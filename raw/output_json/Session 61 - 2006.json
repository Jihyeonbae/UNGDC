        "file_text": "I extend my congratulations on your election, Madam, \nand my respects to His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa \nAl-Khalifa and to the Government and people of the \nKingdom of Bahrain. I assure you of Brunei \nDarussalam\u2019s full support in the coming year and wish \nyou great success during your term of office. \n I would also like to thank your predecessor, \nMr. Jan Eliasson, for his excellent leadership of the \nAssembly over the past year. \n Finally, may I express my special appreciation to \nour Secretary-General. For many years, he has been the \nUnited Nations most public figure. That has never been \neasy, but he has served us with great distinction. His \nprogrammes of action have strengthened our voice. His \npersonal leadership has inspired us, and I thank him \nmost warmly for that. \n During the past few years, we have regularly \ndiscussed United Nations reform, and I am sure that \ndiscussions will continue in the coming years. \nTherefore, at the opening of the sixty-first session of \nthe General Assembly, I would like to take this \nopportunity to mention a few of our own feelings in \nBrunei Darussalam about the question of United \nNations reform. \n I would like to start by acknowledging the fine \nwork done for so many years by our United Nations \nagencies in the field, particularly by the World Health \nOrganization, the United Nations Economic and Social \nCommission for Asia and the Pacific, the United \nNations Children\u2019s Fund, the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme, and the United Nations \nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and \nby United Nations volunteers all over the world. Those \nagencies can truly be called our body\u2019s life blood, and \nat times literally so. Every day of every year, they \nattempt to bring hope, confidence and meaning to the \nlives of ordinary people. They provide people with the \nsimplest and most basic definition of security. By that, \nI mean that they give people a feeling that even the \nmost severe problems can be faced and solved. I thank \nthem with great respect for their dedication and their \nprofessionalism. They represent the United Nations at \nits best. \n Consequently, I believe that any reform of our \nOrganization should be considered with one crucial \nprimary question in mind: Does it directly strengthen \nthe work of our agencies and people in the field? That \nis becoming more and more important to the ordinary \npeople we represent. \n The new century has brought a host of new \nchallenges. The past year, like every year of this new \ncentury, has presented problems that are typical of \nthose the United Nations is increasingly going to face \nand expected to solve. They are, sadly, all the stuff of \nregular breaking news: natural and environmental \ndisasters, health, economic and security disasters, \ncountless political failures and the enormous human \nsuffering that follows. \n The immediate impression is a dramatic one. Our \nnew century seems to be defining itself in images of \ndisaster \u2014 landslides, earthquakes, tsunamis and \nterrorist bombings. The most lasting images are human \nones. Those are the countless victims of events over \nwhich they had no control and of which they had no \nknowledge or warning. The long-term result is a deep \nsense of insecurity. It is reaching into the lives of every \nindividual, every family and every community in every \ncountry we represent. \n Many people are feeling so insecure that they are \nengaged in finding any way they can to salvage some \nhope for themselves. In Asia, Africa and the Americas, \nthey are doing so in their hundreds of thousands. They \nare leaving their families and homelands to emigrate. \nThey often put their lives at enormous personal risk in \nthe search for somewhere where they hope to find \nhope. \n That presents a bleak vision of the future for \nmillions of our people. It would be even bleaker \nwithout the United Nations. Sometimes, in the refugee \ncamps, in the disaster areas and in all the other arenas \n  \n \n06-53323 42 \n \nof destruction, the United Nations offers all they have \nby way of hope. Hence, the second consideration we \ngive to proposals for reform is a human one. We ask a \nsimple question: Is the proposal relevant to ordinary \npeoples\u2019 personal lives and problems?  \n Those lives are increasingly dominated by the \nextremely complex challenges of our new century. \nThose challenges are global. They are scientific, \ntechnological, economic, environmental and political. \nThey now involve over six and a half billion people. \nThose people are becoming more and more dependent \non each other for survival. That means, I believe, that \nwe must continue to stress the need for more than just \nadministrative reform. So our third consideration \nregarding reform is practical. \n Does the proposed reform reflect the current \ncentury, its priorities, its special challenges and its \nchanging character? In other words, are we certain that \nwe are not trying to solve twenty-first-century \nproblems with the mechanisms, priorities and \nprocedures of the twentieth century and sometimes \neven of the nineteenth century? \n We look forward to continuing our discussions \nwith colleagues in the coming year on this critical \nmatter of effective and lasting reform. We are starting \nto see what the twenty-first century is presenting, both \nthe good and the disturbing. We are also seeing the \ndemands it is making on the United Nations. They are \nconsiderable. We believe, however, that the \nconsiderations I have mentioned are the essential basis \nfor reforming the United Nations in a manner that will \nensure that our world body is well capable of meeting \nthe twenty-first century on twenty-first century terms.

        "file_text": "First, I wish to \ncongratulate Ms. Haya Rasheed Al-Khalifa and the \nState of Bahrain on her election as the President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-first session. As an \nAsian, a Muslim and the current Chairman of the \nSummit Conference of the Organization of the Islamic \nConference, I welcome her election with pride and \nsatisfaction. I am confident that she will be able to \nsteer the proceedings of the Assembly with \nconsummate skill and achieve meaningful results. \nNeedless to say, Malaysia will support her in any way \nthat we can. \n Allow me to also pay tribute to her distinguished \npredecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, the Foreign Minister of \nSweden, for the exemplary way in which he guided the \nproceedings of the Assembly\u2019s sixtieth session, during \nsome of the most trying times for the United Nations. \n Speaking of trying times, I would also like to pay \ntribute to Mr. Kofi Annan for his tireless efforts in \nserving humanity, not only during his tenure as the \nSecretary-General but throughout an entire career \ndedicated to the ideals of our Organization. \n I must pay a special tribute to the members of the \nSecretariat and those serving under the United Nations \nbanner, in particular those who have made the ultimate \nsacrifice of their lives, like the four members of the \nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon who were \nkilled last July during the height of the Israeli offensive \nagainst Lebanon. \n Mr. M\u00e9ror\u00e8s (Haiti), Vice-President, took the \nChair. \n We must continually remind ourselves that the \nUnited Nations was brought into being to serve as a \nforum, and, as in Tennyson\u2019s words, to be a parliament \nof man. Six decades later, we have yet to achieve the \nintentions of the United Nations Charter. Indeed, the \nsituation in some corners of the world is bleaker than it \never was before. Yet the human family is still unable to \nfind solutions to its own problems. \n As I review in my mind the events of the past \nyear, I personally feel most disturbed that many of the \nills in the affairs of our world were the result of \nirrational actions caused by prejudice in human \nattitudes. Basically, we have failed to engage in \ndialogue, communicate and reach out to one another as \nfellow humans inhabiting the same planet. Indeed, the \ngreatest discord today exists among the descendants of \nAbraham. These are the People of the Book: the \nfollowers of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, who in \nfact share a common beginning, which was the religion \nof Abraham. \n Of course, dialogue will be endless if it is not \naccompanied by action. The purpose of honest \ndiscussion and engagement is to enable us to formulate \nrational and effective policies. To achieve this, I \nbelieve that all of us need to listen well and be sincere \nin our relations with one another. Much of the dialogue \nthat takes place results in the parties talking at, instead \nof talking to, one another. Any dialogue will certainly \nfail if it is predetermined that certain States are \n\u201crogues\u201d or that certain countries are necessarily \n\u201cevil\u201d. Such name-calling provides an excuse not to \nlisten, let alone engage in serious negotiations to find \namicable solutions to serious problems. \n A blatant example of the refusal to grant even a \nhearing was the early decision by many important \ncountries not to recognize or do business with Hamas \nafter that group was elected to power in Palestine \nthrough a properly conducted democratic election. \nExternal assistance was stopped. Funds were blocked. \nAs a result, millions of Palestinians have suffered for \nmonths without pay or food. I hope that all sanctions \nagainst Palestine will soon be a matter of the past, \nwhen President Abbas succeeds in the task of putting \ntogether a coalition Government embracing all parties \nin Palestine. Surely, to dictate or show preferences as \n  \n \n06-52885 32 \n \nto who should be elected to power in other countries is \nirrational and a sign of double standards. \n The oppression of Palestine, which is being \nallowed to fester; the invasion of Afghanistan; the \nconquest of Iraq; and, most recently, the unrestrained \ndestruction of Lebanon have all been carried out in the \nname of the war against terrorism. The actions of Israel \nin the Middle East are being supported, either openly \nor tacitly, supposedly in defence of the Judeo-Christian \ntradition against the spread of radical militant Islam, \nthus legitimizing all those actions, no matter how \nbrutal. Even Western commentators have conceded that \nIsrael\u2019s latest assault against Lebanon has helped make \nwhat may once have been extremist opinions part of \nthe Muslim mainstream. The Muslim world certainly \nsees all this as complicity to humiliate Muslim \ncountries and Muslim societies. \n I am afraid that the schism between the West and \nthe Muslim world will grow even deeper unless the \ninternational community is prepared to accept certain \nfacts as the truth. The fact is that the sense of \nhumiliation being felt by the Muslim world is the root \ncause for the loss of trust and confidence between the \nMuslim world, on the one side, and Judeo-Christian \ncivilization, on the other. If the international \ncommunity refuses or fails to accept this fact, then I \nam afraid we are denying the truth. \n I believe that much of the prejudice against \nMuslims stems from a lack of understanding of the true \nnature of Islam and what it stands for. For instance, \nthere is a lack of appreciation in the West of the role of \nreligion in the lives of Muslims. Modern Europe has \ngenerally embraced secularism and has largely \nremoved religion from the public domain, placing it in \nthe confines of the home and family. For Muslims, the \nteachings of Islam serve as their guide for doing all \nthings, whether conducting their affairs in the public \ndomain or practicing the religion in their private \nhomes. I suggest that many of the misunderstandings, \nespecially those between the Christian West and the \nMuslim world, arise out of this fundamental \nmisunderstanding of the place of religion in the daily \nlives of Muslims all over the world. When dealing with \nMuslims, one cannot separate them from their religion, \nbecause that is their way of life. \n My country, Malaysia, is a multi-ethnic, multi-\nreligious, multicultural country. However, Islam is \nrespected by all our people as the official religion. The \nGovernment which I now lead has embarked on a \nprogramme to communicate a proper appreciation of \nIslam as a force for good. We call it Islam Hadhari, \nwhich is an approach for achieving a progressive \nsociety that is compatible with modernity yet firmly \nrooted in the noble values and injunctions of Islam. \nThis approach has been accepted by everyone in \nMalaysia because underlying the whole message of \nIslam Hadhari is a call for equitable development and \nprogress. It is a call for moderation and tolerance as \nwell as the assurance of justice and fairness for all, \nirrespective of their faith. \n The point I am making is that Islam the religion \nis not the source of intolerance between people of \ndifferent faiths. In fact, one of the fundamental \nteachings of Islam is the requirement to respect other \nreligions. The Holy Koran contains that commandment \nby God. We must not confuse the perverse words and \nevil deeds of a small number of extremists who operate \non the fringes of Muslim societies as a reflection of \nIslamic culture. The demonization of Islam must be \nstopped and Islamophobia must be removed. The \npolitics of fear must cease to dictate the conduct of \nrelations between peoples and nations. If the politics of \nfear is not stopped, then prejudice and irrationality will \ncontinue to prevail in the affairs of the world, and \ndialogue will continue to fail. \n However, we must persevere, not only to \neliminate political and religious discord among men, \nbut also to eradicate social and economic injustices, \nparticularly poverty and disease. That is an \ninternational responsibility, not only in the name of \nhumanity, but also as a necessary aspect of maintaining \ninternational peace and stability. \n We must therefore do all we can to ensure that the \nimpoverished and marginalized also enjoy the fruits of \neconomic growth, globalization and free trade. It \nwould indeed be unfortunate if we were unable to do \nso, because the world has become more wealthy than \never before. We should learn from history that any \neconomic system in which disparities exist cannot be \nsustained in the long term. All too often, such societies \ncome to a violent end. The civil wars and social unrest \nwe witness today mark a phase that we must stop. \n Malaysia firmly believes that the key to \nprosperity, inclusion and equity is sustained economic \ngrowth based on the building of national capacities, \nparticularly human capital development. While \n \n \n33 06-52885 \n \neducation and skills by themselves are no guarantee of \nsuccess, they are indispensable ingredients for the \ngreater productivity of individual citizens, which in \nturn gives them hope for a better future. \n However, efforts at the national level alone are \nnot sufficient. Those efforts need to be supplemented \nby the establishment of an international economic \norder that would cover areas such as trade, finance, \ndebt, official development assistance (ODA) and \ndevelopment, and that would enable the developing \nworld to overcome its difficulties and contribute to \nglobal prosperity. Some progress has been made, but \nthe overall results have been far from satisfactory. \n Given the economic clout that the developed \ncountries possess, it is essential that they demonstrate \nflexibility and goodwill at this critical juncture in the \nworld trade talks. Malaysia will continue to be \nsupportive of multilateral trade negotiations. \nMalaysia\u2019s approach will, however, never be premised \nsimply on the notion of progressive liberalization. We \nwill continue to take a pragmatic approach by \ncombining liberalization with regulation in a policy \nmix consistent with the country\u2019s economic conditions \nand development needs. \n It is all too clear that our human family must \ncome together and that its members must talk to one \nanother if we are to overcome the problems that \nthreaten to engulf us all. To talk, however, is easy; to \nengage in dialogue and to communicate is more \ndifficult. Indeed, this may be the most difficult of all \nhuman endeavours, given the human temperament with \nall its passions and foibles. It will require courage, \nhumility and an appreciation of the diversities that \nmake us human.  \n We must not be patronizing or condescending in \nour relationships, and we must certainly not be \nthreatening. We must be persuasive and patient in \ndealing with complexities. The pursuit of peace, justice \nand fairness in relations among nations and peoples has \nnever been easy. Let us take up this challenge, with all \nthe fortitude that it requires, and together put into \neffect a better world. "

        "file_text": "As you know, Madam President, there is \none African tradition, but its forms are many. That is \nwhy the African continent is the cradle of mankind and \nthis African tradition universal. We can see this \nuniversal nature here in New York within this forum of \nthe United Nations where the values of solidarity and \nbrotherhood symbolize a common desire for peace and \nlove.  \n How can we not fail today to recall the vitality \nwhich marked the World Summit which was held in \n2005 in this very Hall, following the fifty-ninth \nsession, which was undoubtedly the longest ever due to \nthe intensity of the consultations begun by His \nExcellency Mr. Jean Ping, President at that session, \nwith a view to reaching a consensus on questions \nrelated to reform of our Organization, including that of \nthe Security Council. Those questions divided, and \ncontinue to divide, delegations and regional groups, \nand finally overshadowed the discussion of other \nitems.  \n But the Summit and the ensuing sixtieth session \nnonetheless had the merit of establishing the Human \nRights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission.  \n Despite all the differences among United Nations \nMembers and despite the criticism of some of its \nactions, the United Nations remains the international \norganization which, due to its universality, \nrepresentativity and authority, cannot be ignored. The \nCentral African Republic, which reiterates its \ncommitment to the purposes and principles of the \n \n \n5 06-53341 \n \nCharter, would like to reaffirm its ongoing desire to \ncontinue to contribute to all efforts to reform the entire \nUnited Nations system. \n Having said that, I should like, on behalf of His \nExcellency General Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9, President of the \nRepublic, head of State, and on behalf of the \nGovernment and the people of the Central African \nRepublic, to warmly congratulate you, Madam, on your \nelection as President of the General Assembly at the \npresent session. I view it as a sign of confidence and a \nwell-deserved tribute to your beautiful country, the \nKingdom of Bahrain. I am also pleased to express to \nyour predecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, my high esteem for \nthe remarkable way in which he led the work of the \nsixtieth session. In addition, I express my warm and \nsincere thanks and appreciation to the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, a worthy son of the African \ntradition, for his praiseworthy and tireless efforts, in a \nparticularly difficult international context, to promote \nthe role of the Organization, to attain its objectives and \nto promote peace and security throughout the world. \n The theme suggested for the present session is \n\u201cImplementing a Global Partnership for Development\u201d. \nWe should recall that, six years ago, the highest leaders \nof the Organization\u2019s Member States made the firm \ncommitment to unite their efforts to collectively fight \npoverty and all the scourges it causes, which pose a \nserious threat to international peace and security and a \nmajor obstacle to the development processes in many \ncountries.  \n In the Millennium Declaration, which resulted \nfrom that commitment, the 189 signatory countries \u2014 \nincluding the Central African Republic \u2014 solemnly \npledged to do their utmost to overcome poverty, which \ncontinues to devastate the majority of the world\u2019s \npopulation. To that end, several Goals were defined. \n Ms. Blum (Colombia), Vice-President, took the \nChair. \n As the Secretary-General has stated, the main \nGoals have been implemented to varying degrees:  \n\u201cAccordingly, we will not enjoy development \nwithout security, we will not enjoy security \nwithout development, and we will not enjoy \neither without respect for human rights. Unless \nall these causes are advanced, none will succeed\u201d \n(A/59/2005, para. 17). \n In the case of the Central African Republic, we \nmust acknowledge that many challenges remain to be \naddressed if we are to truly strive to achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) within the \nagreed time frame. Indeed, my country experienced \nmore than two decades of serious crises, from which \nwe only recently emerged by holding general elections \nand establishing republican institutions and the \nGovernment of National Reconciliation. But we must \nstill fight the cross-border insecurity raging in the \nsubregion and push back out of our territory the \naggressors, supported from abroad, who seek to \ndestroy our democratically established republican \ninstitutions.  \n The Central African authorities are striving to \nrestore security throughout the territory. It goes without \nsaying that no development is possible unless we \neradicate the endemic insecurity maintained by those \nwho set up roadblocks and by the rebellion raging \nmainly in the north-eastern part of the country, \nbordering on the Sudan and Chad. The security and \ndefence forces deployed in the back country face many \ndifficulties \u2014 particularly logistical ones \u2014 in \novercoming that phenomenon. The proliferation of \nsmall arms and light weapons in the subregion \u2014 due \nto the long crisis in Darfur and its effects on the \nCentral African Republic \u2014 are hardly helping to put \nan end to that scourge. \n The Central African Republic supports the \nproposals made by Presidents George Bush and \nJacques Chirac and by the Chairperson of the African \nUnion, Mr. Denis Sassou Nguesso, on the positioning \nof United Nations troops on the border between the \nCentral African Republic, Chad and the Sudan.  \n In addition, since 2003, the Central African \nRepublic, one of the seven countries in partnership \nwith the World Bank\u2019s Multi-country Demobilization \nand Reintegration Programme, has taken a new \ncomprehensive, integrated approach that is integrative \nand inclusive aimed at resolving the thorny problem of \nthe disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of \nformer combatants. The results today reflect the \nGovernment\u2019s willingness to succeed in that process. \nMoreover, our country has just developed a new \nstructure to fight the proliferation of small arms and \nlight weapons, namely, a national commission against \nthe illicit proliferation of small arms and light weapons \nand for disarmament. \n  \n \n06-53341 6 \n \n The deteriorated state of the Central African \neconomy is hardly likely to encourage the \nimplementation of the Development Goals in order to \npromote a robust fight against poverty, which for us \nremains an ongoing threat to peace and stability.  \n In the area of finance, the Government has taken \nenergetic measures to restore financial health by \nimplementing an extensive system to monitor civil \nservants and establishing a body to verify their \nacademic credentials.  \n The other challenges \u2014 just as great \u2014 facing \nthe Central African Republic are those of health care \nand education, which are among the main MDGs. With \nrespect to health care, the HIV/AIDS pandemic and \nother diseases, such as tuberculosis and malaria, are \nsources of concern for our country.  \n The recent conference on AIDS, held here at \nUnited Nations Headquarters in early June 2006, \nhighlighted the particularly disturbing characteristics \nof that calamity among the most impoverished sectors \nof the population: women and children. There is a \nhealth emergency, and thus the Central African \nRepublic is requesting greater assistance and action \nfrom its development partners. \n The education and training sector \u2014 covered by \nGoal 2 of the MDGs \u2014 has undoubtedly been the main \nvictim of the long period of political and military \ncrises, whose wounds are gradually healing. The many \nempty years of discouragement resulting from the loss \nof motivation on the part of the teaching staff, delayed \nsalary payments, the lack of State resources to build \nschools and purchase equipment, and the continued \ninsecurity in some areas of the country for the past \nseveral years \u2014 all of that has led to a decline in the \nquality of teaching and a drop in the literacy rate. \n However, since the burst of patriotism of \n15 March 2003, the Government has been doing its \nutmost to ensure that the school year will no longer be \ninterrupted and to restore the former credibility of the \nCentral African educational system. Thanks to the \nassistance of certain donors \u2014 among which we must \nmention the International Organization of la \nFrancophonie \u2014 the Central African Republic is \nbeginning to take up the challenge between now and \n2015. Indeed, it will not be possible to ensure that \ndemocracy and a culture of dialogue and tolerance are \nfirmly established unless the people have access to \nquality education and are able to grasp what is truly at \nstake, and thus make sound judgements in full \nknowledge of the facts. \n The United Nations Millennium Development \nGoals Report 2005 highlights the need to ensure a \nsustainable environment by intelligently exploiting \nnatural resources and protecting the ecosystems upon \nwhich the survival of humanity depends. Climate \nchange and global warming owing to the depletion of \nthe ozone layer are worrisome phenomena for our \ncountry, whose northern region is being increasingly \novertaken by desert. The initiatives set out in the Kyoto \nProtocol show that progress is possible if there is \npolitical will on the part of the major consumers.  \n If we are to prevent and reduce the risks related \nto natural disasters and to equip ourselves with better \norganization and more effective means to make the \nworld safer, we must support the transformation of the \nUnited Nations Environmental Programme into a \nspecialized agency with a broader mandate, as \nproposed by France. \n Despite delays in the achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), the Central \nAfrican Republic is determined to reach them, \nespecially Goals 3 and 4, relating to the empowerment \nof women and the promotion of gender equality and to \nthe reduction of under-five mortality. Indeed, \nconsiderable progress has been made in terms of \nvaccination coverage and also with respect to the free \ndistribution of mosquito nets to pregnant women and to \nchildren under the age of 5.  \n The Central African Republic greatly appreciates \nthe proposals made during the 2005 World Summit by \nPresidents Chirac, Lula Da Silva and Hu Jintao \nregarding the promotion of peace, security and \ndevelopment.  \n However, the results of MDG implementation \nwill remain mixed until international solidarity fully \nplays its part. We live in an interdependent world; the \ndevelopment of the Central African Republic is closely \nlinked to that of the rest of the world, because the \nUnited Nations is a community of nations.  \n May God bless the United Nations. May God \nbless the Central African Republic.  "

        "file_text": "I extend my \ndelegation\u2019s sincerest congratulations to the President \non her very well-deserved election. I would like to \ncongratulate her predecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, on his \nstewardship of the historic sixtieth session of the \n \n \n9 06-53341 \n \nAssembly and to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-\nGeneral for his dedicated service to the Organization \nover the past decade. It is also my pleasure to welcome \nMontenegro as the newest Member of our \nOrganization.  \n The Assembly is meeting against a backdrop of \ndire human tragedy. The recent wanton Israeli \naggression in Lebanon has shocked the world. Most \ndisconcerting has been the fact that the international \ncommunity failed to respond promptly and effectively, \nas colossal devastation wrecked Lebanon and the \nLebanese people. In the end, the Security Council \nredeemed itself by ordering a ceasefire in Lebanon. Let \nus hope that the Security Council will exercise its \nmandated responsibilities so that such atrocities and \nviolations of human rights do not occur in the future \nunder any pretext. \n Alongside Lebanon, the dire situation in Palestine \nhas worsened owing to the continuous use of \ndisproportionate force by the Israeli Government. We \ncall upon the international community to make sincere \nefforts to put the peace process back on track. \n The scourge of terrorism knows no boundaries. It \nis professed and carried out by a handful, and the vast \nmajority of victims are innocent men, women and \nchildren. Efforts to combat terrorism and its \nprotagonists globally and nationally may have seen \nsome positive results. However, action to combat terror \nby individual countries has created divisions between \npeoples and affected interfaith harmony. Many \nindividuals are being subjected to racial or religious \nprofiling, which foments suspicion, misunderstanding \nand even hatred. That is what the terrorists are actually \nlooking for: to divide the nations of the world. We \nmust ensure that they do not have their way. \n Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia has \nunequivocally declared that Bangladesh abjures \nreligious extremism and does not and will not support \nany kind of militancy. The Prime Minister has \nreasserted her Government\u2019s vow to eliminate all \nmilitants and their networks. She has called for the \npassage of tough laws to punish the perpetrators, whom \nshe has repeatedly dubbed enemies of Islam, enemies \nof democracy, development, humanity and the people \nof the country \u2014 our country, beloved Bangladesh. \n In this connection, I must mention that a small \ngroup of extremists carried out a country-wide \nbombing attack on 17 August last year in Bangladesh. \nBut the extremists underestimated the will of the \nGovernment and the people of Bangladesh. Instead of \nfear, there was anger. The Government mobilized all \navailable resources to relentlessly hunt down the \nleaders and the operatives. I am proud to inform the \nAssembly that we have been able to bring all the \nleaders of the outlawed militant group to justice. \n Bangladesh today is what it has always been: a \nmoderate, tolerant society that practises democracy and \nwhere the equal rights of each and every citizen are \npreserved. Our determined action did not allow the \nopportunists and the perpetrators of terror to destroy \nthe values of democracy and tolerance that we treasure \nmost. \n For smaller States, the United Nations remains \nthe premier world body, addressing the challenges they \nface. Despite its shortcomings, the United Nations has \nproved invaluable in times of crisis and in the tasks of \npreserving global peace and security and promoting \nsustainable development. \n At present, we are seized of the issue of reform of \nthe United Nations. Bangladesh holds that reform is a \nprocess and not an end in itself. We do not think that \narbitrary deadlines or pressure in order to obtain a \nparticular outcome are helpful. It is our belief that, for \nmeaningful reform, an environment of mutual trust, \nconfidence and respect for divergent positions is \nindispensable. \n We trust that the new Human Rights Council will \nnot be a mere replication of the Commission on Human \nRights. It must not indulge in politicization of its work. \nBangladesh, as an elected member, is committed to \nadvancing the work of the Council in a fair and \nbalanced manner. \n We hope, too, that the newly constituted \nPeacebuilding Commission will fill the existing \ninstitutional gap in the United Nations system to \nfacilitate the transition from peacekeeping to \npeacebuilding. Bangladesh, being one of the largest \ncontributors to United Nations peacekeeping \noperations, will bring its experience to the work of the \nCommission in all its aspects. \n As the United Nations deals with individual post-\nconflict situations, it must not lose sight of wider \nissues, such as disarmament and small-arms \nproliferation, as well as weapons of mass destruction. \n  \n \n06-53341 10 \n \nBangladesh would like to see sustained efforts by the \nUnited Nations in these very critical areas. \n The Outcome Document of the 2005 World \nSummit (resolution 60/1), which had development as \nits centrepiece, has hardly progressed beyond mere \npledges. For the least developed countries (LDCs), the \nsavings-investment gap and lack of capital remain the \nprimary constraints to development. Official \ndevelopment assistance (ODA) to the LDCs in 2004, \naccording to the most recent data available, amounted \nto $23.8 billion, or $35.70 per person living in these \ncountries. This is certainly not sufficient to \ncomplement income or boost investment. Faster growth \nin exports, and the consequent rise in income, could \nhelp the LDCs accumulate the resources needed for \ndevelopment. For this, we would need unhindered \nmarket access for all LDC exports. The Doha \ndevelopment round must resume to ensure special and \ndifferential treatment for the LDCs. We would also \nneed increased ODA, full debt cancellation, foreign \ndirect investment and transfer of technology to enhance \nthe global partnership for development. \n We can also increase capital flows to LDCs by \naddressing one of the fundamental inequities in the \nglobal financial system. It is utterly inefficient and \nunfair that the LDCs cannot utilize their own foreign \nexchange reserves \u2014 a staggering $28 billion \u2014 to \nfinance their own development efforts and that these \nreserves yield very low interest, or none at all. On the \nother hand, when LDCs borrow against their own \nreserves, they pay a huge premium in interest or \nservice charges. The United Nations system must lead \nthe international effort to reform the global reserve \nsystem and to make arrangements that enable the LDCs \nto borrow at a zero mark-up of the interest rate against \ntheir own foreign exchange reserves. \n The General Assembly has just concluded the \nmidterm comprehensive review of the implementation \nof the Brussels Programme of Action for the LDCs. In \nthis context, I would like to point out that, unless duty-\nfree and quota-free market access for all LDC products \nis ensured, the agreed development goals and targets \nwill remain unattained for a long time to come. We call \non the developed countries to fulfil their pledges of \nsupport for the framework to facilitate aid for trade, to \nwhich they have committed many times over. An \neffective monitoring capacity under the auspices of the \nUnited Nations can significantly facilitate this task. \n Let me now turn to two issues that are of \nparticular concern to Bangladesh. I begin with \nmigration. Liberalizing the movement of labour can \ngenerate significant benefits and a win-win result for \nboth sending and receiving countries, as well as for the \nmigrants themselves. Numerous studies have found \nthat a modest commitment under the World Trade \nOrganization\u2019s General Agreement on Trade in \nServices Mode 4 would offer substantial welfare gains \nfor both developing and developed countries. It may \neven exceed the gain of complete market liberalization \nin merchandise trade. \n The second issue is the threat of natural disasters, \nwhich often undermine our development efforts. The \nAsian tsunami was a wake-up call for all of us. In these \ntimes of increasing global interdependence, disaster \nrisk management is a matter of global concern, as the \nimpact of a disaster in one region adversely affects \nothers. Bangladesh has advanced considerably in the \nfield of comprehensive disaster management. We stand \nready to share our experience, which has been \ninternationally recognized as the best-practice model. \nThe United Nations must gear its efforts to introduce \nweather insurance and weather derivatives to manage \nthe risks of natural disasters, especially in developing \ncountries. \n Within weeks of her assumption to power five \nyears ago with a massive mandate from our people, the \nGovernment of Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia \nlaunched a reform programme to restore discipline in \nour country. Thanks to our relentless efforts, we could \naccelerate the growth momentum remarkably without \ndestabilizing our macroeconomic fundamentals. \n After maintaining a growth rate of 6 per cent for \nthe past five years, we expect a growth rate of 6.7 per \ncent this fiscal year, against the backdrop of a global \neconomic slowdown. Given natural disasters, political \nunrest and many external shocks \u2014 such as the global \neconomic recession, the phasing out of the Multifibre \nArrangement and the oil price hike \u2014 that affect our \neconomies, that is a remarkable achievement. \n Keeping our commitment to the Millennium \nDeclaration, we have already achieved two Millennium \nDevelopment Goals by ensuring access to safe drinking \nwater and removing gender disparity in primary and \nsecondary education. Enrolment in primary education \nhas been ensured for 97 per cent of our children. Of \ncourse, there is no complacency on our part and we \n \n \n11 06-53341 \n \nknow that we should try to achieve 100 per cent \nenrolment in our primary schools. \n Apart from those achievements, Bangladesh has \nachieved remarkable success in the reduction of child \nand maternal mortality and malnutrition and in \nimproving food security. We have begun channelling \nresources to targeted programmes in the light of our \nPoverty Reduction Strategy Paper. Our development \nefforts, however sincere, will not reach their goals or \neven see the light of day unless they are complemented \nby international support. \n Bangladesh has been pursuing meaningful \nregional cooperation to improve the socio-economic \nconditions of South and South-East Asia. As the \ncurrent Chair of the South Asian Association for \nRegional Cooperation and as members of the Bay of \nBengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and \nEconomic Cooperation, the Asia Cooperation Dialogue \nand the Developing Eight Countries, Bangladesh has \ndemonstrated its commitment to working with other \ncountries of the region. We are working in total \nharmony with the nations of our region. Our recent \npartnership in the Regional Forum of the Association \nof Southeast Asian Nations bears testimony to our \ncommitment. \n The present Government will complete its tenure \ntowards the end of next month and will hand over \npower to a neutral caretaker Government in accordance \nwith the provisions of the Constitution. We very much \nhope to return to work again with the General \nAssembly. We have had peaceful transfers of power \nover the past three elections under neutral caretaker \nGovernments when the voters exercised their franchise \nfreely and without fear or intimidation. The system has \nworked and has been accepted by the people. \nDemocracy has taken firm root in our country and the \nnext general election will be one more opportunity for \nthe people to demonstrate that they are the ultimate \nsource of power. \n I end with the assurance that we will work \ntogether for a better tomorrow for future generations.

        "file_text": "Antigua and \nBarbuda joins other Members of the United Nations in \ncongratulating Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her \nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-first session. Madam President, we wish you \nsuccess in all your efforts and assure you of our full \ncooperation. I wish also to thank and congratulate your \npredecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, for his outstanding \nleadership of the sixtieth regular session of the General \nAssembly. \n Permit me also to convey the appreciation of the \nGovernment of Antigua and Barbuda to Mr. Kofi \nAnnan for his many years of service to the United \nNations and for his overall dedication to the pursuit of \nworld peace and development. Every year brings new \nand unique challenges which add to the burdens of the \noffice of the Secretary-General, and this past year has \nbeen no exception. In bidding Mr. Annan farewell, on \nbehalf of the Government and people of Antigua and \nBarbuda, I pay tribute to his indomitable courage over \nthe past 10 years and say to him that success is never \nfinal and failure is never fatal; it is courage that counts, \nand he has risen to the challenge when it counted most. \n Among the many accomplishments achieved in \nthe twentieth century was the establishment of the \nUnited Nations. Among the accomplishments of the \nUnited Nations in its 60 years of existence is its \nadvocacy of decolonization by peaceful means; its \nadvancement of the concept of sovereignty as a natural \nright of all nations and all peoples; and the awareness \nit has brought to the international community that, in \nthis era of globalization, the majority of humanity is \nafflicted not by inter-State wars but by the ravages of \npoverty, hunger, disease, environmental degradation \nand human rights violations. \n We are aware of the awesome task of \nimplementing reform measures for this Organization. \nWe are, however, encouraged by the significant \nachievements made since the adoption of the Outcome \nDocument of the 2005 World Summit. We are pleased \nthat some progress has been made in areas such as the \nestablishment of the Human Rights Council, the \nCentral Emergency Response Fund, the launching of \n  \n \n06-53952 10 \n \nthe Peacebuilding Commission and agreement on a \ncounter-terrorism strategy. \n Respectfully, Antigua and Barbuda joins this \ncommunity of nations in underscoring the importance \nof social and economic development, basic human \nrights and their importance to the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security, mutual respect, and \nlasting goodwill among nations. \n Slavery is today perhaps the most under-\nrecognized crime against humanity, in spite of its \nconsequences: the vicious displacement and brutal \ntreatment of an entire race. Next year \u2014 2007 \u2014 \nmarks the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the \ntrans-Atlantic triangular slave trade. The 14 members \nof the Caribbean Community, whose people are \nprincipally of African slave descent, are committed to \nbringing this anniversary to the attention of the world, \nand we look forward to members\u2019 unanimous support \nin the General Assembly for our forthcoming \nresolution and to their joining us in the appropriate \nrecognition of this event, which foreshadowed the \nabolition of slavery. \n In a few weeks, on 1 November, Antigua and \nBarbuda will celebrate 25 years of political \nindependence. As we take stock of our challenges and \nexperiences in nation-building and our actions in \nattempting to achieve and maintain a decent standard \nof living for our people, our progress report is one of \nmixed successes and failures punctuated with hope and \nfrustration.  \n The reality is that we are a politically \nindependent small island nation with limited resources, \nexisting in an economically interdependent yet fiercely \ncompetitive world. \n Our challenges are many. But, having emerged \nfrom a past dominated by colonialism, we are indeed \nproud of our history as an independent democratic \nState where people of whatever race, creed or political \naffiliation are free to express and exercise all basic and \nfundamental human rights, which are inherent features \nof the United Nations legal framework. However, for a \npolitically independent nation like ours to survive in \nthis economically interdependent world, that requires \neffective multilateralism and the forging of real \ninternational partnerships. In other words, our future \ndepends on our ability to work well with each other in \na spirit of understanding and respect, given our diverse \ncultures, histories and economies. \n Antigua and Barbuda is acutely aware of the \nimportance of partnerships and of the necessity of \nworking within a multilateral framework to meet the \nchallenges we face as a young developing nation. That \nbrings me to the importance of the United Nations in \nits role as a melting pot of ideas for constructive and \npositive action.  \n The United Nations development agenda is an \nambitious, noble, worthy and necessary one. Were we \nto accomplish the goals we have set within the \nspecified time frames, it would be a testament to the \ngreatness of humankind. My Government and my \npeople therefore support any process of reform of the \nUnited Nations that will enhance the level of \nrepresentation in all its principal organs, increase its \neffectiveness and improve its legitimacy. It should be \nmore democratic in its representation, more reflective \nof modern-day geopolitical realities and more timely \nand effective in delivering on the outcomes of its many \ninternational conferences, summits and agreements, \nincluding, of course, the Millennium Declaration. \n We wholeheartedly agree with those who believe \nthat multilateralism should not be subverted and that \nthe United Nations framework for the peaceful \nresolution of international conflicts should not be \nundermined or replaced by unilateralist tendencies.  \n Additionally, in our efforts to revamp and \nrevitalize the various development bodies of the United \nNations, we should pay particular attention to the \nvulnerability of States. When the entire gross domestic \nproduct of a country can be wiped out by a single \ncommonplace natural disaster, that country\u2019s economy \nis most definitely vulnerable. When the economic \nmainstay of a country can be cut off by activities and \nevents that occur in another country many, many miles \naway, that country is indeed vulnerable. When a \ncountry\u2019s economic activity can be effectively stymied \nby the failure or refusal of another country to abide by \ninternational rules, accepted norms and arbitral \ndeterminations, that country\u2019s economic prospects are \ncertainly vulnerable. For small island States like ours, \nsuch vulnerability is our greatest insecurity. \n Over the years, Antigua and Barbuda has joined \nthe rest of the world in mourning immeasurable losses \nfrom natural disasters, be they monsoon flooding, sub-\nSaharan drought or Asian tsunamis. Our Caribbean \nsubregion is particularly susceptible to the annual \nravages of a hurricane season that lasts from June \u2014 \n \n \n11 06-53952 \n \nwhich the popular ditty says is \u201ctoo soon\u201d \u2014 to \nOctober, when it just may be \u201call over\u201d. My country\u2019s \nGovernment feels that a review of existing \ninternational disaster relief funds and an increase in the \namount of financial resources made available are \nnecessary for the elimination of the sad state of the \neconomic vulnerability of so many of our nations. \n With regard to international peace and security, \nthe Government of Antigua and Barbuda does not \nbelieve that war benefits any country \u2014 not the \nwarrior, not the vanquished and not the passive \nonlooker. As leaders of nations, therefore, international \npeace is the greatest gift we can give to our peoples \nand to our children. Hence, a world where friendly \ndiplomatic relations and dispute-solving discussions \nbetween countries are promoted is a world in which \nour children and grandchildren will inherit a legacy \nworth cherishing.  \n Our present-day values and our hopes for a better \ntomorrow have been reason enough for my country\u2019s \ncompliance with a significant number of United \nNations-mandated anti-terrorism treaties. Terrorism \nbreeds insecurity and exacts a severe financial burden, \neven on countries and communities far removed from \nthe actual terrorist act. We join others in encouraging \nthe Members of the United Nations to continue to deal \ncomprehensively with the threat of terrorism by all \nmeans necessary, including the promotion of, and \nrespect for, religious, cultural and ethnic tolerance.  \n We must of necessity be more responsible when \nwe speak as influential world leaders. With the growth \nand development of technology, all of the world is a \nstage in a manner that William Shakespeare never \nforesaw. It therefore behoves us all to constantly and \ncontinuously mind our exits and our entrances and the \nmany parts that we play on the global stage. \n Today we join a list of countries that have time \nand again in these hallowed halls repeated the clarion \ncall for greater action by the international community \nto realize the laudable objectives and full intentions of \nthe United Nations Charter in the areas of meaningful \ndevelopment financing and the concept of fair trade. \nSecretary-General Kofi Annan was correct politically \nwhen he said a few days ago from this very rostrum \nthat \u201cthe \u2018global partnership for development\u2019 is still \nmore a phrase than fact \u2014 especially in the all-\nimportant area of trade\u201d ().  \n Too often we have taken corrective steps at home \non the domestic level to create, in the jargon of the \nUnited Nations, an enabling environment. Yet we see \nlittle or no real or tangible results, because developed \ncountries do not deliver on their commitments but \ncontinue, in spite of their rhetoric, to support or \ncontinue systematic imbalances in the international \ntrading system. \n Antigua and Barbuda, in spite of its limited \nresources and its highly vulnerable economy, has \nembarked upon a strategy of economic diversification \nguided by the rules and regulations of the World Trade \nOrganization. Yet, unfortunately, even as we play by \nthose rules, the unfair trading practices of some of our \ninternational partners threaten to diminish the modest \neconomic gains that we have made in recent times. We \nneed to ask ourselves, are we really serious about \nraising standards in the developing world? Are we \nreally serious about sustainable development? \n Rest assured that in spite of the continuing \nrhetoric, we in Antigua and Barbuda will continue our \nefforts to achieve a high standard of living and \nimproved economic and social well-being for our \n80,000 people. We will continue to partner with our \nsister countries within the Organisation of Eastern \nCaribbean States and Caribbean Community \nsubregional groupings. We will continue our advocacy \nfor good environmental stewardship and the \nadvancement of the fundamentals of sustainable \ndevelopment at home, in our region and beyond. In \naddition, we will continue to insist on nationally owned \ndevelopment strategies as we seek deeper North-South \nand South-South cooperation for more meaningful, \ntangible and lasting economic development.

        "file_text": "It \ngives me great pleasure to join in the warm \ncongratulations to Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa \nupon her assumption of the office of President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-first session. We are \nconfident that her extensive professional and life \nexperience will be instrumental in addressing the issues \nfaced by the General Assembly. \n Tajikistan also welcomes the accession of \nMontenegro to the United Nations. On this occasion, \non behalf of the Government of our country, I would \nlike to extend our sincere congratulations to the \nGovernment and people of that friendly State. \n A year has passed since the historic Summit \nconfirmed the common views of the international \ncommunity on the key issues of our time and on the \nUnited Nations as the universal international \nOrganization whose goals and objectives are focused \non the collective search for answers to the questions of \nconcern to the entire international community. The \nleaders of our States declared that only strict \ncompliance with the United Nations Charter, a \ncomprehensive collective approach and mutual trust \ncan ensure international security and development. The \nlatest developments in the Middle East have proved \nonce again the need to enhance the coordinating role of \nthe United Nations in addressing global and regional \nissues. \n Tajikistan is in favour of further strengthening the \nUnited Nations and lends its overall support to the \nprocess of its ongoing reform. As for Security Council \nreform, it should be undertaken by consensus, with due \nconsideration for the interests of all Member States. \n We believe that it was broad consensus that made \npossible such major accomplishments as the holding of \nthe first session of the Human Rights Council, the \nlaunching of the Democracy Fund and the \nestablishment of the Central Emergency Response \nFund. Of special importance was the establishment of \nthe Peacebuilding Commission, whose objective is also \nto sustain peace and development in post-conflict \ncountries.  \n The Government of Tajikistan was among those \nthat actively advocated the establishment of an \nefficient United Nations body of that kind \u2014 one that \nwould focus on issues of coordination and targeted \nsupport for countries emerging from armed conflict. \nTajikistan\u2019s painful but ultimately successful transition \nfrom civil war to peace convincingly demonstrated the \nneed for an international peacebuilding agency to assist \nthe Security Council and other United Nations bodies \n  \n \n06-53341 12 \n \nin their efforts to accelerate the rehabilitation of \ncountries emerging from crisis and to create guarantees \nfor the non-recurrence of such conflicts. \n Stable peace prevails in Tajikistan today, and \nnational accord and respect for political pluralism have \nbeen achieved. The complex process of establishing \ndemocracy is under way, and all political forces \ninvolved are aware of their ever-increasing \nresponsibility for the fate of our country. In compliance \nwith the Constitution and valid legal procedures, new \neffective Government institutions are being \nsuccessfully built. Respect for the law is increasingly \nthe rule rather than the exception. Civil society is \ndeveloping at an accelerated pace. Citizens determine \ntheir own destiny through active participation in the \nlife of the State. The forthcoming presidential \nelections, scheduled for November 2006, will be an \nimportant milestone on the road towards peace and will \nopen a new page in the history of the establishment of \nTajik statehood. \n In Tajikistan, as in the majority of United Nations \nMember States, the issue of sustainable development \nranks among our top priorities. Today, we are fully \naware of how instrumental the United Nations agenda \nhas been in enhancing sustainable development and \neradicating poverty, epidemics, famine and illiteracy \nthe world over. At the same time, the implementation \nof a large-scale programme to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals will require not only extra effort, \nbut also considerable financing. In that regard, we \nexpect tangible results from the work of the \nCommission on Sustainable Development and the \nHigh-level Dialogue on Financing for Development. \n In that connection, we highly value the outcome \nof the United Nations High-level Dialogue recently \nheld in New York, which helped States concerned with \nissues of migration to reach constructive mutual \nunderstanding. Migration has been an issue of vital \nimportance to our country since the outbreak of the \ncivil war, when a part of the Tajik population had to \nleave the country. I would like to emphasize the special \nrole and capacity of the United Nations in \nstrengthening international cooperation in the field of \nmigration and development. In this regard, Tajikistan is \nresolved to achieve as much progress as possible in \nimplementing the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs). In recent years, tangible progress has been \nachieved in the implementation of a number of goals, \nand the foundation has been laid for enhancing efforts \nin this area. \n But long-term stability in Central Asia in the \nyears to come is inseparable from the development of \nregional integration.  \n Currently, vast opportunities are emerging in the \nCentral Asian region for the implementation of large-\nscale economic projects, the creation of a unified \nmarket of commodities and services and the \nestablishment of conditions for attracting capital \ninvestment. Potential foreign investors see Central Asia \nas a single entity; and, primarily, as a common market. \n Economic integration will become a powerful \nfactor in the sustainable development of the region and \nwill bring about the reduction of poverty and the \nimprovement of well-being. For this reason, Tajikistan \nwill continue to stand for strengthening of ties and the \nexpansion of mutually advantageous cooperation \namong the States of the region. \n The current positive processes in Afghanistan \nalso create favourable conditions for regional \ncooperation in implementing transportation and \ncommunication projects which will provide the region \nwith access to the southern seaports. The creation of \nnew multi-modal transport corridors and the revival of \nthe Great Silk Road routes will form a unified \ninterconnected system of communications and make it \npossible for Central Asian States to gain access to \npromising markets. \n It is also obvious that in many respects the \nattainment of the MDGs depends on assistance \nrendered by the international community to developing \ncountries. Tajikistan joins the request addressed to the \ndonor community to at least double the amount of \nassistance provided for the purposes of long-term \ndevelopment. The process of exchanging the debts of \ndeveloping countries for national projects in the field \nof sustainable development remains an urgent issue. \n One of our planet\u2019s major assets is the fresh water \nindispensable for sustaining life. Our common goal in \nthis respect is to develop qualitatively new patterns for \nthe sustainable management of water resources and for \naddressing water-related economic issues at the \nnational, regional and international levels. This can be \nachieved through a combination of appropriate support \nfrom the international community and national efforts, \n \n \n13 06-53341 \n \nwith the leading role being played by countries and \nregions faced with the water-resource problems. \n In this regard, Tajikistan hopes for the continued \nactive involvement of the Member States in the \nactivities of the International Decade for Action, \n\u201cWater for Life\u201d, 2005-2015, including the successful \nholding of the International Freshwater Forum in \nDushanbe in 2010. In order to coordinate activities in \nthis area the Government of Tajikistan is establishing \nthe National Water Committee. It will monitor progress \nand develop effective ways of attaining the goals of the \nwater Decade at the national, regional and global levels \nthrough cooperation with the countries and \ninternational organizations concerned. Our efforts in \nthe area of water are part and parcel of the strategic \nprogramme for the attainment of the MDGs. \n It is well known that international terrorism, \ntransnational organized crime and illegal drug \ntrafficking obstruct sustainable development. Tajikistan \nbelieves that the United Nations and its Security \nCouncil provide a unique opportunity for the \ndevelopment and implementation of joint measures to \nconfront international terrorism and the narcotics \nthreat. We entirely support the report of the Secretary-\nGeneral entitled \u201cUniting against terrorism: \nrecommendations for a global counter-terrorism \nstrategy\u201d, and we view the outlined principles for \nconfronting new challenges and risks as major \ninstruments for counteracting those threats. \n The response of the international community to \nthe complex strategic threat of terrorism must also be \ncomprehensive. The community of nations must \nintensify its efforts to counteract the instigation of acts \nof terror, the spread of terrorism ideology, extremism \nand separatism, religious and ethnic intolerance and \nhostility, and the financing of terrorism. \n Universalizing and improving an international \nlegal framework to counter terrorism remains an urgent \nissue. The speedy approval of the draft comprehensive \nconvention on international terrorism will serve the \ninterests of all countries and peoples in the United \nNations community. Tajikistan will continue to support \nthe strengthening of the United Nations as the core \ninstitution in this area. \n The global system for counteracting terrorism \ncurrently being shaped cannot be established without \nthe involvement of regional and subregional \norganizations. This should be taken into account when \nadopting measures aimed at combating any \nmanifestations of extremism and violence at the \nregional and global levels. We regard participation of \nregional structures in this process as one of the major \nprerequisites for ensuring collective security. Among \nthe structures of this nature in our region are the \nCommonwealth of Independent States, the Collective \nSecurity Treaty Organization and the Shanghai \nCooperation Organization. \n We believe that long-term success in combating \nterrorism and religious extremism depends on the \nelimination of the deep-rooted causes of these negative \nphenomena, generated by social and economic \nproblems in the society. Prevention of illegal drug \ntrafficking, which, to a certain extent, serves as a \nbreeding ground for terrorism and international crime, \nmust become part and parcel of our common struggle \nagainst terrorism. In this regard I would like to \nreiterate that Tajikistan is prepared to continue a \nconstructive dialogue and cooperation with the aim of \nestablishing an efficient global partnership to \ncounteract the narcotics threat. \n It must be said that current efforts at \ncounteracting the narcotics threat are not sufficiently \neffective. For this reason, we believe that financial and \ntechnical assistance to Afghanistan, to be rendered \nwithin targeted programmes, and the creation of a \nmodern, efficient and capable Afghan border service to \nsafeguard the external borders, including the Afghan-\nTajik border, would be a worthy application of the \nefforts of the international community in this area. \nAlso, within the anti-narcotics partnership, we suggest \nenhanced interaction with the Afghan structures with \nthe purpose of adopting joint measures to prevent drug \ntrafficking across the Afghan-Tajik border. We are \nconvinced that these measures could serve as a basis \nfor the proposed establishment of the first section of \nthe security belt around Afghanistan. Involvement in \nthe constructive process of Afghanistan\u2019s neighbours \nand factoring in the regional aspects of the post-\nconflict rehabilitation of that country may well be key \nto the success of the efforts undertaken by the \ninternational community. \n Today, the regional dimension becomes one of \nthe key factors of long-term development. Broad and \nconstructive regional economic cooperation in Central \nAsia, which possesses considerable natural resources, \nis of particular importance at the present juncture. We \nbelieve that achieving that goal could enable Central \n  \n \n06-53341 14 \n \nAsia to become self-sufficient in terms of energy, fuel \nand food supply and a dynamic, developing region of \nthe world. Therefore, we believe that the achievement \nof the MDGs should hold a place in the new structure \nof global security currently being shaped, and become \none of the tools for addressing new challenges and \nthreats. Today, as never before, it is becoming \nincreasingly obvious that a security policy needs to be \nintegrated into development. \n The scale of the challenges facing the \ninternational community dictates the need to further \nstrengthen our Organization. There is no doubt that we \nmust do everything we can to make the United Nations \nmore effective in dealing with issues of international \nsecurity. The collective approach should keep us from \nmaking hasty and emotional decisions, since we are \ndealing with the Organization responsible for \ncollective security, sustainable development and \nprotection of human rights. It is with the United \nNations, despite some of its imperfections, that \nhumanity places its hope for a peaceful and just world \norder, for tangible achievements in the fields of \ncombating poverty and natural disasters. A responsible \nattitude towards the United Nations is in the interests \nof each and every Member State. "

Allow me to begin by conveying my \nmost heartfelt and sincere congratulations to you, \nMadam, on your election as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-first session. Solomon Islands is \nconfident that, as a result of your leadership, guidance \nand service to the world, our work to achieve global \npeace, progress and prosperity will bear fruit. My \ndelegation assures you of our cooperation and support \nduring your term in office. \n Solomon Islands would also like to take this \nopportunity to applaud and pay tribute to your \npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson, Foreign \nMinister of Sweden, who, with truly admirable skill, \nled us in achieving many reform initiatives following \nlast year's World Summit, in particular the \nestablishment of the Peacebuilding Commission and \nthe Human Rights Council, the launch of the Global \nCounter-Terrorism Strategy, the adoption of the \ndevelopment resolution, management reform, \nSecretariat mandate review and the Declaration on \nHIV/AIDS. \n It would be remiss of me not to thank our \nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, for \nhis distinguished service to this premier institution. He \nhas been a constant catalyst for change and has \ndistinguished himself by combining leadership with \nvision, initiative, patience, respect, persistence and \nfaith in this institution. Solomon Islands continues to \nrender him and the Secretariat staff our support. We \nwish the Secretary-General well in his future \nendeavours and sincerely thank him for his service. \n Solomon Islands would also like to join others in \nwarmly welcoming the newest Member, the Republic \nof Montenegro, which was admitted into the United \nNations family in June this year. We wish the new \nnation every success and look forward to working with \nit for the common good of the globe. \n Democracy remains the bedrock of the Solomon \nIslands political system. My Government came to \npower four months ago, following the country\u2019s \nseventh national election since its attainment of \npolitical independence 28 years earlier. We were \nfortunate in having the Electoral Assistance Division of \n  \n \n06-53323 2 \n \nthe United Nations Department of Political Affairs \nmonitor and coordinate the international observers who \noversaw this election. Despite the positive verdict of \nthe international observers, a minor hiccup occurred \nduring the second part of the election and led to three \ndays of rioting. Solomon Islands looks at that incident \nas a wake-up call, urging that more be done for the \ndevelopment of its growing population. I am pleased to \nsay that the incident is now behind us, stability has \nbeen restored and a Commission of Inquiry has been \nset up to look into the matter. \n Solomon Islands would like to thank all those \nthat participated in the election observer programme \nincluding the Commonwealth, the Pacific Islands \nForum, Australia, New Zealand and the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP). My Government \nhas gone ahead and put in place some integrity \nlegislation that will strengthen the development of the \nparty system in Solomon Islands and bring about \nneeded political stability. \n Like many young democracies, Solomon Islands \nis being challenged and tested. Governance is \nexpensive and needs support in order to be nurtured \nand to flourish. Political ideology should belong to all, \nnot only to those that can afford it. \n The Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon \nIslands, led by Australia and supported by New \nZealand and all the Pacific Islands Forum countries, \nhas just completed its third year. My Government has \nrenewed the Regional Assistance Mission\u2019s term for \nanother twelve months, given the Mission\u2019s success in \ntransforming the country from a fragile to a stable \nState. Solomon Islands is undertaking a comprehensive \nreview of the Mission in an effort to strengthen the \nexisting partnership, with the objective of broadening \nthe scope and role of the Mission so that it can take a \nmore development-oriented approach. \n The theme of this session, \u201cImplementing a \nGlobal Partnership for Development\u201d, demands a \nrenewed commitment to existing partnerships between \ndeveloped and developing countries and presents an \nopportunity to reorder and close the North-South \ndivide through a strengthened multilateral system.  \n Just last week, more than one quarter of the most \nvulnerable Members of the United Nations, the least \ndeveloped countries, met here in this Assembly to \nreview the Brussels Programme of Action. These \ncountries have special needs and require special \nattention. While we welcome the declaration issued by \nthe High-level Meeting on the midterm comprehensive \nglobal review of the implementation of the Brussels \nProgramme of Action, it is not the declaration that \nimplements the Brussels Programme of Action, rather \nit is our action in honouring our international \nobligations and commitments. \n Solomon Islands is a country of small \ncommunities, scattered across nine hundred islands. \nSustainable development for Solomon Islands can be \nachieved only through a global partnership in which \ndevelopment is directed at rural communities. The \napproach must have a sense of urgency and the \ncommon purpose of enabling the rural population to \nexploit their resources thanks to the transfer of \nappropriate technologies and thus to realize their \neconomic aspirations. \n The shape and future of international relations \ndepends on how we manage change. According to \nCharles Darwin, it is not the strongest of the species \nthat survives, nor the most intelligent, but rather the \none most responsive to change.  \n I am pleased to note that this year the United \nNations is looking at expanding its presence in the \nPacific region. Such an approach strengthens United \nNations relations with its Members. In that regard, \nSolomon Islands looks forward to the proposed \nupgrading of the UNDP sub-office in Honiara to the \ncountry level. \n Solomon Islands notes that the first part of the \n2005 World Summit Outcome Document features rural \nand agricultural development. My delegation is \nheartened by a proposed joint UNDP/United Nations \nCapital Development Fund project for the \nstrengthening of the Solomon Islands provincial \ngovernment system and for investing in provincial \ninfrastructure and communications. The project has the \nmerit of strengthening all democratic principles and \nbringing the State closer to its people. My Government \nstands ready to assist such a worthwhile project in any \nway it can. Solomon Islands calls on all partners to \ncontribute to it and to better the lives of a people \nwhose needs have been neglected for so long. \n Solomon Islands follows developments in the \nMiddle East with concern, in particular in Iraq, \nLebanon and Palestine. It is sad to see parents burying \nsons in a conflict that claims the lives of more children \nthan soldiers. Solomon Islands associates itself with \n \n \n3 06-53323 \n \nthe observation of the Under-Secretary-General for \nHumanitarian Affairs, Jan Egeland, that something is \ntruly wrong. Under such difficult circumstances, we \nmust find the strength to trust one another and work \ntirelessly to find a permanent, sustainable and lasting \nsolution to the crisis. The world looks to this \nOrganization for a solution, and we must not fail it. \nThat can only be done if we are prepared to take a \nholistic approach in seeking a permanent solution to \nthe Middle East question, by embracing all parties in \nthe region and working in the spirit of the United \nNations Charter and through dialogue and consultation. \n On Security Council reform, in the words of our \nSecretary-General, \u201cno reform of the United Nations \nwill be complete without the reform of the Security \nCouncil\u201d (A/61/1, para. 161). The time is ripe to \nbalance ongoing reforms with Security Council reform. \nThe Council\u2019s failure to act \u2014 for various political \nreasons \u2014 to contain certain conflicts calls into \nquestion its effectiveness, given its responsibility for \nthe maintenance of international peace and security. \nThe most vulnerable Members of the Organization do \nnot have the luxury of waiting, because conflicts and \npotential conflicts may take root. More than 5 billion \ndollars has already been spent on United Nations \npeacekeeping missions \u2014 money that would be better \nspent on development. \n Only by enlarging the Council and arming it with \nimproved working methods can we make it truly \nrepresentative and accountable to the wider \nmembership of this Organization. Solomon Islands \nwould like to see countries such as Japan and Germany \nas permanent members, together with emerging Powers \nsuch as India and Brazil. \n On the question of the representation of Taiwan, \nthe continuous refusal by this Organization over the \npast 13 years to discuss the representation of the 23 \nmillion people of Taiwan at the United Nations is a \nmatter of serious concern. This creates an institutional \ngap in an Organization where we are all supposed to \nstand equal. My delegation wishes to register its \ndisappointment at the fact that its right even to discuss \nthe issue was denied last week. Solomon Islands feels \nthat the purposes and principles of the United Nations \nCharter continue to be violated in this respect. The \ntime has come for this institution to act according to \nthe rules that guide the behaviour and conduct of \nMembers and to have an honest debate on the issue. \nSolomon Islands renews its call on the United Nations \nto recognize the right of the 23 million people of \nTaiwan to be represented at the United Nations. \nSolomon Islands is also concerned about security \nthreats on the Taiwan Strait. My delegation calls on all \nMember States to distinguish our collective interests to \npreserve peace from narrow interests that threaten \npeace. Solomon Islands further calls on the United \nNations, the body responsible for the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security, to mediate and engage \nwith the People\u2019s Republic of China, Taiwan and other \nstakeholders in finding a permanent solution to this \nissue. \n This year we will be electing a new Secretary-\nGeneral. Solomon Islands, a member of the Asian \nGroup, would like to see a Secretary-General who has \nan interest in our subregion. For the last 28 years, since \nSolomon Islands joined this noble institution, no \nSecretary-General has ever visited my part of the \nworld. We would like to see our future Secretary-\nGeneral engage more closely with Member States on \nthe other side of the globe. \n On the subject of terrorism, Solomon Islands \nonce again reiterates its condemnation of all forms of \nterrorism, in whatever form and manifestation, \nwherever and whenever it may occur. Recent attacks in \nIndia and in various parts of the world underscore the \nfact that terrorism remains a threat to all. Solomon \nIslands looks forward to an early conclusion of the \ncomprehensive terrorism convention and is pleased that \ntalks between the United Nations Counter-Terrorism \nCommittee and Member States, including those in the \nPacific region, have begun. It is our hope that the \nconsultations will address the gaps in national \nmechanisms and, where possible, have a regional \napproach to the issues. I am pleased to report that, with \nthe assistance of New Zealand, Solomon Islands \nexpects to fulfil some of its counter- terrorism \nreporting obligations during the course of 2007. \n Mr. Chidyausiku (Zimbabwe), Vice-President, \ntook the Chair. \n At last year\u2019s World Summit, 170 of our Heads of \nState and Government agreed to ensure the fuller \nparticipation of developing countries, in particular the \nleast developed countries, in the global system. The \nlack of agreement at the Doha Round continues to hurt \nsmall island open-market economies, such as that of \nSolomon Islands. We hope that enough political will \ncan be garnered to confront existing differences and \n  \n \n06-53323 4 \n \nensure that a universal, rules-based, open, \nnon-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading \nsystem is established. \n Solomon Islands continues to benefit from North-\nSouth cooperation to sustain its growth. We must also \ncontinue to work on enhancing South-South \ncooperation. I am pleased to note that developing \ncountries, such as Papua New Guinea, have provided \nneeded assistance in education and security. My \nGovernment is paying closer attention to renewable \nsources of energy with the help of India, Taiwan and \nIndonesia. It is our hope that, with the cooperation of \nall our partners, appropriate technologies will be \ntransferred, so that communities can have access to \nmodern and affordable energy. In this connection, the \nGlobal Environment Fund and the United Nations \nEnvironment Programme could look at facilitating such \ninitiatives. Solomon Islands would like to thank India, \nTaiwan, Indonesia, China and the United Nations \nDepartment for Economic and Social Affairs for \nenabling experts from the Pacific Islands to meet and \nwork on such programmes. \n A number of developmental opportunities have \nemerged since the 2005 World Summit meeting. \nAmong other things, a HIV/AIDS declaration has been \nadopted. Solomon Islands would like to see the Global \nFund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria provide a \ncomplete package for the Pacific region, ranging from \nawareness to treatment. It is cheaper to invest in a \nproblem that is small than to treat a full-blown \npandemic. Solomon Islands would like the Global \nFund to reconsider the Pacific regional project \nsubmitted during the sixtieth session. \n Solomon Islands notes with regret that the recent \nfive-year review conference of the 2001 Programme of \nAction to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit \nTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All its \nAspects did not agree on a final document. Solomon \nIslands continues to believe that the root cause of the \nemerging gun culture is development-related. At some \nstage, such conferences should focus more on \naddressing poverty issues within vulnerable countries, \nwhere gun culture is likely to emerge, in a global effort \nto address the issue once and for all. \n On the issue of international migration, which \nwas taken up at last week\u2019s High-level Meeting, \nSolomon Islands, together with its regional neighbours, \ncontinues to seek opportunities to manage short-term \nlabour migration within its subregion and globally. \nWhile nothing concrete has emerged, the regional \ndiscussion has allowed us to better understand the \nreceiving States\u2019 position and, hopefully, will allow us \nto work towards striking an agreed balance. Solomon \nIslands feels that the pull factor from the South to the \nNorth is natural and serves as a win-win factor for the \nSouth that provides needed labour for the North\u2019s \ngrowing economies, while at the same time benefiting \nthe South financially. \n The United Nations offers opportunities for \nMember States to become responsible global citizens. \nSolomon Islands would like to see mission recruitment \nprocedures at country level. We are also seriously \nlooking at participating in selected United Nations \ncivilian police missions. \n Finally, a reformed and strengthened United \nNations represents our best hope for a better future. \nSolomon Islands reiterates its commitment to work \nwithin the framework of international cooperation to \naddress today\u2019s economic, social, cultural and \nhumanitarian challenges.

        "file_text": "Madam, \nyour election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-first session is the sign of a \nfavourable turn of events in the world. I congratulate \nyou and I welcome you not only as an experienced \ndiplomat, with established skills and qualifications, but \nalso as a great advocate of human rights. I wish also to \ncommend, through you, your country, the State of \nBahrain, for its tremendous contribution to the \npromotion of the values of peace, freedom and \nequality. \n I should like also to express our deepest gratitude \nto Mr. Jan Eliasson for the wisdom and competence \nwith which he guided the previous session. He \ndeserves plaudits for having led to a successful \noutcome the difficult negotiations on the establishment \nof the Human Rights Council and of the Peacebuilding \nCommission. I would also like to congratulate a great \nson of Africa, a friend and brother, Mr. Kofi Annan, for \nhis work as Secretary-General. His outstanding work \nwas recognized at the seventh session of the \nConference of the African Union held last July at \nBanjul and was given a moving and memorable tribute \nthat I would like to reiterate here. Mr. Secretary-\nGeneral, the world is grateful to you; Africa is proud of \nyou. Furthermore, I would like to welcome \nMontenegro as a Member State, whose admission \nreinforces the universal character of our Organization. \nWe wish that country a warm welcome. \n This session opens at a time when the overall \nsituation in the world is becoming more and more \ncomplex with reasons for concern and reasons for \nhope. It is our responsibility to ensure through \nmultilateralism that hope overcomes fear and that the \nworld becomes safer for future generations. We must \nreaffirm our faith in multilateralism, because the many \nchallenges of our time must be confronted collectively; \nno State can deal with them alone. The same is true for \nthe environment, terrorism, drug trafficking etc. Since \nits creation, the United Nations has never slackened in \nthe search for ways and means to assume its \nresponsibilities. \n But today more than ever, it is necessary to \nencourage the search for collective solutions for the \nmany sorts of phenomena that weaken global peace. \nToday more than ever, we must join our energies to \nbuild a world in which human beings can live where \n  \n \n06-52737 2 \n \nthey wish in dignity, safe from need and fear. That is \nthe purpose of our joint activities. \n In order to eradicate armed violence, we must \nwork for peace through the prevention and settlement \nof conflicts. The situation in the Middle East continues \nto be a serious threat to international peace and \nsecurity. It is urgent that a just, lasting and \ncomprehensive solution be found to this conflict that is \nravaging this region. We need a solution based on the \nagreed proposals, such as the Road Map and the \nrelevant resolutions of our Organization. The role of \nthe Quartet in this respect is crucial. The cessation of \nhostilities, after one month of pointless violence in \nLebanon, must be consolidated in order to achieve a \nlasting ceasefire. \n As for Africa, positive advances have been made \nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo with the \nholding of general elections. Every effort must be \nmade to ensure the successful conclusion of the \nelectoral process, namely the second round of the \npresidential elections. The fact that we are now \nspeaking of peacebuilding in Burundi, Liberia and \nSierra Leone is not only a reason for satisfaction but \nalso a reason for hope for other countries still in a state \nof conflict. At the same time, in many other situations, \nsuch as those in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, the Sudan or in \nSomalia, the search for the way to solve those conflicts \nis still on the agenda. We wish to develop a natural \npartnership between our regional organization, the \nAfrican Union, and the United Nations in managing \nthese crises in accordance with the provisions of \nChapter VII of the Charter. This is the case in C\u00f4te \nd\u2019Ivoire with the creation of an international working \ngroup. \n By deciding to hold the meeting of its Peace and \nSecurity Council on Darfur here in New York City, the \nAfrican Union has reiterated its willingness to consider \nall constructive proposals regarding this conflict. The \nAfrican Union\u2019s unflagging efforts to ensure peace in \nDarfur has never been in question. The seriousness of \nthe situation in this region of the Sudan calls for more \nenergetic and more effective action. We solemnly call \non the Government of the Sudan to make a full \nassessment of the tragedy that is taking place before \nour eyes. \n In the case of Somalia, we appeal to the \ninternational community to provide its support to \nefforts to re-establish peace and reconciliation in \nSomalia. The international community must not lose \npatience faced with the meagre results in the search for \npeace in several of the African conflicts. The \ninternational community must provide strong support \nfor the efforts undertaken at many levels with, of \ncourse, the agreement of the countries concerned. As \nthe current chair of the African Union, we promise to \nwork fully to promote peace and security on the \ncontinent. \n I do not wish to end my statement on this subject \nwithout recognizing the courage of peacekeepers \nthroughout the world, especially in Africa. Our \ngratitude also goes out to the civil society and \nhumanitarian organizations that work courageously and \nwith dedication to relieve the suffering of people. \n One of the major challenges that I mentioned \nearlier is that of development. The international \ncommunity dealt especially with this question during \nthe Millennium Summit by establishing the \nMillennium Development Goals to be achieved before \n2015. The assessment that we conducted last year \nrevealed serious weaknesses. It was clearly apparent \nthat resources were lacking and that it was essential to \nlook for new sources of financing. \n Also, we must give due credit to the initial \nresponses to the appeal launched here a few months \nago during the High-Level meeting held on eradicating \nHIV/AIDS, within the framework of our commitment \nto achieve universal access to HIV/AIDS prevention, \ntreatment and care by 2010. \n We welcome the International Drug Purchase \nFacility (UNITAID) initiative launched by the French \nGovernment to mobilize resources derived from the \ntaxation of airplane tickets. Congo, among other \ncountries, has joined this initiative. This effort is in \nline with the Abuja Declaration and Framework for \nAction for the Fight Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis \nand Other Related Infectious Diseases. It is also in line \nwith the Brazzaville Commitment, which presents the \ncommon African position. The African Union summit \nalso declared a state of emergency in Africa with \nregard to those diseases. \n In discussing the issue of migration and \ndevelopment a few days ago in this Hall, the United \nNations took a look at an area of involvement that has \nnot been sufficiently studied, specifically that of \nindividuals and other entities \u2014 business and \n \n \n3 06-52737 \n \neconomic institutions \u2014 in bringing people together \nand sharing the common goods of our planet. \n The African Union, meeting in Banjul, took this \nopportunity to declare a common position that \nemphasized the positive nature of the role that should \nbe played by migration if it is correctly integrated into \nan approach to profitable development for the \nreceiving countries, as it is for the countries of origin \nof the migrants. \n Our Organization has launched a vast reform \nprogramme, of which some results are already tangible. \nA few moments ago, I talked about the establishment \nof the Human Rights Council, as well as the \nPeacebuilding Commission. Organizational reform \nseeks to adapt our Organization to changes that have \noccurred throughout the world over the past 60 years.  \n The African Union has made the reform of the \nSecurity Council and the reinvigoration of the General \nAssembly a major issue of concern. We must improve \nthe representative nature of the Security Council, \nwhich is the true lynchpin of the entire institutional \narchitecture of the United Nations. \n The African proposal for an equitable \nenlargement of the membership of the Council \nconstitutes a fundamental pursuit, which cannot be \nreplaced by simple palliative measures. We also \nbelieve that the Security Council must improve its \nprocedures and its working methods to lay the basis for \nconsensual work. On subjects as serious as counter-\nterrorism or nuclear non-proliferation, seeking a \nconsensus must continually be pursued through \ncooperation and dialogue. Between those who give \npriority to compliance with the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and those who, \nrightly or wrongly, call for effective, concomitant \ndisarmament and the recognition of a universal right of \naccess to technologies in all areas, there is no doubt \nmuch to be discussed, but this must be done in good \nfaith. \n We must refrain from radicalizing our attitudes \nby turning the discussion into a conflict of values or \ncivilizations, because, most often, the problem is really \nonly due to a lack of dialogue and communication. \n All these problems and challenges prove, if even \nthere was a need to do so, the importance of the United \nNations. The United Nations is necessary because it is \nthe instrument of international relations; it is the \nenzyme that can give us global peace and security; it \nis, really, the conscience of mankind. The world would \nnot be what it is, without the United Nations. \n Still, our Organization has not succeeded, in spite \nof this confident affirmation of its role, in changing \nwith times to fulfil the deepest aspirations of nations \nand peoples. We know that the United Nations can \nachieve that goal if the nations that created it, nations \nthroughout the world, from the most powerful to the \nmost humble, were to give to the United Nations, \nwithout hindrance or hypocrisy, the means that it needs \nto serve humanity. \n Africa, I can assure you, is prepared to do its part \nin this highly anticipated debate.

        "file_text": "Before proceeding \nwith my remarks, I wish to indicate that Cyprus, as a \nmember of the European Union, is represented by the \nUnion and fully subscribes to the statement delivered \nthis morning by the President of Finland on behalf of \nthe European Union. I should also like to express my \nsincere congratulations to Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa \non her election as President of this session of the \nGeneral Assembly, and my gratitude to Mr. Jan \nEliasson, President during the sixtieth session, for his \ntireless efforts during a historic year for the United \nNations. I also wish to thank the Secretary-General for \nhis comprehensive report on the work of the \nOrganization (A/61/1), highlighting the problems, the \nconcerns and the achievements of the United Nations \nand providing guidance on the way forward. I would \nlike moreover to warmly welcome the Republic of \nMontenegro as the 192nd Member of the United \nNations. \n During the session that followed the 2005 World \nSummit, implementation of the Summit Outcome \nDocument (resolution 60/1), and the reform process \nmore generally, absorbed an important part of the work \nof the Organization. The establishment of the \nPeacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights \nCouncil, alongside other important achievements, \nconstitutes an important building block towards a \nconsolidated international system based on effective \nmultilateralism. We should, however, not lose sight of \nthe fact that the legitimacy and the relevance of the \nreform achieved will be judged by its impact on the \nlives of our peoples. In that respect, let me underline \nthat as a country whose priority lies with upholding the \nintegrity of international law and full respect for \nhuman rights, we have a strong interest in seeing a \nHuman Rights Council that fulfils its mandate and \nleads to human rights improvements on the ground. \n There are also aspects of reform that continue to \nelude us, such as Security Council reform and a \ncomprehensive convention against terrorism; aspects \nthat remain in progress, such as management reform, \nmandate review and system-wide coherence; and \nchallenges that are increasingly more difficult to \ntackle, such as disarmament and non-proliferation. \n  \n \n06-52737 18 \n \n In that regard, I would like to commend the \nPresident of the General Assembly for choosing the \nachievement of the development goals as the theme of \nher presidency in recognition of their enduring \nimportance. My Government believes that concerted, \ninnovative multilateral action to eradicate the scourges \nderiving from poverty and underdevelopment can yield \nsubstantial results. In that connection, Cyprus has \njoined France, Brazil, Chile, Norway, the United \nKingdom and other countries in deciding to introduce a \nspecial levy on air tickets, the proceeds of which will \nfund improved access to medication in developing \ncountries. \n Regrettably, the urgent need to achieve a \ncomprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East \nmanifested itself in a very dramatic manner once again \nthis summer. For almost four weeks, the international \ncommunity witnessed a violent crisis in Lebanon that \ncaused indescribable suffering, devastation and a \ndeplorably high number of casualties among civilians. \nWe offer our sympathy and concern to the \nGovernments of Lebanon and Israel and to the families \nof all those affected. \n Firmly convinced that there is no military \nsolution to such crises, Cyprus, from the very first \nmoment of the outbreak of violence, supported the \ncalls for an immediate ceasefire and joined in the effort \nto provide assistance both to the Lebanese people and \nto the evacuees. Unfortunately, it took almost a month \nfor the Security Council to discharge its \nresponsibilities effectively towards the peoples of the \nregion, causing disappointment and frustration. In our \nsearch for United Nations-centred, effective \nmultilateralism, the lessons learned from that crisis \nshould be a strong guiding force. We hope that the \nexpanded United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, to \nwhose deployment, operations and support Cyprus has \nundertaken to contribute, will be effective in \npreventing future eruptions of violence. \n In parallel to the Lebanese crisis, the world \ncontinues to witness the deterioration of the situation \nin the occupied Palestinian territories, with a heavy \ncivilian toll and worsening humanitarian conditions. A \nyear after the positive prospects created by Israeli \ndisengagement from Gaza, the current crises serve as a \nreminder of the urgent need for a new strategy that \nwould lead to a comprehensive and lasting settlement \nof all facets of the Middle East question on the basis of \nrelevant United Nations resolutions. In that respect, it \nis imperative to urgently revert to the implementation \nof international agreements, including the road map, \nproviding for the creation of a viable Palestinian State \nthat will peacefully coexist side by side with Israel \nwithin agreed borders. \n Let me now turn to the Cyprus problem \u2014 a \nproblem of the invasion and continuing occupation by \nTurkish military forces of 37 per cent of the territory of \nmy country for more than 32 years now. Mistaken by \nsome for a protracted conflict, the Cyprus problem \nessentially epitomizes the inability of the international \ncommunity to redress this set of massive violations of \ninternational legality. The status quo remains \nunchanged and the humanitarian and human rights \nconsequences of the forcible division of the island and \nits people persist. The efforts to establish a separate \npolitical and legal entity within the occupied area of \nCyprus by the occupying Power remain undiminished. \nOnly with respect to investigating the fate of persons \nmissing since the invasion and establishing the \ncircumstances of their disappearance have we recently \nwitnessed some encouraging developments. \n In the political field, we have continued to exert \nefforts on two key axes, coming closer to a negotiating \nprocess that would guarantee a peaceful settlement, \nalleviate the consequences of the invasion and bring \nabout the reunification of Cyprus, its territory, people, \nsociety, economy and institutions in a bizonal, \nbicommunal federation. \n The political agenda of projecting a separate \npolitical entity in Cyprus has been pursued in recent \nyears under the pretext of a campaign to lift the so-\ncalled isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community. \nHowever, with the annual per capita income in the \noccupied areas of Cyprus currently standing at \napproximately $11,000, it is evident that the argument \nfor economic development is being exploited for \npolitical reasons and is a manifestly unsubstantiated \nallegation. A recent example of that pattern of \nbehaviour is the refusal of the Turkish side to consider \nour proposal to increase trading activity by reopening \nthe port of Famagusta for exports to other States \nmembers of the European Union, in cooperation with \nthe European Commission, following the return of the \nnow fenced-off and derelict city of Famagusta to its \nlawful inhabitants under the control of the Cyprus \nGovernment. \n \n \n19 06-52737 \n \n The Greek Cypriots remain committed to \nreunification through a functional bizonal, bicommunal \nfederation. The failure of the most recent initiative did \nnot alter our commitment or our willingness to work \nresolutely towards the reunification of our country. The \nproposed plan was not accepted precisely because it \ndid not provide for the reunification of our divided \ncountry or address core issues and key concerns in a \nsatisfactory manner. The search for a settlement firmly \nremains for us in the United Nations framework, within \nthe context of the good offices mission mandated to the \nSecretary-General by the Security Council. \n I would now like to turn briefly to developments \nof a political nature that have taken place over the past \nfew months and to our attempts during that time to \ncreate the right conditions for the resumption of \nmeaningful negotiations in the framework of the good \noffices mission of the Secretary-General for a viable \nsettlement of the Cyprus problem. To that end, I wish \nto emphasize our concurrence with the opinion of the \nSecretary-General that good and careful preparation of \nany negotiating process is necessary before full-\nfledged negotiations can take place. It was thus agreed \nthat bicommunal discussions at the technical level \nwould commence to address substantive aspects of the \nCyprus problem, as well as issues that affect the \neveryday life of all Cypriots as long as the status quo \npersists \u2014 a process that could be complemented by \nparallel confidence-building. This expert-level process \nis a sine qua non for the preparation of issues and their \npresentation to the leaders of the two communities for \nthe purpose of meaningful negotiation. The method of \ninitiating these technical discussions was agreed to by \nthe two communities during the recent visit to Cyprus \nof Under-Secretary-General Gambari. Here, I wish to \nexpress my sincere gratitude and appreciation for the \ngood offices of Mr. Gambari, as well as for the \ncontinuing efforts of the Secretary-General\u2019s Special \nRepresentative, Mr. Michael M\u00f8ller. \n Addressing these core issues \u2014 which must be \nsettled satisfactorily if there is to be a feasible \nsolution \u2014 should facilitate the attainment of the \nbroader objectives of a settlement, which should be \nbased on international law, the relevant United Nations \nresolutions, the high-level agreements, the European \nUnion acquis and the relevant decisions of the \nEuropean Court of Human Rights. That entails \nestablishing a bicommunal and bizonal federal State of \nCyprus with a single sovereignty and international \npersonality and with a single citizenship. It must also \nguarantee the independence and territorial integrity of \nCyprus, without any foreign troops on its soil and \nwithout the possibility of foreign intervention. A \nsettlement must aim, through a rational approach and a \ncommon vision of the future, to preserve and uphold \nthe character of the State as a working democracy and \nto ensure the reunification of society and the \nconvergence of allegiances to common institutions. \nEthnic origin, political equality as defined in the \nrelevant United Nations resolutions, and cultural and \nreligious diversity should be safeguarded, but not at the \nexpense of the fundamental rights of citizens and the \nfunctionality and efficiency of State institutions. \n We had hoped that by now, Turkey\u2019s course of \naccession to the European Union would have had a \ncatalytic effect, producing the necessary political will \non the part of Turkey and changing its perception of \nCyprus from that of an adversary to that of a partner, a \nvaluable neighbour and a potential ally in the European \nUnion. Such a change in attitude would render \ncompletely anachronistic those considerations that \nhave led the country to maintain its occupation army in \nCyprus and that fuel its confrontational approach. \n We continue to expect Turkey to at least proceed \nwith the implementation of its legally binding \nobligations vis-\u00e0-vis the European Union. This is a \nunique opportunity for Turkey to prove its willingness \nto turn the page by meeting obligations that it \nundertook years ago. Unfortunately, it has so far \npersistently refused to comply with them. Instead, our \ngenerous attitude towards Turkey\u2019s accession to the \nEuropean Union has met with a blockade against my \ncountry in its bid to join several international and \nregional organizations and with Turkey\u2019s refusal to \nopen its ports and airports to Cypriot vessels, as \nrequired. \n We still believe that in our relations with Turkey, \nthere is only one way forward: creating a future of \npeace and cooperation, building bridges and mutual \nunderstanding, normalizing our relations and working \nhand in hand to achieve the goals of the European \nUnion in our region. That would also enable us to \naddress all outstanding issues to the benefit of all \u2014 \nespecially the Turkish Cypriot community, which \nwould have major opportunities to thrive and flourish \nif Turkey were to accept and acknowledge that it has \nno vested interests in Cyprus and must therefore \nrelinquish all forms of interference in my country\u2019s \n  \n \n06-52737 20 \n \naffairs. Once again, I invite Turkey to recognize that \nthere is no room for military doctrines with regard to \nCyprus and to join us in seeking a lasting solution for \nthe benefit of all Cypriots \u2014 Greek and Turkish \nCypriots alike \u2014 of Turkey and of our entire region.

        "file_text": "Twenty-one \nyears ago, on a day like today, a terrible earthquake \nbattered my country. We remember the victims, and we \nexpress our ongoing solidarity with their family \nmembers. \n Madam President, on behalf of Mexico, let me \ncongratulate you on your election to the presidency of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-first session. We wish \nyou every success. \n The Mexican people thank Mr. Jan Eliasson for \nhis leadership during the Assembly\u2019s sixtieth session \n  \n \n06-52737 4 \n \nand for his contribution to the United Nations reform \nprocess. \n Mexico warmly welcomes the people of \nMontenegro to this Organization of free and juridically \nequal nations. We welcome all nations that today have \njoined the free and democratic nations, through \ngenuine representation of their peoples, and are united \nin the struggle against terrorism and in favour of \nhuman rights. \n A few days ago, we commemorated the fifth \nanniversary of a terrorist act that plunged many \nfamilies of this and other countries into mourning. We \noffer our sympathy to those who have suffered the \nviolence and cruelty of terrorism. Mexico strongly \ncondemns that terrible evil, as it condemns all acts of \naggression or violence. We repudiate any action that \nundermines peace or conflicts with the noble principles \nand purposes of our Organization. \n Throughout the past six decades, the peoples of \nthe United Nations have seen that the use of force does \nnot solve problems; on the contrary, it often aggravates \nthem. Peace and development are the fruit of mutual \nrespect and the cooperation to which such respect gives \nrise. \n The peoples of the United Nations are well aware \nthat the deterioration of peace and security is the result \nof insufficient international dialogue and cooperation. \nWe know, too, that many of the setbacks \u2014 such as \nthose in the field of disarmament and those that take \nthe form of aggression against other people or the \nenvironment \u2014 are caused by a lack of respect among \nnations. \n These are very challenging times. Our peoples \ntoday face such situations as the persistence of long-\nstanding international conflicts or the emergence of \nnew tensions and threats to international peace. They \nalso must tackle problems ranging from poverty, \ndisease and illiteracy to inequality of opportunity and \nthe urgent need for more inclusive dialogue aimed at \nincreasing mutual understanding. \n Humanity is desperately seeking respect, \nunderstanding, and cooperation among nations. There \nwill be no peace without respect among nations, no \ndevelopment without cooperation among them. \n These are challenging times, but also times of \nhope. I believe that hope and goodness alone can give \nus the necessary strength and drive to achieve our goals \nand fulfil our dreams. \n This house, the foremost of the international \nforums established by mankind, is built upon the \nprinciples and values shared by all peoples, the product \nof their common essence. Here, we summon up what is \nbest in us. Here, we show that what unites us is not \nforce and animosity, but hope and solidarity. Here, we \nare united by our ideals and our will to preserve future \ngenerations from the scourge of war. Here, we work \ntogether to foster the dignity and worth of the human \nperson, and, shoulder to shoulder, we promote the \neconomic and social progress of all of our peoples. \nHere, we make firm commitments, such as the \nMillennium Development Goals, and we work \nenthusiastically in order to go forward and achieve \nthose goals. This is no small task. There are many \nchallenges, because the goals are ambitious. The \nmagnitude of the challenges cannot and should not \novershadow the scope of our common will. \n Mexico\u2019s message is one of hope and of faith in \nwhat we are capable of achieving together. It is a \nmessage of confidence in the work done by our United \nNations. This is the message of Mexico, whose people \nconquered democracy in 2000 and in so doing inspired \nhope for a new future of prosperity and justice. \n Mexico is a country with well-established \ninstitutions which guide and lead our nation. It is \ncurrently experiencing unprecedented freedoms. My \npeople live and work in peace, enjoy stability and have \ntheir eyes set on new horizons of well-being and \njustice. \n The democratic Mexico is firmly committed to \nprotecting human rights. We are very proud to be a \nfounding member of the Human Rights Council and to \noccupy its first presidency. We will continue working \nwith enthusiasm and determination in order to make \nthe Council an organ that responds effectively to the \nchallenges posed by human rights. \n Mexico is a country that cherishes its roots and \ntraditions and treasures its heritage as a land of many \nand diverse cultures. We prize the legacy of our \nindigenous peoples and are proud of our indigenous \npresent. We are actively engaged in the recognition and \npromotion of the rights of indigenous peoples at the \ninternational level. \n \n \n5 06-52737 \n \n In May, a Rar\u00e1muri woman from the state of \nChihuahua named Isabel said to me, \u201cMr. President, it \nis certainly true that all human beings are different \nfrom one another, that we see the world through \ndifferent lenses and that we do not all share the same \nbeliefs. Nevertheless, all human beings are equal in \ndignity and stature\u201d. She asked me to pass on that \nmessage. I promised her that I would do so, and today I \nam keeping my word by bringing Isabel\u2019s voice and \nthose of our other indigenous sisters and brothers to \nthis forum. Isabel\u2019s voice is the voice of all Mexican \nwomen and men who are fighting discrimination. \n Thanks to the commitment of the members of the \nHuman Rights Council, the General Assembly will \nhave before it for consideration a draft United Nations \nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. On \nbehalf of the indigenous peoples of Mexico and of the \nrest of the world, I call upon each and every State \nMember of this Organization to adopt that draft \nDeclaration and to endow it with the means necessary \nfor it to promote respect for the rights of indigenous \npeoples. \n Five years ago, in a spirit of great enthusiasm and \nin the quest for a more just and human-centred world \nfor millions of people with disabilities, my country, \nMexico, presented the General Assembly with a \nproposal for a draft United Nations convention on the \nprotection and promotion of the rights and dignity of \npersons with disabilities. We now have a draft text that \nwill prompt Governments and society to pay more \nattention to people with disabilities. I urge all nations \nto sign and ratify that legal instrument \u2014 proposed by \nmy country and already endorsed by many of the \nnations represented here \u2014 with a view to creating a \nworld of greater justice, humanity and dignity for all. \n Mexico believes in the United Nations \u2014 in its \npresent and in its future. We have always worked here \nin a constructive manner, promoting consensus and \nharmony and putting forward initiatives to address the \ngreatest challenges of our times. \n I would like to thank and pay tribute to the heads \nof State of Algeria, Australia, Canada, Colombia, \nChile, Germany, Japan, Kenya, the Netherlands, New \nZealand, Pakistan, Singapore, Spain and Sweden for \ntheir support for the Mexican initiative to establish the \nGroup of Friends for United Nations Reform. Together, \nwe presented proposals that were taken up in the \nSecretary-General\u2019s report of March 2005 (A/59/2005). \n I am certain that our commitment to reform of the \nUnited Nations will result in a stronger Organization \nthat is capable of accomplishing the lofty objectives for \nwhich it was created. Mexico is convinced of the need \nto promote a reform of the Security Council that can \nguarantee the Council\u2019s representativeness, efficacy \nand transparency, as well as ensure accountability. That \nobjective will not be reached by creating new \npermanent seats. \n We are an Organization based on the principle of \nthe juridical equality of States. The reform of the \nSecurity Council should ensure more frequent \nparticipation by all Member States in the activities of \nthat body. That is why Mexico proposes an increase in \nthe number of non-permanent seats, with the \npossibility of immediate re-election. \n As this is the last time that I will speaking in the \nAssembly in my capacity as President of Mexico, I \nwould like to express my gratitude to all Member \nStates for their support for all of our efforts and \ninitiatives over the past six years. \n I would like to express my deep appreciation to \nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, a good friend of \nMexico. He will be remembered for his efforts to \nreform and strengthen this Organization and for his \npassion for peace and harmony among nations. \n I would like to reaffirm my country\u2019s \nunconditional commitment to the objectives of the San \nFrancisco Charter, to the reform process currently \nunder way and to our common quest for a world free \nfrom poverty, fear and despair \u2014 a world of mutual \nrespect, peace and harmony. \n From this rostrum I appeal, on behalf of Mexico, \nfor respect and peace among nations. In particular, I \ncall on the United Nations to continue to promote an \neffective peace process in the Middle East. \n There is no greater enemy or obstacle than \nhopelessness, unkindness and lack of solidarity. Let us \nbuild a future based on the strength of our ideals and \nvalues, confident that our United Nations can achieve \ngreat things. \n In the same spirit that made our peoples free, \nsovereign, democratic and human-centred nations, I \ninvite the Assembly today to set its sights on a future \nof greater freedom, justice, brotherhood and solidarity \namong human beings.

        "file_text": "\u201cUnited in diversity\u201d: \nthis motto of the European Union expresses what we, \nthe 25 \u2014 and soon to be 27 \u2014 member States of the \nEuropean Union, demand from ourselves, as well as \nour aspirations for the United Nations. \u201cUnited in \ndiversity\u201d is also a concrete management principle of \nour practical, everyday work to promote justice, peace, \nfreedom and prosperity. As the host country to the only \nUnited Nations headquarters within the European \nUnion, as President of the European Union during the \nfirst six months of 2006 and as a venue for the dialogue \nof religions and cultures, Austria has consistently \naimed at translating this principle into practice, \nincluding by providing peacekeepers, despite recent \n  \n \n06-53005 36 \n \nbitter experiences such as the tragic death of Major \nHans-Peter Lang while he was serving the United \nNations in southern Lebanon. \n By establishing the Human Rights Council in \nGeneva and the Peacebuilding Commission, we have \ngiven ourselves new instruments for carrying out an \nimportant part of our work in this phase of United \nNations reform. Austria thanks Jan Eliasson, President \nof the General Assembly at its sixtieth session, for his \nvision, tenacity and endurance. We owe it to his \nnegotiating skills that institutional reform of the United \nNations has been decisively set in motion. We pledge \nto devote the necessary determination to the reform \nmeasures that still need to be implemented, such as \nmanagement reform, the review of United Nations \nmandates and the establishment of a rule of law \nassistance unit. \n Today, after decades of division, Europe is \ngrowing together again. That is the major achievement \nof the European Union. We have come a long way. The \niron curtain is a relic of the past. Today, we want the \ncountries of South-East Europe and the Balkans to take \ntheir rightful place in Europe and to be included in the \nreunification process of our continent. The European \nexperience is, profoundly, an experience of overcoming \nold and bitter conflicts and of the power of patient and \npeaceful transformation.  \n Here, I wish to welcome to the General Assembly \nthe newest European member and the 192nd Member \nof the United Nations, the Republic of Montenegro. \n In Europe, difficult issues need to be solved. \nTomorrow, the Security Council will discuss the future \nstatus of Kosovo. Austria supports the efforts of \nPresident Martti Ahtisaari and his team in Vienna. As \nneighbours and friends, we urge both Belgrade and \nPristina to engage in these negotiations constructively, \nin a results-oriented manner and with the necessary \nsense of realism. Our goal is a democratic and multi-\nethnic Kosovo whose citizens can all live in security \nand dignity on the basis of mutual trust. In the same \nspirit, a confident, peaceful and prosperous Serbia, \nfully integrated into the family of European nations, is \ncrucial for the stability of the whole region. \n In the Middle East, innocent civilians still suffer \nfrom the disastrous consequences of terror attacks and \nthe indiscriminate use of force. Men, women and \nchildren on all sides must be given a real chance to live \nin peace and in an atmosphere of increasing mutual \ntrust.  \n The goal that Austria pursues in its relations with \nthe Middle East is to realize the vision of Palestinians \nand Israelis living side by side in security as \nneighbours in two States, working towards a peaceful \nand economically successful common future. We know \nthat the path towards that goal is rocky, but now we \nhave reached a turning point. In the aftermath of the \narmed conflict in Lebanon, all parties in the region \nhave agreed on the need for renewed engagement on \nthe part of the international community. The European \nUnion and its member States can and will make a \nsubstantive contribution.  \n However, international efforts can only \nsupport \u2014 not serve as a substitute for \u2014 efforts by \nIsrael and the Palestinians. That is why we welcome \nthe efforts of President Abbas to form a Government of \nnational unity in the Palestinian territories and the \nrecent high-level, direct contacts. Yesterday\u2019s statement \nby the Middle East Quartet \u2014 in which the United \nNations plays such a central role \u2014 is another \nencouraging signal. We hope that those decisions will \nhelp to alleviate the plight of the Palestinian people \nand to move the political process forward. \n Austria is convinced that the work of the Middle \nEast Quartet should now pave the way towards a major \npeace initiative. We see great merit in an international \nMiddle East conference along the lines of the 1991 \nMadrid Conference. We believe that such a forum \nshould be open to regional partners willing to \nparticipate constructively in search of a comprehensive \npeace settlement. A conference of that kind could also \nexamine the longer-term potential for regional security \narrangements. \n As the Secretary-General has rightly pointed out, \nAfrica must remain one of our main priorities. In \nparticular, we must engage to prevent a humanitarian \ncatastrophe in Darfur. It is simply unacceptable that not \neven relief agencies are given access to help those most \nin need. It is deeply disturbing that there is no clear \nperspective for an end to fighting and suffering in the \nregion. As many others, we urgently call upon the \nGovernment of the Sudan to accept the deployment of \na United Nations peacekeeping force in Darfur without \ndelay. \n Austria is deeply aware of the need for the \ndialogue of cultures and religions. This is because my \n \n \n37 06-53005 \n \ncountry lies at the crossroads of many different \ncultures, at the heart of a continent marked by centuries \nof dividing lines. Our own difficult experience has \ncertainly taught us that mutual tolerance and respect \nare universal values, which we must all uphold and that \nreligious beliefs, by their very nature, must never be \nmisused to justify violence.  \n In view of our own experience, we are also \nconvinced that the dialogue of religions and cultures is \nnot a challenge confined only to the international field; \nthis dialogue begins at home, within our own societies. \nHere, as well as at the global level, \u201cUnited in \ndiversity\u201d must be our guiding principle. We have to \nkeep our work down to earth. We have to find answers \non how best to organize living together and provide \norientation in a rapidly globalizing world that many \nregard as a menace. Ultimately, it is in the work place, \nat school, in defining the role of women in society, in \nseeking to create opportunities for young people and in \nthe media that we decide about the outcome of the \ndialogue of cultures in real-life terms. \n I am therefore convinced that we must better \nintegrate the dialogue of religions and cultures in the \neveryday work of the United Nations. This is a topic \nthat we cannot leave to the street. The minefield of \ncollective emotions is not a good place to discuss \nquestions of belief. Complex feelings of frustration, \nhumiliation and neglect can erupt in violence at the \nslightest trigger. In a world where connections are \nestablished by a single mouse click, reactions arrive \nwithin minutes. Here, we need to counteract on the \nbasis of our common values, in full conformity with \nuniversal human rights and basic freedoms, as they are \nthe very foundation of our work here at the United \nNations. \n In the 61 years of the United Nations, this is only \nthe third time that a woman has presided over the \nGeneral Assembly, and the first woman to do so \ncoming from the Arab world. While we congratulate \nher personally on her election to this high position, \nAustria also regards this election as a signal to all \nwomen in the world: the time has come for women to \ntake their rightful place in all spheres of public life. We \nare called upon to engage politically at all levels, from \nthe community level to the United Nations. The voices \nof women need to be heard more clearly in the work of \nthe United Nations. Women know what holds families, \ncommunities and societies together. This age-old \nknowledge in all its modern variety and colour should \nnot be left untapped, in particular in peace processes. \nIn United Nations missions, at the negotiation table, in \ndecision-making processes and not only as voices in \nthe background. During its presidency of the European \nUnion, Austria, in its recruitment strategy, consistently \naimed at deploying women in European Union peace \nmissions. In addition, we elaborated guidelines for \nEuropean Union missions on how to best comply with \nthe special needs of children. \n In his address to the General Assembly at its 10th \nmeeting, on 19 September, the Secretary-General \nrightly said, \u201cIt is shameful that last year\u2019s Summit \nOutcome does not contain even one word about non-\nproliferation and disarmament\u201d. Austria calls for a \nrenewed commitment of the international community \nto these security goals. We also offer to host the next \npreparatory meeting for the Review Conference of the \nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons in Vienna in the spring of 2007. \n Development and the preservation of our \nlivelihoods require sustainable solutions. Among the \ngreat global challenges we are facing is climate \nchange. Global warming is real. Austria is committed \nto do her part in combating it. However, in Austria\u2019s \nview, nuclear energy is not the right answer; it bears \ntoo many risks and uncertainties to be regarded as a \nsafe and sustainable source of energy. \n Solidarity is at the heart of the United Nations: \nsolidarity with the poor, the weak and the powerless. \nHere, the United Nations task list for the coming years \nis rich with promise: achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals in full, concluding the Doha \nDevelopment Round, fighting against hunger, disease, \npoverty and exclusion. \n On Tuesday, we launched the United Nations \nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy with a clear \nmessage: the international community is united against \nthis scourge of humanity. We will not tolerate terrorism \nin any form or manifestation. And we will redouble our \nefforts to dry up the breeding grounds from which \nterrorism feeds itself. Let me in this context point out \nthe excellent work of the United Nations Office on \nDrugs and Crime in Vienna, with its Global \nProgramme against Terrorism, in delivering technical \nassistance to Member States. \n It is out of respect for diversity and in recognition \nof the need for unity that Austria has presented its \ncandidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security \n  \n \n06-53005 38 \n \nCouncil for the period 2009-2010. With this in mind, \nwe have made the rule of law the backbone of our \ncandidature. \n Let me close by conveying Austria\u2019s appreciation \nfor the great personality who has been standing at the \nhelm of this Organization for the past decade, for Kofi \nAnnan, the statesman and the person. We thank the \nSecretary-General, in particular for being a tireless \nencourager, despite the considerable obstacles he has \nhad to face at times. He is a role model for dignity and \nconfidence. He is always ready to speak out, in his soft \nbut firm voice, for those whose voices are not strong \nenough or loud enough to be heard; to give voice to the \nweak, the poor, the small and those who feel lost or \nabandoned. Mr. Secretary-General, the world will \ncontinue listening to your voice as it is the voice of \nhope and steadfastness. "

        "file_text": "At a \ntime when the United Nations continues on its path \ntowards universality by welcoming a new Member \nState \u2014 Montenegro, with which Algeria has been \ninvolved in multi-faceted cooperation \u2014 the very basis \nof our institution is once again being tested by the \ngrave developments in the situation in the Middle East, \nwith violence directed at our brother peoples of \nPalestine and Lebanon. Because of their context, their \nscope and the breadth of their consequences at various \nlevels, those acts of aggression \u2014 which cannot merely \nbe seen as passing occurrences \u2014 point an accusing \nfinger at the limitations imposed upon the authority of \nthe United Nations when it is faced with conflict \nsituations which run counter to its very raison d\u2019\u00eatre. \n In the vast areas of the developing world, in \nparticular throughout Muslim civilization, a silent \nfrustration is growing and increasing before the \npowerlessness of the United Nations to support the \nmost elementary human values of the Palestinian and \nLebanese people. \n The Middle East is without doubt the most \nunstable region of the world. There we see the great \ncruelty, flagrant denial of justice and recurrent waves \nof violence that are reflected in the serious \ndeterioration of the humanitarian and security \nsituation. This makes the prospect of establishing a just \nand lasting peace in the region a remote one. The \nPalestinian people are improperly subjected to \ncollective punishment, and Lebanon \u2014 whose \nsuffering is exemplified by the relentless Israeli attack \nagainst Qana \u2014 has been caught up in a murderous \nwar, in which the Lebanese people were able to hold at \nbay the infernal firepower and destructive capability \ndirected against it. \n In the same geopolitical sphere, lack of security \nand instability persist in Iraq. The daily ransom paid in \nheavy human losses is submerged in a pernicious effect \nof habit and trivialization. The establishment of the \nGovernment of National Unity, and that Government\u2019s \ndecision to opt for inclusive national reconciliation are \nfirst steps in the right direction. Algeria welcomes the \npositive response to those developments from the main \npolitical forces in Iraq, and we believe that the best \nway to ensure the success of the ongoing political \nprocess \u2014 with its objective of allowing Iraq to fully \nrecover its sovereignty in the framework of national \nunity and territorial integrity \u2014 would be through \nintensified efforts to avoid further fratricidal schism in \nthe country along ethnic and religious fault lines. \n One year ago, at the World Summit, we defined a \npath together towards comprehensive reform of the \nUnited Nations. By joining the consensus on adoption \nof a series of specific reform measures, the non-aligned \ncountries hoped to contribute to the transformation of \nthe United Nations into an instrument capable of \n \n \n23 06-53329 \n \naddressing the new challenges and threats confronting \nthe international community. \n First of all, we have seen the creation of the \nPeacebuilding Commission, an innovative institutional \nmechanism that has long been lacking in the \nOrganization. We saw also the establishment of the \nHuman Rights Council, which also marks progress for \nthe international community as it seeks to achieve \nuniversal respect for all human rights. However, a great \ndeal remains to be done in order to attain the objectives \nwhich have been set in the reform process.  \n Thus, it is important that we strengthen our \nefforts in order to succeed at this session in achieving \ncomprehensive agreement on pending issues, in \nparticular reform of the Security Council. Through \nsuch comprehensive reform, the Security Council \nshould become more representative in its membership, \nmore democratic and more transparent in its \nfunctioning and more in harmony with the positions of \nthe General Assembly, in order to provide greater \nlegitimacy to its decisions and to enhance its \neffectiveness. \n The peoples of the United Nations had hoped that \nthe celebration of the Organization\u2019s sixtieth \nanniversary would return us to the principles and \npurposes of the Charter, and enable us to re-draw the \nplans it outlined. But today\u2019s world is full of \nuncertainty and too many problems still weigh upon it. \nIt is confronted with more threats than ever \u2014 all of \nthem equally dangerous \u2014 which must be addressed in \na consistent manner in order to better determine their \nroot causes and thus to enable the international \ncommunity to act with determination to eliminate them \nfor good.  \n That is true for terrorism, which continues to \nstrike communities with its well-known horror and \ncruelty and without distinction as to race, sex or \nreligion. The fight against that scourge, from which no \ncountry is safe, requires unified cooperation at both the \nregional and international level, using clear and \ncomplementary approaches. \n Algeria, which has long suffered from terrorist \nviolence \u2014 to which some have reacted with \nindifference and others with complacency \u2014 can only \nwelcome the fact that the international community has \nbecome aware of the seriousness of the threat of \nterrorism upon international peace and security. It \nstresses the urgency of concluding a comprehensive \nconvention against international terrorism, which \nshould contain an unequivocal definition of that \nscourge and draw a distinction between the legitimate \nstruggle of peoples against foreign occupation, on the \none hand, and on the other, acts perpetrated by terrorist \ngroups or individuals, and which would be careful not \nto confuse that scourge with any particular religion, \ncivilization or geographic area. \n I would like to reiterate our legitimate concern as \nwe are faced with the deadlock of the multilateral \ndisarmament process, and the disagreement that has \nemerged, here and there, on the issue of the non-\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The goal \nhas remained the same. Disarmament must be overall \nand complete and under effective international control. \nThe policy of nuclear non-proliferation must be \npursued in both its horizontal and vertical dimensions \nand those countries that have voluntarily given up the \nmilitary nuclear option have the right to expect security \nguarantees and free access without discrimination to \nnuclear technology for peaceful uses. \n In the Western Sahara, the last territory which \nmust be decolonized in Africa, the Saharan people \nremain deprived of their inalienable right to self-\ndetermination, as enshrined in the Charter and relevant \nUnited Nations resolutions. Just as in 1991 with the \nadoption of the Settlement Plan, in 2003 the \ninternational community, after the unanimous adoption \nby the Security Council of the peace plan proposed by \nMr. James Baker, former Personal Envoy of the \nSecretary-General for Western Sahara, the United \nNations had the hope of seeing a just and lasting \nsettlement to the conflict. But today we must note that \nno positive evolution of that conflict has taken place, \nbecause of the rejection of the peace plan by one of the \ntwo parties to the conflict and its desire to prejudge to \nits advantage, the final status of the territory \u2014 a status \nwhich can only be determined through a referendum on \nself-determination. \n Algeria, which has no claims whatsoever on that \nterritory and is not in any way involved in the \nconflict \u2014 which has only two parties as designated by \nthe international community, namely, the Kingdom of \nMorocco and the Polisario Front \u2014 has taken note of \nthe unanimous adoption by the Security Council of \nresolution 1675 (2006), which reaffirms the right to \nself-determination of the Saharan people. Deeply \nrespectful of the \u201cDeclaration on the Granting of \nIndependence to Colonial Countries and Peoples\u201d as \n  \n \n06-53329 24 \n \ncontained in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) \nof 14 December 1960, Algeria will continue to support \nall efforts designed to enable the Saharan people to \nexercise their right to self-determination with full \nsovereignty in conditions that are incontestably free \nand transparent. \n In another area, the outcome of the seventh \nAfrican Union Summit in Banjul shows a mixed record \nconcerning the development of various crises and other \nconflicts situations on the continent, in particular in the \nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \nthe Sudan and Somalia. Serious efforts are being \ndeployed in order to promote interaction between the \nUnited Nations and the African Union, in order to \neffectively deal with those situations, which have often \nshown themselves to be complicated and difficult.  \n What is more important \u2014 a culture of peace is \ndeveloping throughout Africa as a result of a renewal \nand recovery, the foundations of which were \nestablished by African leaders of the region through the \ncreation of the African Union and the New Partnership \nfor Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD).  \n In that light, it is extremely important to insure \nthat the peaceful settlement of the crisis in Darfur, with \nfull respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity \nof the Sudan and in keeping with the Abuja accord, \nmove hand in hand with harmonious action based on \nthe good will of all, in particular of the African Union \nand the United Nations. \n The question of development is, rightly, one of \nthe highest priorities of the United Nations agenda, in \nparticular following the adoption in September 2000 of \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). So, too is \nthe eradication of poverty, which weighs heavily upon \nthe conscience of mankind. However, the gap that \nexists to date between the goals and the progress \nachieved is such that decisive efforts are essential in \norder to insure that Africa will achieve its goals by the \nyear 2015. Similar great efforts are required from the \ndeveloped countries to honour their commitments \nundertaken at the time of the Millennium Summit,  \nthe International Conference on Financing for \nDevelopment held in Monterrey, as well as the 2005 \nWorld Summit. \n At the time of the sixtieth anniversary of the \ncreation of the Organization, all of us realized that the \nworld had profoundly changed and that it was \nnecessary to adjust our activities to the new realities. \nFaced with the many challenges and structural threats \nof our time, the 2005 World Summit gave us a clear \ndiagnosis and prescribed the necessary remedies. One \nyear later \u2014 the state of the world today further \nstresses how acute the problems are and the urgency of \nsolving them. It makes it crystal clear that it would be \npointless to dwell on the uncertainties and imbalances, \nas well as the precarious situations that have become \nan inextricable part of the fabric of international \nsociety, unless we want to doom that society to chronic \ninstability and insecurity. \n Truthfully, the imperfect achievements and \nlimited gains made by the international community, at \na time when globalization has greatly shrunk both time \nand space, demand of us that we view the future with \ngenuine resolve, concerning what has to be done, rather \nthan resign ourselves to what merely appears possible. \nIn that connection, there is no alternative to a truly \ndemocratic reform of the United Nations that includes \nthe participation of all countries. There is no viable \noption other than a globalization based upon peace and \nprosperity that benefits all of humankind. "

        "file_text": "It gives me great \npleasure, Madam, to extend to you the felicitations of \nmy Government and our people, and my own \ncongratulations, on your well-deserved election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly. My delegation \nstands ready to extend to you its fullest cooperation, \nnot only as a member of your Bureau, but as a close \nfriend of Bahrain as well. Your predecessor, Mr. Jan \nEliasson, has left an indelible impression on the United \nNations. Under his leadership, we were able to carry \nout a substantial part of the package of reforms \nmandated by the largest gathering of world leaders, as \nset out in the 2005 World Summit Outcome \n(resolution 60/1). \n Last year, our leaders met to commemorate 60 \nyears of the United Nations. That meeting gave all of \nus renewed hopes for peace, growth, progress and the \npre-eminence of the rights of all peoples. Those hopes \nremain, even in the face of continuing threats to the \npeace and security of mankind posed by terrorism and \nthe proliferation of nuclear weapons; even in the face \nof grinding poverty and financial uncertainty; even in \nthe face of intolerance and misunderstanding; and, \ncertainly, in the face of the fast-changing nature of our \nworld.  \n Those hopes remain because the spirit of \ncooperation and community, which lies at the very \nheart of our Charter, lives on. Cooperation remains the \nkey to reaching the goals set by our Charter. \nCooperation, according to a twentieth-century \nphilosopher, is the only thing that will redeem \nmankind. \n It is in that spirit that the Philippines welcomes \nand supports the continued work of the Middle East \nQuartet and its call this week for greater progress \ntowards a just and comprehensive peace. We strongly \nsupport the Road Map to peace and maintain our hopes \nfor the realization of the vision of two democratic \nStates, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace \nand security. \n Together with the other members of the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), we \nwere gravely concerned over the deteriorating situation \nand the escalation of violence in the Middle East, \nparticularly the disproportionate, indiscriminate and \nexcessive use of force in Lebanon. The United Nations \npeacekeeping operation now under way in Lebanon \nrenews our hope for peace and offers a great \nopportunity for the United Nations to demonstrate its \nrelevance and its impact on the world stage. \n Our own quest for peace in the Philippines is \nboldly moving forward, thanks to the support and \ncooperation of key members of the Organization of the \nIslamic Conference and other members of the \ninternational community. \n Our own experience as a country is convincing \nproof of the efficacy of collective action in fighting \nterrorism. Working closely with our neighbours and \nothers, we are ridding our country of terrorists. The \nrecent adoption of the United Nations Global Counter-\nTerrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288) will help to \nstrike another blow against terrorists. I commend the \nPermanent Representatives of Spain and Singapore for \nhaving successfully steered the negotiations on the \nStrategy.  \n One of the anchors of the Strategy is an initiative \nthat is a primary concern of my country: the promotion \nof interfaith dialogue and cooperation. In pursuit of \nthat initiative, the Philippines organized and chaired \ntwo key meetings held yesterday here at the United \nNations: the First Ministerial Meeting on Interfaith \nDialogue and Cooperation for Peace and the High-level \nConference on Interfaith Cooperation for Peace. As \nfounder and current Chair of the Tripartite Forum on \nInterfaith Cooperation for Peace \u2014 a new movement of \nGovernments, United Nations agencies and religious \nnon-governmental organizations accredited to the \nUnited Nations \u2014 the Philippines will initiate the \nholding of another high-level tripartite conference, this \ntime to focus on the issue of small arms and light \nweapons.  \n In addition, the Philippines announced last week, \nat the Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, that we \nwill organize and convene a special ministerial meeting \non interfaith dialogue and cooperation for peace in the \ncity of Davao, in southern Philippines. Meanwhile, I \ncommend Spain and Turkey for their new initiative on \nthe Alliance of Civilizations. I believe that it will \n \n \n27 06-53323 \n \ncomplement and reinforce, in a mutually inclusive \nmanner, the Philippine initiative on interfaith dialogue \nand cooperation for peace. \n We have barely nine years left to achieve the \nMillennium Development Goal (MDG), set by our \nleaders, of cutting poverty in half by 2015. That target \ncould remain a mere vision if no effective mechanism \nfor resource mobilization is found. It is in that context \nthat the Philippine initiative on debt for equity in MDG \nprojects was launched last year; I thank the Group of \n77 and China for its support. This initiative does not \ncall for debt cancellation, a debt moratorium or debt \nreduction; it merely calls for the use of part of the \npayments from the debt stock of low- and medium-\nincome developing countries not eligible under the \nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative as \nequity for creditors in MDG projects in areas such as \ninfrastructure, education, employment and health. \n Multilateral cooperation in the field of energy \nsecurity continues to grow in importance. Alternative \nsources of energy have to be developed. My delegation \nrecommends that the Secretary-General appoint a \ngroup of eminent persons to look into this matter. The \noutput of such a group should be the subject of a high-\nlevel dialogue before the current session ends.  \n One of the historic achievements of the sixtieth \nsession of the General Assembly was the decision to \nestablish the Central Emergency Response Fund for the \nrapid deployment of relief and assistance to countries \nstricken by natural disasters. The Philippines ranks \nthird globally in terms of the number of people \nexposed to earthquakes and tropical cyclones annually. \nFor that reason, the Philippines calls on all nations to \nsupport the Fund. We also call for enhanced \ncooperation aimed at effective responses to natural \ndisasters. \n International migration and development was the \nsubject of last week\u2019s High-level Dialogue. That is an \nissue that is close to our hearts. Approximately one \ntenth of the population of the Philippines lives \noverseas. We are the largest supplier of seafarers, and \nour land-based workers can be found in practically all \nparts of the world.  \n Bearing that in mind, the Philippines joined the \ncall for the creation of an informal global forum on \nmigration and development as an outcome of the High-\nlevel Dialogue, provisionally outside the umbrella of \nthe United Nations, to enable the international \ncommunity to continue the dialogue on important \nissues relating to migration. My delegation invites \nMember States to accede to the International \nConvention on the Protection of the Rights of All \nMigrant Workers and Members of Their Families in \norder to demonstrate and reaffirm the universality of \nhuman rights.  \n For my country and its people, human rights and \nthe sanctity of the life of the individual are of \nparamount value. For my Government, the protection \nof human life is a sacred commitment. Last week, the \nPhilippines renewed that commitment through the \nsigning of the Second Optional Protocol to the \nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. \n Enshrined in our constitution is powerful \nlanguage against the death penalty. Three months ago, \nPresident Arroyo gave that constitutional mandate \nfurther expression when she signed into law Republic \nAct 9346, which removed the death penalty from our \nstatute books. \n Such is the value that we assign to life that, in our \nconstitution, we are bound to protect the life of the \nunborn child. Through the signing of the Second \nOptional Protocol, the Philippine Government re-\nemphasized its unrelenting commitment to \nstrengthening the protection of human rights. \n I should like to take this opportunity to express \nthe profound appreciation of the Philippines and of \nASEAN to the outgoing Secretary-General, Kofi \nAnnan, for his dedicated and tireless service to the \nUnited Nations. He leaves behind a more invigorated \nand dynamic Organization, a legacy of reform with \nnew and needed institutions such as the Human Rights \nCouncil and the Peacebuilding Commission, and an \neloquent recommitment on the part of the United \nNations and its membership to alleviating the plight of \nthe less fortunate through the articulation of the \nMillennium Development Goals.  \n The Philippines is particularly appreciative of \nSecretary-General Kofi Annan\u2019s support and \ncooperation during our recent term as a Security \nCouncil member during the biennium 2004-2005 and \nfor his steadfast support for the Philippines interfaith \ndialogue initiative. \n Two world wars ago, Mr. Woodrow Wilson, an \nadvocate of a global organization, defined power in \nterms that are still relevant today. He said: \u201cPower \n  \n \n06-53323 28 \n \nconsists in one\u2019s capacity to link his will with the \npurpose of others, to lead by reason and a gift of \ncooperation\u201d. The drafters of our Charter and the \nchallenges of the present provide us with the reason. \nWe must now find within ourselves, as nations and as \npeoples, the gift of cooperation. "

        "file_text": "Allow me first, on behalf \nof my delegation, to congratulate Ms. Haya Rashed \nAl-Khalifa on her election as President and to express \nmy conviction that the session will be successful under \nher able leadership. \n The desire of humankind for a peaceful and \nprosperous world in the new century is still faced with \ngrave challenges. The unilateralism and high-handed \nacts of the super-Power are becoming so reckless as to \ntrample on the principles of respect for the sovereign \nequality of all States, the fundamental basis of the \nUnited Nations Charter, thereby arousing international \nsociety\u2019s serious concern. Worse still are the invasions \nof sovereign States, either openly committed or \ndisregarded, and even fanned under the pretext of non-\nproliferation and anti-terrorism, giving rise to the \nmassacre of innocent people and the destruction of \ninternational peace and security. \n The threats and high-handed acts of the super-\nPower are becoming more and more obvious, with the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea as their target. \nThe United States adventurous military manoeuvres, \nsuch as military exercises and an economic blockade of \nthe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, continue \nto be tolerated, while the routine missile test-firings of \nour army for self-defence have been condemned as a \nthreat to international peace and security. Such a reality \nis a serious lesson to us all that a country with \npowerful strength, a just deterrent, is capable of \nsafeguarding the dignity and sovereignty of a nation by \nitself.  \n Herein lies the necessity and justness of the \nSongun policy of General Kim Jong Il, the respected \nleader of our people. The Songun policy is a sure \nguarantee of the ability of the Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of Korea to safeguard its sovereignty and \nsecurity and ensure peace and stability on the Korean \npeninsula, and in the region as a whole, in the face of \nthe ever-hardening, hostile policy of the United States \ntowards it. The Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea\u2019s possession of deterrent power, solely for self-\ndefence, is also fully in line with the interest of the \ncountries of the region in peace and security and a \npeaceful environment. \n As is well known, the Korean people have \nsuffered a tragic history; after the nearly half-century-\nlong tyrannical military occupation by Japan they have \nbeen living in a state of war with the United States for \n60 years. Against this background, the Korean people \naspire for peace more than any other country. Today \nthere persist on the Korean peninsula touch-and-go \ncritical tension and confrontation, rather than durable \npeace and security. The source is none other than the \nvicious, hostile policy of the United States towards the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.  \n The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is not \nexceptional either, as it originates from United States \nnuclear threats. The United States policy towards the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea has gone \nbeyond mere hostility, going so far as to pose nuclear \nthreats, even by designating it part of an \u201caxis of evil\u201d \nand the target of pre-emptive strikes, thus driving the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea to inevitably \npossess a nuclear deterrent. The Government of the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea maintains its \nconsistent position of seeking to resolve the issue of \ndenuclearizing the Korean peninsula peacefully \nthrough dialogue and negotiation. \n As the world knows well, the core elements \nstipulated in the Joint Statement of 19 September 2005, \nadopted at the six-party talks, are the respective \ncommitments of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea and the United States to abandon its nuclear \nprogramme and to live in peaceful coexistence. As for \nthe Joint Statement, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic \nof Korea remains committed to implementing all its \nagreed provisions on an equal footing. The Democratic \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea is sure to get greater \nbenefit from implementation of the agreed provisions \nof the talks. That is why it is willing, more than any \nother country, to hold the talks. However, the United \nStates, soon after the announcement of that Joint \nStatement, wasted no time in imposing financial \nsanctions upon the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea, a dialogue partner, eventually scrapping the \n \n \n27 06-53609 \n \nalready agreed itinerary for the following rounds of the \nTalks and creating the present impasse. \n In view of these facts, it is crystal clear that the \nUnited States is not in favour of the six-party talks and \nthe denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. If there \nis anything that the United States does favour, it is \naggravated tension on the Korean peninsula, to be used \nas a pretext to reinforce its military forces in the north-\neast Asian region. By doing so, the United States aims \nto strengthen its armed forces in the region and thus \ncontain the ever-growing, strong Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of Korea and neighbouring countries within \nits world supremacy strategy. That is the real intention \nof the United States.  \n It is quite preposterous that the Democratic \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea, under the groundless \nUnited States sanctions, takes part in the Talks to \ndiscuss its own nuclear abandonment. That is the \nmatter of principle on which even the slightest \nconcession cannot be tolerated. I take this opportunity \nto express my deep gratitude to Member States of the \nUnited Nations for their continued support for and \nencouragement of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea in its efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution of \nthe nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. \n As for Korea\u2019s reunification, it is the supreme \naspiration of our nation to realize it at the earliest \npossible date as a prerequisite to ensuring lasting peace \nand security on the Korean peninsula. The North-South \nJoint Declaration of 15 June 2000 is a declaration on \nrealizing independence and peaceful reunification by \nthe Korean nation itself, rejecting foreign interference. \nRegrettably, however, on 21 September the South \nKorean Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade made \ndistorted remarks about the root causes of the tension \nin the Korean peninsula, without saying a single word \nabout implementation of the North-South Joint \nDeclaration of 15 June 2000. That causes us \nconsternation.  \n It is already well known that the major factors \nundermining peace and stability and aggravating \ntension in the Korean peninsula are the United States \nmilitary presence in South Korea; its doctrine of pre-\nemptive nuclear strike against the Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of Korea; incessant large-scale joint United \nStates and South Korea military exercises; the mass \ndelivery to South Korea of all sorts of military \nequipment, including weapons of mass destruction; and \naerial reconnaissance carried out by the United States a \nhundred-odd times every month. \n The North-South Joint Declaration of 15 June has \nnot been smoothly implemented so far, because of the \npersistent manoeuvres of the United States, which \ndislikes improved inter-Korean relations, and because \nof the existence in South Korea of such legal \nmechanisms as the national security law stipulating \nfellow countrymen as enemies and denying even basic \nhuman rights, which is against the ideals of \u201cBy our \nnation itself\u201d, the core of the Joint Declaration. Those \nare undeniable facts.  \n By upholding the banner of the North-South Joint \nDeclaration, and under the ideals of \u201cBy our nation \nitself\u201d, the Government of our Republic will surely \nachieve national reunification by firmly realizing \ncooperation in the three areas of national \nindependence, peace against war, and patriotism for \nreunification.  \n For the United Nations to fulfil its mission for the \nmaintenance of international peace and security, \npractical measures should be taken to reject \nunilateralism and high-handed acts that block the \nestablishment of equitable and just international \nrelations. Furthermore, the United Nations should be \ndemocratized so that all international issues are \nresolved in conformity with the common interests of \nMember States.  \n In this regard, we are of the view that one of the \nreasonable ways to effect that is to hand over from the \nSecurity Council to the General Assembly the power to \npass resolutions on issues directly linked to \ninternational peace and security, such as the use of \nforce. It is also imperative to ensure that the Security \nCouncil, responsible for international peace and \nsecurity, strictly observe the principle of fairness in its \nactivities. It should be accountable to the General \nAssembly by making a real contribution to \ninternational peace and security, not a means for \ncertain countries to legalize their strategic interests.  \n The fact that the Security Council remains \nindifferent to the infringement of sovereignty and the \nmassacre of civilians in Arab territories \u2014 such as the \nUnited States invasion of Iraq and Israel\u2019s aggression \nin Lebanon \u2014 is a typical example of the \nirresponsibility, unfairness and double standards in its \nactivities. The reform of the Security Council now \nunder consideration should focus on ensuring fairness \n  \n \n06-53609 28 \n \nin its activities, first and foremost, and ensure that the \nnon-aligned and developing countries, which make up \nthe overwhelming majority of Member States, are fully \nrepresented.  \n With regard to expansion of the permanent \nmembership of the Council, a country like Japan, the \nwar criminal which invaded Asian countries and \nmassacred innocent people, but which has been \ndistorting its aggressive history instead of liquidating \nit, should never be allowed to become a permanent \nmember. \n The Government of the Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of Korea will continue to develop relations of \nfriendship and cooperation with all Member States that \nrespect its sovereignty, in accordance with the ideals of \nits foreign policy \u2014 independence, peace and \nfriendship \u2014 and will make an active contribution to \nthe efforts of international society to achieve world \npeace and security and sustainable development.

        "file_text": "Let me begin by \nextending my congratulations to Her Excellency Haya \nRashed Al-Khalifa from the Kingdom of Bahrain on \nthe occasion of her election as President of the General \nAssembly in its sixty-first session. I wish you, Madam, \nevery success in carrying out this important mission. \n To the former President, His Excellency Jan \nEliasson, Minister for Foreign Affairs from the \nKingdom of Sweden, I convey my respect for his \noutstanding achievements in running the previous \nsession. \n I convey my best wishes to the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan. I would like to express my \nprofound respect and full support for his incessant \nefforts in continuing to reduce international tension and \nresolve international conflicts. \n The matters we have gathered here to discuss \ntoday are very important for the world, for Europe, for \nPoland and for me personally. I am saying this as \nPresident and as a member of Solidarity \u2014 the \nmovement that completely changed my country. \n Solidarity gave Poland her freedom and \nsovereignty, and also contributed to the fall of \nCommunism in Europe. Thanks to Solidarity, a wall \ndividing the world into two hostile camps was brought \ndown. We, the Poles, perceive global partnership for \ndevelopment \u2014 the theme of this year\u2019s session of the \nUnited Nations \u2014 through the lens of our historical \nexperiences \u2014 the experiences of the Solidarity \nmovement. \n The Polish Solidarity movement originated from \nan idea that is a universal value in various cultures, \nreligions and traditions. This value must be \nrediscovered in order to help build a new world based \non the right of all nations and all peoples to live in \ndignity. \n Poland\u2019s heritage is inextricably connected with \nthe heritage of Europe \u2014 one that is founded on a \nrespect for human rights and love of freedom. \n Like many other countries over the course of \nhistory, we have experienced disasters like those that, \nunfortunately, continue to affect the everyday lives of \nmillions of people on various continents. For many \nyears, we suffered from wars, destruction, poverty, a \nlack of freedom and a loss of independence. Today, in a \nfree country where we have been implementing \nessential reforms for more than a decade, we are \nmaking up for lost time. Although we sometimes make \nmistakes trying to improve on those reforms, we \ncontinue to make progress. We wish to share with \nothers our experience of profound transformation. \n Poland\u2019s experience in shaking off a totalitarian \nregime and taking up the task of modernizing the \ncountry gives us a special understanding of the needs \nof countries following a similar path. That is why we \nare committed to doing our utmost to spread \ndemocracy and freedom around the world. Today, \nPoland is a rapidly developing country. We are \nbecoming a nation that is able to donate to the \ninternational community, much to our satisfaction. \nUntil recently, we were the beneficiary of such aid. \nIndeed, I should like Poland to become even more \nactive in that regard. \n Today, in the twenty-first century, Poland is a \nstrong sovereign State and an active member of the \nEuropean Union, as well as an ally of the United States \nof America. Having overcome painful historical \nexperiences, Poland has been developing friendly \nrelations with its neighbours since 1989, opening a new \nchapter in its relations with Germany. We also want the \nbest possible relationship with our great neighbour \nRussia. We are hopeful, yet sometimes concerned, \nabout the developments in that country. \n Poland, a member of the European Union for \nmore than two years, supports the Union\u2019s approach to \ncooperation with the United Nations. We are convinced \nthat peace must be built through long-term sustainable \ndevelopment. It is in that conviction that we take action \nin the United Nations with regard to the Millennium \nDeclaration and the Millennium Development Goals. \nWe also support our eastern neighbours in their reform \nefforts. Poland, which paved the way for a market \neconomy, the democratic rule of law and a civil society \nin Central and Eastern Europe, has extensive \nexperience in those areas. We are prepared to share that \nexperience further with countries that are transforming \ntheir economies and State institutions. \n Together with our European partners, we are \nshaping the political, social and economic future of our \ncontinent. However, because Poland is aware that \nEurope is not the whole world, we are participating in \nstabilization and peacekeeping missions around the \nworld, including those in Kosovo, Afghanistan, the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Lebanon and Iraq. \n \n \n23 06-52731 \n \n We strongly encourage efforts to bring a lasting \npeace to the Middle East. A few days ago, I had the \nopportunity to express Poland\u2019s position in that regard. \nPoland unequivocally supports Israel\u2019s right to live in \nsecurity. At the same time, Poland supports the \naspirations of the Palestinian nation to build an \nindependent State. We have been involved in the \nstabilization of the region for many years. We actively \nparticipate in the United Nations Interim Force in \nLebanon. Two weeks ago, at the request of the \nSecretary-General, we stated that we would increase \nour military contingent. If necessary, we will increase \nit even further. \n For Poland, the difficult and painful period of our \nhistory belongs to the past. I wish to reiterate that our \nexperiences have left us with a sense of moral \nobligation to help others. We want to repay our debt. \nJust as we once received support, we now want to \nsupport others. \n In seeking to provide the most effective forms of \nassistance, the international community must take into \naccount the phenomenon of globalization, which has \nbecome the challenge of the twenty-first century. \nAlthough it understandably gives rise to various \nemotions and extreme opinions, its significance is \nindisputable. Globalization has revealed the scale and \nthe nature of problems of which we had not been fully \naware. I am thinking about the ever-increasing \ninequalities and exclusion from the achievements of \ncivilization and about the vast areas of poverty and \ninstability that are breeding grounds for crime and \nincrease the threats to peace and security. \n It is also difficult not to fear the negative effects \nof globalization: the division of the world into \ncountries that are becoming ever richer and those that \nare condemned to ever-deepening poverty. The \nresponse to these fears must be global solidarity. We \ncan scarcely fail to see the dramatic contradiction \nbetween such poverty and the affluence made possible \nby incredible scientific and technological progress. \n What is solidarity in the global context? Very \nbriefly, it is the collective reaction against the \nemergence of new iron curtains and political, economic \nand cultural barriers; it is also respect for the dignity \nand the inalienable right to freedom of every human \nbeing throughout the world, regardless of culture, \ntradition or geographic location. Understood in that \nway, solidarity is a rational fight against poverty, \ncarried out by encouraging a broad flow of assistance \nto the poorest countries through appropriately planned \neconomic support. Assistance efforts must be \nundertaken in such a way as to ensure not only that \nthey provide short-term relief, but also, and above all, \nthat they permit long-term development. Thus, we \nshould work out a reform programme to make such \ndevelopment possible. \n Here, I should like to draw attention to the issue \nof energy security, which is increasingly important in \nmany regions of the world. Energy security should be \nbased on the diversification of energy sources and on \nthe development of energy relationships that cannot be \nused as a means of political pressure. \n Assistance provided in the context of global \nsolidarity has an economic aspect. Freedom and respect \nfor the rights of the individual are essential conditions \nfor sustainable well-being. Assistance in the context of \nglobal solidarity also implies support for societies \nstriving to achieve freedom, democracy and the \nprotection of human rights \u2014 support that is provided \nwith wisdom and that is sensitive to the cultural \nuniqueness, traditions and needs of each country. \n I believe that where tensions and social conflicts \nare resolved through dialogue, where respect is \npromoted for different cultures and religions and where \neconomic inequalities between societies and States are \nprevented, terrorism will not find soil in which to \ngrow. I also wish to express my conviction that here \nand now, in the contemporary world, we must fight \nterrorism wherever it appears. In the long run, \nhowever, global solidarity may be the most effective \nweapon against those who would like to see the world \nas the scene of a never-ending fight. \n The United Nations today needs specific \nprogrammes to realize ambitious visions founded on \nglobal solidarity and a global partnership for \ndevelopment. The United Nations must be more \neffective in ensuring equal development opportunities, \nthus closing the gap between the living standards of the \nNorth and of the South. \n The United Nations is thus confronted with huge \ntasks, which require both high-minded commitment \nand reforms. We want changes that adapt the United \nNations to contemporary challenges. The world is \nconstantly changing, and the United Nations must keep \npace with those changes. Only thus can it preserve its \nsignificance and multiply its great achievements. \n  \n \n06-52731 24 \n \nReforms must be focused on the human being, thus \ndefending human rights and freedoms and opening the \nway to well-being and spiritual development for all. \nThose were the founding values of the United Nations \nover 60 years ago. \n Poland advocates such a reform of the \nOrganization and is ready to participate in it. Poland \nalso wishes to participate in a restructuring of \ninternational relations that would be based to a greater \nextent on the principles of solidarity and assistance \nextended by wealthy nations to nations in need. In \nother words, the quantity of such support should be \nsignificantly greater than it is now. \n These words of that great Pole, Pope John Paul II, \nthe spiritual father of Polish solidarity, can be our \nguiding beacon: \u201cMan is great not through what he  \n \nowns, but through what he is; not through what he has, \nbut through what he shares with others.\u201d \n We are facing tremendous challenges. We can \ntackle them only by acting in solidarity through global \npartnership. May our efforts be inspired by solidarity, a \nprinciple embodied in a word that appears in all the \nworld\u2019s languages \u2014 and in many of them it sounds \nvery much the same. "

To Mr. Jan Eliasson I \nconvey our gratitude for the leadership he provided \nduring the work of the sixtieth session. \n In 1970, when I was first elected to the \nParliament of Sri Lanka, a paragraph in the Preamble \nto the Charter of the United Nations gave substance \nand direction to my future political life. It was \u201cto \nreaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the \ndignity and worth of the human person, in the equal \nrights of men and women and of nations large and \nsmall\u201d. Having been a human rights campaigner at the \ngrassroots level throughout my political life, I found it \nnatural that my new Government should be committed \nto carrying the message of democracy to all corners of \nour multi-ethnic, multicultural and multi-religious \ncountry. \u201cDemocracy, equity and prosperity\u201d is our \nclarion call. \n In addition, my country has been influenced by \nthe core Buddhist values of non-violence, loving \nkindness, compassion, equanimity and mindfulness. \nWith this sense of direction, our Government has \ncommitted itself \u201cTowards a new Sri Lanka\u201d, guided \nby a vision of peace, where every Sri Lankan citizen \nmay live with dignity and self-respect, in freedom and \nwithout fear, free of want, and where every child may \nenjoy childhood and grow up with hope and \nexpectation. \n However, Sri Lanka\u2019s dream is threatened by a \nterrible affliction that impedes development, \nundermines democracy and challenges fundamental \nfreedoms. I refer to the bane of terrorism which \nconfronts my country and many other countries of the \nworld. I reaffirm my Government\u2019s firm commitment \nto supporting all global efforts to combat terrorism \nwhenever and wherever it raises its ugly head. \nTerrorism has become closely intertwined with \norganized crime. It is now directly linked with people \nsmuggling, the trade in illicit drugs, the illegal trade in \nsmall arms and money-laundering. Terrorism is a major \nimpediment to development and poses a terrible \nchallenge to civilized society. We support all measures \nundertaken in the United Nations to meet this \nchallenge. We have ratified all United Nations \nconventions in this regard. \n  \n \n06-52879 8 \n \n In our capacity as Chair of the ad hoc committee \non measures to eliminate international terrorism we \nshall spare no effort to realize the international legal \nframework to facilitate our common struggle against \nterrorism. It is our fervent hope that the comprehensive \nconvention on international terrorism will soon become \na reality. \n The illicit trade in and trafficking of small arms \nand light weapons has contributed to the escalation of \nmany local conflicts because of the easy availability of \narms for non-State actors. Sri Lanka is concerned that, \ndespite the commitment of the international community \nto wipe out this menace, the impact at ground level \nthroughout the world is limited. We hope that the \nUnited Nations Plan of Action on this matter will be \nfully implemented and its scope further expanded in \nthe future. \n With regard to terrorism, I speak from personal \nexperience in my own country. Exploiting minority \nconcerns, which we are addressing politically, a \nruthless terrorist outfit in Sri Lanka, the LTTE, has \nbeen terrorizing our people for over two decades. In an \nage when the world seeks dialogue and peace, the \nLTTE devotes its full force to violence, suicide \nbombings, massacre of civilians, indiscriminate armed \nassaults and the conscription of young children for war. \nAssurances given to the Special Representative of the \nSecretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict on \nthe conscription of children for armed combat have \nbeen blatantly violated. \n At the presidential election in November last year \npeople in certain parts of Sri Lanka were cruelly \ndeprived of their freedom to vote. Furthermore, in an \nact of ethnic cleansing more than 60,000 Muslims were \nforcibly expelled from their homes in the north. \n Our Government believes that some of the \nconcerns of minorities in my country have deep roots. \nIn this connection I recall the following words in the \nConstitution of the United Nations Educational, \nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO): \n\u201csince wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the \nminds of men that the defences of peace must be \nconstructed\u201d. \n Soon after my election, despite the violence \nunleashed by the terrorists, I expressed the conviction \nthat we needed to address the causes of the conflict \nfrom a fresh perspective and with a new approach to \ndevelop a sustainable solution. We examined this issue \nwith an open mind, and looked at every option with a \nview to evolving a national consensus to achieve an \nhonourable peace in an undivided country. A \nconsultative process is currently under way to prepare \nconstitutional proposals to address the concerns of the \nminorities. I have invited the LTTE to participate in the \nprocess of seeking a solution to the conflict through \ndialogue. \n As one of the oldest democracies in Asia, we are \nfirmly convinced that the restoration of democracy, the \ncreation of space for dissent, and the promotion of \nhuman rights in the conflict-affected areas are essential \nelements of a successful and sustainable process of \npeace. I hope that the international community will \ncontinue to extend to us its fullest support towards the \ntransformation of the LTTE into a democratic civilian \norganization. \n Our Government firmly believes that terrorism \ncannot be eliminated through military means alone. We \nremain fully committed to talking with the LTTE, \neither directly or through a facilitator. It is our hope \nthat the LTTE will transform itself from a terrorist \noutfit into one that is committed to dialogue and \ndemocracy. Our Government stands ready to respond to \nany display of good will and a move towards a non-\nviolent approach. \n We continue to take unilateral humanitarian \nmeasures, which extend even to terrorist cadres. As a \nresponsible Government we will continue to provide \nunhindered access to conflict-affected areas to the \nInternational Committee of the Red Cross, United \nNations agencies and other recognized humanitarian \nagencies. \n More than 53,000 Muslims were evicted from \ntheir homes by the terrorists following the recent \nviolence. They are the innocent victims of the LTTE\u2019s \nruthless policies. Following Government counter-\nmeasures, almost all have now returned to their homes. \nThe Government has assumed responsibility to provide \nmedical supplies, food and other essential items to the \ninternally displaced persons living in the affected \nareas. \n I am pleased to state that, despite the conflict in \nour country, the economy of Sri Lanka continues to \ngrow at a commendable rate. In the first quarter of this \nyear we recorded growth of 8.1 per cent \u2014 the highest \nin 28 years. With our determination to further enhance \ngrowth with equity, we have adopted an economic \n \n \n9 06-52879 \n \nstrategy that will provide opportunities for all citizens, \nwhile giving adequate space to the private sector as the \nengine of growth. \n We continue to maintain the highest rating in \nSouth Asia on the Human Development Index. We \nhave already achieved some of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goal targets in primary school \nenrolment, gender equality and maternal and infant \nmortality rates. We hope that the increased economic \nopportunities in the country will further encourage the \nLTTE to opt for a negotiated peace. \n We follow a pro-poor development strategy, with \na focus on regionally balanced growth. Our objective is \nto achieve overall development while raising the \nincome levels of the poor through the empowerment of \ncommunities living at the grass-roots level. In this \nconnection, Sri Lanka hopes that debt forgiveness will \ncontinue to be expanded to encourage the development \nof developing countries. It is only right that those who \nreach the heights of development should pause to lend \na helping hand to those who have fallen behind due to \ncircumstances. \n I wish to acknowledge the role of President \nClinton, the United Nations Special Envoy for Tsunami \nRecovery, and the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, \nfor their assistance with tsunami-related support. I also \nacknowledge the support given by many other \ncountries. I am pleased to state that, despite being a \ndeveloping country, we are now well on the way to \nrecovery from this massive disaster, in many instances \nas a result of the efforts of our own people. We urge \nour development partners to stay involved with us in \nthis long-term effort. \n We in Sri Lanka see the United Nations as \nindispensable in creating a just and secure world order. \nWe, the 192 Members of the United Nations, must \ncontinue to have faith in our collective capacity to \nreform the United Nations so that it is made more \neffective and more relevant to the needs of its \nMembers in facing the challenges of the twenty-first \ncentury. \n We are pleased with several important measures \nthat have been adopted since the sixtieth session. Given \nmy personal commitment to the promotion of human \nrights at both the local and international level, the \nestablishment of the Human Rights Council, with \nenhanced status and capacity to promote and protect \nhuman rights worldwide, is a cause for delight. I am \nhappy that Sri Lanka was elected to the Council last \nMay. In honouring a pledge made during the \npresidential election last year, we have already started \nwork on crafting a human rights charter in Sri Lanka. \nConsistent with our goal of safeguarding human rights, \nmy Government will establish an international panel to \nobserve investigations into certain alleged human \nrights violations that my Government has already \ncondemned. \n The establishment of the Peacebuilding \nCommission is another important landmark \nachievement of the United Nations this year. We are \npleased that Sri Lanka has been elected to its \norganizing Committee as a founder member of that \nimportant body. The needs and concerns of those \naffected, the specific theatres of conflict, and the \nrealities on the ground of each specific situation must \nnecessarily be taken into account in the Commission\u2019s \nwork. \n We are also encouraged by the general agreement \nthat the Security Council must be strengthened, as it \ndoes not reflect current geopolitical realities. We \ntherefore look forward to the continuation of work \ntowards Security Council reform, towards making its \ncomposition more representative and its decision-\nmaking more democratic. It is essential that the \nSecurity Council reflect the current geopolitical \nrealities in Asia, Africa and Latin America. \n For long years now, on the basis of our \ncommitment to human rights and dignity, we have had \na lasting interest in seeing the emergence of peace in \nthe Middle East. Recognition of the rights of the \nPalestinian people is of concern to me and to my \ncountry. Many Sri Lankans have in recent years made \nthe Middle East their temporary home. We are pained \nby the recent escalation of violence in that region and \nthe devastation in Lebanon. It is our sincere hope that \nSecurity Council resolution 1701 (2006) will pave the \nway for peace and security for Lebanon and the region. \n The Preamble to the Charter requires that we \n\u201cunite our strength to maintain international peace and \nsecurity\u201d. Let us all, Members of the United Nations, \nfocus sharply on this commitment. Let us dedicate \nourselves to its realization and let us mobilize our \ncollective energies towards the achievement of peace \nand security worldwide. \n Let us make peace the goal of the present decade. \nLet us all unite for peace. May all living beings be free \n  \n \n06-52879 10 \n \nof suffering, be healthy and be prosperous. May the \nblessings of the Noble Triple Gem be with you all. "

        "file_text": "First, I would \nlike to pay tribute to the work of the Secretary-General. \nA former British Minister once said of the NATO \nSecretary General that he should be more of a secretary \nand less of a general. Kofi Annan has been more of \neverything: more of a diplomat, more of a reformer and \nmore of a moral voice of leadership in the world. \n In a world shattered by conflict, the founders of \nthe United Nations saw that only by coming together, \nunited in support of larger freedom, could we build our \nshared future. Today, when the world\u2019s nations are \neven more interdependent than they were in 1945, what \ndoes it mean to stand, as they intended, united? At one \nlevel it means taking action when things go wrong, \nwhere there is an actual breakdown of security or a \ndescent into violence or chaos. Today in particular, the \nUnited Nations faces the challenges posed by multiple \nupheavals and crises across the world. \n In the Middle East the United Nations is playing \na vital role in establishing stability in southern \nLebanon. Troops from the European Union are \ndeploying alongside those from the Middle East, Asia \nand Africa. All Member States must meet their \nobligations under Security Council resolutions 1701 \n(2006), 1559 (2004) and 1680 (2006), if we are to \nenable Lebanon to be the proud, democratic and \ndiverse nation that its people want it to be. \n But we are all aware that this most recent conflict \nin Lebanon had its roots in the continuing failure to \nachieve a just solution to the Palestinian question. That \nis why the United Kingdom has consistently argued \nthat there can be no higher priority than reinvigorating \nthe Middle East peace process. \n In Iraq, Prime Minister Al-Maliki\u2019s national \nreconciliation plan can help leaders from all \ncommunities come together. At this crucial juncture, \nwe must all intensify our support. The International \nCompact provides the right vehicle. It allows the Iraqi \nGovernment to set its own vision and shows us how we \ncan help turn that vision into a reality. \n In Afghanistan, real progress has been made, with \nthe United Nations taking a leading role in \ncoordinating the international effort. But real \nchallenges still lie ahead. NATO\u2019s task of securing the \nsouth of the country is far from easy. Soldiers from \nmany NATO countries, not least my own, have given \ntheir lives to provide a better future for the people of \nAfghanistan. The Afghan Government and people, too, \nwant security, development and good governance. The \nUnited Kingdom and the international community are \ndetermined to help them to achieve them. \n We must show a similar shared determination in \nurging the Government of Iran to address international \nconcerns over its nuclear ambitions and its support for \nterrorism. The proposals put forward by Britain, France \nand Germany with China, Russia and the United States \noffer a path for the Iranian Government to develop a \nmore constructive relationship with the rest of the \nworld and give Iran\u2019s talented population the \nopportunities and prosperity that is their right, \nincluding, if they wish, a modern nuclear power \nindustry. We want to be able to resume negotiations. \n  \n \n06-53317 20 \n \nIran knows what is required, and that the alternative is \nincreasing isolation. \n Darfur remains in crisis. I pay tribute to the \nefforts of the African Union and its peacekeepers. \nWednesday\u2019s decision to extend their mandate averted \na security vacuum. We must now strengthen the force \nof the African Union Mission in the Sudan. But it can \nonly be a temporary reprieve. We also need action \nimmediately on the political and humanitarian front. \nThose who have not signed the Darfur Peace \nAgreement must do so. Those who have must abide by \nits provisions. \n To underpin that Agreement, we urgently need a \ngreatly strengthened international presence on the \nground, with the active engagement and support of \nAsian and Muslim, as well as African, countries. That \nis why the Security Council authorized the deployment \nof United Nations peacekeepers to Darfur. I urge \nPresident Bashir to extend the Sudan\u2019s relations with \nthe United Nations in a common purpose to bring \nlasting peace and genuine stability to the whole of the \nSudan. It is, above all, his responsibility. \n The security challenges the world faces are real. \nAs an international community we must deal with \nthem. But standing united also requires us to take up a \nsecond, deeper level of global responsibility, namely, \ntackling the underlying problems that promote conflict \nand underdevelopment. We must strive to promote \nsound global values and to build multilateral systems \nwithin which nations and individuals can cooperate, \nco-exist and each achieve their potential. \n Many representatives to the Assembly have \nalready spoken of the need to accelerate progress \ntowards the achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. Progress on those Goals is a moral \nimperative rooted in a concern for, and an \nunderstanding of, our common humanity. But it is also \na political imperative, because there will be no stability \nand security in our global community while so many \nmillions of men, women and children in that \ncommunity face only a life of hunger, poverty, \ninequality and disease. \n The same is true for those whose lives are \nshattered by conflict or blighted by injustice. The \nPeacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights \nCouncil are new structures that give us new \nopportunities and new impetus. At the same time, we \nmust see a step change in efforts towards an \ninternational arms trade treaty that will end the \nirresponsible transfer of arms that fuel conflict and \nfacilitate the abuse of human rights. That is why the \nUnited Kingdom, with six other countries, will \nintroduce a draft resolution in the First Committee to \nestablish a process to work towards a legally binding \ntreaty on the trade in all conventional arms. \n Collectively, we have a responsibility to protect \nhuman life and a duty to defend the international \ninstitutions that help us as a community to achieve that \ngoal. The answers lie not in division or in personal \nattacks, but in the earnest and consistent pursuit of \njustice and peace.  \n Our collective responsibility to each other is \nnowhere more evident than in the huge challenge posed \nby climate change. The British Prime Minister, Tony \nBlair, made climate change one of our two G8 \npriorities last year, alongside poverty reduction in \nAfrica. When the Prime Minister appointed me as his \nForeign Secretary, in May, he specifically charged me \nwith putting climate security at the heart of our foreign \npolicy. We will not solve that problem if we do not \neach assume our share of the responsibility for tackling \nit. Nobody can protect themselves from climate change \nunless we protect each other by building a global basis \nfor climate security. That goes to the heart of the \nUnited Nations mission, and the United Nations must \nbe at the heart of the solution. \n To put it starkly, if we all try to freeride, we will \nall end up in free fall, with accelerating climate change \nthe result of our collective failure to respond in time to \nthat shared threat that faces us all. Look just at the \ndanger posed by rising sea levels. Potentially, that \ncould cause massive damage to some of the key urban \ncentres of our global civilization. London, Shanghai, \nDhaka, Singapore, Amsterdam, Cairo and, yes, \nManhattan are all at risk. That is why we must all \u2014 as \nforeign ministers, heads of Government and heads of \nState \u2014 be ready to do more, and do it more quickly. \nOur climate presents us with an ever-growing threat to \ninternational security. Dealing with climate change, by \nboth adapting to what is now inevitable and acting to \navert still greater damage, is no longer a choice, it is an \nimperative. \n We need common commitment and genuine \naction. We must all be ready to find a way to get the \nagenda moving beyond Kyoto. The Gleneagles \ndialogue meeting in Mexico at the beginning of \n \n \n21 06-53317 \n \nOctober will be one such opportunity, a chance for \ndeveloped and developing countries to work together \non that shared problem.  \n If we do not act now, an unstable climate will \nundermine our progress in all those other areas that \nmatter to us, not least the Millennium Development \nGoals themselves. Take one of the most basic needs of \nall, water. Already perhaps two fifths of the world\u2019s \npopulation finds it hard to get the water they need. At \nthe same time, many in the world rely on affordable \nenergy to help lift themselves out of poverty \u2014 and, \nindeed, perhaps to give them access to that water. But \nthere is a dilemma: if we provide affordable energy by \nburning fossil fuels, we accelerate climate change. That \nmeans further disrupting water supplies. For some \npeople who now have plenty of water it will mean new \nshortages. For those who already have little, it will \nmean less. In turn, everywhere less water means less \nfood. \n Let me give a specific example of that dilemma. \nThe whole world, as well as the Chinese people, is \nbenefiting from the great success of the Chinese \neconomy. No one in China or elsewhere wants that \ngrowth to stop. But it is based, in China as elsewhere, \non a rapidly increasing use of the fossil fuels that are \ncreating climate change. Yet China is a country already \nvulnerable to climate change. The Chinese Government \nknows that as the Himalayan glaciers melt and \nagricultural land shrinks, crop yields will fall, fresh \nwater will become more scarce and the economy itself \nwill suffer, and with it the world\u2019s economy. \n All the nations of the Arctic Circle are being, and \nwill be, affected by melting permafrost, with \ndisruptions to infrastructure and to investment. The \nVice-President of Palau has just given us a vivid \ndescription of what the environment means for his \nnation. We all share, to a greater or lesser extent, that \nsame dilemma. If we do not act on climate change, we \nrisk undermining the very basis of the prosperity and \nsecurity we are seeking to achieve. That is why we \nmust recognize that talk of having either a successful \neconomy or a stable climate is a false choice. We must \nwork together to find paths for economic growth that \nwill protect our climate. The truth is that we already \nhave much of the technology we need to move to a \nlow-carbon economy. But we must now deploy it very \nmuch more rapidly. What we do in the next 10 years \nwill count the most.  \n The former chief economist of the World Bank, \nSir Nicholas Stern, will shortly publish one of the most \nsignificant and wide-reaching analyses so far of the \neconomic impacts of climate change itself. One of the \nkey emerging findings of his work is that while it will \nnot cost the Earth to solve climate change, it will cost \nthe Earth, literally as well as financially, if we do not. \n Moreover, if we learn to tackle climate change \ntogether, we have an opportunity to build trust between \nnations and to strengthen the multilateral system. But if \nwe get it wrong, that trust will be further eroded. It is \nthe developed, rich world that bears a large \nresponsibility for the present level of greenhouse gas \nemissions, but it is the poorest in our global \ncommunity \u2014 those least able to bear it \u2014 who will \nbear the brunt of climate insecurity. We all need to do \nmore. But the rich world should of course continue to \nlead the effort, applying the principle of common but \ndifferentiated responsibility, which must continue to be \nour guide. In the joint endeavour which the United \nNations represents there can be no more stark or more \nurgent warning than that. "

        "file_text": "Allow me first of all to \nalign myself with the very warm congratulations \naddressed to you, Madam President, on your election to \nyour very important position. I would like to assure \nyou once again of the full support of my country in \nyour endeavours for further reform of our Organization \nand for the consolidation of its role in the coming year. \nI would also like to express our gratitude to the \nprevious President of the General Assembly, Mr. Jan \nEliasson, for his dedicated and efficient work and for \nthe achievements that were made in implementing \nUnited Nations reforms. \n I would also like to greet the newest member of \nour large family, the Republic of Montenegro. I am \nsure that that country from our region, South-East \nEurope, will spare no effort in contributing to the work \nof the United Nations. \n(spoke in French) \n Bulgaria is on the threshold of a historic \nachievement. After 17 years of reforms to build \npolitical democracy and a market economy, my country \nis preparing to join the European Union (EU) on \n1 January 2007. Our journey, although difficult, has \nbeen successful. I am certain that, as a new member of \nthe Union, Bulgaria will contribute added value to the \nEuropean Common Foreign and Security Policy. We \nwill work with even greater determination for a strong \nand effective United Nations, which must be at the \nvery centre of the global security and development \nsystem. Bulgaria endorses the position set out earlier \nby the Finnish presidency of the EU. \n We welcome the fact that concrete outcomes have \nbeen achieved in implementation of the radical reform \nprocess launched at last year\u2019s World Summit. We hope \nthat that the momentum will be maintained and that the \nprocess, which is necessary and useful for all Member \ncountries, will move forward even more quickly. \n I would like to express our profound respect and \ngratitude to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for \nhis tireless efforts throughout the past decade to \nstrengthen the United Nations in a globalized world. \n I would like to refer to the resolution that was \nrecently adopted on the revitalization of the work of \nthe General Assembly. The implementation of the \nresolution should lead to enhanced coordination of the \nwork of the General Assembly, the Security Council \nand the Economic and Social Council, and to a \nstrengthened role for the President of the General \nAssembly, a streamlined agenda and improved methods \nof work. \n No United Nations reform effort would be \ncomplete without the crucial element of Security \nCouncil reform. Despite all the efforts made, we have \nnot yet been able to reach consensus on a viable \nformula for Council expansion that can be supported \nby all Member States. Bulgaria believes that any \nreform exercise should increase the representativity \nand legitimacy of the Council, while preserving the \neffectiveness of its decisions and its key role in \nmaintaining peace and security. We also support efforts \nto improve its working methods. \n At the level of institutional reform, two new \nUnited Nations bodies have been established: the \nPeacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights \nCouncil. Their potential will be realized in the future. \nThere are certain areas, however, where the desired \nprogress is far from being achieved: mandate review, \nthe strengthening of the Economic and Social Council, \n \n \n17 06-53323 \n \nensuring effective management and promoting \ncoordination among the agencies and bodies of the \nUnited Nations system. Despite the challenges, our \nwork must continue at an accelerated pace with a view \nto the achievement of concrete results during this \nsession. \n I would like to point out that yesterday Bulgaria \ndeposited its instruments of ratification relating to the \nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of \nDiscrimination against Women and the United Nations \nConvention against Corruption. We also attach great \nimportance to combating the traffic in human beings \nand drugs, as well as to the fight against organized \ncrime. \n Five years on from 11 September 2001, terrorism \nin all its manifestations continues to pose a genuine \nthreat to human civilization. That is why Bulgaria \nwelcomes the launching of the United Nations Global \nCounter-Terrorism Strategy to fight that scourge at all \nlevels. The consensus that has emerged regarding the \nStrategy must give impetus to the process of adopting a \ncomprehensive international convention on terrorism, \nin accordance with the decisions taken at the 2005 \nWorld Summit. Such a convention would provide the \ninternational community with an effective, \ncomprehensive, universal legal framework for the fight \nagainst that scourge and give substance to its firm \ncondemnation of terrorism in all its forms and \nmanifestations. \n Bulgaria supports all initiatives to promote \ndialogue and mutual understanding among people of \ndifferent religions, ethnic groups and cultures. \nBulgarian history and our national experience have \nalways been characterized by dialogue and tolerance. \nIn this context, we look forward to the \nrecommendations of the High-Level Panel of the \nAlliance of Civilizations, and we will take part in their \nimplementation. \n Bulgaria pursues a policy aimed at promoting \neffective arms control, the non-proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction and disarmament. We are \nconcerned about the genuine threat of destabilization \naffecting legal instruments currently in force, in \nparticular the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons (NPT), because of non-compliance \nwith obligations and unilateral withdrawals by certain \nStates.  \n We support the entry into force of the \nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We firmly \nbelieve that the unresolved question of the Iranian \nnuclear programme should be dealt with promptly, on \nthe basis of Security Council resolution 1696 (2006) \nand relevant decisions of the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency. Likewise, we call for the \nimplementation of Security Council resolution 1695 \n(2006) and urge progress in the six-party talks on the \nNorth Korean nuclear problem. \n The United Nations must be endowed with \nsufficient capacity to enable it to deploy \nmultidimensional peacekeeping operations that are \naimed not just at maintaining peace, but also at \nstrengthening the sovereignty of States and building \ndemocratic institutions that will guarantee the stability \nof peace processes. In this context, I would like to \npoint out that yesterday Bulgaria signed the Optional \nProtocol to the Convention on the Security of United \nNations and Associated Personnel. \n As a member of NATO and the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, as a future \nmember of the European Union and as a country that \ncontributes troops to peacekeeping operations, \nBulgaria actively promotes effective partnership and \ncooperation among the United Nations and regional \nand subregional organizations in activities aimed at \nconflict prevention, peacekeeping and peacebuilding. \nCurrent cooperation between the European Union, the \nUnited Nations and the African Union is an \nencouraging example of such cooperation, which is \nalready bearing fruit. \n My country is actively contributing to long-term \nsecurity and stability in South-East Europe. We \nwelcome the fact that the Balkans are now seen as a \nregion, not of crisis and conflict, but of cooperation \nand integration. One convincing example of political \ncooperation among the countries of that region is the \nSouth-East Europe Cooperation Process. Bulgaria is \npreparing to assume the chairmanship of that Process \nin mid-2007, and we will work tirelessly to ensure that \nthat structure can support regional cooperation and \npromote European and Euro-Atlantic integration in that \npart of Europe. \n In addressing our geographic region, I cannot \noverlook the problem of Kosovo. Reaching a decision \non the future status of that province is on the agenda of \nthe international community. Bulgaria is playing a very \n  \n \n06-53323 18 \n \nactive role in efforts aimed at creating the atmosphere \nof trust and openness necessary for the holding of such \nnegotiations. We fully support the Special Envoy of the \nSecretary-General, Mr. Martti Ahtisaari, in his efforts \nto find a solution, based on the maximum amount of \ncommon ground, to which both parties could agree. We \ncall on the international community to let itself be \nguided by the principles of sustainability, monitoring, \nregional stability and the European perspective in \nworking out a final decision on the status of Kosovo. \n Bulgaria attaches particular importance to the \nsituation in the Middle East. We welcome and support \nthe efforts of the Secretary-General and the Security \nCouncil, as well as the key role being played by the \nEuropean Union in the expanded United Nations \nInterim Force in Lebanon, which is called on to ensure \npeace in southern Lebanon in implementation of \nSecurity Council resolution 1701 (2006). Bulgaria will \nmake its own contribution to the international \ncommunity\u2019s efforts to bring about lasting peace. \n We remain convinced that the crisis in Israeli-\nPalestinian relations would be best resolved by direct \nnegotiations between the countries concerned, based on \nan absolute rejection of the use of force and with the \nnecessary support of the international community. We \nsupport all of the efforts to that end on the part of the \nQuartet, as presented yesterday here at the United \nNations. \n Bulgaria greatly appreciates United Nations \ninitiatives relating to the stabilization of the political \nand constitutional process in Iraq, as well as the \nprinciples set out in the International Compact. We will \ncontinue to meet our obligations in Iraq in support of \nnational institutions aimed at providing for the security \nand prosperity of that country. \n We support all positive trends towards \nstrengthening the sovereignty of Afghanistan. During \nthe past year, my country doubled its participation in \nthe International Security Assistance Force. We support \nthe Afghanistan Compact adopted at the London \nConference a few months ago.  \n We welcome the adoption of Security Council \nresolution 1706 (2006), whose implementation will \nassist in the implementation of the political agreements \nrecently reached on the Sudan. In our view, the \ninternational community must take urgent action to \naddress the humanitarian tragedy in Darfur. \n Bulgaria, with more than 50 years\u2019 experience as \nan active and responsible Member of our Organization, \nand which has served three terms in the Security \nCouncil and held the presidency of the General \nAssembly for one year, has submitted its candidacy to \nthe Economic and Social Council for the period 2007-\n2009. I am convinced that our country\u2019s experience and \nexpertise, as well as its commitment to contribute to \nstrengthening the effectiveness of the United Nations, \nare important reasons to support our candidacy. \n(spoke in English) \n We are witnessing and also taking an active part \nin the implementation of the most important reform \nsince the United Nations was founded. Today more \nthan ever before, the peoples of the world need our \nOrganization to help establish long-lasting peace, \nprosperity and a better future for new generations. We \nmust succeed in reforming the United Nations so that it \ncan change the world for the better. "

        "file_text": "The sixty-first session of the \nGeneral Assembly has begun its work in quite a \ndisturbing context. We note the persistence of certain \nconflicts and the emergence of new hot spots of \ntension, which are serious threats to international peace \nand stability. World poverty and hunger have not \ndecreased, despite the enormous efforts of our \ncountries to improve the living conditions of our \npopulations. In fact, we note a deterioration in the \nsocial and health conditions of millions of people as a \nresult of endemic diseases such as HIV/AIDS, \ntuberculosis and malaria, particularly on the African \ncontinent.  \n The political, economic, financial, social and \nenvironmental problems facing the world are assuming \nincreasingly alarming proportions. That requires \nconcerted efforts on the part of the entire international \ncommunity. Therefore, we must work together to \nstrengthen the existing multilateral system and the \ncapacity of the United Nations to act in order to \naddress those challenges more effectively. \n Our people expect concrete, swift and effective \nmeasures from the Organization, involving the \nestablishment of modern and efficient operational \nstructures. In short, reforms within the United Nations \nsystem are necessary and urgent.  \n It is in that context that, on behalf of my country, \nGuinea-Bissau, which it is my honour to represent, I \nwarmly congratulate you, Madam, on your election as \nPresident of the General Assembly at the present \nsession. We believe that your many qualities and your \nlong experience are guarantees of the success of our \nwork. Under your guidance, we will experience a new \ndynamism capable of promoting joint efforts for peace. \nI would like to assure you of the availability and full \ncooperation of our delegation in contributing to the \nachievement of the our common goals.  \n Allow me to congratulate your predecessor as \nwell, Mr. Jan Eliasson, for his dedication to the cause \nof our Organization and for the important results \nachieved during the sixtieth session. I reference in \nparticular to the creation of the Human Rights Council \nand the Peacebuilding Commission, of which my \ncountry is a member.  \n We recently participated in the fourteenth Summit \nof the Non-Aligned Movement in Havana, where a \nlarge number of world leaders gathered. Those eminent \npersonalities, including the head of State of Guinea-\nBissau, considered the world\u2019s problems, the \nseriousness of which calls to us all and demands of us \nconcerted and collective actions. The conclusions \nreached at the Summit, as well as the initiatives we \nintend to undertake on behalf of our Movement, are in \nline, to a large extent, with the opinions, \nrecommendations and solutions set out by the \nSecretary-General in his annual report on the work of \nthe Organization, delivered during a brilliant speech to \nthe Assembly.  \n None today can doubt the seriousness of the \nsituation in the Middle East, particularly in Lebanon. It \nis the same with regard to the tragic conditions in \nwhich millions of our African brothers live in Darfur. It \nis clear that we can no longer accept the systematic \nviolation of international norms. Nor can we \nunderstand why we are incapable of taking concerted, \nnegotiated and responsible measures to put an end to a \ntragic situation that threatens the lives of innocent and \nvulnerable people. Our brothers in Darfur have the \nright to the compassion and solidarity of Africa in \nparticular, and of the international community as a \nwhole.  \n If current trends in the world continue, poor \ncountries will not be able to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by 2015. The reforms that \nare planned or that have already been introduced into \nour systems of governance, respect for the rules of \ndemocracy and respect for human rights are, \n  \n \n06-53341 30 \n \nunfortunately, insufficient to achieve the rates of \ngrowth essential to relaunch our economies. \n In our countries, the economic and financial \nsituation depends on internal and external factors that \nwe do not control. Protectionist measures and subsidies \nfor agricultural products such as cotton, sugar and \nwheat seriously compromise the competitive capacity \nof our farmers. The absence of an agreement on the \nrules that should govern international trade and the \nlack of political will and of progress in the negotiations \nwithin the World Trade Organization are aggravating \nfactors. \n We need to recognize that we are far from \nachieving the objectives set out in the Monterrey \nConsensus and Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, \nwhich concern developing countries, particularly the \nleast developed countries. We also feel the imbalance \nin the globalization process. These are serious \nobstacles to our development. The midterm review for \nthe Brussels Programme of Action for the Least \nDeveloped Countries for the Decade 2001-2010 has \nindeed shed new light on the shortcomings and on the \nstill-insufficient level of development assistance. In \nthis environment, our efforts to eliminate poverty and \ncreate better living conditions within our countries are \nat risk.  \n A large part of our populations, particularly our \nyoung people, are more and more despondent because \nof the very high level of unemployment and lack of \nhope for a better future. Thousands of young people are \nso desperate that they even risk their lives to seek other \nforms of existence, which, unfortunately, often turn out \nto be mirages. The international community must \naccord greater attention to this issue so that we might \nfind the means to ensure the rebirth of hope in the \nhearts of our youth. I am thinking especially of \ncreating professional training centres and promoting \nactivities that generate jobs, thus ensuring more and \nbetter social integration. \n I would also like to stress in this regard the \nimportance of the High-level Meeting on International \nMigration and Development, which for the first time \nmet here at the Headquarters of the United Nations. I \nam convinced that thanks to this type of dialogue and \ncooperation at the international level, we will be better \nequipped to put a brake on illegal immigration and on \norganized crime, to which this tragic phenomenon is \nmore and more linked.  \n Guinea-Bissau, with a considerable number of \ncitizens living abroad, pays particular attention to the \nissue of migration. Therefore we welcome the place it \noccupies on the agenda of the international community. \nWe support the relevant recommendations emerging \nfrom the High-level Dialogue on Migration and \nDevelopment that took place here in New York, two \nweeks ago. We are aware of the role played by our \ndiaspora in the economy of developing countries, \nthanks to remittances and other forms of contributions. \nMy country is committed to developing an appropriate \nnational policy on this issue in cooperation with our \ndevelopment partners, especially with the countries of \ndestination.  \n On 17 July Guinea-Bissau hosted the sixteenth \nConference of the Heads of State Community of \nPortuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP). The heads of \nState of our community reaffirmed their determination \nto step up efforts to eradicate hunger and poverty. They \nalso committed themselves to undertaking concrete \nmeasures to mobilize internal and external resources \nfor the achievement of the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) by 2015. The consolidation of \ndemocracy, the rule of law and human rights issues \nwere also subjects of particular attention for these \nleaders. They are indispensable preconditions for \ninternational peace and security. The heads of State \nalso decided to strengthen relations between the CPLP \nand the United Nations and its specialized agencies in \norder to establish an effective partnership.  \n Allow me in this respect to thank, on behalf of \nthe CPLP, all our partners for the important assistance \nthey have given to the weakest members of our \ncommunity. I would also like to appeal to our \ndevelopment partners in general and to the Group of \nEight countries in particular, requesting that they assist \nus in addressing the critical issue of external debt \nburden. \n One year after elections in Guinea-Bissau, which \nconfirmed the return to constitutional normality in my \ncountry, I should like to reiterate here the commitment \nof the people, Government and especially that of \nMr. Jo\u00e3o Bernardo Vieira, President of Guinea-Bissau, \nto spare no effort in consolidating peace and \nestablishing political stability and national \nreconciliation. Significant progress has been made in \nthis area. It must, however, be stressed that the \ncomplexity of the current reforms, especially within \nthe defence and security forces, requires lasting and \n \n \n31 06-53341 \n \nsubstantial support from the international community, \ngiven the lack of resources available to us.  \n I would like to express our appreciation to all our \npartners, especially our brothers in the Economic \nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) and the \nCommunity of Portuguese Language Countries \n(CPLP), for their support and the creation of the \nInternational Contact Group on Guinea-Bissau, whose \nfirst meeting was held here at the United Nations \nHeadquarters last week. I would also like to take this \nopportunity to reaffirm that my country will spare no \neffort to continue to deserve your confidence and \nsolidarity. Nonetheless, it must be stressed that, despite \nour willingness and determination, Guinea-Bissau \nneeds your urgent assistance in order to implement the \nmeasures contained in the national poverty reduction \nstrategy paper. Just adopted by our Government, that \ndocument will serve as the basis for preparing a \nroundtable on Guinea-Bissau planned for next \nNovember at Geneva. It is a pleasure to invite all our \ntraditional partners and others here present to take part \nin that roundtable, which will, indeed, be an event of \ngreat importance for stimulating our economy and for \nraising the living conditions of our people.  \n Today\u2019s world is a genuine global village. \nMankind\u2019s progress in science, information technology, \ncommunications and transportation means that the \ndestinies of our peoples are more and more \ninterdependent. That is why we must combine our \nefforts to eradicate poverty and hunger in the world \nand to deal with endemic diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, \nand to put an end to injustices, violations of human \nrights and all forms of discrimination and intolerance. \n When we discuss the issues of development and \ncombating poverty, we must resist the temptation of \ntaking the easy way and applying simplistic solutions. \nEconomic and social development and its corollary, the \neradication of poverty, require deep thought and \ncourageous measures. No phenomenon can be \nexplained simplistically, and there is no simple \nuniversal recipe. The signs of the times must be \ncorrectly interpreted. Peoples\u2019 opinions, their culture, \ntheir religious practices and their concerns must all be \nunderstood and respected. We must find new ways of \nreorganizing and strengthening democratic States by \ngiving priority to education and training. We must also \nthink about the need to increase our collective capacity \nto combat terrorism and to deal with all forms of \nextremism through permanent dialogue between \ncultures and civilizations. \n It is incomprehensible, and even less acceptable, \nthat human beings are abandoned and condemned to \ndie under the indifferent regard of the international \ncommunity. International solidarity towards vulnerable \npopulations must not be delayed or be given under post \nmortem conditions. The international community must \ndemonstrate vigilance and be capable of preventing all \nhumanitarian catastrophes resulting from conflicts, as \nthe Secretary-General rightly recalled, in the name of a \nuniversal conscience. It is precisely because of the \nuniversal nature of the responsibility of our \nOrganization that Guinea-Bissau will spare no effort in \norder to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations \nthrough concerted, pragmatic and efficient reforms. In \nfact, the effectiveness of our Organization would be \neven greater with the full participation of all Member \nStates with a view to enhancing our multilateral \ninstitution, which needs greater democracy and \ntransparency in fulfilling its mandate. \n More than sixty years after its founding, the \nUnited Nations must adapt to the changes that have \ntaken place in the world in order to take into account \nthe existence and the emergence of new players on the \nworld stage whose contribution to peacekeeping and \ninternational security are becoming more and more \nimportant. Among those States are countries in Africa, \nAsia and Latin America, which can legitimately lay \nclaim to a permanent seat on the Security Council. \nDeveloping countries in Africa, Asia and Latin \nAmerica have the right to greater participation and \nprominence on the Security Council. \n Ten years ago, we elected Kofi Annan, an \noutstanding son of Africa, to guide the destiny of our \nOrganization. As we assess his tenure, it is with pride \nand satisfaction that we note the achievements during \nhis term of office. Recent years have not been easy, \nbecause the world is confronting new and longstanding \nchallenges in various forms and scales and for which \nour Organization was insufficiently designed and \nprepared. On behalf of Guinea-Bissau, the President of \nGuinea-Bissau, Jo\u00e3o Bernardo Vieira, and our \nGovernment, I would like to add our voice to the \nvibrant tribute paid by the entire international \ncommunity to the Secretary-General. I would also like \nto express the gratitude of our people to him for the \ncontribution of the United Nations system in promoting \n  \n \n06-53341 32 \n \npeace, political stability and development in our \ncountry. \n The great challenges of the new millennium will \ndetermine the development work facing us and the \ncapacity of people to resolve, as quickly as possible, \nproblems of peace, political stability, national \nreconciliation and social justice. All States and civil \nsociety must be able to count upon, whenever required, \nthe transparent and democratic functioning of the \nUnited Nations system for the defence of their rights, \nin a perspective that creates consensus and which is \ncompatible with human development, namely \ncompatible with the well-being of humanity. \n As the General Assembly prepares to select a \nsuccessor to Mr. Kofi Annan, it will, I am convinced, \nbe able to elect a Secretary-General with the essential \nattributes of skill, experience and dedication for \npromoting better understanding between peoples and \nnations of this world. \n The determination and leadership of the next \nSecretary-General will also be necessary in order to \nestablish synergy and international cooperation so as to \ntransform the United Nations into a unique and \nirreplaceable instrument that can strengthen \nmultilateralism in favour of development, of improved \nconservation of our planet and of international peace \nand security.

        "file_text": "I \nwish to begin by congratulating you, Madam President, \non your election as President of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-first session. I am confident that, under your \nguidance, this session will achieve full success. I also \nwish to pay tribute to Mr. Jan Eliasson, President of the \nlast session, and to Secretary-General Kofi Annan. I \nwould also like to take this opportunity to congratulate \nthe Republic of Montenegro on becoming a Member of \nthe United Nations. \n The world is experiencing profound and complex \nchanges. Peace, development and cooperation have \nbecome trends of our times and represent the common \naspirations of all countries and peoples in the world. \nHowever, the world is not tranquil and the issue of \ndevelopment remains prominent. There is still a long \nway to go in the pursuit of durable peace and common \ndevelopment. Recently, the nuclear issue on the Korean \nPeninsula, the Iranian nuclear issue and the Lebanese-\nIsraeli conflict have flared up, adversely affecting \nregional and global stability and testing the wisdom, \nunity and patience of the international community. \n  \n \n06-53317 22 \n \n To maintain peace is the shared mission of the \nentire international community. Consultations based on \nequality and peaceful negotiations are the only \neffective means to resolve disputes. China, as a \npermanent member of the Security Council and a \nmember of the international community, will continue \nto make every effort to achieve a peaceful resolution of \nhotspot issues. \n As regards the nuclear issue on the Korean \nPeninsula, China is committed to maintaining peace \nand stability on the Peninsula, making it free of nuclear \nweapons and promoting the six-party talks. During the \nSecurity Council\u2019s deliberations in July regarding the \nmissile tests by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea and the related resolution, China made strenuous \nefforts to engage the parties concerned, in an effort to \nmaintain peace on the Peninsula and in North-East Asia \nand preserve the unity and authority of the Security \nCouncil and safeguard the progress already made in the \nsix-party talks. \n Long-standing antagonism and mistrust between \nthe parties concerned is the main cause of the current \ndifficulty. All parties should be patient and pragmatic \nand act with vision to reduce differences and remove \nobstacles through dialogue. The six-party talks remain \nan effective mechanism to enhance understanding and \ntrust and resolve the Korean nuclear issue. We hope \nthat the parties involved will be cool-headed and more \nflexible, expand common ground, meet each other \nhalfway and work together for the early resumption of \nthe six-party talks and progressive implementation of \nthe joint statement. That is the only viable solution to \nthe Korean nuclear issue. \n With respect to the Iranian nuclear issue, China \ncalls for upholding the integrity of the international \nnuclear non-proliferation regime, and is opposed to the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons. It has worked for a \npeaceful resolution of the issue in order to promote \npeace and stability in the Middle East. At the same \ntime, the legitimate right of countries to the peaceful \nuse of nuclear energy should be fully respected, \nprovided they fulfil their relevant international \nobligations. \n Diplomatic negotiation represents the best chance \nto resolve the Iranian nuclear issue and serve the \ninterests of all parties. China hopes that the parties \ninvolved will exercise patience and restraint, continue \nto take a flexible approach and remain committed to \nthe right course of pursuing a peaceful resolution. \nChina will continue to play a constructive role in \nworking for an appropriate settlement of the Iranian \nnuclear issue. \n As regards the Lebanese-Israeli conflict, China \nopposes any move that will undermine peace and \nstability in the region, and calls for a comprehensive \ncessation of hostilities. China welcomes Security \nCouncil resolution 1701 (2006) and hopes that it will \nbe strictly observed. China hopes that the parties \nconcerned will reach an early agreement on a \nframework of political settlement that is both just and \ndurable. \n The question of Palestine is at the core of the \nMiddle East issue. The peace process should be re-\nstarted in keeping with the relevant resolutions of the \nUnited Nations and the principle of land for peace, in \nthe interest of reaching an early and comprehensive \nsettlement of the Middle East issue, including the \nPalestinian-Israeli conflict, so that the countries \ninvolved can live in harmony and the region can enjoy \ndurable peace. \n The United Nations has played an instrumental \nrole in resolving regional flashpoints this year. But the \nOrganization also faces major challenges. In the new \ninternational environment, to enhance its role through \nreform is in the common interest of humankind. The \nUnited Nations needs to take resolute steps in carrying \nout reform. The United Nations should develop in a \nway that promotes the purposes and principles of its \nCharter, upholds the unity and cooperation of the \nOrganization and serves the collective interests of its \nMembers. The reform of the United Nations should be \ncomprehensive in coverage, and progress should be \nmade in security, development, human rights and other \nfields. More should be done to promote development \nand facilitate the realization of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. The reform of the Organization \nshould, as far as possible, satisfy the needs of its \nMember States, particularly those from the developing \nworld. The reform should be a democratic process and \nfull consultations should be conducted to reach \nwidespread consensus. Major controversial issues \nshould be handled with caution and dealt with through \nin-depth consultations. \n China welcomes the progress made in reforming \nthe United Nations, in particular the progress in \nimplementing the World Summit Outcome. We will \n \n \n23 06-53317 \n \npledge $3 million to the United Nations Peacebuilding \nFund. We will continue to work with other countries to \nmake progress in the reform of the United Nations, \nstrengthen the unity and authority of the Organization \nand increase its efficiency and capacity to respond to \nchallenges. \n As the chief administrator of the United Nations, \nthe Secretary-General has an important role to play. In \nthe election of the next Secretary-General, China will \nfirmly support an Asian candidate. We are convinced \nthat Asia can produce a competent and well-respected \nSecretary-General acceptable to all Member States. \n The scale of assessments for the apportionment of \nthe expenses of the United Nations involves the \ninterests of all Member States and constitutes the \nfinancial foundation of the Organization. All Member \nStates have an obligation to pay their assessments on \ntime and in full. The ability to pay is the basic \nprinciple governing the scale of assessments. It should \nbe adhered to, as it has proved effective and represents \nthe general consensus of Member States. Over the \nyears, China has honoured its financial obligations in \ngood faith and has made appropriate contributions to \nthe budget of the United Nations. As China\u2019s economy \ngrows, we are prepared to increase our contributions to \nthe Organization\u2019s budget in accordance with the \nprinciple of ability to pay. We are ready to take part in \nrelevant discussions in a constructive way, and hope \nthat a fair and equitable formula will be reached on the \nbasis of extensive consultations. \n Without overall development, global peace and \nprogress cannot be sustained. In addition to developing \nthe concept of partnership and improving its \nmodalities, all countries should honour our \ncommitment to the global partnership for development \nset out in the Millennium Declaration, the Monterrey \nConsensus, the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation \nand last year\u2019s World Summit Outcome.  \n Countries should shoulder the primary \nresponsibility for their own development and \nimplement comprehensive development strategies in \nkeeping with the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs). \n The international community \u2014 and developed \ncountries in particular \u2014 should increase development \nassistance, promote international trade, technology \ntransfers and investment, offer more extensive debt \nrelief, provide more support to developing countries \nand respect their ownership of national development \nstrategies. \n The United Nations should play a bigger role in \nthe field of development. It should create a fair and \nequitable framework to assess progress in meeting the \nMDGs and ensure that the United Nations Foundation \nand the various United Nations programmes and \nspecialized agencies provide greater support for \ncapacity-building programmes in developing countries. \nIt should enhance coordination between international \ndevelopment policy and monetary, financial and \ntrading regimes and create an enabling international \nenvironment for developing countries. \n The suspension of the Doha round serves \nnobody\u2019s interests. Members of the World Trade \nOrganization should demonstrate political will, \nspeedily resume the Doha development round and \nwork towards a comprehensive and balanced outcome. \n Non-governmental organizations should be \nencouraged to be more extensively and deeply involved \nin development cooperation. Their efforts and those of \nGovernments should complement each other. \n The establishment of the Human Rights Council \nechoes the calling of our times. Member States have a \ncommon responsibility to make the Council a dynamic \nand effective body. The Council should give greater \nattention to massive and gross violations of human \nrights caused by armed conflicts and should support \nthe international community in its efforts to prevent \nconflicts, restore peace and combat terrorism in all its \nforms and manifestations. \n The Council should attach equal importance to \neconomic, social and cultural rights and encourage the \ninternational community and United Nations agencies \nto take effective measures to support countries in their \nefforts to realize their right to development.  \n The Council should continue to give special \nattention to the rights of women, children, persons with \ndisabilities, migrant workers, ethnic minorities and \nother vulnerable groups to ensure that they enjoy the \nsame level of respect as others. \n The Council should promote dialogue and \ncooperation on an equal footing between countries of \ndifferent social systems and levels of development, \naddress human rights issues properly and reject double \nstandards and politicization. \n  \n \n06-53317 24 \n \n For decades, relations between China and African \ncountries have been characterized by sincerity and \nmutual support. We have conducted our cooperation on \nthe basis of equality and mutual benefit, while \nsafeguarding sovereignty and independence and \npromoting social and economic development in our \nrespective countries. All that has served to bring about \nsignificant benefits for the Chinese and African peoples \nalike. \n China and Africa will hold a summit and the third \nministerial meeting of the Forum on China-Africa \nCooperation in Beijing from 3 to 5 November. \nFocusing on the theme of friendship, peace, \ncooperation and development, Chinese and African \nleaders will discuss ways to establish and foster a new \ntype of strategic partnership featuring political equality \nand mutual trust, win-win economic cooperation and \ncultural exchanges. They will also draft a blueprint to \nenhance China-Africa cooperation. China is committed \nto peaceful development. Africa, which is home to the \nlargest number of developing countries, is committed \nto achieving stability and renewal. Stronger ties \nbetween China and Africa will contribute to South-\nSouth cooperation and international peace and \ndevelopment. \n The conduct of China\u2019s diplomacy aims to \nsafeguard world peace and promote common \ndevelopment. China is committed to developing itself \nthrough safeguarding and promoting world peace \nthrough its own development. We are pursuing \ndevelopment that is peaceful, inclusive, cooperative \nand harmonious in nature. We will endeavour to \npromote the fundamental interests of our own people in \nharmony with the common interests of other peoples \nand to pursue peace, promote development and resolve \ndisputes through cooperation. \n China is dedicated to building a harmonious \nworld. It hopes to increase mutual respect and \nunderstanding with other countries and to live in \nharmony with them. China respects the right of a \ncountry to choose its own path to development. It \nsupports equal participation by different countries in \ninternational affairs and democracy in international \nrelations. It works to enhance mutual benefits, win-win \noutcomes and global prosperity through sharing the \nbenefits of economic globalization and technological \nprogress. China seeks to promote a diversified world \nand advance human civilization by furthering dialogue, \nunderstanding and mutual enrichment between \ndifferent cultures. China is committed to advancing \nhuman progress by enhancing dialogue, building \nmutual trust with other countries and working with \nthem to address global issues. \n China will continue to demonstrate to the world \nthat it is an important force for global peace and \ndevelopment and that the Chinese people will remain \ntrustworthy friends and cooperation partners to the \nworld\u2019s peoples.

        "file_text": "The \ntwenty-first century demands that the world develop a \nnew vision of the concept of international law and of \nrelations among peoples and States. A year ago, \nEcuador raised the need to move towards a new world \norder built on three bases: the economy, international \nlaw and biology. This need has become urgent. We \nsummon the planet to establish this new triad, which \nmust include biology. \n Never before has there been so much wealth. \nPoverty, however, continues to grow, and hunger and \nmisery take their toll of human lives each day. Life on \nEarth is deteriorating. The harmonious continuity of \nhumanity is threatened, and the world \u2014 including the \ndeveloped countries \u2014 has not been able to find an \nadequate answer. There are still vast areas of \nsub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Asia where \nmillions of human beings are on the brink of \nextinction. Vast areas continue to require international \ncooperation. While in Japan, Hong Kong and Iceland, \nlife expectancy at birth exceeds 80 years, in Botswana \nand Lesotho it barely reaches 36 years. While in \nSweden, Singapore, Denmark, Iceland and Norway, the \n  \n \n06-52885 20 \n \nunder-five mortality rate is below 4 per 1,000 live \nbirths, in Sierra Leone, Niger and Liberia it exceeds \n235 per 1,000 live births. We must guarantee greater \nequity in health expenditure throughout the world in \norder to overcome the huge gap between the few \ndollars per capita invested in poor countries and the \nthousands of dollars per capita that are invested in the \ndeveloped world. \n Five years have passed since the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals were proclaimed, and very little \nhas been done to achieve them. The limited compliance \namong the most highly developed countries to \ncontribute 0.7 per cent of gross national income to \nprogress in the poorest areas has had an adverse impact \non this situation. \n Underdevelopment is a global problem; just like \nthe healthy continuity of our species, which is \nthreatened by economic, political and military \nproblems. The least developed countries lack resources \nto improve education and culture \u2014 a requirement for \nensuring collective health. The growing burden of \nforeign debt prevents our people from investing in their \ndevelopment. Underdeveloped countries are still under \nthe yoke of external debt service, which continues to \nabsorb domestic savings and limits the possibilities for \nsocial and productive investment. \n Far from resolving the problem, successive debt \nrefinancing creates further links that lengthen the chain \nshackling development and economic progress, and it \nundermines the ethical foundation and the destiny of \nhumankind. That is why Ecuador supports the initiative \nof the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan to create a group \nof highly indebted lower- and middle-income countries \nthat together would work to find creative and long-\nterm solutions. \n The neediest countries are marginalized from \ninvestment in scientific research and medical \ndiscoveries. \n The phenomenon of migration has taken on \nunprecedented dimensions. More than 200 million \npeople are refugees, living outside their countries of \norigin. Migration causes families to break down and \nresults in cultural deterioration, hampering the \nemergence of future healthy generations and adequate \ncare of the elderly in conditions of dignity. \n Countries must assume binding commitments on \nthe defence of the human rights of migrants. To that \nend, we welcome the High-level Dialogue on \nInternational Migration and Development \u2014 a \nmultidimensional event that reflects the political \nresolve of sending and receiving countries. \n War affects the entire planet. Mortality rates \nincrease not only because of its direct victims, but also \nbecause of the destruction of infrastructure. Ethnic and \nreligious problems, or economic aspirations, lead to \ngenocidal practices. World peace, respect for human \nrights and respect among States are the principles that \nled to the founding of the United Nations. \n Transfixed, the world has witnessed bloodshed \nand brutal acts of violence against peoples as a \nconsequence of the settlement of conflicts through the \nuse of weapons, and of the limited ability of the \ninternational community within the United Nations to \nfind solutions within the framework of the law. \n We support the resolution adopted by the Security \nCouncil \u2014 and the efforts of the Secretary-General \u2014 \nto ensure a commitment by all parties involved to \ncomply with the ceasefire and to withdraw their forces \nto the borders established before the last confrontation. \n The international community and the highest \nmultilateral bodies have been unable to find diplomatic \nmeans of resolving such conflicts swiftly and \neffectively. Thus there needs to be an improvement in \nthe structure of these bodies, including the United \nNations system itself. \n The Security Council is no longer an expression \nof a global balance. Today, it represents only itself. For \nthat reason, it must be reformed and democratized. It is \nunacceptable that, at the dawn of the third millennium, \nthe lives of millions of human beings and of entire \npopulations hinge on the veto of one State or another \nand on a unilateral geopolitical vision. \n The concepts of war and peace are once again at \nthe heart of our reflection on global security and \nsurvival. The security of the planet, of peoples, of \nStates and of nations will be sustainable only if it is \nfounded on health, on education, on development and \non peace. \n Laying the foundations of genuine peace is the \ngreatest moral obligation of all of humankind. The \nalternative is growing insecurity, fuelled by poverty, \nillness, destitution and fear. \n \n \n21 06-52885 \n \n The creation of the Peacebuilding Commission \nand the inception of the Human Rights Council, of \nwhich Ecuador is member, and the reforms that are \nbeing launched in the Secretariat and in the \nadministrative bodies of the United Nations represent \nsignificant steps forward, but they still fall short. \n My country, Ecuador, believes that the reform of \nthe system includes strengthening the World Health \nOrganization, its leadership and its fight against \npoverty and the environmental impact of poverty, in \nthe promotion of local, national and regional initiatives \naimed at implementing a fully decentralized global \nhealth system. That will make possible enable the \ndevelopment of health systems and models capable of \nensuring tangible benefits for all inhabitants of the \nplanet. \n Universal health insurance is a valid strategy to \nguarantee access to a comprehensive health-care \nsystem among developing nations at the same level as \nin developed countries. That would eliminate the \nshameful asymmetry that is reflected in the unbalanced \nhealth statistics that differentiate the various segments \nof our populations. \n In order to implement these and other important \nhealth programmes, considerable financial resources \nmust be mobilized, which must flow from international \ncooperation, but also from developing countries and \nthe so-called donor countries. \n In this century, compliance with the Millennium \nGoals is State policy for the Government of Ecuador. \nFor a multinational, pluricultural and multi-ethnic \ncountry such as Ecuador, ensuring respect for human \nrights means, above all, respect for the other; respect \nfor the development of indigenous peoples, with full \nrecognition of their diversity and of their need to be \nintegrated into the process of modernization, while \npreserving their identity. \n Ecuador welcomes the recent adoption by the \nHuman Rights Council of the Declaration on the Rights \nof Indigenous Peoples and fully supports its adoption \nby the Assembly. \n We reaffirm our commitment to fight crimes of \nthe utmost gravity, such as trafficking in human beings \nand the sexual exploitation of boys and girls. This year \nwe have strengthened our domestic legislation to \npunish such crimes. The Government of Ecuador has \nundertaken economic policy measures to recover \nincome from petroleum operations. That will enable us \nto engage in sustainable and productive social \ninvestment, thus improving living conditions for \nunderprivileged Ecuadorians. As a result of those \nmeasures, for the first time in Ecuador, funds are \navailable for scientific and technological research to \npromote knowledge so that we can be masters of our \nown destiny.  \n Ecuador is committed to strengthening South-\nSouth relations. We attach great importance to regional \nintegration, in particular through the Andean \nCommunity of Nations and the Common Market of the \nSouth, which are key actors in building the South \nAmerican Community of Nations to make progress \ntowards Latin American integration, hemispheric \nintegration and, ultimately, a globalization that has a \nhuman face and is equitable for all.  \n Ecuador promotes all the conditions necessary to \nreach trade agreements with all countries throughout \nthe world, based on principles that respect the \npreservation of sensitive areas of national production, \nensure food security and protect biological diversity \nand genetic data \u2014 that is to say, life.  \n Ecuador has consistently fought narco-trafficking \nand related crimes. That is why we believe that we are \nfully entitled to ask the United States Senate to renew \nthe Andean Trade Preference Act to encourage legal \nproduction and exports.  \n Ecuador endorses the principles that guided the \nestablishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO). \nWe hope that the obstacles faced by the Doha round \nwill be successfully overcome to ensure its full \nvalidity, particularly with respect to the elimination of \nexport subsidies for agricultural products.  \n Our relations with Mexico, Central America and \nthe Caribbean are particularly important. At the same \ntime, we are seeking dynamic relationships with \ncountries of the Pacific rim and throughout the world. \n Within the framework of the South American \nCommunity of Nations, we are beginning to engage in \nregional meetings with Arab and African countries to \nstrengthen political dialogue, cooperation and mutual \ntrade. Ecuador was greatly pleased to welcome \nministers for finance and related areas from Arab and \nSouth American countries in order to jointly formulate \na strategy for strengthening our economic, trade and \ninvestment relationships. With regard to African \n  \n \n06-52885 22 \n \nnations, my country will participate at the highest level \nin the summit to be held in Nigeria this November.  \n Ecuador also attaches great importance to \npolitical coordination mechanisms such as the Group \nof 77 and the Non-Aligned Movement, whose summit \nwas held recently.  \n To conclude, I wish to express my sincere thanks \nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his \noutstanding work at the head of the Organization \ndespite the enormous difficulties he was obliged to \nface, including those of a financial nature. The world is \nconfident that the new Secretary-General will be able \nto continue that work and to implement the processes \nof United Nations reform, with the commitment of all \nits Members, particularly the most highly developed \ncountries.

        "file_text": "Madam President, Burkina Faso is pleased to \nsee you presiding over the General Assembly at its \nsixty-first session. Please be assured of the full \ncooperation of my delegation, which will spare no \neffort to help your noble mission succeed. I would also \nlike to express our gratitude to Mr. Jan Eliasson, \nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Sweden, who \nsuccessfully guided the work of the Assembly at the \nsixtieth session. \n This session is being held at a time when peace \nand security are seeing their foundations severely \nshaken in several regions of the world. Areas of tension \npersist in Africa, despite recent efforts to dispel them. \nThat is the case, for example, in the Sudan, Somalia \nand C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. Fortunately, fighting has ceased in \nseveral countries, thus opening up real opportunities \nfor progress and development. \n In Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea-Bissau and \nBurundi, democracy and building the rule of law have \nnow become a reality. That is proof that nothing, \nabsolutely nothing, can replace the political will of \npeople to engage fully in inclusive and constructive \ndialogue. We very much hope that the democratic \nprocess which is under way in the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo will be successfully pursued. \nLikewise, we welcome the progress made in the inter-\nTogolese political dialogue. Having had the privilege \nof following that process as a facilitator, President \nBlaise Compaore has been able to sense fully the \ndegree of determination of the Togolese political \nleaders. That is why we reiterate the appeal he made to \nTogo\u2019s partners to provide the support necessary for \nthe economic revitalization of Togo. \n The crisis in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is at a decisive turning \npoint. We are convinced that with the firm and sincere \ncommitment of all parties and the support of the \ninternational community a lasting solution can be \nfound very quickly. \n In the Middle East, we have watched a disturbing \nescalation in the violence in recent months. Since the \ncauses of that conflict are sufficiently known to all, \nthere is no reason to go into them here. While \nwelcoming the adoption of Security Council resolution \n1701 (2006) and the deployment of an expanded \nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), \nBurkina Faso strongly hopes that negotiations will \ncontinue and intensify at all levels in order to achieve a \nglobal and lasting peace in that region, a peace that \nwill restore the sovereignty of Lebanon, provide \nfreedom for the Palestinian people and ensure Israel\u2019s \nsecurity. \n The question of free and fair international trade \nremains on the table. The collapse of the Doha \nDevelopment Round is proof of this, and it has shown \nus the need to search for the best way to ensure that the \nrules of the multilateral trading system set by the \nWorld Trade Organization are strictly observed. For \nBurkina Faso, which has thrown its full weight behind \nthe interests of African cotton producers, this \nrequirement is more imperative than ever. Sustainable \ndevelopment, the reduction of poverty and the \nelimination of hunger and precariousness in the world \nstill constitute challenges that must be faced. \n Over and above what has been done to reduce \ndebt and find innovative financing mechanisms, which \nwe welcome, the international community must work \nto forge a true North-South partnership that will \nguarantee fair treatment of the questions of concern to \nall the regions and countries in the world. The midterm \nreview of the implementation of the Brussels \nProgramme of Action for the Least Developed \nCountries, held several days ago, and its conclusions \nsuggest that we are moving in the right direction. \n The sheer scale of international migration in \nrecent years, together with the daily tragedies \nexperienced by thousands of young people who risk \ntheir lives, presents a new challenge caused by \naccelerated globalization. To deal with the problem, the \ncountries of origin, transit and destination must find \nmore imaginative solutions that go to its root causes, as \nneither barriers, nor borders, nor interdiction, nor \nforced repatriation can be an adequate, much less a \nsustainable, response. That is why we welcome the \nresults of the Euro-Africa Conference on Migration \nand Development, held on 10 and 11 July 2006 in \nRabat, the initiatives taken by the African Union to \nprepare a joint African policy on migration and the \n \n \n29 06-53323 \n \nconclusions of the High-level Dialogue on \nInternational Migration and Development, held \nrecently in New York at the margins of the current \nsession. \n The unprecedented rise in the price of a barrel of \noil and the resulting energy crisis have hit our \ncountries hard. The economies of African countries that \ndo not export oil, such as Burkina Faso, will take a \nlong time to recover. This crisis means that we must \nfind not only innovative forms of international \nsolidarity but also alternatives to fossil fuels. With this \nreality in mind, Burkina Faso has already decided to \nmake the development of biogas from the waste of \nplant crops, such as cotton, one of its priorities. \n The question of nuclear energy has been on the \nagenda of most of our meetings for some time. Burkina \nFaso reiterates its firm condemnation of the arms race \nin general and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in \nparticular. It is now imperative that we give full force \nto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons. However, we must do so without prejudice to \nthe rights of all States to develop, produce and use \nnuclear energy for peaceful purposes. \n In the name of democracy and justice, we have all \nsought to create a new United Nations, a symbol of \nmodern governance and efficiency in its management \nof world affairs. That is why we have undertaken to \nensure deep-rooted reform of the Organization and its \nworking methods. Africa in particular is dedicated to \nthat cause because we are convinced that it is the only \nway to put right an unjustice that has festered over \ndecades. \n Change was launched with the creation of the \nPeacebuilding Commission and the Central Emergency \nResponse Fund, the conversion of the Commission on \nHuman Rights into the Human Rights Council, and the \nadoption of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. We \nmust now all work together to ensure that \nmultilateralism and universalism triumph over \nunilateralism. To that end, we need a strong and \ndemocratic United Nations that is open to all peoples \nwho seek peace and justice. \n That spirit of openness and universalization in the \nOrganization must be a component of a genuine and \nirreversible democratic movement. That is why we \nmust do justice by the 23 million Taiwanese whose \nonly aspiration has always been to play an active role \nin our common endeavour to build a better world. \n In that respect, Burkina Faso is very pleased to \nwelcome Montenegro as the 192nd Member of the \nUnited Nations. \n On behalf of my country, Burkina Faso, I wish \nnow to pay special tribute to Secretary-General Kofi \nAnnan, who, with commitment, tact, selflessness and \nunprecedented efficiency has breathed new dynamism \ninto the Organization over the past 10 years and \nrejuvenated the founding elements of the new United \nNations that we have dreamed of for decades. As he \nprepares to move on from this important chapter in his \nlife, we wish him every success in his future activities. \n The aspirations of our peoples are vast. Just as we \nmust strive to optimize governance globally, we must \nalso work to entrench local governance, democracy and \nfreedom. That is the only way we will be able to satisfy \nthose legitimate aspirations and to bequeath to future \ngenerations a world of peace that is reconciled to itself. "

        "file_text": "I would like \nto begin, like previous speakers, by extending my \nwarmest congratulations to Ms. Haya Rasheed Al-\nKhalifa, the first woman in nearly 40 years to take up \nthe position of President of the General Assembly. This \nis good news for international politics. I wish her every \nsuccess in discharging the mandate on which she is \nnow beginning, in which she can be assured of \nPortugal\u2019s firm support. We are confident that she will \ncontinue the excellent work carried out by her \npredecessor, Minister Jan Eliasson, whom I am very \nhappy to remember here. \n This session of the Assembly is also notable for \nbeing the last during which Secretary-General Kofi \nAnnan will be in office. I therefore solemnly express \non behalf of the Portuguese people our heartfelt, deep \nappreciation for the way in which he has carried out his \nduties over the last 10 years, contributing concretely \nand decisively to international peace and stability in a \nworld that we all wish were more just. It was on his \nwatch \u2014 and with his indispensable personal help \u2014 \nthat we saw the birth of the new State of Timor-Leste. \nPortugal will not forget that this was one of the great \nrecent victories of the United Nations, in peoples\u2019 fight \nfor self-determination, and in defence of the values in \nthe Charter. \n This Organization has carried out a crucial task in \nTimor-Leste, in maintaining peace, consolidating the \nrule of law and, together with donor countries, creating \nthe foundations for a more prosperous economic and \nsocial future for the Timorese people. \n There is still a long way to go, it is true. But it is \nimportant that the Timorese people be aware that they \ncan count on the United Nations. Unfortunately, the \n  \n \n06-52988 24 \n \nrecent internal crisis raised a serious question about \nsecurity, and it is vital that this be resolved if the \ncountry is to find stability. \n We therefore applaud the new United Nations \npeace mission, the United Nations Integrated Mission \nin Timor-Leste, which represents a continuity of the \nsignificant investment made by the international \ncommunity, to which Portugal belongs. We participate \nactively in this Mission, consistent with our ongoing \ncommitment, going back over three decades, to the \npolitical process of the new State of Timor-Leste. \n In this regard, I would also like to pay due tribute \nto the memory of Sergio Vieira de Mello, brutally \nmurdered three years ago in Baghdad in the service of \nthe United Nations. We will not forget all that he did \nfor the just cause of the Timorese people, and in \ndefence of the values that the United Nations \nembodies. \n This last decade has been one of great changes. \nThe United Nations has had undoubted successes, but \nthere have also been missed opportunities. Many \naccuse the Organization of undue complexity, slowness \nin its decision-making process and excessive \nbureaucracy. It is true that diplomacy requires time, but \nit does produce results. If there is something that we \nhave learned over these last years, it is that there is no \nalternative to multilateralism; multilateralism is where \nthe United Nations plays a determinant role. \n The United Nations is today one of the greatest \nguarantors of our collective security. It is our duty to \npreserve and strengthen it. It is an investment from \nwhich we all stand to benefit. Each one of us is a \nMember of this Organization not only to serve and \npromote our own national interests, but also \u2014 and I \nwould go so far as to say above all \u2014 to fulfil the \nhopes and dreams of the people of the whole world. \n The world today, as we know, is full of risks and \nthreats that no country can face alone. If we do not \nunite in our efforts, we are halfway down the road to \nfailure. Reality, particularly in recent years, has proved \nthis to us quite clearly. \n I would therefore like to underline Portugal\u2019s \ncommitment to multilateralism, because we firmly \nbelieve that this is the path where one can best uphold \nthe essential values of peace and development. \n A big part of this multilateral action rests on a \ndialogue between cultures and civilizations. It is \nthrough this dialogue that we assume a collective \nresponsibility to overcome obstacles, prejudices, \npreconceived ideas and, principally, ignorance. Our \nchallenge here in this dialogue is not to limit ourselves \nto mere declarations, but to take firm and concrete \nsteps towards greater interaction between peoples and \ncultures. \n Despite the huge uncertainties and \nmisunderstandings in the world today, we have a set of \nprinciples \u2014 contained in our Charter \u2014 that can \ninspire us and guide us. They are our best help. \n The dialogue between cultures and civilizations \nalso imposes demanding domestic political agendas, in \nthe respect for differences and the inclusion of all \ncitizens in society \u2014 the inclusion of immigrants; the \ninclusion of all, irrespective of their beliefs or \nreligions. \n On the other hand, the dialogue between \ncivilizations also imposes steps forward on the \ninternational scene, the strengthening of economic \nbonds between North and South. The strengthening of \nworld trade mechanisms constitutes an investment in \nour own security, and is an essential part of that \ndialogue; hence the importance of overcoming the \nobstacles of the Doha Round in the context of the \ncurrent negotiations in the World Trade Organization. \nWe all have to be prepared to give up something so that \nat the end of the day everyone can win. \n One of the biggest political challenges that we \nface in this dialogue of cultures and civilizations is \nundoubtedly the Middle East. The region remains one \nof the main focal points of instability in the world. We \nall have in our minds the painful images of the most \nrecent crisis in Lebanon, where we witnessed the \nsuffering of civilians on both sides of the conflict. This \nreinforces all the more the need to actively pursue a \npermanent and balanced solution, which may bring \nabout a dynamic of hope and peace in the region. \n The Middle East is not a military issue. The \nMiddle East is, above all, one of the greatest political \nand diplomatic challenges that today\u2019s world faces. We \nshould not, therefore, miss the window of opportunity \noffered to us by Security Council resolution 1701 \n(2006). It is a challenge where the United Nations and \nthe European Union assume shared responsibilities in \npromoting peace and stability, through an effective \nmultilateral dialogue. \n \n \n25 06-52988 \n \n Portugal fulfils its duty and supports the urgent \nimplementation of this resolution, and we are present \nin the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon to help \nimplement it. \n I would like to draw attention, once more, to \nAfrica. Portugal has given it great attention, and \ninvested great efforts there, and it is our duty to ensure \nthat the continent is not forgotten. There is progress in \nAfrica that we should encourage, and we also have a \nhistorical responsibility on which the developed world \nshould not and cannot turn its back. \n I am pleased to stress here today the \ndetermination with which the European Union has been \nreinforcing its partnership and its strategy with the \nAfrican continent. The current drafting of a Euro-\nAfrican joint strategy will lead to a script for our \nrelations with Africa in the fundamental areas of peace \nand security, good governance and human rights, \nregional trade and integration, and also aspects relating \nto human development. \n I stress the word \u201cjoint\u201d. All of us share the \nresponsibility \u2014 Africans and Europeans alike. I trust \nthat the conditions will soon be right for this strategy \nto be adopted. And I hope that it will be at the highest \nlevel, when we hold in Lisbon the second European \nUnion-Africa summit. \n In recent years, with the consolidation of the \nAfrican Union and various regional organizations and \ninitiatives, very significant progress has been made in \nmany fields on the African continent, and this has been \ndriven by the continent itself and its own institutions. It \nis our duty to recognize these developments, support \nthem with renewed support and vigour, and develop \nthem further. \n I would also like to recall that last July, in Bissau, \nthe Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries \ncelebrated its tenth anniversary. This organization has \nbeen consolidating itself and strengthening its \ninvolvement within the United Nations system, where \nit currently holds observer status, presenting itself as a \ncredible organization in the fostering of international \npartnerships. \n In Bissau, on the tenth anniversary, we pledged \nour commitment to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, by defining and implementing a \ngeneral cooperation strategy where the highest priority \nis given to achieving these Goals. This is our priority \nin our domestic policy in Portugal; at the top of our \npriorities are the Millennium Development Goals. We \nshall implement them with a bilateral and multilateral \ncooperation strategy that will help to fight poverty, \nalleviate the pressure on migratory flows and promote \nsustainable development. \n September in New York, above all else, should \nnot be some sort of annual pilgrimage to rediscover \nthis Organization. At the end of the day, the credibility \nof the United Nations is in our hands. \n We all face the same challenges. But, at the same \ntime, they give us the opportunity to live in accordance \nwith our ideals and put into practice the principles that \nhave guided us for more than six decades. The only \nway out is for us to look for answers together. That is \nwhy we need a stronger and more cohesive United \nNations. We owe this to ourselves. We owe it to our \nchildren. But, above all, we owe it to future \ngenerations. "

        "file_text": "On \nbehalf of the people of Costa Rica, I convey my \ngreetings to the President of the General Assembly and \nwish her every success. I also greet the Secretary-\nGeneral, Kofi Annan, Nobel Peace laureate and tireless \ndefender of dialogue and understanding among the \npeoples of the Earth. \n I come before the Assembly overwhelmed by the \nsame emotion and the same sense of urgency as I felt \nwhen I did so for the first time, 20 years ago. Then, I \ncame burdened with the deepest distress of my people. \nI came to remind the world that, in the \u201cwaist of \nAmerica\u201d, five small nations were engaged in a \nstruggle between life and death, between freedom and \noppression, between war and peace. I came to ask the \ninternational community not to let violence turn \nCentral America into a barren land where the seeds of \nthe most beautiful human dreams could not grow. \n The world has changed since then. The finest \nchildren of Central America no longer inherit war as \ntheir birthright, and our countries have ceased to be \npawns in the immense global chess game of the cold \nwar. \n For Central Americans, it is impossible to think \nthat the old days were better. I am convinced that \nhumanity has reasons to be optimistic and that, as \nWilliam Faulkner said, man will prevail. But I also \nknow that the progress made towards human freedom, \ndignity and well-being are no more than small victories \nin a long and epic battle. We have just set out on the \nroad towards the full realization of human beings, and \nit is strewn with obstacles. \n If we are to continue on the road towards human \nemancipation from misery, if we are to transform \ndevelopment and human rights into something more \nthan the utopian dream that they are today for hundreds \nof millions of people throughout the world, we will \nneed more than good intentions. We will need courage \nto call things what they are, to correct mistakes and to \nmake urgent decisions. \n With optimism and vehemence, I propose to the \nAssembly that we now take three courses of action that \ncould have powerful effects on the well-being of all \nhumanity. \n First, we must denounce increases in military \nspending, the arms race and the weapons trade as \noffences to the human condition. \n Secondly, we must make a reality, through free \ntrade, of the promise that the globalized economy holds \nfor humanity and in particular for the world\u2019s poorest \npeoples. \n Thirdly, we must defend, with all our strength \nand eloquence, international law and the United \nNations, proposing reforms that will enable us \nsuccessfully to adapt to the tremendous changes that \nthe world is undergoing. \n For quite some time I have argued that the \nstruggle for human development is linked to the \nstruggle for disarmament and demilitarization. It is no \nbadge of honour for our species that global military \nspending exceeded $1 trillion in 2005 \u2014 the same \nlevel of spending, in real terms, as at the end of the \ncold war. That represents eight times the annual \ninvestment necessary to achieve, in the span of a \ndecade, all the Millennium Development Goals, in \nevery country. \n \n \n21 06-52737 \n \n The investment that the most industrialized \nnations make in their military \u2014 they are responsible \nfor 83 per cent of global military spending \u2014 is 10 \ntimes greater than the amount of resources that they \ndedicate to official development assistance. The United \nStates, the richest country on the planet, spends, at the \nvery least, 25 times more on the military than it gives \nin aid. Is this not a clear example of twisted priorities, \nnot to mention profoundly irrational? \n Indeed, at the end of the day, rationality is what \ncounts. Since the tragic events of 11 September 2001, \nglobal military spending has increased by a little more \nthan $200 billion. There is not a single indicator that \nsuggests that that colossal increase has made the world \nmore secure and human rights more widely enjoyed. \nOn the contrary, we feel increasingly vulnerable and \nfragile. \n Perhaps it is time to think of other ways to deploy \nthose resources. Perhaps it is time to realize that, with \na sum much smaller than that one, we could guarantee \naccess to potable water and primary education for \nevery person in the world. Perhaps there would be \nenough left over, as Gabriel Garc\u00eda Marquez once \nsuggested, \u201cto perfume Niagara Falls with sandalwood \non an autumn day\u201d. Perhaps it is time to understand \nthat this is what would probably make us happier and \ncertainly more secure. \n Every weapon is a visible sign of the delay in \nmeeting the needs of the poor. I am not the only one to \nhave said so. The same thing was said, memorably, by \na man of arms, President Eisenhower, nearly half a \ncentury ago: \n\u201cEvery gun that is made, every warship launched, \nevery rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a \ntheft from those who hunger and are not fed, \nthose who are cold and are not clothed. This \nworld in arms is not spending money alone. It is \nspending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of \nits scientists, the hopes of its children.\u201d \n While it is sad that the richest nations, through \nmilitary spending, are denying development \nopportunities to the poorest, it is sadder still that the \npoor are complicit in destroying their own future. \nIndeed, it is tragic that the Governments of some of the \nmost underdeveloped countries continue to supply their \ntroops with tanks, warplanes and missiles, supposedly \nto protect a population afflicted by hunger and \nignorance. \n My region of the world has not escaped that \nphenomenon. In 2005, the countries of Latin America \nspent almost $24 billion on weapons and troops \u2014 an \namount that has risen 25 per cent in real terms over the \nlast decade and increased substantially in the past year. \nLatin America has begun a new arms race, even though \nit has never been more democratic and there have been \nvery few military conflicts between countries in the \npast century. \n In that respect, I believe Costa Ricans have \nreason to be very proud. Since 1948, thanks to the \nvision of our former President, Jos\u00e9 Figueres, a very \nwise man, Costa Rica abolished its army and declared \npeace on the world, and we bettered our life. \n As I did 20 years ago in my first message to the \nGeneral Assembly, I can say today with satisfaction \nthat I come from a country without weapons, that our \nchildren have never seen a tank, an attack helicopter, a \nwarship or a cannon. As I did 20 years ago, I can say \nthat in my country, fathers and grandfathers explain to \nthe young people the curious architecture of some of \nour schools, which is due to the fact that, long ago, \nthose schools were military barracks. I can say that in \nmy homeland, none of our citizens, man or woman, \nknows oppression, and that not a single Costa Rican \nlives in exile. I can say today that mine is a nation of \nliberty. \n This is a path that neither my country nor I are \nwilling to abandon. Not only that: It is a path that we \nwish all humanity to follow. Today I would like to \npropose an idea. I propose that we all give life to the \nCosta Rican consensus, through which we create \nmechanisms to forgive debt and provide international \nfinancial support to developing nations that invest \nmore and more in education, health and housing, and \nless and less in soldiers and weapons. It is time that the \ninternational financial community reward not only \nthose whose spending is orderly, as it has done to date, \nbut also those whose spending is ethical. \n I propose to the Assembly as well that we \napprove, as soon as possible, an arms trade treaty \nprohibiting countries from transferring weapons to \nStates, groups or individuals if there is reason to \nbelieve that such arms will be used to violate human \nrights or international law, or if there are clear \nindications that they will be used to hinder the process \nof sustainable development. \n  \n \n06-52737 22 \n \n I hope that the United Nations, at this session of \nthe General Assembly, will approve the formation of a \ngovernmental group of experts that will draft the text \nof a binding treaty on the subject of international arms \ntransfers. \n It is time to close the door on the arms trade and \non the endless trail of death it leaves in its wake. It is \ntime also to open the door to other forms of \ncommerce \u2014 the legitimate and licit trade of goods \nand services \u2014 on which the prosperity of the peoples \nof the world depends. \n I know that in the Assembly there exists a wide \nrange of opinions about the best way to promote global \ntrade so as to provide genuine opportunities for all \ncountries. In a globalized world, the challenge facing \ndeveloping nations is simple: if we cannot export more \ngoods and services, we will end up exporting more \npeople. \n The strongest argument in favour of opening up \neconomies is, quite simply, that it helps to reduce \npoverty. I sometimes marvel that some continue to \ninsist that globalization is a negative force that is \nincreasing global poverty. On the contrary: according \nto the World Bank, the number of people living in \npoverty has fallen by almost 200 million over the past \ntwo decades, largely owing to the advances of India \nand China \u2014 two countries that have embraced \nglobalization and have opened up their markets with \nparticular enthusiasm. \n Trade liberalization can thus be defended on the \nbasis of the benefits that it brings for the poorest \npeople. If we truly want to meet the ethical challenge \nof reducing global poverty, wisdom and caution must \nprevail so that the Doha round can be successful. But I \nwant to stress that the defence of free trade must be \nhonest and consistent. We should seek commercial \nexchanges that are equally free for all countries. The \npractice among developed nations of pressing for the \nelimination of commercial barriers only in the sectors \nin which they have a clear comparative advantage is \nethically indefensible. Furthermore, developing \ncountries need and demand free trade in agriculture. \nUntil we make progress on this issue, we will have to \ncontinue paraphrasing George Orwell\u2019s famous words, \nand say that in free trade everyone is equal, but some \nare more equal than others. \n Developing countries need development \nassistance and solidarity from industrialized countries, \nbut what we need from them above all is consistency. \nIf they extol the virtues of a free market, then let that \nmarket actually be free. If in their countries they \npromote admirable forms of social justice through the \nwelfare state, then let them put that principle into \npractice on an international scale. If their credo of \ndemocracy prevails within their borders, then let them \nsupport a more just balance of power within all \ninternational organizations. \n The third major challenge to which I want to refer \ntoday is the strengthening of global governance and the \nreform of its institutions. This task begins with the \ndefence of multilateralism and the strict adherence of \nall countries to international law and the fundamental \nprinciples of the Charter, the most elemental safeguard \nagainst anarchy in the world. Costa Rica, since it lacks \nan army, is perhaps the country most in need of an \neffective international system to guarantee its security. \n It is essential that the most powerful nations on \nEarth understand that the survival of international law \nand of the United Nations is fundamental for their own \nsecurity; that the mere existence of this forum is one of \nthe great achievements of our species; and that the \nUnited Nations represents the triumph of hope over \nfear, of tolerance over fanaticism and of reason over \nforce. \n As I stand here today, I would so much like to \nhear once more the powerful voice of John F. Kennedy, \ntelling the world, as he did in 1961, \n \u201cTo that world assembly of sovereign \nStates, the United Nations, our last best hope in \nan age where the instruments of war have far \noutpaced the instruments of peace, we renew our \npledge of support \u2014 to prevent it from becoming \nmerely a forum for invective, to strengthen its \nshield of the new and the weak, and to enlarge the \narea in which its writ may run.\u201d \n This is the globalization that can transform the \nlives of all human beings for the better \u2014 a \nglobalization in which all countries are, as we are here, \nequal in rights; a globalization in which each people \ncan make its voice heard and hear the voices of others \nand in which the exercise of the tolerance that we \npractise every day in this Hall is the norm, not the \nexception. \n The great British writer Aldous Huxley once \nwondered whether this world was not another planet\u2019s \n \n \n23 06-52737 \n \nhell. I do not think it is. It is just a marvellous and \ncomplex place, inhabited by a species that is barely in \nits infancy and that, like an infant, has scarcely begun \nto understand its immense power to create and to \ndestroy. \n For good or for ill, our species writes its history \nin draft form, never cleanly, always debating with \nitself \u2014 like each one of us \u2014 in a perpetual conflict \nbetween the good and bad angels of our nature. In this \nconflict, the victories of the human spirit, as certain as \nthey may seem, are always incomplete, gradual and \ntentative, and setbacks are always possible. The Earth \nis not hell. It is a place where there is no perfection \u2014 \nand never will be; just goodness and greatness \npunctuated by misfortunes, errors and suffering. \n The indisputable achievements of the past 20 \nyears tell us that, in spite of our sorrows, human beings \ncontinue the march of progress. But now is the time to \ncorrect costly mistakes, to right our course and to \nabandon the destructive behaviour that will make our \nmarch of progress infinitely more difficult and tortuous \nthan it should be. \n If today we do not confront the rise in military \nspending and the arms trade; if we do not encourage \nthe poorest countries to invest their scarce resources in \nlife and not in death; if we do not conquer the fear and \nhypocrisy that impede truly free trade throughout the \nworld; and if we do not strengthen the institutions and \nthe international norms that can protect us against \nglobal anarchy, we will be condemned to walk on the \nedge of a precipice and to engage in futile actions, \nhaving to start all over again, like Sisyphus, after every \nachievement. \n I believe that we must supplement optimism with \ncourage and the will to change. I believe that it is time \nfor humanity to build the brightest future that we could \npossibly dream of. "

        "file_text": "I would \nlike to congratulate you, Ms. Al-Khalifa, on your \nelection as President of the General Assembly at this \nsession, since I believe it is very significant that a \nwoman has assumed that role, to promote gender \nequality, which is a goal both of my Government and \nof the United Nations. \n On behalf of the Argentine Republic, we would \nalso like to congratulate the President of the General \nAssembly at its sixtieth session, Mr. Jan Eliasson, for \nthe work he carried out, and to renew our recognition \nof Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his role in action \npromoting peace, multilateralism and the fight against \npoverty. \n We have come to the General Assembly in the \nfirm belief that the revitalization of this forum of \nglobal representation is fundamental so that \ninternational law can be the instrument of rationality \nthat will enable us to settle conflicts and combat the \nthreats to peace. \n The international conduct of the Argentine \nRepublic is inspired by the values of representative \ndemocracy, respect for fundamental human rights and \nactive defence of international peace and security. \nThose principles, shared by the vast majority of the \n \n \n5 06-52885 \n \nArgentine people, guide our administration and are the \nbasis of our foreign policy decisions. \n In the field of human rights, in 2003, after more \nthan two decades of sustained democratic rule in \nArgentina, we experienced a true paradigm shift. In \nresponse to the mandates of the whole of society, the \nthree powers of the State adopted, within their \nrespective purviews, concurrent decisions against \nimpunity, preserving memory, truth and justice and \nsecuring reparations. \n The annulment by Congress of the laws that \naccorded impunity for State-sponsored crimes of \nterrorism, the ruling that those laws and pardons \ngranted by the courts in our country were \nunconstitutional, and the reopening of over a thousand \ncourt proceedings for crimes against humanity \u2014 some \nof which have resulted in the conviction of those \nresponsible \u2014 constitute landmarks of that shift. It is \nour conviction that democracy is strengthened with the \nsimultaneous fight against impunity and promotion of \nfull respect for the rule of law, without calling for \nrevenge. \n With that experience, we have, since the \nbeginning of the reform of the United Nations system, \nstrongly supported incorporating human rights into the \nhierarchy so as to raise the institutional level of their \ntreatment to that already given to development and to \nthe maintenance of international peace and security. \nThat determination led us to establish the Human \nRights Council, in whose creation Argentina \nparticipated actively. \n The first steps of that body have been positive, \nhaving approved the text of the International \nConvention for the Protection of All Persons from \nEnforced Disappearance. That is an instrument of great \nsignificance for our country, as it defines a crime \nagainst humanity from which Argentina suffered \nmassively in the past, at a high cost to our society. We \nhave among us here today a representative of an \norganization that was extremely involved with that \nissue \u2014 one of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, \nMrs. Marta V\u00e1zquez, who is accompanying our \ndelegation. We hope the General Assembly will adopt \nthat very important instrument quickly, during this \nsession. \n Five years after the attacks that shocked this city \nand the world, we would like to firmly condemn the \nserious threat of global terrorism. Argentina considers \nall acts of terrorism against innocent civilians to be \ncriminal and unjustifiable, and accepts no argument to \njustify such methods. \n The Argentine people suffered two atrocious \nattacks in the 1990s against the Embassy of Israel and \nthe headquarters of the Asociaci\u00f3n Mutual Israelita \nArgentina. We are still struggling, in spite of the time \nthat has elapsed, to fully clarify the facts and punish \nthe culprits. We believe that, in order to face this \ncriminal threat successfully, we must carry out a \nsustained multilateral and legitimate response. Respect \nfor human rights, international humanitarian law and \nrefugee law is essential, as are international \ncooperation and legal assistance to effectively enforce \nthe norms against terrorism. \n If, in facing down global terrorism, we resort to a \nglobal violation of human rights, the only winner in \nthis fight shall be terrorism. We will advance firmly in \nthe fight against terrorism only if we frame it within \nrespect for local laws and international norms and \nconventions. No complication can be an excuse for not \ncombating terrorism within the law. \n Peace is built and maintained by understanding \nthe true concept of solidarity among nations from a \nwider perspective than the purely military or the \npredominantly unilateral. Nations big and small, rich \nand poor, will be markedly vulnerable if we fail to \ngrasp that the fight against terrorism demands \nsustained multilateral, intelligent action firmly based in \nlegitimacy, respect for fundamental rights, \nproportionality of response and the support of \ninternational public opinion. \n We would like to express our concern regarding \nthe hostilities on the border between Israel and \nLebanon, resulting in hundreds of casualties, severe \ndamage to the civilian infrastructure and hundreds of \nthousands of displaced persons. The violence must \nstop. We need to address the causes at the heart of the \ncrisis, avoid the disproportionate use of force, and \nunderstand that only negotiated political solutions can \nhold in the long term. Argentina will continue to \nsupport a fair solution to the Middle East problems \nwithin the framework of resolution 1701 (2006). \n We must understand that the world will move \ncloser to peace only insofar as it promotes equality and \nstruggles to eradicate poverty and exclusion. That is \ntrue both for the global system and for each country \nnationally. \n  \n \n06-52885 6 \n \n Argentina supports the building of societies that \nare fairer, more equitable and with a better distribution \nof the benefits of economic growth. We also believe \nthat each country has the right to search for its own \ndevelopment model with no external conditionalities. \nWe not only aspire to generate sustainable growth; we \nalso want it to reach everyone. There must be \nharmonized growth that translates into a balanced \nincome distribution, because we know that what is \nneeded is not development for a mere few, but the \ndevelopment of the whole country. \n In the region and in the Common Market of the \nSouth, we want an efficient instrument to address \npoverty and exclusion; we want the common good to \nprevail over sectarian interests and to overcome \nstagnation and the technology gap; and we want to \ndefine a sustainable and productive development model \nthat valorizes our competitive advantages and fosters \nour vast wealth in human and material resources. \n The economic situation of the Republic is very \ndifferent from what it was when our Administration \nbegan. We are achieving true structural change. That \nincludes uninterrupted growth at rates of between 8 \nand 9 per cent; the growing participation of investment \nin the gross domestic product; record local savings \nrates; the resurrection of local industry; a fiscal surplus \nat historic levels; a clear expansion of our industrial \nsales to the world; the systematic decrease of local and \nexternal public debt; the preventive accumulation of \nreserves; lesser external exposure; a marked drop in \nunemployment; a strengthening of the income of wage \nearners and retirees; and a significant fall of poverty \nand destitution levels. \n With a prudent monetary policy, an orderly fiscal \npolicy, a fiscal and commercial surplus, and a \nresponsible management of indebtedness, we are \nincreasingly reducing the vulnerability and uncertainty \nthat characterized the Argentine economy in the past. \nDecent work, social inclusion, national production, \ninternal consumption and sustained growth have \nallowed us to fulfil the goals of the Millennium \nDeclaration, although there is still a long way to go to \nrecover from the hell into which we had fallen. \n We seek the integral sustainability of that \nprocess, not only in its macroeconomic aspects, but \nalso guaranteeing social equity and a fairer distribution \nof income through the reduction of poverty and \nunemployment. \n In implementing a national education plan with a \nstrong federal emphasis that highlights the challenge of \nimproving the quality of education, ensures the \ngrowing funding of the public sector, and interacts with \nthe private sector, we seek also to achieve its strategic \nsustainability. \n We cannot but point out that these achievements \nhave not been supported by the International Monetary \nFund, which has denied us any kind of aid, and, it must \nbe said, that they are in many cases the result of \nignoring or even contradicting its recommendations \nand conditionalities. We have sufficient empirical proof \nof the failure of international financial organizations in \nthe promotion of development in less developed \ncountries. In many cases, their conditionalities have \nactually had the opposite effect, hindering \ndevelopment. \n The world has changed and those organizations \nhave not. They still insist on jeopardizing advancement \nwith their misguided interference. That is why we \nsupport, together with most countries, the reform of the \ninternational financial architecture to make it more \neffectual in assisting the progress of nations with fewer \nresources. In noting the reluctance of international \nfinancial organizations to effect any real change in \ntheir policies, we feel it necessary to endorse such \nchange and to consider the creation of new \ninternational financial instruments that would allow us \nto fund development projects to fight poverty and \nhunger in the world and generate true options for \nprogress. \n Argentina is distressed to note the stagnation in \nthe negotiations of the Doha Round for the \ndevelopment of the World Trade Organization (WTO). \nIt is imperative, within the current globalization \nprocess \u2014 from which developing countries must \nprofit \u2014 to reach a successful and balanced result fully \nconsistent with the mandate of the Doha Declaration. \nThus, we reaffirm the need to reach a satisfactory \nresult in agriculture in this WTO round, including a \nsubstantial reduction in domestic subsidies, the \nelimination of export subsidies and ample access to the \nmarkets of developed countries. \n We are increasingly concerned to see the \ndeterioration of the global environment. We affirm that \nthere can be no double standards. The environment \nmust be protected in developed and in developing \ncountries, in rich countries and in poor, in the countries \n \n \n7 06-52885 \n \nof the North and of the South, in the central and in the \nperipheral countries. \n In developing their industries, the more \nindustrialized countries have profited from a true \nenvironmental subsidy from the rest of the countries \nwhich today compromise, in their relative \nbackwardness, a true world environmental reserve. \nThat is why we cannot accept that those countries that \nhave achieved greater development \u2014 often at the \nexpense of the degradation of the environment and by \nproducing a severe global effect evident in climate \nchange \u2014 should seek to transfer to us the more \ncontaminating part of their industrial processes. \n There can be no reliable solutions without the \nconcerted action of all countries of the world, insofar \nas the nature of the problem is of a global scale. It is \nunacceptable for the claims of the developing States to \ngo unnoticed. It is imperative to take the path of \nsolutions. \n Our countries wish to receive investments and \npresent profitable opportunities in the energy, \ntransportation and infrastructure fields, and even in \nsensitive sectors. Therein lies a strong foundation for \ninternational collaboration, but we do not want \ninvestors to undertake activities in our countries that \nare prohibited in the industrialized countries just so \nthat they can improve the profits of shareholders by \ncreating the illusion of an allegedly less expensive \nproduct by raising the costs of environmental pollution, \ndeteriorating health conditions and lowered life \nexpectancy. \n On a different subject, we attach high importance \nto our participation, together with other countries of \nthe region, in the United Nations Stabilization Mission \nin Haiti. In our view, beyond the progress achieved in \nthe transition, the steady support and economic \nassistance of the international community will continue \nto be critical in the areas of security, the strengthening \nof institutions, the fostering of political dialogue, the \nprotection of human rights, social inclusion, the \npromotion of the rule of law, the creation of \nadministrative capacity and, above all, the promotion \nof economic and social development through concrete \ncontributions. \n We reiterate here our will to achieve peaceful \nnuclear development under the verification of \ninternational organizations. Argentina\u2019s commitment to \ndisarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear \nweapons, our adherence to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and our long-\nstanding practice in the field are known to all. \n In conclusion, I wish to recall that the question of \nthe Malvinas Islands \u2014 which includes the Malvinas, \nthe South Georgias, the South Sandwich Islands and \nthe surrounding maritime area \u2014 has been under \nconsideration by the United Nations since 1965. The \nGeneral Assembly and its Special Committee of 24 on \nDecolonization have defined this as a special case that \ndiffers from traditional colonial situations in that it \ninvolves a sovereignty dispute that must be resolved \nthrough bilateral negotiations between my country and \nthe United Kingdom, in accordance with the provisions \nof resolution 2065 (XX) and other relevant resolutions. \n We must stress that the Government of the United \nKingdom persists in ignoring those General Assembly \nresolutions. Nonetheless, I would like to reaffirm once \nagain my country\u2019s readiness to engage in constructive \ndialogue with the United Kingdom. We call upon the \nUnited Kingdom to promptly heed the request of the \ninternational community to resume negotiations. \n In conclusion, we are firmly convinced that the \nbasis exists for international cooperation that can help \nthe world move towards peace. The tensions and \ndifficulties besetting humanity must not prevent us \nfrom understanding the extent to which the \nauthoritarian notion that military might can provide \nunilateral solutions to conflicts and threats is starting to \nrecede. That mistaken belief has led only to failure and \ngreat suffering. \n Only multilateral solutions, reached through the \narduous process of negotiation, despite their \nlimitations, can move us forward. In this context, the \nUnited Nations has a fundamental role to play in \nensuring greater understanding among nations with a \nview to creating a safe, peaceful and fairer world in the \nyears to come.

        "file_name": "IND_61_2006.txt",
        "file_text": "At the outset, Madam, \nlet me join previous speakers in welcoming your \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-first session. On India\u2019s behalf, I would like to \nassure you of our constructive support and \nwholehearted commitment to work with you to achieve \nboth the larger goals of the Charter and the more \nspecific goals of the reform of this Organization that \nwere set out in last year\u2019s World Summit Outcome \nDocument. \n The topic of this general debate is \u201cImplementing \na global partnership for development\u201d. It is difficult to \ncontest its relevance or topicality. Today, whether we \nlook at issues such as international trade, international \nfinancial mechanisms, methods to improve economic \nand social well-being, or even the various threats to \npeace and security that challenge our collective \nexistence, one common theme that emerges is the lack \nof an effective and equitable global partnership. This is \nan imperative even for achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. \n The important annual report of the Secretary-\nGeneral highlights several successes in moving ahead \nwith United Nations reform. During the previous \nGeneral Assembly session, the Central Emergency \nResponse Fund, the Peacebuilding Commission and the \nHuman Rights Council were established, and the \nUnited Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy was \nagreed upon. We have also gradually moved forward \non management and budgetary reforms. While these \nare certainly important \u2014 indeed, critical \u2014 if we are \nhonest, we must acknowledge that significant \nunfulfilled tasks and challenges lie ahead, particularly \nwith regard to unaddressed issues, including the reform \nof the architecture of our multilateral bodies that \noversee security, trade, financial flows and \ndevelopment. Without this reform, the discontent \nassociated with globalization will only deepen. Without \nit, there cannot be substantially enhanced and assured \nresource and technology flows to developing countries, \nwhich are necessary for real economic transformation \nand for achieving the Millennium Development Goals. \n It is sometimes argued that private sector \ninvestment is today replacing the traditional reliance \non aid and development assistance. While we \nappreciate the important role of private sector \ninvestment, it cannot replace public investment in \ndeveloping countries, whose absorptive capacities are \noften limited and where the physical and social \ninfrastructure is often weak. Official development \nassistance (ODA) remains an important means to \n \n \n7 06-53952 \n \naugment public investment in areas such as human \ncapital development and rural infrastructure, which \nrarely attract private sector investment. \n The process of increasing the available pool of \nresources for investment in the social and economic \ninfrastructure of developing countries can be promoted \nat one level by developed countries, expeditiously \nreaching the target of setting aside 0.7 per cent of their \ngross domestic product for official development \nassistance. \n At another level, there is also a need to develop \ninnovative sources of financing. We must evolve a \nbroader understanding of ways to encourage the least \ndeveloped countries to get out of the debt trap by \nextending debt-cancellation programmes, without \ninsisting on conditionalities, such as encouraging \nprivatization, which, applied indiscriminately, may \nrecreate the original difficulties that necessitated \nrecourse to debt in the first place. \n The impasse in international trade negotiations is \ndisappointing, to say the least, considering the hopes \nraised after the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference and \nat the Group of Eight Summit in Saint Petersburg in \nJuly. Early resumption is desirable, but adherence to \nthe existing mandate is imperative \u2014 the mandate of \nthe Doha Declaration, the July framework and the \nHong Kong Ministerial Declaration. When agriculture \nwas brought into the ambit of negotiations at the \ncreation of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the \ndeveloping countries were given a clear understanding \nthat trade-distorting agricultural subsidies would be \nphased out in a time-bound manner. Minimizing the \nvulnerabilities of poor farmers must be our collective \npriority. Demanding market access from developing \ncountries, which displace low-income and subsistence \nfarmers to satisfy commercial interests, cannot be \nsupported.  \n Proportionately lower overall tariff reduction \ncommitments, operable, effective development \ninstruments for special products and a special \nsafeguard mechanism are essential if we are to ensure \nfood and livelihood security and meet the rural \ndevelopment needs of developing countries. The \noverarching principle of special and differential \ntreatment therefore remains a categorical imperative, \nand is the underlying basis of the position of \ndeveloping countries. \n In our view, there exists an overwhelming logic \nfor giving the United Nations a role in providing \ndirection to the comprehensive reform of the \ninternational financial and trading systems. These \nreforms must be aimed at building an international \narchitecture that reflects the realities of the twenty-first \ncentury and is able to create an environment that \neffectively supports national efforts to eradicate \npoverty. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \nhave given hope to the poor and the underprivileged of \nthe world, and these goals are to be achieved by 2015. \nIn this context, the World Bank must remain steadfast \nin its mission to build a world free of poverty, and its \nstrategy must remain embedded in the historical \ndevelopment-centric approach.  \n The Outcome Document of last year\u2019s World \nSummit emphasized that enhancing the voice and \nparticipation of developing countries in the Bretton \nWoods institutions remains a continuous concern. The \nbridging of this voice deficit requires fundamental \nreforms in the quota structure which are long overdue \nand absolutely necessary to enhance the credibility and \nlegitimacy of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). \nThe quota reforms have to begin with the revision of \nthe formula so as to reflect the relative economic \nstrengths of countries in the twenty-first century. The \nUnited Nations should encourage immediate steps \nbeing taken to initiate the second stage of IMF quota \nreform, involving a basic revision of the quota formula \nand the subsequent increase of quotas for all under-\nrepresented countries. All of this must be done in a \ntime-bound manner. \n Change is the law of life. The acute \ndissatisfaction heard in many statements is the result of \ninstitutions having been prevented from changing. \nWhat is true in the economic field is equally true of the \narchitecture of our international security system as \nreflected in this unique Organization that is supposed \nto reflect the collective will of our world, a system \nwhich remains mired in the past. Recent tragic events \nin Lebanon and the stasis in the peace process in the \nbroader Middle East have highlighted the growing \nfailure of the institution designated by the Charter as \nhaving primary responsibility for issues relating to \npeace and security. \n It is widely accepted that the Security Council \ncan no longer be regarded as reflecting the changed \ninternational environment that has emerged since the \ntime of its creation. The Security Council must not \n  \n \n06-53952 8 \n \nonly be more representative but also more effective if it \nis to be able to satisfactorily perform the role mandated \nto it by the Charter. \n At the same time, the Security Council has \nneedlessly diverted its attention to issues and areas that \ngo beyond its mandate. For instance, the inclusion of \nitems on its agenda which have nothing to do with \npeace and security represents an encroachment on the \nroles mandated to other United Nations bodies. In \norder to ensure that the international community \nexercises real ownership of the process of securing our \nworld, it is essential that comprehensive reform of the \nSecurity Council be undertaken and that its \nmembership be expanded in both the permanent and \nthe non-permanent categories. It is no accident that the \nSecretary-General\u2019s report refers to the enhancement of \nlegitimacy and the urgent need for reform to ensure the \nSecurity Council\u2019s relevance and credibility. \n The revitalization of the General Assembly is \nintertwined with the reform of the Security Council. It \nis no coincidence that its reform too has long been \nfrustrated. A strengthened and more effective United \nNations presumes a revitalized General Assembly that \nexercises its role and authority in the areas of \nresponsibility assigned to it by the Charter. These \ninclude its effectively addressing topics such as \ninternational law and human rights, financial, \nbudgetary and administrative matters, as well as the \nglobal economic architecture and important issues \nrelated to development. \n I now turn to one of the most crucial issues of our \ntimes: the problem of terrorism. While this \nphenomenon has become increasingly global, our \ncollective response to it has remained rather \ninadequate. The multiple ways in which terrorism \nchallenges the core principles of humanity and the \nmandate of the United Nations are underlined by the \noutrages perpetrated in India over the last few months. \nBarely two months ago, on a single black day, more \nthan 200 lives were lost and more than 1,000 were \ninjured by dastardly bombings in Mumbai and \nelsewhere in India. These and other such outrageous \nincidents were clearly designed to spread maximum \nterror among ordinary people. Ours is not the only \ncountry to be singled out for vicious and senseless acts \nof murder. A strong response to terrorism requires \nbroad-based international cooperation, denying to \nterrorists the space that has been available to them and \nincreasing the capability of States to address terrorist \nthreats. It requires sustained and specific cooperation \nby a variety of national, regional and global agencies. \n Earlier this month, we joined in the adoption of \nthe United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy \n(resolution 60/288), even though, ideally, we would \nhave liked the United Nations to convey a far stronger \nmessage in order to counter terrorism. We must \ncollectively and unanimously reject the notion that any \ncause can justify terrorism. No cause can ever justify \nthe targeted killing of innocent men, women and \nchildren. The international community must signal that \nit will no longer tolerate the actions of the sponsors \nand abettors of terrorism, including States which \nwilfully fail to prevent terrorists from utilizing their \nterritory. We hope that the Strategy will provide the \nimpetus to unite the international community in its \nfight against terrorism via practical measures that \nfacilitate cooperation by way of extradition, \nprosecution, information exchange and capacity-\nbuilding. \n We went along with the Global Counter-\nTerrorism Strategy, but the comprehensive convention \non international terrorism, which remains a work in \nprogress, would have provided the requisite legal \nframework upon which a counter-terrorism strategy \ncould have been based. It cannot be beyond our \ncollective ingenuity to reach an agreement on such a \ncomprehensive convention, even though we have \nmissed the target of doing so at the sixtieth session of \nthe General Assembly. We must work together to \nfinalize and adopt the comprehensive convention, at \nleast during this session of the General Assembly. \n The existence of nuclear weapons continues to \nthreaten international peace and security. In our view, \nthe best non-proliferation measure is universal \ndisarmament, and the international community needs to \ntake immediate steps to eliminate the threat of the use \nof nuclear weapons. We have to revive momentum for \nachieving what the late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi \ncalled a nuclear-weapon-free and non-violent world, to \nbe achieved, through negotiations, in a time-bound \nmanner. India will be presenting a working paper at \nthis session of the General Assembly on the issue of \nnuclear disarmament, on which we look forward to \nworking with Member States. \n In recent years, new dangers have emerged due to \nthe threat of proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction-related materials and technologies to non-\n \n \n9 06-53952 \n \nState actors and terrorist groups. The international \ncommunity must work together to meet those \nchallenges. India\u2019s record in that regard is impeccable, \nand we have instituted effective measures to ensure \nthat the technologies we develop are not leaked in any \nway. \n It is true that the developing countries bear the \nheaviest burden from pandemics, epidemics and \nchronic diseases. The scourge of HIV/AIDS, malaria, \navian influenza and tuberculosis seriously threatens the \nfuture of many developing countries by robbing them \nof the most productive segment of their society \u2014 their \nyoung people \u2014 thereby affecting the future of those \ncountries. An enhanced global collaborative effort is \ncalled for to confront the proliferation of challenges \naffecting the lives of the majority of our citizens. \n We also need to address the central issue of the \nspecial needs of the developing countries, especially in \nAfrica, and of the vulnerable small States. On our part, \nwe will continue to expand our programme of South-\nSouth cooperation also through the New Partnership \nfor Africa\u2019s Development, through Team 9 \u2014 our \nspecial programme for West African countries \u2014 and \nby means of the connectivity mission in Africa, as well \nas through assistance, capacity-building and \ntechnology transfer aimed at reducing the vulnerability \nof small States. \n Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, who embodied \nour commitment to the United Nations ideals, said that \n \u201cin a world of incessant and feverish activity, \nmen have little time to think, much less to \nconsider ideals and objectives. Yet, how are we to \nact, even in the present, unless we know which \nway we are going and what our objectives are?\u201d  \n Confronted as we are by the globalization of \nthreats and by the limitations of our international \nsystem to address such challenges, the need for a \ncomprehensive reform of the United Nations has never \nbeen more imperative. We need to enfranchise the \nUnited Nations to meet the challenges of our time by \nreinforcing its role and authority as the core of real \nmultilateralism. \n We look forward to working closely with other \nMember States, under your leadership, Madam \nPresident, to press ahead with essential reforms at the \nUnited Nations and to implement an effective global \npartnership for development that encompasses \neveryone and enables every individual to live a life of \ndignity in a clean, safe and healthy environment.

        "file_text": "Let me start, Madam, by \nsaying how pleased we are to see you presiding over \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-first session. You \nhave our full support. \n The latest cycle of violence in the Middle East \nand the recent escalation in Darfur have once again \nhighlighted the need for a strong multilateral response \nto global challenges. Last year\u2019s World Summit set out \nan ambitious agenda on how to strengthen the United \nNations. Reform efforts must continue. The decisions \nmade here in New York during the sixtieth session \nshould be translated into concrete results in the field. \n For too long, people in Darfur have suffered the \nappalling consequences of conflict. Our common \nefforts must be intensified to end the fighting and \nviolence, to ensure respect for human rights and \ninternational humanitarian law and to end impunity. A \n \n \n23 06-53952 \n \nUnited Nations peacekeeping force should be allowed \nto protect the people in Darfur. We urge the \nGovernment of the Sudan to accept such a force. A \ncontinued African Union force presence is crucial for \nthe humanitarian situation and the transition towards a \nUnited Nations peacekeeping force in Darfur. We urge \nrebel groups that have failed to sign up to the Darfur \nPeace Agreement to do so. Sweden stands ready to \ncontribute to a United Nations mission in Darfur. We \nneed to live up to the principle of the responsibility to \nprotect that we accepted at last year\u2019s Summit. The \nSecurity Council must show the will to act when \ncivilian populations are threatened by the most serious \ncrimes. \n A comprehensive approach to the conflict in the \nMiddle East is urgently needed, with the strong and \nincreased involvement of the international community. \nPositive contributions will be required from key \ncountries in the region, including Syria and Iran. \n The events this past summer have shown that a \nsolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and long-\nterm security for Israel are objectives that cannot be \nachieved by military means. Negotiations are the only \navenue to peace. The Stockholm Conference last month \nresulted in immediate steps to extend support for \nLebanon\u2019s early recovery. It is vital that we sustain our \ncommitment to Lebanon\u2019s reconstruction and to the \nstrengthening of its sovereignty. Full implementation \nby all parties of Security Council resolutions 1559 \n(2004) and 1701 (2006) is needed. Sweden is currently \npreparing a military contribution to the United Nations \nInterim Force in Lebanon. \n The Israeli-Palestinian conflict lies at the core of \nthe tensions in the Middle East. The vision of an \nindependent and democratic Palestine, living side by \nside with a secure Israel, based on the implementation \nof Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 \n(1973), must be revived and concretized. Israel\u2019s right \nto exist should be unequivocally recognized by all. We \ncondemn rocket attacks against Israeli territory. \nTerrorist attacks can never be justified and must end. \n Sweden remains concerned at the humanitarian \nsituation in Gaza and the West Bank. Humanitarian \naccess must be guaranteed, and humanitarian law \nshould be observed throughout the occupied \nPalestinian territories. The expansion of Israeli \nsettlements in the occupied Palestinian territories must \nstop. This settlement policy should instead be reversed \nas it undermines confidence in a credible political \nprocess, as does the building of the barrier on occupied \nPalestinian territory. \n The situation in Iraq is serious, with its negative \nimpact on security in the region and beyond and with \nuntold suffering of innocent civilians. We need to help \nthe Iraqi people build a future free from war and \ninternal strife. \n With an estimated 27,000 nuclear weapons in the \nworld, we have to make progress in addressing the \nthreat posed by weapons of mass destruction. \nDisarmament and non-proliferation are crucial to world \nsecurity. They are interlinked. We must press ahead for \nprogress on both issues. \n The international community\u2019s concerns over \nIran\u2019s nuclear programme must be met. No one wishes \nto see an isolated Iran. Our wish is for Iran to take its \nrightful place among nations in international \ncooperation. But neither would we like to see an Iran \nthat pursues a nuclear weapons option. The Weapons of \nMass Destruction Commission, led by Mr. Hans Blix, \nhas presented a large number of constructive \nrecommendations in its report, entitled \u201cWeapons of \nTerror\u201d. These recommendations offer a way forward \ntowards disarmament and non-proliferation. \n There are over 1.1 billion people living in abject \npoverty in our world today. Well over 100 million \nchildren do not attend school. It is true that there has \nbeen progress. The number of extremely poor has \ndeclined by 130 million since 1990. Since the \nMonterrey Conference in 2001, aid has increased by \nover $50 billion. \n The World Summit gave increased attention to \ndevelopment issues, forging a vital link between \nsecurity, development and human rights in the fight \nagainst poverty. But this is not enough. If we are to \nimplement the Millennium Development Goals by \n2015, we have to do more. The primary responsibility \nlies with the developing countries themselves. They are \nin charge. Good governance must be the guiding \nprinciple at all levels. Donor countries should actively \nsupport the efforts of the developing countries to \nreduce poverty and lend their full support to \ndeveloping countries in their efforts to increase their \nparticipation in international trade. \n The High-level Panel on United Nations System-\nwide Coherence provides a unique opportunity to \n  \n \n06-53952 24 \n \nrevitalize the support of the United Nations to the \ndeveloping countries. If the Organization can become \nmore effective at the country level, it will be able to \nmobilize more resources and ensure that they will \nreach the countries in need. \n Sweden has always given high priority to the \nstrengthening of the United Nations. During this \nsession, it is essential that we stay focused on \nimplementing the decisions already taken and continue \nto seek agreement on outstanding issues from the \nSummit. \n We created the Peacebuilding Commission as a \ntool to assist countries in managing the difficult \ntransition from post-conflict situations. The country-\nspecific commissions should now deliver results, \nbeginning with Burundi and Sierra Leone. \n The Human Rights Council must be a body that \nreacts firmly against violations of human rights. \n Thousands of innocent men, women and children \nhave been killed across the world through acts of \nterrorism. This global threat can only by met by \ncollective action by Member States. That is why we \nadopted the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism \nStrategy (resolution 60/288) in the General Assembly a \ncouple of weeks ago. It sends a strong political \nmessage that terrorism is unacceptable in all its forms \nand manifestations, committed by whomever, wherever \nand for whatever purposes, as it constitutes one of the \nmost serious threats to international peace and security. \nThe Strategy should now be implemented, with full \nrespect for human rights. Let us also build upon this \nachievement to agree on a comprehensive convention \non terrorism during the current session of the General \nAssembly. \n The world needs a stronger and more effective \nUnited Nations. In order to realize this, we need to \nmake further progress in Secretariat and management \nreform. While a number of initial steps were taken \nduring the past year, some key reform proposals have \nbeen deferred to the sixty-first session. These need to \nbe adopted and implemented. \n The United Nations reform process will be \nincomplete as long as the Security Council remains \nunchanged. If we want its decisions to be genuinely \naccepted as legitimate and effective, we must reform \nthe Council to better represent the world of today. This \nis a difficult but vital area of reform. While expanding \nthe Council, we must safeguard its efficiency. \nTherefore, there should be no extension of the veto \npower. The use of the veto should be limited. \n The General Assembly will remain at the heart of \nthe United Nations. During the past 12 months, by \nagreeing on a number of essential reforms, the General \nAssembly has in many ways revitalized itself. Let us \nnow continue to make full use of the broad mandate of \nthis crucial body, representing all the Member States of \nthe United Nations. \n The time has come to build on the achievements \nof the United Nations over the past year and to seek \nsolutions to the issues where we have been unable to \nagree. The time has come to prove that the United \nNations can continue to make a difference \u2014 in Darfur, \nthe Middle East or wherever there is conflict, poverty, \nand human suffering. "

Jordan \napplauds the progress achieved in United Nations \nreform under Secretary-General Annan\u2019s tenure. In \nparticular, we welcome the recent creation of the \nHuman Rights Council and of the Peacebuilding \nCommission. \n I come before the Assembly today with a deep \nsense of urgency. Never has it been more important for \nthe world community to act decisively for peace in my \nregion. The recent crisis in the Middle East is a crisis \nfor all nations. There can be no just global order when \naggression and occupation are permitted to take the \nplace of international law. When these occur in a \nregion as strategic as the Middle East, the shockwaves \nrun worldwide. Our young people are asking, where is \nthe justice, where is the will, of the global community? \nWe must answer them by establishing a lasting peace \n  \n \n06-52737 10 \n \nbased on the international legality that we have \npledged to uphold. \n That means a new focus on the core problem. The \nregion\u2019s contemporary crises are outgrowths of a \ncentral grievance felt throughout the Middle East and, \nindeed, the world. That grievance, plain and simple, is \nIsraeli occupation and the denial, over decades, of \nPalestinian rights. Until we end that wrong, conflict \nwill breed more conflict, year after year. \n The Middle East conflict has repeatedly come \nbefore this institution. And the United Nations position \nhas been repeatedly articulated in resolutions \ncondemning aggression and occupation, affirming \nPalestinian self-determination and supporting a process \nfor peace. Yet, each year without progress has brought \nus another crisis, more suffering and more division. It \nis time to take a better path. \n We must, of course, respond immediately to help \nthose who suffer the terrible destruction of conflict. In \nLebanon we must ensure that the Government can \nextend its sovereignty and control over all Lebanese \nterritory. The Arab world and the international \ncommunity must make every effort and must support \nreconstruction and development. Those are vital \nmeasures; but in the Middle East they are only partial \nmeasures. \n We can solve the Arab-Israeli conflict only by \naddressing the issue at its core: the restoration of \ninternationally recognized Palestinian rights. In 2002, \nthe 22 Arab States \u2014 agreeing unanimously \u2014 led the \nway with a breakthrough peace proposal. Our vision \nand our commitment is a viable and independent \nPalestinian State living side by side with a secure \nIsrael. Under the Arab peace initiative, Israel\u2019s security \nwould be guaranteed and the occupation of Palestine \nwould end, in accordance with United Nations \nresolutions. \n Events show clearly that there can be no \nunilateral solution to the conflict. There must be a \ngenuine partnership among all parties, in the context of \ninternational legality and justice. \n Such a global partnership for peace is directly \nconnected to the global partnership for development. \nAround the world, nations at peace are moving forward \nwith economic growth and development: investing in \neducation, building communities and helping to shape \nthe future of the world. But no nation succeeds in \nisolation. All nations and all people \u2014 especially our \nyoung people \u2014 must be able to share in a promising \nfuture. \n We must make peace a priority. We must do so \nnow. No session of this great institution could make a \ngreater contribution to a future of justice and hope. "

        "file_text": "I am pleased to \njoin with preceding speakers in congratulating you on \nyour election to preside over the General Assembly at \nits sixty-first session. The fact that you are a woman \nmakes me doubly happy. In 61 years you are only the \n  \n \n06-53329 14 \n \nthird female President of the Assembly. Throughout \nyour distinguished career, you have championed with \ndetermination and courage the cause of women\u2019s \nrights, and I am confident that you will bring these and \nother outstanding qualities to your presidency. I pledge \nto you the fullest cooperation of the delegation of \nBarbados. \n I would also wish to thank and congratulate your \npredecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, for his leadership at the \nsixtieth session of the General Assembly and in \nparticular for the skill he demonstrated in that very \nchallenging task. \n I must also take this opportunity to say a special \nfarewell on behalf of the Government and people of \nBarbados to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, \nwho has served this Organization with great skill and \ndedication over the past 10 years. The Secretary-\nGeneral has had to face myriad challenges, and he has \nalways found the strength of character, purpose and \nfortitude to craft appropriate solutions. Barbados \nwishes the Secretary-General well as he proceeds into \nretirement at the beginning of next year, and we look \nforward to welcoming him again to the beautiful shores \nof Barbados whenever he feels the need for some \nrespite and recuperation. \n I would also like at this time to welcome our \nnewest Member, Montenegro, into the family of the \nUnited Nations. \n In July this year, the formal return of Haiti to the \ncouncils of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) \nwas greeted with great satisfaction by all. At that time, \nthe CARICOM heads of Government pledged their full \nassistance to Haiti to facilitate efforts to promote that \ncountry\u2019s development and renewal. We call on the \ninternational community to support the strengthening \nof democracy and the social and economic \ndevelopment of Haiti and to disburse in a timely \nmanner the funds pledged for Haiti\u2019s reinvigoration \nand development. We cannot afford to repeat past \nmistakes. \n This session of the General Assembly provides an \nimportant first opportunity to review and assess the \nprogress in the implementation of the decisions of the \nhistoric 2005 World Summit. At this juncture, it is \nBarbados\u2019s opinion that the results are decidedly \nmixed. The reform agenda decided on at the World \nSummit, encompassed a broad spectrum of issues. We \nare pleased that progress has been made in areas such \nas the establishment of the Human Rights Council, the \nPeacebuilding Commission and the Central Emergency \nResponse Fund, the agreement on a counter-terrorism \nstrategy and the revitalization of the General Assembly. \nWe regret that progress on the cluster of development \nissues, which enjoyed broad consensus at the 2005 \nWorld Summit, has been painfully slow. Also, further \nwork needs to be undertaken on Secretariat and \nmanagement reform as well as on reform of the \nSecurity Council. \n The primacy of development on the global \nagenda must be ensured. Barbados considers the \ninitiative to select development as the theme for this \ngeneral debate to be laudable. If we are to achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015, the \nnext ten years must be the decade of implementation, \nin which we collectively mobilize the will and \nresources needed. In this connection, we commend the \nSecretary-General for recommending a number of \nadditional targets that would facilitate the monitoring \nof progress in the implementation of the Summit \nOutcome (resolution 60/1). \n When I addressed this Assembly one year ago, I \ncalled for the adoption of a new target within the MDG \nframework on universal access to sexual and \nreproductive health and rights. Barbados thanks the \nSecretary-General for recognizing the critical link \nbetween sexual and reproductive health and rights and \ndevelopment, and we fully support his recommendation \nfor a new target under Goal 6 of the MDGs. We are \nequally supportive of his other recommendations for \nnew targets on universal access for treatment of \nHIV/AIDS by 2010 and on decent work and productive \nemployment. \n We would, too, like to see speedier \nimplementation of the decisions on increased financial \nresources for development which were made last year \nat the Group of Eight (G-8) meeting at Gleneagles and \nat the World Summit. These resources are now needed \nurgently, particularly by those countries, like my own, \nthat have prepared their comprehensive national \ndevelopment strategies to achieve the MDGs and other \ninternational development goals and objectives. \n While the developing countries bear \nresponsibility for their own development, national \nactions will not be sufficient to bring about their fuller \nparticipation in the global economy. These actions \nmust be complemented by a supportive international \n \n \n15 06-53329 \n \nsystem, the essential elements of which include \nimprovement in global governance, more coherence in \nthe operation of the United Nations system and a \ngreater voice for the United Nations in the global \ndevelopment policy dialogue. \n Changes in global governance have not kept pace \nwith the growth of global interdependence, and far-\nreaching institutional changes are required to bring \nabout a more effective system. We call for \ndemocratization of the governance of the international \nfinancial and trade systems and concrete steps to be \ntaken to end the marginalization of developing \ncountries and small economies in the policy \nformulation and decision-making processes in the \nmultilateral, financial and trade institutions. \nGlobalization must be made more inclusive and its \nbenefits more equitably distributed. \n Barbados also believes that improvement in \nglobal governance must be mirrored in the \nstrengthening of the management and coordination of \nthe United Nations operational activities at the country \nlevel. This will ensure delivery of better coordinated \ndevelopment assistance. It will lead to better \nabsorption of aid by recipient countries and ultimately \nfacilitate their attainment of the MDGs. Indeed, the \nUnited Nations must be developmentally holistic. We \nanxiously await the Secretary-General\u2019s report on the \nwork of the High-level Panel on this issue. A stronger \nUnited Nations voice in development led by a \nrevitalized Economic and Social Council will also \ncontribute to an improved international system. \nBarbados will continue to work with other Member \nStates to adopt a resolution on reform of the Economic \nand Social Council at this sixty-first session of the \nGeneral Assembly. \n Permit me to focus for a few moments on the \nissue of trade; for there is nothing else more important \nfor small developing countries than an improved \nmultilateral trading system if we are to have the chance \nto participate in and benefit from the ongoing process \nof globalization. The failure of WTO talks to reach \nagreement on new commitments for trade reform in the \nagricultural and industrial goods sectors represents a \nvery real crisis in international trade negotiations. The \nchallenges of reforming trade in these areas are not \ninsurmountable. We call on the developed countries to \ndemonstrate a unity of purpose to resolve differences \namong themselves, remembering that this round of \ntrade talks is about development, or more precisely \nabout raising the standard of living of people in \ndeveloping countries. Consistent with the theme of this \nyear\u2019s session of the Assembly, \u201cImplementing a global \npartnership for development\u201d, developed and \ndeveloping countries must partner together to achieve a \nworkable agreement. \n If there is to be a successful outcome to the trade \nnegotiations, a narrow focus on trade liberalization and \nenhanced market access alone will not be enough. For \nwhile it is important to have agreements that open up \naccess to markets, it is even more essential for any \nnegotiated trade agreement to contain provisions that \nwould assist developing countries to implement \npolicies aimed at transforming their economies. In \nother words, market access is meaningless without \ngoods and services with which to trade. \n An adjustment mechanism will be required to \nassist developing countries in coping with the loss of \npreferences, markets and the resultant reduction in \nfinancial resources during this most important \ntransitional phase of their development. For the small \nand vulnerable economies this will mean some form of \nspecial and differential treatment to facilitate their full \nintegration into the multilateral trading system. \n Special and differential treatment should not be \nseen as a concession or as an exception to the rules, but \nrather as a concept based on the development and \npolicy needs of countries at differing levels of \ndevelopment. It should consist of a broad mix of \nprovisions and programmes that recognize and \nappreciate the characteristics of developing countries \nand the economic challenges that trade liberalization \nand globalization pose for them, and it should seek to \naddress these factors genuinely. In the words of the \nPrime Minister of Barbados, The Right Honourable \nOwen Arthur, special and differential treatment is \nnothing more than reciprocity with flexibility. Among \nequals, equality; among unequals, proportionality. \n During this session, the Assembly will return to a \nconsideration of the agenda item on the Caribbean Sea. \nWe appeal to the members of the international \ncommunity to recognize the fragility of this precious \nshared natural resource of the Caribbean, and its \nimportance for most of our present and future \neconomic activity, and agree on measures that will \nneed to be taken to recognize the Caribbean Sea as a \nspecial area within the context of sustainable \ndevelopment. \n  \n \n06-53329 16 \n \n Also during this Assembly session, the two \nhundredth anniversary of the abolition of the slave \ntrade will be recognized. Barbados joins other \ndelegations in requesting the Assembly to set aside a \nday in late March of next year to commemorate this \nimportant date. This will not only deepen our \nknowledge and understanding of slavery and the slave \ntrade, but also contribute to the removal of all the \nvestiges of slavery. \n Recent events suggest that we need to remain \never vigilant to threats of terrorism. They further \nremind us that once again we face increasing \nchallenges to world peace and security. Barbados is of \nthe view that there must be a concerted effort on the \npart of the international community to ensure that \ndisputes among States do not continuously result in \nmilitary action and loss of lives and that States remain \nfaithful to the rules of humanitarian law and civilian \nrights. \n The questioning of the efficacy of the United \nNations has not abated in spite of the ongoing reform \nprocess, and the threat to multilateralism remains real. \nIn this, our fortieth year of membership of the United \nNations, Barbados reaffirms its faith in the \nOrganization and proclaims its unwavering \ncommitment to multilateralism. Over the past 40 years, \nBarbados has played its part in strengthening and \nwidening the role of the United Nations to enable it to \npromote and protect human rights, to eradicate poverty \nand disease and to cultivate a global culture of peace. \n Strengthening the role of the United Nations \nsystem in the management of global affairs and \nupholding and defending its moral authority remain \nkey foreign policy priorities of the Government of \nBarbados. With the growing complexity and \nunpredictability of international affairs, especially in \nthe context of globalization, and with the emergence of \nnew challenges to peace and security, the fulfilment of \nthe role of the United Nations remains critical. It is \nnow more than ever that we need to strengthen the \nstructures and institutions of the international system to \nsafeguard our common interests in achieving a global \norder of peace and economic and social progress for \nall. We must all work together to reform this vital \ncommunity of nations and ensure its pre-eminence in \nmatters of development, human rights, and peace and \nsecurity, and that it remains the principal forum for \nexercising multilateralism. \n We are not at liberty to abstain from this task.

        "file_text": "The United Nations \nis now more at the centre of international affairs than it \nhas been for many years. We see the Secretary-General \nand his staff driving diplomacy. They are on the \nground, moving forward peace efforts in the Middle \nEast and coordinating and sustaining peace operations \nin Lebanon. The United Nations is drawing up \nmandates and getting ready for new and urgent \nassignments, such as the one in Darfur. \n The United Nations is assisting countries coming \nout of conflict, such as Burundi and Sierra Leone. It is \ngiving protection under international law to soldiers \nand civilians in Afghanistan. It is also launching a \nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy. \n It is to the United Nations that we all turn when \nother processes fail, and Norway is working hard to \nsupport its leading role, be it by sending naval units to \n  \n \n06-52737 48 \n \nLebanese waters, by having soldiers in Afghanistan, or \nby training future peacekeepers for Darfur. \n The policy platform of the Norwegian \nGovernment states that: \n\u201cIt is in Norway\u2019s best interest that we have a \nUnited Nations-led world order. The Government \nwill therefore work to strengthen the United \nNations and international law.\u201d \n The United Nations can count on Norway. We \nbelieve that our combined efforts in the areas of peace, \nthe environment and development will pass the tests of \nforesight as well as hindsight. \n Those of us who are staunch supporters of a \nstrong and effective United Nations must also be key \nplayers in driving the process of change and renewal. I \nhave the honour to serve with colleagues on a panel for \nUnited Nations reform appointed by the Secretary-\nGeneral. The Panel is drawing up proposals on how the \nUnited Nations can deliver more and do so better and \nfaster in the areas of development, humanitarian \nassistance and the environment. \n It was the 2005 Summit that called for greater \ncoherence in and better governance of the United \nNations. Over time the United Nations has added new \nbodies, new organs and new activities to its portfolio. \nFew people comprehend the overall picture; few can \ntell what the United Nations is doing in a particular \ncountry for development; and few can definitively \nanswer how much money the United Nations is \nspending in a specific country. \n In several countries the United Nations system is \nrepresented by more than 20 different organizations. A \ncountry such as Ghana is reported to be host to 14 \ndifferent United Nations agencies. Many United \nNations organizations deal with many of the same \nissues. This is simply overlapping. More than 20 \ndifferent United Nations organizations deal with water \nand more than 10 United Nations organizations deal \nwith the promotion of education for young girls. This \nleads to a fragmented, loosely governed system; it \nleads to duplication and reduces possibilities for \nmonitoring results. This is not the way we would \ngovern our own affairs \u2014 nationally or locally. It is \nwe, the Member States, who are to blame. \n We must put an end to duplication, fragmentation \nand rivalry between different parts of the system. \nInstead, we must focus on results. We must be willing \nto change, adapt to new situations and relinquish tasks \nthat are no longer needed. We need to ensure that less \nis spent on bureaucracy, and more is spent in the field. \n Let us take, for example, the coordination of \nhumanitarian relief after the establishment of the \nCentral Emergency Response Fund headed by Jan \nEgeland. With these resources, he is able to coordinate \nmore effectively through the direction of the financial \nflows. In the absence of a crisis governance and \nfinancing cannot be separated. \n All matters of reform seem extremely \ncontroversial here in the United Nations, but they must \nbe carried out. The most irresponsible thing we could \ndo now would be to do nothing, i.e. to allow bodies, \ngoverning boards and their representatives to duplicate \nwork and squander scarce resources. \n The report of the High-level Panel on System-\nwide Coherence will be presented to the Secretary-\nGeneral later this year. We have had an open, \ntransparent process. We have held meetings in all parts \nof the world and listened to a great many stakeholders, \npractitioners and country representatives. My plea to \nyou all \u2014 to all the Member States \u2014 is to meet that \nreport with an open mind. \n Let me be clear about this: any efficiency gain \nmust be channelled back to the developing world. \nEvery single cent gained in improved performance or \nreduced overhead must go to aid that reaches the \nneedy. Recipients and donors alike would find that \nattractive. \n We are in the fortunate position of having set \nclear goals for the Organization. Six years ago we \nadopted the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \nhere in New York. We pledged to do our utmost to \nachieve these goals \u2014 Norway is working on all eight. \nThis year we give 0.96 per cent of our gross national \nproduct in development assistance and we will reach \nthe 1 per cent mark in a few years. \n Now we have vigorously set out to take a lead in \nrealizing Millennium Development Goal 4, which \ncompels us to reduce child mortality by two thirds by \n2015. Every year, children, in numbers equal to one \nand a half times the population of New York City, die \nbefore their fifth birthday \u2014 most of them from \npreventable diseases. A number of children, equal to \nthe death toll in the recent tsunami, die every month \nfrom pneumonia alone. Vaccines, costing just $20 for \n \n \n49 06-52737 \n \neach child, could have prevented most of those \ncommon diseases. \n Allowing such child mortality puts shackles on \nthe growth potential of States, prolonging the long \nnight of underdevelopment. This can and must be \nchanged. Yesterday I announced that the Norwegian \nGovernment has decided to increase its annual \ncontribution to child mortality and vaccines from \n$75 million per year to $125 million next year. In total, \nNorway will contribute $1.3 billion through 2015 for \nvaccine-related activities to reduce child mortality. \n The next step will be to develop a global strategy \nfor reaching Millennium Development Goal 4, \nspecifically a plan for financing and execution. \nMeeting that Goal, and other Millennium Development \nGoals, really depends on United Nations reform. An \norganization that sets goals and carves them in stone \u2014 \nas we did when we adopted the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals \u2014 such an organization must adapt \nits structure and methods of work to these goals. \n We also have to reform the United Nations to \nreduce child mortality, i.e. in order to save lives as we \nsaid we should. We have done great things in the past \nand have greater means than any other generation and \nany other organization. I invite you all to join this \nglobal campaign for child survival. "

        "file_text": "Madam President, on the occasion of your election to \nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nfirst session, I am pleased to convey to you and to our \nbrotherly country Bahrain my most sincere \ncongratulations. We are convinced that your experience \nand competence will enrich the work of this session \nand will contribute to its success.  \n I should also like to take this opportunity to \ncommend your predecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, for his \nconstant efforts to implement the recommendations of \nthe 2005 Summit related to the reform of the \nOrganization and the adoption of the two resolutions \ncreating the Human Rights Council and the \nPeacebuilding Commission. \n I take this opportunity to convey my special \nthanks to Mr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the \nUnited Nations, for the valuable efforts he has been \ntirelessly making to enhance the Organization\u2019s role \nand advance its performance, and for proving his \ncapability to realize a consensus on several complex \nissues and to advance the reform of the Organization. \n We note with satisfaction the important steps \nachieved since the 2005 Summit aimed at developing \nthe Organization\u2019s role and work for the sake of further \nefficiency in its action, which will contribute to \nanchoring the values of justice and moderation in \ninternational relations. While insisting on the need to \nconfer more transparency on the Security Council and \npursue efforts to reach consensus on its enlargement, \nwhich will ensure equitable representation of all \ninternational parties and allow the Council to perform \nits main functions in an environment of dialogue and \nconsensus, we also call for strengthening the General \nAssembly\u2019s prerogatives, revitalizing its role, and \nmaking it work more efficiently. \n Tunisia, which had the honour of being among \nthe first members of the Human Rights Council, \nreiterates its determination to participate actively in the \nwork of this new United Nations institution and to \ncontribute to achieving the noble objectives for which \nit was created, especially those related to respect for \nhuman rights in their global meaning, as agreed at the \ninternational level. \n Our world today sees numerous rapid changes \nand developments in security, political, economic and \nsocial issues while time many international issues \nremain unresolved. Tunisia \u2014 which has supported the \nMiddle East peace process since its inception and has \nalways called for dialogue, negotiation and recourse to \ninternational legality \u2014 stresses again the need to find \na just, lasting and comprehensive settlement to the \nArab-Israeli conflict that will allow all the peoples of \nthe region to live in peace and security. Taking into \naccount the hardships and suffering that the fraternal \nPalestinian people are undergoing, such as the siege, \nTunisia calls upon the international community to \nprovide them with international protection urgently. \nTunisia also renews its call for active parties, primarily \nthe Quartet, to ensure appropriate conditions for \nreviving all tracks of the peace process in accordance \nwith ongoing Arab efforts, to help the Palestinian \npeople regain their legitimate national rights, including \nthe establishment of their independent State and to \nallow sister States Syria and Lebanon to recover their \noccupied territories. \n Tunisia reiterates its solidarity with Lebanon \nfollowing the Israeli aggression, which caused \ndestruction and huge loss of life and property, and \nrenews its call on the international community to \ncontribute to the reconstruction of Lebanon. In this \nregard, Tunisia commends the results of the recent \nStockholm donor summit.  \n Tunisia also expresses the hope that the fraternal \nIraqi people will find appropriate solutions to their \nnational causes in the framework of the political \nprocess, in order to maintain national unity and \nguarantee security and stability, which will allow Iraqis \nto devote themselves to reconstruction. \n To face the challenges on the international scene, \nespecially the phenomenon of extremism and terrorism, \n  \n \n06-53609 10 \n \nthe international community must enhance its efforts \nand cooperation. Tunisia, which was among the first to \nwarn against these dangers, renews its call for an \ninternational conference, under United Nations \nauspices, to elaborate an international code of conduct \nto combat terrorism to which all parties would be \ncommitted. Tunisia has also called for tackling all root \ncauses of terrorism \u2014 mainly injustice, the policy of \ndouble standards, and economic and social conditions \nthat generate frustration and marginalization \u2014 within \nthe framework of a comprehensive approach. \n To implement this approach, the international \ncommunity adopted the Tunisian initiative to set up a \nworld solidarity fund to fight poverty and exclusion \nand to lay the foundations for a more equitable and \nsolidarity-based vision for development. We hope that \nall relevant parties will increase their efforts to provide \nthe necessary financing to operate this mechanism. \n Spreading the culture of tolerance, dialogue and \nrespect for beliefs and religious symbols in all \ncountries has today become one of the urgent \nnecessities for reinforcing rapprochement, \nunderstanding and solidarity among peoples and for \nestablishing constructive international relations based \non moderation and respect for the specificities and \ncivilizations of peoples and on rejection of violence, \nextremism and intolerance.  \n In this regard, and based on its firm belief in \nthose principles, Tunisia proposed several initiatives, \nsuch as the adoption of the Carthage Charter for \nTolerance in 1995, the appeal of His Excellency the \nPresident of the Republic, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, for \na pedagogy of tolerance, the proclamation of the 2001 \nTunis Declaration on Dialogue among Civilizations, \nand the establishment of the Ben Ali Chair for \nDialogue among Civilizations and Religions. \n In spite of all the efforts made, achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals faces difficulties that \nrequire more collective efforts by all components of \nthe international community, especially economically \nstrong and developed countries, in the field of \nfinancing the development of the countries of the \nSouth and speeding up the transfer of technology to \nthem. With regard to efforts to reinforce resources for \ndeveloping countries, Tunisia again appeals for further \naction to relieve the debt burden of the least developed \ncountries and to recycle those of middle-income \ncountries by transforming them into investments in \ndevelopment projects considered to be a priority by \nthose countries. \n Convinced that the digital divide is one of the \nmain challenges to development, Tunisia initiated the \ncall for a world summit on the information society \nunder the auspices of the United Nations. In November \n2005 it was honoured to host the second phase of this \nsummit, which produced important results and laid the \nfoundations for a new world vision aimed at reducing \nthe digital divide between countries and establishing \nthe bases of a society of knowledge by adopting the \nTunis Agenda and the Tunis Commitment. We are \nconfident that the results of that summit will benefit \nfrom appropriate consideration and follow-up by the \nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies, as will all \nstakeholders in information technology and \ncommunication. \n Tunisia has directed all its capabilities to \nelevating itself to the level of an advanced country \nwithin a future-oriented vision, the foundations of \nwhich were laid by President Ben Ali. That vision \nincludes all political, economic, social and \ndevelopmental domains. It materialized in a set of deep \nreforms that led to the reinforcement of democracy, \npromotion of a culture of human rights at both \nconceptual and concrete levels, consecration of public \nfreedoms, and participation of all segments of Tunisian \nsociety in the political life of the country, all in the \nframework of the rule of law and the institutions of the \nState. Furthermore, Tunisia\u2019s economic and social \nachievements allowed it to attain a high rank among \nthe group of countries with the highest human \ndevelopment index. That was appreciated by \ninternational financial institutions and specialized \nUnited Nations agencies. Tunisia pursues this process \nof reform and achievement with determination and \nperseverance. \n Within its Maghreb, Arab and Mediterranean \nenvironment, Tunisia endeavours to strengthen \nrelations of cooperation, solidarity, dialogue and \nconsultation among all parties in order to reinforce \nsecurity and stability, achieve the aspirations of the \npeoples of the region for an integral development and \nencourage economic complementarity. For Tunisia, the \nestablishment of the Arab Maghreb remains a strategic \nchoice and in terms of civilization, a gain for peoples \nof the region, laying the foundations for increased \nintegration and complementarity among the Maghreb \ncountries. Tunisia works alongside its sister States of \n \n \n11 06-53609 \n \nthe region to further revitalize the march of the union \nin the interest of its peoples.  \n Our country is also keen to enhance its strong \nrelationship with the European Union and to develop it \ntowards the establishment of a solidarity-based \npartnership, which we hope will advance in a context \nof mutual respect and dialogue, thus serving the \ninterests of all parties. \n Tunisia, as part of the African continent, \nrelentlessly continues to support the efforts of the \nAfrican Union to finalize the establishment of its \ninstitutions and reinvigorate them, as well as to \nenhance its role in achieving solidarity-based \ndevelopment, security and stability throughout the \ncontinent. In this regard Tunisia has actively \nparticipated in United Nations peacekeeping \noperations, especially in Africa, convinced, as always, \nof the necessity to join international efforts to \nstrengthen the foundations of peace and security \nthroughout the world.  \n Although we believe that the future of the \ncontinent remains in the hands of Africans and that \ndevelopment can be achieved primarily by relying on \ntheir own capabilities, Africa needs more support and \nassistance from the international community to enable \nit to face the challenges and achieve the aspirations of \nits peoples. \n The strong relationship and interaction among \npeace, security, development and social stability in \ntoday\u2019s world confirm the need for all nations to join \nmultilateral efforts on the basis of the values of \ndialogue, consensus and solidarity. That will help in \nfinding the appropriate solutions to the challenges \nposed. We believe that the United Nations remains the \nideal forum to deal with these urgent issues based on \nthe values and principles of its Charter.  "

        "file_text": "The Republic of Nauru \ncongratulates the President of the General Assembly on \nher election. Nauru commends her pledge to work with \nMember States to achieve the objectives of the United \nNations Charter with transparency and with respect for \nall views and positions. She has our support and \ncooperation as she leads this Assembly in the days \nahead. \n Nauru congratulates the outgoing President, Jan \nEliasson, on his appointment as Foreign Minister of \nSweden and commends him for implementing the \nWorld Summit Outcome Document. His significant \ncontribution has been crucial to the United Nations \nreform process. \n We pay tribute to Secretary-General Kofi Annan \nand thank him for his leadership, courage and vision \nover the past 10 years. \n While we aim to reform this great Organization, \nin line with the realities of the world, we continue to \nwitness major upheavals, conflicts, explosions of \nviolence, natural disasters, terrorism and the giants we \nhave yet to conquer \u2014 that is, poverty, disease and \nhuman and environmental degradation. We must assure \nthe people of the world that we are committed to \nfinding lasting solutions to global problems, while \nupholding the principles of the United Nations with \nfull respect for human rights. \n But Nauru is concerned that much has been said, \nbut very little has been done. We must, therefore, focus \non doing more, as opposed to talking more. And, of \nequal importance, we must be seen to be doing more, \nnot seen to be talking more. \n As a small island developing State, Nauru\u2019s \nconcerns relate primarily to development. Yet we have \nseen little, if any, action to implement the outcome of \nthe Mauritius summit meeting on the sustainable \ndevelopment of small island developing States held last \nyear. There have been no substantial reductions in \nglobal emissions since the Kyoto Protocol of 1997. The \nMonterrey Consensus, whereby the wealthier countries \nwould increase official development assistance to \n0.7 per cent of their gross national product, is still far \nfrom being translated into reality. \n Despite private and public pledges by the United \nNations, we in the Pacific have yet to see the \nestablishment of United Nations offices in the smaller \n  \n \n06-53317 6 \n \nPacific member countries of the United Nations, such \nas Nauru.  \n Despite this Organization\u2019s pledge for \nuniversality and the protection of human rights for all, \nwe still deny the 23 million people of Taiwan their \nright to peace and to development without threat of \nattack, including through the denial of their right to \nrepresentation at the United Nations. \n Mr. Romulo (Philippines), Vice-President, took \nthe Chair. \n We support the inclusivity of the United Nations, \nand we reject threats to human dignity, including the \ndenial that the Holocaust ever occurred, together with \nany call for the elimination of any responsible Member \nState of this Organization. \n That is why Nauru will join other Member \ncountries in protesting and seeking legal redress to the \nviolations of the rules of procedure of the General \nAssembly that occurred during the meeting of the \nGeneral Committee last week. Two questions were to \nbe debated: a proactive role for the United Nations in \nmaintaining peace and security in East Asia, and the \nquestion of the representation and participation of the \n23 million people of Taiwan in the United Nations. \n The employment of procedural tricks to deny \nmember countries their right to take part in the debate \ncalls into question the universality of the United \nNations, for such tricks only serve to deprive Nauru \nand like-minded countries of their right to be heard. \nEven more important, it underlines the need for reform \nof the United Nations. \n There must be a greater voice of the many \npeoples of the globe, including those of the developing \nworld and those countries that can better represent the \ninterests of the developing world. Nauru, therefore, \nechoes the words of the Secretary-General when he \nsays: \n  \u201cI believe very strongly in the need for \nSecurity Council reform, and I have said time and \ntime again that no reform of the UN will be \ncomplete without Security Council reform. ... \nThey should pursue Security Council reform \nbecause it is part of the reason why we have \ntensions in the Organization today. Because quite \na lot of Members feel that our governance \nstructure is anachronistic and we cannot continue \nto have a situation where the power base is \nperceived to be controlled by a limited number of \nfive Member States.\u201d \n We believe we must move quickly to reform the \nCouncil and also to include Japan, Brazil, India and \nGermany in the permanent membership. \n We encourage the United Nations, as part of the \nreform package, to consider a more binding framework \nby which the many declarations arising from the \nOrganization and its many meetings can be \nimplemented and measured. Clearly, our moral \nobligations are not producing the desired results. It is \ntime to build a global partnership within a binding \nframework in order to facilitate the implementation of \nresolutions. \n We believe that each developing country has \nprimary responsibility for its own development. The \nyear 2005 marked a significant chapter in the \ndevelopment of my country when we presented our \nfirst national development strategy at our first donor \nroundtable meeting. Our national development strategy \ncalls for a partnership. It was drafted by community \nleaders, civil society, the private sector and the \nGovernment of Nauru, based on a national vision. It \noutlines our priorities and the steps required to reach \nthose goals within a 20-year framework. We gratefully \nacknowledge our development partners. They have \ngiven us tangible assistance that has improved our \nlives.  \n However, we still receive offers of development \nassistance that come with unrealistic conditions \nattached. In some cases, such assistance is used as a \ntool of interventionist foreign policy, without giving \npriority to the human aspect of the development \nagenda. \n For any fragile developing State, delayed \nassistance creates a perception of failure and \nincompetence and leads to political and social \ninstability. My delegation is disappointed that the \nintention of the United Nations to expand its presence \nin Nauru and other Pacific countries continues \nunfulfilled. The purpose of an expanded presence \nwould be to achieve the MDGs and other development \nobjectives. We call on the United Nations to recognize \nour urgent needs and to act with certainty, following a \nrealistic timetable. \n My delegation believes that good governance \nyields good returns for all people. Nauru is emerging \n \n \n7 06-53317 \n \nfrom governance problems caused by shortcomings in \nthe Constitution adopted at our independence. We are \ngrateful for the assistance from the United Nations \nDemocracy Fund that will facilitate the consultative \nprocess for a review of our Constitution. That process \nis critical to the political stability and accountability of \nfuture Governments. \n In the Summit Outcome, we agreed on measures \naimed at protecting our common environment, \nincluding a call for a more coherent institutional \nframework to address the environmental challenges of \ntoday. We encourage revisiting the climate change \nagenda to give more urgency to action as opposed to \npledges. \n In this regard, we also welcome the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s establishment of a High-level Panel on \nUnited Nations System-wide Coherence. Nauru aligns \nitself with the interventions made by the leaders of \nPacific nations who have taken the floor before me \nregarding the concerns and challenges facing the \nPacific Island States. As island States, we are \nvulnerable to the forces of nature because of our \nremoteness and small populations. As island States, we \nare affected by factors such as shortage of manpower \nand technical capacity, weak institutional capacity, \nlimited financial resources and too little foreign direct \ninvestment. We lack information and access to \nenvironmentally friendly and affordable technologies, \nincluding new and sustainable energy sources. Our \nchallenges are intensified by a lack of commitment \nfrom the United Nations to support our development \naspirations. We hope that the High-level Panel\u2019s report \nwill recognize these special challenges and propose \nrealistic solutions. \n Sustainable development and basic human rights \ncannot thrive in a world without peace and security. We \nmust continue to strengthen our collective efforts in \nresolving conflicts and threats of terrorism through \nprevention and effective political solutions. \n The proliferation of small arms continues to pose \na threat to peace and security in our region. My \ndelegation shares the view of the Secretary-General in \nhis report that, \u201cThese weapons may be small, but they \ncause massive destruction\u201d (A/61/1, para. 102). Nauru \nis deeply concerned that the 2006 Small Arms Review \nConference ended without agreement on further \nmeasures to combat this problem. If it is true that \nwhoever is faithful in the small things will also be \nfaithful in the bigger things, then how can we progress \ntowards the elimination of weapons adaptable to mass \ndestruction while failing to agree on the issue of small \narms and light weapons? \n Finally, \u201cCan two walk together, except they be \nagreed?\u201d Let us reflect on this passage from the Book \nof Amos as we renew our partnership of commitment \nto spare no effort.

I would also like \nto congratulate you, Madam President, on your \nunanimous election as the President of the Assembly. \nYour election is a reflection of the General Assembly\u2019s \nconfidence in your personal abilities and the high \nesteem that the Kingdom of Bahrain enjoys. My \ncountry has fond memories of 21 September 1971, \nwhen our two Kingdoms became proud members of the \nUnited Nations. My delegation also wishes to pay \ntribute to your predecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, for the \nexemplary manner in which he directed the work of the \nsixtieth session. Under his stewardship, a number of \nimportant decisions of the 2005 World Summit were \nimplemented. We are confident that, under your \ndynamic leadership, Madam President, the sixty-first \nwill be able to successfully complete all its tasks. \nBhutan is honoured to serve as one of the Vice-\nPresidents. We assure you of our full cooperation and \nsupport. \n We fully support the theme for the general \ndebate, \u201cImplementing a global partnership for \ndevelopment\u201d. In this era of globalization and \ntechnological advances that have brought \nunprecedented prosperity to a minority of the world\u2019s \npopulation, the international community must unite \nforces to extricate the vast majority of the world\u2019s \ninhabitants from the vicious circle of poverty and \ndestitution. The global partnership must engender \ngreater political will to address the problems of trade, \nmarket access, technology transfer and a host of other \nissues that impede growth and development in \ndeveloping countries. It is also imperative that the \noutcomes of major United Nations conferences and \nsummits, especially those relating to development, are \nfully implemented by all. \n The Midterm Comprehensive Global Review of \nthe Brussels Programme of Action for the Least \n  \n \n06-53317 16 \n \nDeveloped Countries for the Decade 2001-2010, which \nwas undertaken earlier this week, has revealed much \nless progress than desired. It is my delegation\u2019s hope \nthat, as provided in the declaration that was adopted by \nthe review meeting, all stakeholders will genuinely \ncommit themselves to the special needs of the least \ndeveloped countries and work towards the full \nimplementation of the Programme of Action, which \nconstitutes a fundamental framework for strong global \npartnership to accelerate sustained economic growth, \nsustainable development and poverty eradication in the \nleast developed countries (LDCs). \n Owing to the limited prospects for raising \ndomestic resources, attracting foreign investment and \nsecuring funds on commercial terms, official \ndevelopment assistance (ODA) is a critical resource for \nLDCs in achieving the goals and targets of the Brussels \nProgramme of Action. In fact, for many LDCs, such as \nmine, ODA constitutes the primary resource for \ndevelopment. My delegation therefore appeals to all \ndeveloped countries to abide by their aid commitment \nto allocate 0.7 per cent of their gross national product \nto ODA, with 0.15 per cent to 0.20 per cent of that \nearmarked for least developed countries. \n A summit meeting of landlocked developing \ncountries was held on 14 September in Havana, Cuba. \nThat was the first-ever summit meeting of landlocked \ndeveloping countries and it highlighted the serious \nconstraints faced by landlocked developing countries. \nIt is our hope that the international community will \nduly consider the problems of landlocked developing \ncountries and support the road map for global \npartnership set out by the Almaty Programme of \nAction. \n The task of reforming the United Nations remains \nincomplete, in view of the slow progress in areas such \nas the strengthening of the Economic and Social \nCouncil and the reform of the Security Council. It is \nnot enough to say that the reform of those bodies is \nrequired, while we allow ourselves to be constrained \nby other considerations. We need to strengthen the \nEconomic and Social Council to enable it to deal \neffectively with the social, economic and development \nissues that are of primary concern for the vast majority \nof Member States. \n The Security Council needs to be reformed to \nreflect today\u2019s realities and challenges. My delegation \nstrongly believes that the status quo is no longer an \noption. The Security Council has to be urgently \nreformed in all its aspects, including its composition \nand working methods. It is regrettable that the proposal \nsubmitted by the Group of Four at the sixtieth session \nwas not acted upon. It is my delegation\u2019s hope that the \nsixty-first session will be able to bring about real \nreform of the Security Council. \n We welcome the adoption by the sixtieth session \nof the resolution on the revitalization of the General \nAssembly. We must continue with our efforts to further \nenhance the role, authority, effectiveness and efficiency \nof this body, which is the chief deliberative, \npolicymaking and representative organ of the United \nNations. \n Terrorism continues to threaten peace, security \nand development in many parts of the world. \n The recent train bombings in Mumbai, India, and \nthe plot to blow up transatlantic aircraft uncovered in \nLondon last August remind us of the need to take \nstrong measures against international terrorism. In that \nregard, my delegation welcomes the General \nAssembly\u2019s adoption at its sixtieth session of the \nUnited Nations Global Counter-terrorism Strategy \n(resolution 60/288). The next important steps are to \nimplement the Strategy and to renew efforts to \nconclude a comprehensive convention on international \nterrorism. \n Recent developments in the Middle East once \nagain highlight the urgency of finding a solution to the \nproblem there. My delegation calls upon all concerned \nparties and others in a position to help to strive for a \njust and comprehensive solution. \n I would like to take this opportunity to express \nmy country\u2019s deep appreciation to His Excellency \nMr. Kofi Annan for his dedicated service to the United \nNations as its Secretary-General. We are confident that \nthe next Secretary-General, who should be from Asia, \nwill lead the United Nations to greater heights in the \nservice of humankind. \n Allow me to take a few moments to apprise the \ninternational community of the progress that Bhutan is \nmaking. As a small, least developed country with a \npopulation of just over half a million people, the \nhurdles we face are enormous. Yet, under the far-\nsighted leadership of His Majesty the King, the country \nhas been making significant progress in all fields. \n \n \n17 06-53317 \n \n On the political front, most notable is the \nculmination of the reforms that will usher in \nparliamentary democracy in 2008. Those changes are \ntaking place in an environment of peace, progress and \nstability. We are hopeful that the transition will be \nsmooth and the final outcome enduring. \n Bhutan\u2019s development is guided by the conviction \nthat human well-being and contentment must be \npromoted through the pursuit of material progress, on \nthe one hand, and the fulfilment of spiritual and \nemotional needs, on the other. That development \nphilosophy, as I have stated before in the Assembly, is \ndefined as the pursuit of gross national happiness, \nrather than just gross national product. We will be \nhappy to share our experience on that development \nphilosophy, as we did at the international conference \non the theme \u201cRethinking development: local pathways \nto global well-being\u201d, which was held in Nova Scotia, \nCanada, in June 2005. We believe that the happy planet \nindex that was recently published in the United \nKingdom by the New Economics Foundation bears \nclose a relation to the development paradigm pursued \nby Bhutan. \n I wish the General Assembly every success.

I would \nalso like to express our deep appreciation to the \nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his continuous \nvision, leadership and efforts to revitalize and reform \nthe United Nations. \n This year, based on the 2005 Summit Document, \nAlbania has undertaken concrete actions to promote the \nthree main pillars, namely, development, security and \nhuman rights, in order to implement the ambitious \nUnited Nations agenda of reforms. We are filled with \noptimism at the positive results achieved by the \nestablishment of the Peacebuilding Commission, the \nHuman Rights Council and the Central Emergency \nResponse Fund. Reform of the Secretariat and \nmanagement also give us optimism and lead us to \nbelieve that the United Nations must continue these \nreforms in order to respond in the best possible way to \nnew realities and challenges. \n We reiterate our willingness and intent to work \nclosely with all delegations and to reach as much \nagreement as possible by consensus in all significant \naspects of the reforms and we believe that solid and \ninclusive management reform is needed for the \nstrengthening of the United Nations in order to \nincrease transparency and responsibility and achieve a \nmore effective and efficient administration of \nresources. We support the efforts to reform the \nEconomic and Social Council, while we also believe \nthat reform in the Security Council will produce \nprogress and results, thanks to the efforts and \ncommitment of all member countries. \n We welcome the High-level Meeting on \nInternational Migration and Development, because we \nbelieve that international migration that is supported by \nthe right policies can bring major advantages to the \ndevelopment of the countries of origin and destination, \nin terms of respecting and guaranteeing the basic rights \nof migrants, while avoiding discrimination and double \nstandards. \n The United Nations role also continues to remain \nvery important in the war against terrorism, especially \nin securing an effective, global and intensive response \nto this threat. We praise the recent consensual adoption \nof the Global Strategy against Terrorism. We also feel \nthat the adoption of a comprehensive convention on \ninternational terrorism would represent a precious \nachievement furthering United Nations efforts to \ncombat terrorism. Albania is collaborating very closely \nwith all the United Nations bodies in the war against \nterrorism, and the visits of the Monitoring Team, \nestablished pursuant to Security Council resolution \n1267 (1999), and the visit of the Security Council \nCounter-Terrorism Committee, established pursuant to \nSecurity Council resolution 1540 (2004), demonstrate \nthat Albania is fulfilling its obligations to prevent the \nactivity and financing of terrorist groups at the national \nlevel. \n We have supported Security Council resolution \n1701 (2006) on the Israeli-Lebanon conflict, which \nprovides for a peaceful solution of the issue and the \nsending of peacekeeping forces to that area. Albania \nhas joined other countries in giving financial support to \nrebuild Lebanon. \n The main orientation of Albania\u2019s foreign policy \nremains European and Euro-Atlantic integration, and \nthat is why the efforts of the Albanian State and society \nare directed towards meeting European Union and \nNATO standards. A few days ago, the European \nParliament ratified the Stabilization and Association \nAgreement between Albania and the European Union, \n \n \n25 06-52885 \n \nwhich places our country at the most important  \nstage \u2014 that of fulfilling the obligations that stem from \nthe Agreement, and all Albanian political groups and \nthe entire society are conscious of this. We all believe \nthat actual membership in the European Council and \nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in \nEurope, and the prospective accession to the EU and \nNATO are part of the natural move towards \ndevelopment, rather than an objective per se. \n We have established relations based on active \ncooperation and dialogue at the regional level with all \nthe countries concerned by actively working to \nstrengthen regional security and stability. Together \nwith the countries of the region, we have created an \nagenda of joint action against terrorism, organized \ncrime, the circulation of arms and border management. \nIn the same way, we have undertaken concrete \ninitiatives to encourage economic development in the \nregion. \n Albania believes that the main issue to be \nresolved in our region continues to be that of Kosovo. \nKosovo has made great progress in terms of internal \nstability; advancing the fulfilment of the required \ninternational standards; improving inter-ethnic \nrelations; establishing and efficiently running central \nand local Kosovar institutions; its serious and \nprofessional commitment to the process of negotiations \nwith Belgrade through the intermediary of the Special \nEnvoy of the Secretary-General, President Ahtisaari; \nand in its gradual integration into regional activities, \ninitiatives and structures as part of Kosovo\u2019s \nintegrating process in the European Union and NATO. \n The leadership of Kosovo, the representative \nKosovar institutions, the political opposition, civil \nsociety, the media and the entire civil factor are \ndemonstrating social and political cohesion and \nincreasing unity and open and full cooperation with the \ninternational factor to build a sovereign, independent, \ndemocratic and multi-ethnic State integrated into the \nEuropean and Euro-Atlantic structures and at peace \nwith its neighbours. The United Nations Mission and \nthe commitments of the Secretary-General have also \nplayed a significant part in that success. \n The progress of talks between Pristina and \nBelgrade in Vienna is positive. We encourage the \ncontinuation of constructive dialogue and hope that the \nSerbian side will do the same by demonstrating \nrealism, solidarity with the will of the international \ncommunity, and respect for the aspirations of the \npeople of Kosovo. Albania opposes any possible \nscenario for the partition or disintegration of Kosovo, \nwhich past experience suggests could entail conflict \nand instability in the future. \n We support a full and speedy solution to the issue \nof the status of Kosovo that takes into consideration \nthe will of its inhabitants and guarantees functionality \nwithin the Kosovar State and society and the freedoms \nof the minority communities. A sovereign, \nindependent, democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovar \nState with a clear Euro-Atlantic perspective will serve \nthe interests of peace and stability in the region and \nbeyond. \n The view occasionally expressed that the \nindependence of Kosovo would encourage the \nimplementation of similar solutions to current \nproblems in other countries and regions does not seem \naccurate to us. The solution of any problem must take \nthe historical and geographical context into account, \nalong with other considerations that exclude the search \nfor and mechanical application of inappropriate \nanalogies. Given the historical, juridical and moral \naspects of the issue of Kosovo, as well as the fact that \nit evolved through the convulsions and wars that \naccompanied the disintegration of the former \nYugoslavia, I believe that its solution in accordance \nwith the will of the citizens of Kosovo themselves is \nentirely legitimate. In that light, the solution will also \nmark the final stage of that disintegration and the \nturning of a new page as part of democratic \ndevelopments in the Balkans over the past decade. \n Albania is at an important phase in the process of \ncomprehensive institutional, legal and economic \nreform with a view to adopting European models and \nstandards. We are committed to improving governance \nat all levels to ensure that it adheres as closely as \npossible to the interests of our citizens and the country. \nThe current Government has undertaken various \neconomic initiatives to liberalize procedures and \nenhance our capacity to attract foreign investment. We \nare aware that this objective can be achieved only \nthrough reforms that realistically promote a \ncompetitive and open market for unfettered initiative \nthat offers as many people as possible the opportunity \nto conduct business or to be employed and is \ncoordinated with reforms in the priority public sectors. \nSuch reforms include increasing investment in \ninfrastructure and the energy, education and health \n  \n \n06-52885 26 \n \nsectors, complemented by effective social policies in \nfavour of social groups and individuals in need. Our \nobjective is for economic growth to contribute directly \nto meeting the Millennium Development Goals by \nmaking it the main factor in the reduction of poverty, \nreducing the unemployment rate to the average level of \nthe developed European countries, and securing stable \nand long-term economic growth that enhances \nopportunity for future generations. \n A comprehensive campaign against corruption is \npart of our efforts to strengthen the rule of law and \ndevelop the country. In that framework, concrete action \nis being taken to implement legislative and institutional \nreform in order to take preventive measures, narrow \nopportunities for corruptive abuses, enhance public \ntransparency, eliminate conflicts of interest, improve \naccess to decision-making, and strengthen the \nmonitoring role of civil society, local communities and \nthe media. \n We have also paid special attention to the fight \nagainst organized crime, drug and human trafficking, \nand money-laundering. Today we can state with full \nconviction that those phenomena are being met with \nthe full power of the law and the country\u2019s \nconsolidated structures, and in cooperation with the \ninternational factor. That is why our results have been \nsignificant. \n Albania supports and contributes to a strong and \neffective United Nations capable of meeting new \nchallenges, because we believe the Organization to be \nbased on the values and principles of multilateralism, \nglobal partnership for development, and joint action to \nstrengthen collective peace and security to the benefit \nof human rights, the rule of law and commitments \nagainst terrorism. \n In conclusion, allow me to affirm that my country \nwill be active in fulfilling the commitments and \nobligations arising from its responsibilities within the \nOrganization and from those decisions that the General \nAssembly will adopt at its sixty-first session.

        "file_text": "It is a great honour \nand privilege for me to deliver this important statement \non behalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of \nSwaziland. Allow me to convey the warm greetings \nand best wishes of His Majesty King Mswati III, Her \nMajesty the Queen Mother, the Government and the \npeople of the Kingdom of Swaziland to the whole \nUnited Nations family. \n The Kingdom of Swaziland warmly congratulates \nyou, Madam, on your historic election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \nsession. We are confident that your wide experience \nand proven legal and diplomatic skills will ensure \nsuccess in addressing the challenging and daunting \nissues that face the Assembly at this session. We would \nalso like to commend the excellent work of your \npredecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, Minister for Foreign \nAffairs of Sweden, in particular for his skilful \nleadership and the great effort he put into directing the \nGeneral Assembly at its previous session. \n The Kingdom of Swaziland would like to pay \nspecial tribute to Mr. Kofi Annan for his outstanding \nwork during his tenure as our Secretary-General. \nThrough his untiring and dedicated efforts, he \ndemonstrated the vision and qualities that saw him \nsuccessfully lead our Organization into the twenty-first \ncentury, despite the daunting challenges that the \nOrganization faced. We also commend him for his \ninitiatives in contributing to the economic and social \ndevelopment of the African continent through the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). \n The Kingdom of Swaziland is delighted to extend \na warm welcome to our Organization\u2019s newest \nMember, the Republic of Montenegro, whose accession \nis a further confirmation of respect for the principles of \nuniversality and representation enshrined in the Charter \nof the United Nations.  \n However, as we welcome our new Member, we \nremain conscious of the fact that the principle of \nuniversality has not been applied to its fullest. I am \nreferring to the exclusion of Taiwan. With the \nadmission of Montenegro, almost all the countries of \nthe world have become Members of this global \nOrganization, all except one \u2014 Taiwan. The exclusion \nof this nation poses a legal and a moral challenge to the \ninternational community. The time has come for the \nUnited Nations to stop enforcing a policy of exclusion \nagainst the 23.6 million people of Taiwan. The \nKingdom of Swaziland believes that accepting Taiwan \nas a member of the United Nations would not only \nrestore the rights of the people of that island but would \nalso contribute to ensuring that peace and stability is \nmaintained in the Taiwan Strait. We believe that every \ncountry in that region should be allowed to participate \nin working towards peace, stability and positive \ndevelopment. We propose, therefore, that General \nAssembly resolution 2758 (XXVI) of 1971 be \nreviewed carefully, with a view to restoring the legal \nand moral rights of the people of Taiwan to be part of \nthe United Nations family. \n The Kingdom of Swaziland joins the world in \ncondemning terrorism and threats to international \npeace and security. We condemn all acts of terrorism \nthat have taken place over the past year and we offer \nour sympathies and prayers to all those who were \naffected by such acts, especially the families and \nfriends of those who lost their lives. The world has, in \nrecent times, seen an upsurge of terrorism on an \nunprecedented level. \n We welcome the recent agreement on a counter-\nterrorism strategy, which demonstrates the commitment \nof the international community to overcome the \nscourge of terrorism. It must be borne in mind that all \nStates, large and small, and in every region, are \nvulnerable and could be affected by terrorism. \nTherefore, all Member States have to ensure that the \nstrategy is implemented and further updated in order to \nconfront the evolving challenges. \n \n \n13 06-53958 \n \n We fully support the African Nuclear-Weapon-\nFree Zone Treaty and call for the elimination of all \nnuclear weapons by those States that possess them. As \npart of our commitment to a peaceful world, we \nsupport the efforts of the Conference on Disarmament \nconcerning the prohibition of the development and \nmanufacture of new types of weapons of mass \ndestruction. We also continue to be part of the \ncampaign against the trafficking, sale and distribution \nof small arms and light weapons. Such weapons \nencourage terrorism on an international as well as on \nan individual level. \n The Kingdom of Swaziland welcomes the \nestablishment of the Peacebuilding Commission, and \nwe look forward to the realization of the goals \nenvisaged in the formation of that body. We are also \nproud to congratulate a sister State, the Republic of \nAngola, on her election to be the first to preside over \nthis important and unique Commission. \n The recent tragic events that took place in \nLebanon and northern Israel are a cause for great \nconcern and a challenge to the Peacebuilding \nCommission. The Kingdom of Swaziland stands firmly \nbehind the collective effort of the international \ncommunity to ensure the implementation of the \nSecurity Council resolution that ended the conflict \nbetween Israel and Hizbollah. We are of the view that a \ncomprehensive peace process must be revived as a \nmatter of urgency. \n While we are especially encouraged by the \ndevelopments towards peace on the African continent, \nwe remain concerned about the worsening security \nsituation in Darfur in western Sudan, where thousands \nof people have been killed and more than 2 million \ndisplaced since the conflict erupted in 2003. We urge \nthe parties concerned to demonstrate a spirit of \nnecessary compromise and to cooperate with efforts \nmade to facilitate the search for peaceful and lasting \nsolutions. The Kingdom of Swaziland supports \nunequivocally every effort that is being made to sustain \npeace in this area. We join our fellow Member States in \ncalling for support from the United Nations. We fully \nhope and expect that commitments in words will be \nfollowed up by deeds. \n We welcome the results of the historic first-round \nelections that took place in the Democratic Republic of \nCongo, the first of its kind in 40 years. These elections \nwere the first crucial step towards the recovery of that \ncountry, and we support every effort by the United \nNations and the international community to consolidate \nthis achievement, bearing in mind that it will make a \ndifference not only to the Democratic Republic of \nCongo but to the African continent as a whole. \n The recently established Human Rights Council \nhas just concluded a successful inaugural session. The \nKingdom of Swaziland welcomes the creation of this \nhistoric new body. The creation of the Council was \nindeed a step in the right direction towards \nstrengthening our Organization\u2019s human rights tools. \nWe believe that the work of the Council will be guided \nby the principles of universality, impartiality, \nobjectivity, non-selectivity, international dialogue and \ncooperation. In this regard, we align ourselves with the \nrest of Africa in supporting a less-politicized body that \nwill respond promptly to cases of human rights abuses \nin any part of the world. \n The Kingdom of Swaziland believes that the \nongoing reforms of the United Nations are essential, \nespecially if the Organization is to retain its global \ncredibility. It is therefore our hope that the many key \nreform proposals that were deferred to this session will \nbe dealt with satisfactorily. Meanwhile, we welcome \nthe progress that has been made so far, including the \nestablishment of a United Nations Ethics Office, the \nPeacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights \nCouncil. \n Neither renewal nor reform would be complete \nwithout the reform of the Security Council. In the quest \nfor an overall agreement on this issue, the Kingdom of \nSwaziland supports the position of the Non-Aligned \nMovement and the African Group concerning the \ncomposition and working methods of the Security \nCouncil. We hope and expect that positive results will \nflow from the conclusion of this matter. \n As a Member State of this body, we recognize the \nvital role that the major United Nations conferences \nand summits have played in identifying commonly \nagreed objectives which should lead to the successful \nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs). However, we do realize that nothing can be \nachieved without adequate funding, especially for \ndeveloping nations. Even though promises have been \nmade, the time has come for them to be translated into \nactions. \n The breakdown and suspension of negotiations of \nthe World Trade Organization\u2019s Doha Round is \n  \n \n06-53958 14 \n \nlamentable. However, insofar as the outcome is \nconcerned, the Kingdom of Swaziland believes that the \nneeds of developing nations must be fully taken into \nconsideration. Failure to do so will undermine the \nalready limited trade opportunities of these nations and \ndetract from the pursuit of policies in key areas, such \nas employment, industrialization, food security, rural \ndevelopment and sustained economic growth. \n While we welcome the relevant ideas and general \nprinciples for designing microeconomic, sectoral and \ntrade policies contained in the United Nations \nConference on Trade and Development\u2019s Trade \nDevelopment Report of 2006, we still believe that the \nspecific needs of developing nations have to be \naddressed. \n On a more domestic note, let me report that the \nHIV/AIDS pandemic continues to be one of the biggest \nchallenges faced by the Kingdom of Swaziland. As we \nbegin to realize the benefits of a full-scale national \nroll-out of antiretroviral drugs, a critical area of \nconcern is the care needed by the estimated 63,000 \nchildren who have been orphaned by the pandemic. \n That is why, among many other structures we \nhave put in place to curb this scourge, we have revived \nthe concept of the \u201cKaGogo\u201d, which means, literally, \n\u201cgrandmother\u2019s house\u201d. These KaGogo centres are \nbeing constructed across the country and are a new \ninitiative based on traditional ways that empower local \ncommunities to look after their orphans within \ntraditional structures. During the High-level \nConference on HIV/AIDS held in June 2006, His \nMajesty King Mswati III clearly spelled out the scale \nof the pandemic and how it is taking its toll on our \nnation. It is indeed our greatest challenge. \n The Kingdom of Swaziland fully supports the \nPolitical Declaration that was adopted at the High-level \nConference, and we are confident that this renewed \ncommitment will strengthen the global response to the \npandemic. Thus, we realize the urgency of combining \nour efforts to ensure that the rate of infection decreases \nand that greater access to treatment and care for those \nwho are already living with the virus is achieved. We \nfully support the efforts of such organizations as the \nJoint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS \n(UNAIDS), especially in terms of minimizing the \nthreat of HIV to young people. We believe that that is a \nmoral obligation and is essential for halting the \nescalation of the infection rate. In this regard, we look \nforward to working closely with United Nations \nagencies in order to alleviate the situation.  \n On a more positive note, the Kingdom of \nSwaziland is now implementing the recommendations \nof our job creation summit, which took place last year. \nHis Majesty King Mswati III always stands behind his \npeople and fully supports the idea of the participation \nof the people in building the economy. For instance, he \nencourages them to start their own businesses as a \nmeans of reducing the unemployment level. However, \nwe still face significant challenges, e.g., market \nfluctuations in certain products such as sugar and \ntextiles. We also encourage our people to enter into \npartnerships and join ventures with foreign direct \ninvestors in order to develop our nation. \n In conclusion, allow me to allude to the fact that \nthere is indeed much vital work to be completed during \nthis sixty-first session of the General Assembly. The \nKingdom of Swaziland is confident that the initiatives \nalready taken will lead to the renewal of our \nOrganization, and we look forward to a new dynamic \nand vibrant working period. We are indebted to the \nUnited Nations for all we have received and achieved \nover the years towards the development of our nation. \n I am, therefore, charged by His Majesty The \nKing, Her Majesty The Queen Mother, the Government \nand the people of the Kingdom of Swaziland with \nproclaiming the renewal of our commitment to the \nCharter of the United Nations. We ask for God\u2019s \nblessings upon those charged with leading the \nOrganization to give them the wisdom and direction \nthey require to carry out these tasks on behalf of all the \npeoples of the world.

        "file_text": "I \nwould like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General, \nMr. Kofi Annan, for everything that he has done; he \nhas been a great Secretary-General. Thanks to his clear \nvision, his commitment and his open-mindedness, he \nhas greatly contributed to the development of the \nUnited Nations and the promotion of Africa. I thank \nhim and his team. \n Last year we discussed the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. It was clear that they could not be \nattained in the sub-Saharan countries if we did not \nmake a considerable effort. The initiatives of the G-8, \nthe World Bank, the European Union and other donors \nseemed to constitute a good foundation for a profound \nchange. Have we noticed a profound change? I do not \nthink so. The sad reality is that Africa receives less \ninternational assistance per capita than it did 20 years \nago. \n Let us be honest. The great ideas and the \ngoodwill expressed in words rarely pass through the \nfilters of existing structures and programmes. The files \non Afghanistan, Iraq and Lebanon, the Palestine \nquestion and the oil question have put the Africa file in \nthe shade. It is a fact: Africa is not a priority for \ninternational authorities. \n However, I remind the Assembly that we all set \nthe Millennium Development Goals. These are \ncommon goals; therefore, their realization is also a \ncommon task. I remind the Assembly, too, that when \nwe deal with issues we are also writing the destiny of \nhundreds of millions of human beings. Our decisions \naffect millions of children. Where is the fervent desire, \nthen, to deliver on what we have promised to do for \nthem? That is the paradox between what we preach and \nwhat we do. \n I remind the Assembly that the task of this \ncommunity is to avoid crises instead of dealing with \ncrises. This institution should be a place not for \nfirefighters, but for strategists.  \n I emphasize that the idea of one world, the \nfoundation of globalization, cannot take us towards a \nfair and peaceful future as long as many poor countries \nare still marginalized. We want the same ticket to enter \nthe international community as the European Union has \ngiven to Eastern European countries. We should all be \non the same boat. However, many developing countries \nare still struggling behind it, swimming hard to try to \ncatch up with it. How can we get out of this calamitous \nsituation? \n The Millennium Development Goals must remain \nthe basis of our discussions and our actions, even if \ntheir achievement becomes more and more difficult. \nThe industrialized countries have asked us, the \n \n \n19 06-52988 \n \ndeveloping countries, to develop visions for our \ncountries and to prepare road maps in order to achieve \nthem. They have asked us to specify the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals for our countries. They have asked \nus to increase our absorption capacity. \n All of that is fair and understandable. However, \nthe role of industrialized countries is not to play the \nreferee, assess players and give out red cards. All \ncountries, developed and developing alike, must play \ntogether. We must act together and have the same goal. \n That is why I have decided to develop a new \nstrategy in Madagascar, which we call the Madagascar \nAction Plan. The plan has been discussed throughout \nthe regions of Madagascar with representatives of \nprivate and public organizations to create a sound basis \nfor achieving our vision, \u201cMadagascar \u2014 Naturally!\u201d, \nand the Millennium Development Goals. \n The plan has also been discussed with members \nof the donor community. I told them that it is based on \nour vision and on the Millennium Development Goals, \nwhich we all set together. We should not be satisfied \nwith existing means; we should mobilize all the means \nneeded to achieve those goals. \n I also told the donors that the Madagascar Action \nPlan is our common plan. We decide together how \nmany men and women we want to \u2014 and can \u2014 pull \nout of poverty; how many poor children can have a \nbetter education; and how many children we can save \nby providing them with safe drinking water and \nvaccines. \n Together we have to answer these questions, \nbecause they concern global tasks, common tasks. \nHunger, poverty and disasters are among those issues \nthat know no borders. Therefore, they are part of our \nshared responsibility.  \n We must change the approach used in the past, \nwhich was based on division. We must accept that the \ntasks are too burdensome to be carried out by weak \npeople, to whom a new burden is given. I am talking \nabout goals and measures that we must deal with \ntogether, according to the capacity of each of us. \n International assistance for African development \nmust undoubtedly be doubled or tripled in the short \nterm. Donors must deliver on their promises in the \nshort term if we really want to revive the economies of \nAfrican countries. \n People ask why sub-Saharan Africa has not \nexperienced economic growth in the last few years. \nThere are many reasons. They include internal \nconflicts, lack of good governance, instability and \ninsecurity. However, the reduction of aid per capita \nduring the last 20 years is one of the main reasons for \nthe slowing of economic growth. \n A further reduction of international aid has been \nproposed, so that developing countries will become \u2014 \nso it is said \u2014 much more independent quickly. That is \na fundamental misunderstanding. To become \nindependent, we need more international aid. Greater \nsupport is the shortest path towards independence. The \nmore we invest in education, infrastructure and health, \nthe more economic growth will be strengthened. And \nthe more economic growth is strengthened, the quicker \nwill the independence of developing countries become \neffective. \n Investments in education, health, infrastructure \nand so on continue to be conditions for foreign direct \ninvestment. Private investment cannot replace them.  \n We should look at the results of the Marshall Plan \nand at the huge investments by the European Union in \nthe new member States. They have been a huge \nsuccess. \n The question of absorption capacity has been \ndiscussed. Like all developing countries, we too have \nhad problems, problems of cooperation between \nnational and international partners. Basically, if there is \na lack of capacity, it is the result of lack of cooperation \nand confidence.  \n Capacity must never be the factor that determines \nthe volume of support. Where there is a lack of \ncapacity in an area, it is necessary to strengthen that \narea. If there are not yet enough human resources \navailable at the national level, it is necessary to call on \ninternational experts, while reinforcing national \ncapacities. \n In this context, I would like to add a few words \non \u201ccountry ownership\u201d. It is true that we in the \ndeveloping countries know our problems very well. \nTherefore, we are ready to assume our responsibilities. \nDeciding on policies and actions must be the \nresponsibility of nationals. The programmes of the \ndonors have to be integrated into national programmes. \n But it is also true that we are not always aware of \nour weaknesses and are not in phase with all the \n  \n \n06-52988 20 \n \nvalues, rules, standards and procedures that are \nacknowledged in most industrialized countries. Often \nour fellow citizens do not appreciate the true worth of \ngood governance. \n Transferring the rules of good governance and \nstandards of quality in education, health and \ninfrastructure into our culture and our policies is \nessential. The transfer of knowledge is as urgent as is \nthe transfer of capital. It is not only technical \nknowledge that we lack; the transfer of knowledge \nmust also include values and the concept of \nprofessionalism. \n Let us pool our capacities. What is at stake is so \nimportant that we must use all our capacities at the \nsame time. Effectiveness must be the rule. Good \ncooperation between national and international experts \nis the basis of success. \n And let us be more realistic, more pragmatic. The \npercentage of international aid spent on studies is far \ntoo high. Most studies are not implemented and simply \nrepeat what previous studies have already found out. \n I also recommend more effective \ndecentralization, so that financial aid reaches the grass-\nroots communities. The financing mechanism is often \nslow and sometimes complex. It resembles a tortuous, \nstony path \u2014 and it is porous.  \n From time to time, we ask the same questions: \nHow can we better structure international assistance? \nWhich transfer of funds, for which area and with which \nmeasures is the most important? There is no simple \nanswer. Each country, each region and each area \nrequires a different answer. Theoretical discussions \nwill not help.  \n However, there is a foundation that is crucial to \nall development: confidence. If a people do not feel \nconfident, they will not contribute to development. If \ninternational firms do not feel confident, they will not \ncome. \n Confidence comes from opening up to the outside \nworld, from stability, security and transparency. Good \ngovernance and democracy are also crucial. I assure \nthe Assembly that Madagascar, my Government and I, \nwill hold free and fair presidential elections in \nDecember. \n During last year\u2019s session of the Assembly there \nwas general agreement about the urgent need to \nincrease international aid quantitatively and \nqualitatively in order to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. We should therefore act \naccordingly.  \n North America, Europe and most countries in \nAsia and South America have experienced an era of \nprosperity and progress. Their peoples now have a \ngood chance of enjoying a good standard of living until \nthe age of 80. \n The peoples of Africa do not have that chance. I \ntherefore call upon the United Nations to develop and \nadopt a new, more dynamic and determined approach \nin favour of Africa. If that is done, opportunities will \nbe more balanced and the world will be a fairer place. \n We note that the industrialized countries can react \nquickly and launch large-scale operations if their vital \ninterests are at stake. We desire now the same dynamic \napproach for Africa, because the basic needs of our \npeople are still being ignored. Such an approach is in \nthe interest of the African peoples, but it is also in the \nbest interest of humanity. A prosperous Africa is an \nasset for the world. "

        "file_text": "I begin by \ncongratulating Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalaifa on her \nassumption of the office of President of the General \nAssembly. We have full confidence in her and wish her \nevery success. I should also like to praise Foreign \nMinister Jan Eliasson for his effective leadership \nduring the Assembly\u2019s sixtieth session, which achieved \ntruly noteworthy results.  \n I also warmly welcome the Republic of \nMontenegro as the 192nd Member of the United \nNations. \n The United Nations confronts huge tasks. There \nhas already been remarkable progress in certain reform \nareas, such as the establishment of the Human Rights \nCouncil, the Central Emergency Response Fund and \nthe Peacebuilding Commission. We also attach great \nimportance to the launching of the Global Counter-\nTerrorism Strategy, which calls for enhanced United \nNations measures to deal with terrorism and for the \nbetter coordination of such efforts. \n Estonia is strongly committed to promoting peace \nand security throughout the world. We have been \nfollowing developments in the Middle East with \nconcern and compassion. The recent events have once \nagain demonstrated that, in addition to the need to \nsecure lasting peace, there is a need for prompt action \nand generous contributions from the international \ncommunity to resolve humanitarian crises. Estonia has \nnot been a bystander. We have been responding to the \ndire needs of the people in Lebanon and have provided \nassistance to the Iraqi people so that they can rebuild \ntheir country.  \n Estonia continues to actively support the United \nNations in promoting peace and security, just as we \nsupport the Organization\u2019s important role in \ninternational development. We remain convinced that \nthe United Nations is an answer to both current and \nfuture threats and divisions in the world. As we fully \nsubscribe to the comprehensive statement delivered by \nthe President of Finland on behalf of the European \nUnion, let me briefly highlight some aspects of global \npartnership to which we attach great value. \n One of the main aims of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals is to develop a global partnership \nfor development. That encompasses a commitment to \ngood governance and the efficient functioning of \ndemocratic institutions, as well as to fully respecting \nhuman rights and the rule of law for the sustainability \nof development efforts. As was emphasized in the Final \nDocument of the 2005 World Summit, no country can \ntackle today\u2019s complex challenges alone. While all \nnations bear the principal responsibility for their own \ndevelopment, their individual efforts should be \nsupported by concrete global actions and programmes. \nPartnership is truly a central element in everything we \ndo. \n Joint global action is most urgently needed when \na disaster hits a country or a whole region. For a timely \nand efficient response from the international \ncommunity, a well-coordinated and properly resourced \nglobal disaster relief system is required. Estonia gives \nincreasingly high priority to the coordination of \nhumanitarian and disaster relief assistance at the global \nlevel, and finds it important to further strengthen the \nUnited Nations humanitarian response capabilities. The \nfirst year of the Central Emergency Response Fund has \nbeen a promising step towards a balanced and more \nresponsive international humanitarian system, although \nmany challenges remain. We are committed to further \nincreasing our financial contribution to the United \nNations humanitarian system disaster relief assistance.  \n In this regard, it is important to always ensure \nthat disaster relief and all other development activities \n \n \n29 06-53609 \n \nfavour environmentally sustainable solutions. \nEnvironmental sustainability is an urgent, but at the \nsame time long-term, task which demands common \naction. Estonia attaches great importance to the need \nfor coordination and coherence in the field of \nenvironment-related activities, and supports the \ncreation of a more coherent institutional framework \nwithin the United Nations. \n The fulfilment of the internationally agreed \ndevelopment goals calls for the engagement of not only \nGovernments and intergovernmental bodies; the \ncommitments made at major conferences cannot be \nimplemented without cooperation with local \ninstitutions, the private sector and non-governmental \norganizations. Our experience clearly demonstrates that \nnon-governmental organizations can play a crucial role \nin effective development cooperation. In many cases \ncivil society institutions are much more efficient in \nestablishing dynamic working relationships with non-\ngovernmental organizations of partner countries than \ngovernment institutions. The cooperation with non-\ngovernmental organizations has been remarkably \nadvantageous in such sectors as sustainable \ndevelopment and information and communication \ntechnology, as well as e-governance. \n This brings us to another area of cooperation \u2014\nusing information and communication technology to \nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. Since my \ncountry has been notably successful in employing new \ninformation and communication technologies, as well \nas in carrying out extensive reforms, we shall continue \nto increase our input into overall development in this \nfield.  \n There is also a need to reinvigorate and reform \nthe United Nations. Estonia is ready to contribute to \nthe best of its ability to the development of a \ncomprehensive information and communication \ntechnologies strategy for the whole United Nations \nstructure. All these issues \u2014 information technology, \nsustainable development and humanitarian and disaster \nrelief \u2014 are also on the agenda of the Second \nCommittee, which will be chaired by the Permanent \nRepresentative of Estonia during this sixty-first \nsession. We will do our utmost there to see to the \neffective promotion of the matters I have mentioned \u2014 \nand, of course, all other crucial matters before the \nCommittee. \n We must remain strongly committed to respect \nfor the rule of law and our rights and dignity as human \nbeings. Indeed, if we want human rights to form one of \nthe three main pillars of the United Nations, alongside \nsecurity and development, it is essential to implement \nboth the letter and spirit of resolution 60/251. We \nexpect the Human Rights Council to be strengthened \nand become an authoritative institution, and we expect \nhuman rights issues to gain equal standing with other \nmajor items on the United Nations agenda. This first \nyear of the existence of the Human Rights Council is a \nyear of transition and capacity-building. Estonia\u2019s \nvision encompasses the establishment of an operational \nbody reinforced with special procedures and a new \nefficient and universal mechanism, which monitors \nindividual countries, with non-governmental \norganizations as essential partners. \n We should also make sure that the rights of \nindigenous peoples remain an integral part of human \nrights and continue to be a matter of substance for the \nHuman Rights Council. Adopting the draft declaration \non the rights of indigenous peoples during the current \nsession is of great importance for the millions of \nindigenous peoples worldwide. It is crucial that it be \nadopted at a plenary meeting of the General Assembly \nthis year. Its implementation could be a major step \ntowards eliminating the widespread human rights \nviolations suffered by many indigenous peoples. The \nHuman Rights Council could also host a forum for \ndialogue where the representatives of indigenous \npeoples, States and a special rapporteur could discuss \nthe issues enshrined in the Declaration. \n Another new instrument that needs to be adopted \nby the General Assembly and implemented by States as \nsoon as possible is the draft convention on enforced \ndisappearances \u2014 a recurrent phenomenon that must \nbe fought against. It is essential that it be adopted at \nthe current session so that States can start to sign and \nratify it at the beginning of next year in Paris. \n The Millennium Development Goals are also \nintended to promote gender equality and empower \nwomen worldwide. That includes, of course, the United \nNations. Estonia shares the vision that the role of \nwomen within the decision-making system of the \nUnited Nations should be increased. As the General \nAssembly is to decide on the next Secretary-General \nthis year, we support the proposal to consider \nMrs. Vaira Vike-Freiberga as a candidate. Thus the \nPresident of Latvia could be the first woman to head \n  \n \n06-53609 30 \n \nthe United Nations in its 60 years of existence. Our \ncommitment must be reflected in our decisions. The \ntime has come to have more representatives from \ncentral and eastern Europe in high-ranking posts in the \nUnited Nations. I believe we are ready to make history. \n Before finishing, I should like to express my \ndeepest respect for the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi \nAnnan. We appreciate his dedication and personal \ndetermination in addressing the enormous challenges \nof the twenty-first century and shaping our common \nfuture. During nearly 10 years of service he has held \nmankind\u2019s universal values high and led the United \nNations with true vision. "

        "file_text": "Traditionally, the General Assembly session \nprovides an opportunity to conduct a review of the \ncurrent situation in the world, identify major \ninternational issues and determine the role that the \nUnited Nations could play in resolving them.  \n I believe that we have every reason to conclude \nthat there is a prevailing trend of growing awareness of \nthe need to strengthen the collective foundations of \ninternational politics, as well as of the fact that there is \nno alternative to tackling problems through multilateral \ndiplomacy. That trend is based on objective facts, for it \nreflects the realities of an emerging multipolar \narchitecture of international relations. It is logical, \nbecause answers to global challenges and threats can \nonly be found collectively. Finally, it is a manifestation \nof historical continuity, because we are revisiting the \nsame objective as the founding fathers of the United \nNations were determined to pursue by enshrining in the \nCharter the principles for a system of collective \nsecurity.  \n It is precisely such an approach, firmly grounded \nin international law, that can ensure the world\u2019s \nsustainable development in this era of globalization. \nThat requires a strengthened central role for the \nuniversal Organization in every area of international \nlife. \n We must of course continue to adapt the \nmechanisms and methods of the United Nations to the \nnew environment. Much has been done as follow-up to \nthe decisions of the 2005 World Summit: The \nPeacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights \nCouncil have been established, and the reform process \nhas been extended to management.  \n It is important that all our further work be based \nupon the fundamental principle of the universality of \nthe United Nations. Patterns contrary to the Charter of \nthe United Nations that exclude individual States or \ngroups of States from participating meaningfully in the \nactivities of the Organization or that introduce a single \nsystem of values into the work of the Secretariat are \nunsustainable. Let us not forget that the United Nations \nbelongs to us all. Moreover, administrative reform \nshould not lead to the bureaucracy taking over the \nmanagement of the Organization, thereby jeopardizing \nthe intergovernmental nature of the United Nations. \n A trend towards collective action has also spread \nbeyond the structures of the United Nations. During \nRussia\u2019s presidency of the Group of Eight (G-8), there \nwas greater interaction between the G-8 and other \nleading countries and international organizations. Over \n  \n \n06-53005 28 \n \nthe past 12 months our dialogue partners have actively \ncontributed to Saint Petersburg summit documents on \nevery main agenda item, including global energy \nsecurity, education and controlling infectious diseases.  \n A new and genuinely collaborative type of \ninteraction between the G-8 and Africa is now \nemerging in this era of globalization, as the needs of \nthe continent are reflected in the mainstream of world \ndevelopment rather than being viewed as issues \ndivorced from overall trends.  \n The G-8 does not have a monopoly over the \ndecisions taken at Saint Petersburg. All States are \ninvited to participate in their implementation. \n Regional organizations and cooperation and \ncoordination between those organizations and the \nUnited Nations have also strengthened in maintaining \ninternational peace and security. Issues pertaining to \nthat were discussed yesterday at the special ministerial \nmeeting of the Security Council (see S/PV.5529). Once \nagain, we are dealing here with an important dimension \nof collective action by the international community. \n The Commonwealth of Independent States has \nmade a significant contribution to such interaction. To \naddress common problems, specific actions have been \ntaken within the Commonwealth area, primarily within \nthe Eurasian Economic Community and the Collective \nSecurity Treaty Organization. Further substantive and \nresolute efforts are being made in the context of the \nShanghai Cooperation Organization, which developed \nand launched and initiative to establish a partnership \nnetwork for multilateral organizations in the Asia-\nPacific region. Development patterns in that region \nwill largely determine the future contours of our planet.  \n Multilateral institutions in Latin America have \nalso become stronger, and the development of the \nAfrican Union is gaining momentum. \n At their recent Summit in Havana, heads of State \nof the countries of the Non-Aligned Movement \nexpressed their support for a collective search \u2014 \nwithin the context of the central role of the United \nNations \u2014 for agreed solutions to problems \nconfronting the world community. \n Europe, of course, is not outside the common \ntrend towards collective examination and resolution of \ncommon problems. In that connection, we also see \ngrowing awareness of the fact that security and \nprosperity are indivisible. We expect NATO to \ntransform itself from a defence alliance into something \nmore contemporary that would be in line with \nprinciples of transparency and collective response and \nbased upon a universal legal foundation.  \n We have been watching with keen interest the \nemerging foreign policy and security mechanisms of \nthe European Union. Russia is prepared to cooperate \nwith multilateral structures in the Euro-Atlantic space \nand other regions of the world. In fact, we already have \neffective common mechanisms with many of them. \n Collective efforts are also needed to further \ndevelop international law, primarily within the context \nof countering new threats. The United Nations Global \nCounter-terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288), which \nwas recently adopted by consensus, is an important \ncontribution in terms of strengthening the legal basis \nfor the anti-terrorist coalition and ensuring a \ncomprehensive approach to counter-terrorism. It is not \nonly about countering all terrorist manifestations and \nideologies, it is also about eliminating the problems \nthat give rise to terrorism. The next step will be to \nagree upon a comprehensive anti-terrorism convention. \n It is necessary to secure the achievements that \nhave been made by taking practical steps. In the course \nof Russia\u2019s presidency of the G-8, the Second \nMinisterial Conference on Drug Trafficking Routes \nFrom Afghanistan was held, where additional measures \nwere approved aimed at mobilizing the international \ncommunity to counter the terrorism-related drug threat \noriginating from Afghanistan. Another international \nmeeting will be held in Moscow next November to \nfocus on developing modalities for government-\nbusiness partnerships in countering terrorism. \n What is needed today are more proactive \nmeasures to prevent lethal weapons from falling into \nthe hands of non-State actors, as well as the consistent \nimplementation of Security Council resolution 1540 \n(2004) and other counter-terrorism resolutions of the \nCouncil. The Russia-United States global initiative to \ncombat nuclear terrorism, which was launched at Saint \nPetersburg by Presidents Vladimir V. Putin and George \nW. Bush last July, should be an important tool in \npreventing a linkage between weapons of mass \ndestruction and terrorism. That initiative invites \ninterested States to act collectively. \n The ever-growing demand for the unique \npeacekeeping capabilities of the United Nations also \ncalls for a collective effort. Not all of those capabilities \n \n \n29 06-53005 \n \nhave been utilized to the fullest. Utilizing the \ncapabilities of the Military Staff Committee, as well as \nthose of regional organizations, on the basis of the \nrelevant provisions of the United Nations Charter \nwould be helpful. \n It is encouraging to see a more active role being \nplayed by Africans themselves in peacemaking \noperations in Africa \u2014 an undertaking spearheaded by \nthe African Union and supported by the United \nNations.  \n In a number of crisis situations conditions are \ngradually emerging for a transition to post-conflict \nreconstruction. It is our hope that the Declaration on \nCooperation and Future Action in Stabilization and \nReconstruction adopted at the Saint Petersburg G-8 \nSummit will help us complement the efforts of the \nUnited Nations and regional organizations at this \ncritically important period of transition to \npeacebuilding. \n A comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli \nconflict remains a central task for the world \ncommunity. Many of today\u2019s threats have come \ntogether in that region, and the key to resolving them is \nmost often to be found there. In that connection, I \nshould first like to mention the truly global challenge \nposed by the need to prevent a schism between \ncivilizations.  \n We welcome the emerging prospects for a \nnational agreement in the Palestinian territories, as \nwell as for the resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli \ntalks. It is important to continue to encourage the \nparties to meet their respective obligations, with the \nclear understanding that any progress towards the \nobjectives set out by the international community will \ninevitably be gradual and that any attempt to act in an \nall-or-nothing spirit will be counterproductive and \ncould once again plunge the region into confrontation. \n The recent war in Lebanon demonstrated the \ngreat fragility of the situation in the Middle East and \nthe acute need for a comprehensive approach along all \ntracks. That presupposes the involvement of all \ncountries and parties. Without their participation it will \nbe impossible to reach any viable negotiated solution. \nIt is also clear that the road to comprehensive peace \nwill not be an easy one, but now is the time. The \ninitiative of the League of Arab States to convene an \ninternational conference should contribute to finding \nthe proper framework for that undertaking. The Quartet \nof international mediators should also make a key \ncontribution to the process. \n A breakthrough on a Middle East settlement \ncould provide the positive momentum so wanting in \nthe region. It could also facilitate the solution of other \nburning problems in the region and in neighbouring \ncountries. That is particularly true as regards efforts \naimed at stabilizing the situation in Iraq, where \nattempts to contain wanton violence and chaos have \nthus far proved unsuccessful. Dozens of people, mainly \ncivilians, continue to die in Iraq every day. Five \nofficials of the Russian embassy in Baghdad have also \nfallen victim to that barbarous massacre. A resolution \nin Iraq will be possible only through concerted efforts. \nThat requires the involvement in the political process \nof all major Iraqi interests and the implementation of \nthe plans of that country\u2019s Government to reach \ngenuine national accord, with the concerted support of \nthe international community, including all of Iraq\u2019s \nneighbours. \n We are, unfortunately, now witnessing growing \nsignificance of the use of force in world affairs; that \nundermines non-proliferation regimes. The feeling of a \nlack of predictability and stability in the area of \nsecurity is becoming ever more pronounced. Against \nthat background, the growing interest of many States in \nnuclear energy may give rise to concerns, given the \ntrend towards the global proliferation of sensitive \ntechnologies.  \n Apart from current resolute steps to find \nnegotiated solutions to individual problems \u2014 such as \nthe Iranian nuclear programme and the problem of the \nKorean peninsula \u2014 there is a need for an urgent effort \nby the entire international community to systematically \nstrengthen non-proliferation regimes on a generally \nacceptable basis, while ensuring that the benefits of \npeaceful atomic energy are legitimately accessible to \nall States.  \n President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s initiative to \nestablish multilateral centres for nuclear fuel-cycle \nservices, along with similar ideas proposed by the \nleadership of the International Atomic Energy Agency \n(IAEA) and proposals put forth by United States \nPresident George W. Bush, have found support among \nG-8 leaders. We are confident that the development and \npractical implementation of such approaches \u2014 in \ncooperation with all countries with an interest in \nmodern and safe nuclear energy \u2014 will make it \n  \n \n06-53005 30 \n \npossible to resolve non-proliferation issues in a non-\nconfrontational manner. \n As in other areas, the obsession with sanctions \u2014 \napplied without calculating their consequences \u2014 \nmight produce unpredictable results. It is absolutely \nnecessary to eliminate the loopholes in the non-\nproliferation regimes, but that should be done through \nclear and non-discriminatory approaches, without \ncreating grounds for suspicion regarding the existence \nof some hidden agenda. \n Stagnation in the international disarmament \nprocess does not help to resolve non-proliferation \nproblems. Here again, we need concerted action, for \nthis is a matter of collective security. \n In the area of strategic arms, the United States-\nRussian agreements play an enormously important role. \nTheir significance goes far beyond the framework of \nbilateral relations, considering that virtually all \nmembers of the international community benefit from \nstrategic stability. We support the consistent \ndevelopment of the United States-Russian bilateral \ndisarmament process, as was stated by our Presidents \nin Saint Petersburg in July.  \n Closely related to that are issues related to anti-\nballistic missiles, in particular within the context of the \nexisting plans of the United States. In that context, \nthere is a need for complete transparency and for an \nanalysis of the consequences for strategic stability. \n The situation surrounding the Treaty on \nConventional Armed Forces in Europe continues to \ncause grave concern. The old Treaty, based on the \nrealities of confrontation between military blocs, has \nlost its relevance, while NATO is blocking the entry \ninto force of the Agreement on its adaptation. \n At the same time, reconfiguration of the military \narchitecture on the European continent is under way. At \nits heart is an expanding military alliance. Such virtual \narms control becomes meaningless as it turns into a \none-way street.  \n It is also necessary to revitalize multilateral \ndisarmament approaches. That agenda should include \nthe entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-\nTest-Ban Treaty, non-deployment of weapons in outer \nspace, conclusion of a fissile material cut-off treaty and \nensuring information security. Nuclear-weapon-free \nzones play an important role, and we welcome the \ncreation of such a zone in Central Asia. \n The overall task is to reinvigorate the efforts of \nthe international community in the area of disarmament \nand arms control, within the framework of the \nConference on Disarmament and other relevant United \nNations bodies.  \n The 2005 World Summit unanimously reaffirmed \nthat peace, security and development are inseparable. \nWith that in mind, we are prepared to engage in \ncollective discussions and support further joint \npragmatic steps with a view to improving the \nefficiency of the social and economic activities of the \nentire United Nations system. \n The Russian Federation realizes its responsibility \nas one of the fastest growing economies of the world, \nand is devoting increasing attention to development \nassistance. Thus far, Russia has written off or has \nundertaken to write off $11.3 billion of the debt of \nAfrican countries, including more than $2.2 billion \nwithin the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt \nInitiative. New steps are planned in that area. Russia \nnow ranks third in absolute figures of debt relief and \nfirst in terms of the ratio of debt relief to gross \ndomestic product. We have also increased our \ncontributions to other international development \nassistance mechanisms, including through United \nNations institutions and funds and the Bretton Woods \ninstitutions. \n Today, I cannot fail to express my sincere \nappreciation and praise to the Secretary-General Kofi \nAnnan. For many years, during the most difficult times \nfor world politics, he has carried out his duties with \ndignity. Thanks largely to the efforts of Kofi Annan \nand to his ability to take the lead while remaining a \nrealist in the face of severe challenges, we have \nmanaged to make progress in strengthening the United \nNations. \n Today the United Nations is relevant as never \nbefore. We do not have to create it anew. In the course \nof reforming the United Nations in accordance with the \ndictates of the time, it is incumbent upon us all to \nreaffirm by action our commitment to the world \nOrganization, which draws its strength from our trust \nin it and in its unique legitimacy. Without the United \nNations and its Charter to rely upon, it would prove \nimpossible to ensure a more reliable and democratic \nsystem of collective security that would respond to the \ndictates of our time.

        "file_text": "I wish to congratulate \nyou, Madam, on your election as President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-first session. It signals \nthe increasing role of women, especially women from \nthe Muslim world, in international affairs; and this is a \nvery welcome and positive development. May I also \nthank and commend His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson \nfor his able stewardship at the sixtieth session. \n Let me now join colleagues in paying tribute to \nthe outstanding service of His Excellency Mr. Kofi \nAnnan, whose 10-year term of office as Secretary-\nGeneral is about to conclude. Among the valuable \nservices he has rendered is to give the world \ncommunity a way of firmly grasping the fundamental \nchallenges of our time: the challenge of security, the \nchallenge of underdevelopment and the challenge of \nhuman rights and the rule of law. \n We have contemplated these challenges well \nenough to know the answers. We know that long-term \nsecurity can be achieved only through a durable and \njust peace, not one that is imposed on the weak by the \nstrong. We can overcome the challenge of poverty only \nthrough a global partnership for development that will \nequitably distribute the benefits of globalization. The \nchallenge of human rights and the rule of law can only \nbe met by Governments that rule by the consent of the \ngoverned, Governments that are elected by and \naccountable to the people. In a word, democracy. \n Peace, development and democracy are \ninseparable. Development is paralysed and democracy \nis meaningless in situations of violence and bloody \nconflict. Nowhere is this more poignantly true than in \nthe Middle East. Over the years, Lebanon has rebuilt \nits civil-war-ravaged economy, only to be bombed to \nthe ground recently by Israel. Hundreds of innocent \ncivilians were killed in those military strikes, many of \nthem women and children. The carnage stopped with \nthe adoption of Security Council resolution 1701 \n(2006), but this came only after a very lengthy process \nduring which time the Lebanese people underwent so \nmuch unnecessary suffering and loss. The frustration \nand inability to take immediate action is radicalizing \nmany people in the Muslim world. \n \n \n17 06-53329 \n \n This serves to prove the importance of reforming \nthe Security Council, in its composition, as well as the \nway it works, so that it can take effective action when \naction is a matter of life and death for thousands of \npeople, as was recently the case in Lebanon. \n Deeply committed to being a part of the solution \nto this crisis, Indonesia is sending an 850-strong \nmechanized infantry battalion to form part of the \nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), as \nmandated by Security Council resolution 1701 (2006). \nIt has become an Indonesian tradition to contribute \ntroops to United Nations peacekeeping forces. The first \ncontingent was deployed as part of the United Nations \nEmergency Force I in Suez in 1957. \n As for the Arab-Israeli conflict, it is essential to \nrecognize that the problem of Palestine lies at its core. \nThere are no military solutions to this problem, as \nmilitary might can never guarantee security. There can \nonly be a two-State solution, with the parties to the \nconflict assuming their responsibilities and taking \nconcrete measures to lay down the foundations of \npeace. In this regard, we encourage the formation of a \nPalestinian government of national unity, as that will \nopen a window of opportunity for the resumption of \ndialogue and for the revival of the Quartet\u2019s Road Map \nfor peace.  \n We appeal to the Security Council to act on this \nissue with dispatch, for Muslims everywhere have a \nstrong emotional reaction to what they perceive to be \nthe oppression and humiliation of their Palestinian, \nIraqi and Afghan co-religionists. Terrorists operating as \nfar away from the Middle East as South-East Asia \njustify their heinous crimes as retaliation for what they \nconsider to be aggression against Islam. \n Thus today we are witness to the error of some \nWestern circles attributing to Islam a propensity for \nviolence, matched by the error of terrorist groups \nclaiming that violent means are sanctified by Islam. \nThe only way to liberate the human mind from these \nerrors is through intensive and extensive dialogue. \n That is why Indonesia has been actively \npromoting interfaith and intercultural dialogue in the \nAsia-Pacific region and within the Asia-Europe \nMeeting (ASEM). It is our way of debasing the \nideology of the terrorists and at the same time \nempowering the moderates and strengthening the voice \nof moderation. \n Earlier this month, we collaborated with Norway \nin holding the first global intermedia dialogue, which \nwas attended by leading mass-media practitioners from \nfive continents. For while the media can be a force for \ngood, it can also do a great deal of harm, as shown by \nthe recent cartoon controversy. Through this dialogue, \nwe aimed to promote mass media sensitivity to other \ncultures and faiths, while upholding freedom of \nexpression. As with the interfaith dialogue, the \nintermedia dialogue has been institutionalized and will \nbe carried out annually. \n There is also a great need for dialogue to address \nthe proliferation of nuclear weapons in Asia. While the \nthreat of nuclear weapons has subsided in other \nregions, a new nuclear theatre may be developing from \nWest to East Asia. \n It is therefore important that we find a diplomatic \nsolution to the nuclear issue regarding Iran and North \nKorea. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons (NPT), as the cornerstone of disarmament, \nmust be strengthened. In fact, all weapons of mass \ndestruction should be abolished. \n Indeed, we must work for peace in a relentless \nday-to-day struggle. Even when the guns are silent, \nthat is not enough for the long-term survival of \nhumankind. There must also be development. There \nmust be an end to poverty as a basic problem of the \nhuman condition; otherwise social grievances will be a \nconstant threat to peace. \n We in the international community have the \nresources and the skills to conquer poverty. For that \ngoal to be attainable, however, the developed and the \ndeveloping world must be able to faithfully carry out a \ncontract of partnership that stipulates for each side a \nset of obligations. \n We do not need to negotiate that contract; it \nalready exists. For the past decade and a half, the \ninternational community, within the framework of the \nUnited Nations, has produced a substantial body of \ndocuments to which we have formally committed \nourselves. These constitute a contract for the conquest \nof poverty and its attendant maladies. It is not just a \ncontract between and among States; it is also a contract \nwith our peoples and with future generations. \n Hence, it is appropriate that the theme of our \nsixty-first session should be \u201cImplementing a global \npartnership for development.\u201d As President Susilo \n  \n \n06-53329 18 \n \nBambang Yudhoyono pointed out recently, all we need \nto do is bind ourselves to this contract and carry it out \naccording to its letter and spirit. This means political \nwill, which is often lacking, and a streak of sincerity, \nwhich is very rare in our time. \n The developed nations have four basic \nobligations under this contract. The first is to tear down \nthe walls of protectionism and open up their markets to \nthe products of the developing world. They must \nsalvage the Doha Development Round.  \n Their second obligation is to relieve their \ndeveloping counterparts of some of the burdens of the \ndebt crisis. Developing countries are often unable to \nfund their development programmes because they have \nto make huge debt payments. \n The third obligation of the developed countries is \nto ensure sufficient volumes of financial flows to \ndeveloping countries, especially in the form of foreign \ndirect investment. Many developing countries are \nsimply too poor to muster the capital they need to get \nthem out of poverty. \n Another essential requirement of development is \ntechnology. Hence, the fourth obligation of the \ndeveloped countries is to share their technology with \nthe developing world, striking a balance between social \nresponsibility and respect for intellectual property \nrights. \n The obligations of developed countries must be \nmatched by those of the developing countries, \notherwise the partnership will not be equitable. The \nfirst obligation of developing countries is to practise \ngood governance. We must therefore wage a relentless \nbattle against all forms of corruption. The only form of \ncapital that is abundant in the developing world is \nhuman capital. It is therefore the second obligation of \nthe developing countries to protect and enhance that \ncapital through education, human resources \ndevelopment and health care. \n The third obligation of the developing countries \nis to provide a climate that is friendly to foreign \ncapital, particularly foreign direct investment. This \nnormally means a package of incentives. It also means \na level playing field and a reputation for good \ngovernance. \n It is our fourth and particular obligation to make \nuse of our natural resources with wisdom so that we \nmeet the needs of today without robbing our future \ngenerations of their legacy. These obligations are not \neasy to fulfil, but they must be carried out if the global \npartnership for development is to work. \n In the case of Indonesia, we carried out the first \nobligation as a matter of survival: it was the only way \nwe could climb our way out of the limbo to which the \nAsian financial crisis relegated us almost a decade ago. \nWe had to make our transition to a more fully \ndemocratic system of governance, becoming, in the \nprocess, a full-fledged democracy. \n We instituted reforms in every aspect of national \nlife. Our economic recovery is a product of reform, and \nour new drive for economic growth is driven by \nreform. In the spirit of reform and dialogue, we were \nable to forge a peace agreement with the separatist Free \nAceh Movement. The peace has been holding for more \nthan a year and promises to be durable. \n As for our human resources, our Constitution \nmandates that 20 per cent of our budget be allocated to \neducation. As part of our effort to achieve universal \neducation, we are providing free schooling to some 60 \nmillion primary through high school students. To \nalleviate poverty, we are continuing to extend direct \ncash subsidies to some 19.1 million households. \n Last year, one fourth of our total population of \n220 million benefited from the medical services of \ncommunity health centres. We recently reduced the \nprice of generic medicines by 30 to 50 per cent. \n With regard to foreign investment, Indonesia is \nsending out some very positive signals. We are \nlegislating a new package of investment incentives, \nincluding a law on tax reform, a law that rationalizes \nthe labour market and regulations to streamline \ncustoms procedures. We are establishing special \neconomic zones. The response of foreign direct \ninvestors was to pour some $6 billion into Indonesia \nlast year. \n To ensure the sustainability of our environment, \nwe have launched a national programme entitled \n\u201cTowards a green Indonesia\u201d aimed at building the \ncapacity of local government to conserve natural \nresources and control environmental degradation. In \nsum, Indonesia is ready for partnership \u2014 ready to be \nan active participant in that global partnership for \ndevelopment that will enable the developing world to \nreach its Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). I \nbelieve that many other developing countries are just \n \n \n19 06-53329 \n \nas ready for that partnership; and, if they feel they are \nnot ready at the moment, it takes nothing more \u2014 but \nnothing less as well \u2014 than political will to get \nthemselves to a proper state of preparedness. That also \napplies to the countries of the developed North \u2014 they \nmust also have the political will to fulfil their end of \nthe partnership. Otherwise, that partnership will not be \nworth the paper on which so many Summit documents \nwere printed. Given that development, peace and \nhuman dignity are inseparable, the destiny of this \npartnership parallels the destiny of the entire human \nrace; a partnership for development is also a \npartnership for peace and for the dignity of the human \nbeing.

        "file_text": "First, I sincerely thank \nMr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General, for all the \nefforts he has made throughout his very successful \nmandate during a time of enormous challenges facing \nour civilization. I particularly single out his \nexceptional understanding of the problems that south-\neastern Europe has faced and is still facing. \n I also congratulate you, Madam President, on \nyour election. \n At the same time, I warmly welcome the \naccession of Montenegro to the United Nations as a \nnew Member State. \n I am addressing the General Assembly today as \nPresident of the Republic of Serbia, an independent \nand democratic State in south-eastern Europe, in the \nBalkans. I assure the Assembly that Serbia seeks to \nmake a significant contribution to this part of the \nworld \u2014 in terms of fast democratization and respect \nfor human rights, economic development, the security \nof the entire Balkans and the stability of south-eastern \nEurope. Instead of being a place where problems are \ncreated, Serbia and the Balkans must become a place \nwhere problems are resolved in a peaceful manner. \n  \n \n06-52988 4 \n \n Serbia is simultaneously a new and an old \nState \u2014 new, because its flag is flying for the first time \nin front of this building, and old, because already in \n1835 its Constitution guaranteed freedom to any man \nsetting foot on its soil; new, because it is being created \nagainst the backdrop of the specific challenges of the \ntwenty-first century, and old, because it is created in \naccordance with the very principles it helped to \nestablish and embody in the Charter of the United \nNations in 1945. \n Today Serbia is an active Member of the United \nNations. We believe that the decisions made under the \nOrganization\u2019s auspices have to form the basis of \nstability and prosperity for all States and peoples in \nsouth-eastern Europe. \n Serbia believes in a shared and prosperous future \nfor the Balkans. It is important to stress that none of \nthe current problems in the Balkans can be viewed or \nresolved in isolation, without taking into account our \ncommon history and a vision of our shared future. \nHence, in dealing with any problem in the Balkans, it \nis necessary to hear and give weight to the opinions of \nall countries in the region. \n I trust that a better future for our part of the world \nwill be based upon three major principles: democracy, \nas a guarantor of human freedom and the basis of \neconomic progress; the security of each State, as a \nprecondition for the security of the entire Balkans; and \nregional stability, as a vital factor of global peace and \nprosperity. All the challenges we face should be tackled \nin accordance with those principles.  \n In that spirit, Serbia is sincerely committed to the \nterritorial integrity of all Balkan States and the \npreservation of their existing borders. In the same vein, \nthe integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, based on the \nDayton Accords, which may be changed by its citizens \nonly with the consensus of all three constituent \npeoples, is an essential factor in the stability and \nfurther democratization of the region. By the same \ntoken, the preservation of the sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity of Serbia is in the interest of \ndemocracy and the prosperity of all of south-eastern \nEurope. \n Strengthening regional cooperation is Serbia\u2019s \npriority. That is why we believe that the prosperity of \nall neighbouring countries is in the interest of Serbia. \nWe are aware that the Balkan countries can make \nprogress and achieve their primary foreign policy \nobjective \u2014 European Union and Euro-Atlantic \nmembership \u2014 only through cooperation.  \n In this regional framework, we also wish to \nactively cooperate in the fight against organized crime, \ncorruption and international terrorism. As a concrete \ncontribution to this goal, at my initiative, a meeting of \nthe Heads of State of south-eastern Europe will soon be \nheld in Belgrade, aimed at promoting communication \nand strengthening cooperation in the fight against these \nthreats to the life and prosperity of us all. \n Serbia sees the Balkans as a common space, in \nwhich it is possible to achieve political and social \nstability. The achievement of that goal should be an \nimportant contribution to efforts conducive to full \ndemocratization and peace. It is based on the principle \nof shared responsibility of all Balkan States. That is \nwhy none of the Balkan States must feel a loser as we \nmove closer to a joint European future. \n Kosovo and Metohija is currently under United \nNations interim administration. The settlement of \nKosovo\u2019s future status is one of the most difficult \nproblems facing Serbia, the other Balkan countries and \nthe international community, as well as the Albanian \nand Serbian people in Kosovo. That is why we believe \nthat this problem should be addressed in a strategic and \nsubstantive manner in order to arrive at a solution that \nwill take into account the full complexity of relations \nin the Balkans. That poses certain requirements: to face \nthe past, to find sustainable solutions for the present \nand to open up avenues of cooperation in the future. \n But, of course, this does not imply that the \nKosovo case is unique, different from all others. On the \ncontrary, the Kosovo problem must be approached on \nthe basis of recognized principles of international law \nand universal democratic values. If there is failure in \nthat, we shall not be able to escape the vicious circle of \nold animosities and mutual recriminations. \n What it seeks for itself, Serbia seeks for the \nprovince, too: promotion of democracy, respect for \nhuman rights, economic prosperity and security. In \norder to contribute to that goal, Serbia has decided to \nensure power supply this winter from its own resources \nto Kosovo\u2019s population. \n It is in the interest of Serbia that Kosovo be \nstable, prosperous, economically viable, multi-ethnic \nand democratic. Before its future status is determined, \nit is of crucial importance to establish the rule of law \n \n \n5 06-52988 \n \nand put an end to seven years of discrimination against \nthe Serbs as well as other non-Albanian communities, \nwho suffer as the target of extremism and terrorism. \n The autonomy offered by Serbia to Kosovo \nAlbanians is broader than any currently enjoyed by any \nregion or federal unit in Europe. In our view, that is a \nsustainable, stable and long-standing solution that \nwould open a new chapter in the long and difficult \nhistory of Serbian-Albanian relations. Among other \nthings, it would enable Kosovo to have direct access to \ninternational financial institutions, necessary for its \neconomic recovery and development, which are in the \ninterest of both Serbia and the region as a whole. \n Serbia is genuinely committed to the achievement \nof the Millennium Development Goals, technological \nadvancement and economic prosperity. Large-scale \npoverty, which unfortunately still prevails, deeply \naffects human dignity. \n Today, 21 September, we observe the \nInternational Day of Peace. It is important that it be \nobserved each year in an effort to put an end to wars \nand violence in the world. Many crises have not yet \nbeen resolved, and some continue to escalate \ndangerously, while new challenges threaten to generate \nnew conflicts, destruction and humanitarian \ncatastrophes. \n An important aspect of preserving peace and \nsecurity is efficient and timely deployment of United \nNations peacekeeping forces. Serbia supports the \nefforts to strengthen the effectiveness of United \nNations peacekeeping, and my country is ready to \nmake an active contribution to these operations. The \nmandate of peacekeeping operations is today more \ndiverse than it used to be and includes conflict-\nprevention, peacekeeping, post-conflict reconstruction \nand assistance to long-term and sustainable \ndevelopment. \n Following several years of conflict, the Balkans \nis slowly but surely turning into a zone of good-\nneighbourliness and cooperation. Serbia is prepared to \ndeal with the burden of its recent past in the interest of \nits Balkan and European future. The people of Serbia \nstarted doing this successfully and democratically in \n2000, when they removed the regime largely \nresponsible for the hardships that befell Serbia and the \nBalkans in the last decade of the twentieth century. \n Precisely for that reason, we are firmly \ncommitted to the successful completion of our \ncooperation with the Hague Tribunal. This is not \nmerely our international obligation; it is also a question \nof moral values. \n As a responsible State and a part of the \ninternational community, Serbia is truly devoted to \nhonouring the Charter of the United Nations and \nbuilding democracy in the world. Therefore, Serbia is \nfirmly committed to making its full contribution to the \nstrengthening of the role and mandate of the United \nNations, as well as to multilateral dialogue leading to \nequal cooperation among States and peoples, to respect \nfor human rights and freedoms, and to tolerance and \nmutual respect.

        "file_text": "Equatorial Guinea is participating in the \ndebates of the sixty-first session of the General \nAssembly in the firm conviction that this world \nOrganization remains the only forum with the authority \nnecessary to resolve any situation facing the \ninternational community. Attempting to usurp that \nauthority is irrational; it means negating the universal \nprinciples of international law, which govern our world \nwith justice and equity.  \n That is why, before addressing any of the issues \non our agenda, I wish to pay a well-deserved tribute to \nHis Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General, \nand to His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson, President of \nthe General Assembly at its sixtieth session, for the \narduous task that they accomplished in the face of the \nconflicts that have threatened the peace and stability of \nthe planet during 2006. \n We should also like to welcome the election of \nHer Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, \nLegal Adviser to the Royal Court of Bahrain, who will \npreside over the General Assembly at this session. We \nbelieve that her election is an implicit recognition of \nthe seriousness, dedication and dynamism that \ncharacterize her country\u2019s quest for global equilibrium \nand its respect for the principles of international law, \nhuman freedom, the right of peoples to self-\ndetermination, national independence and sovereignty, \nmutual respect among nations, and international \ncooperation to promote development and respect for \nhuman rights. \n This session opens at a time of uncertainty for \nhumanity, due to the many conflicts and the increasing \nsocio-political imbalance threatening the lives of \nmillions of people throughout the world. Humanity \ntoday finds itself in a complex situation that raises \nseveral questions. \n What is the current role of the United Nations, \ngiven the absence of priorities in its decision-making \nprocess? What has been gained since the end of the \ncold war? What kind of future can humanity hope for \nin a world of so-called globalization, governed by a \npolitical and economic system characterized by \ninequality and a lack of cooperation in eradicating \npoverty in the weakest nations? What kind of future is \nthere for the developing countries when the gap in the \nacquisition of technology for development continues to \ngrow, or when sprawling intelligence services are \nconstantly devising plans to keep the world under the \npolitical dominance and economic influence of the \nmost powerful nations? \n Those and similar questions must be the focus of \nattention of politicians and this world body if we are to \nstraighten this crooked path in international relations. \nPresently, there is no judge capable of adjudicating any \ninternational conflict equitably and impartially. From \n \n \n23 06-52885 \n \nour point of view, the authority of the United Nations \nhas been taken hostage by certain interests that are \nmonopolizing the world. Nevertheless, I am convinced \nthat we still have time to rescue the situation if we do \nnot wish to see the international community completely \nderailed, because the results obtained to date are not \nsatisfactory. \n We must first democratize this world \nOrganization by reinstating its rightful authority on the \ninternational scene. We must also set an objective \nvalue to the globalization of politics by adopting new, \nequitable political and economic strategies to protect \nthe legitimate interests of the weakest States. If we do \nnot, we must be prepared to endure a world crisis as a \nresult of our inability to sustain the current pressures \nand jarring disparities among nations. \n Many conferences held in various political, \neconomic and social forums have identified a number \nof strategies to reduce the gap that separates us all, but \nsuch strategies have always been met with the \ncomplete indifference of those who are supposed to \nexecute them. \n We ought not be surprised, then, by the \nphenomenon of terrorism that threatens the world \ntoday, because, although its methods and destructive \neffects on humans are condemnable, it remains the \nrecourse of the oppressed and a reaction of those who \noppose prevailing injustices that have been denounced \nthroughout the last quarter of a century. \n The ongoing mass migration of peoples from the \nSouth to the North is another consequence of the huge \nimbalance caused by the present unjust international \neconomic system. That migration will never cease if \nthe North does not help the South to develop with \nprogrammes of support and solidarity. \n We would like to see democracy, equity and \nsolidarity in a more harmonious world become the rule \nthat would enable international relations to function, \nespecially those governed by the Bretton Woods \ninstitutions, the World Trade Organization, the \nrelationship between the European Union and the \nnations of the African, Caribbean and the Pacific, and \nall other economic relations between the North and the \nSouth. \n Moreover, nature has endowed the world with \nimmense natural resources that are perfectly sufficient \nto allow all to live in dignity. We do not have to resort \nto draconian rules of exchange that favour some and \ndiscriminate against others. Those who seek to \nmonopolize resources that belong to humanity and who \nstill believe in the larceny of the past, or rather in their \nown ability to perpetuate illegal exploitation by force, \nare the same people who today support and maintain \nvast mercenary organizations that fall upon the weaker \nnations in order to create internal political instabilities \nfor their own selfish interests. \n Indeed, my country has been a victim of such \nplotting because we own crude oil, the product that is \ntoday dividing and destroying the world. My country \nwas able to avert a mercenary invasion on 6 March, \n2004, that was organized by powerful countries that \ncontinue to dispute among themselves and to nurture \nambitions to gain free control of the world\u2019s petroleum. \nFortunately, our security services were alerted in time \nand were able to prevent the anticipated genocide. \nThose directly responsible for the attempted coup are \nserving time in prison, while the brains behind the \nwhole thing are still at large and thumb their noses at \njustice. \n Nevertheless, my Government does not believe \nthat this natural resource belongs to us alone. My \ncountry benefits from barely 30 per cent of the \nproceeds from that exploitation, because, as we have \nexplained time and again, due to an unjust system of \nexchange, the operating contracts give the lion\u2019s share \nof those profits to our partners of the North. \n In that regard, I noted at the sixtieth session of \nthe General Assembly that if the responsibility of \ntransparency is to be borne equitably, there is a need to \ndemand the same from the operators of the extracting \nindustries and compliance with the contracts and \nregulations that guarantee equal benefits between the \nparties concerned. \n To conclude, the message from Equatorial Guinea \nis that we must respond as human beings, because we \nstill have time to make this planet Earth a better place \nfor human beings. Therefore, let us turn our backs on \ngreed, hegemonic ambition and the lack of sensitivity \nto the sight of such horror and misery that is rife in our \nworld, so that we can respond to this system of \ninjustice and inequality, and so that, as human beings, \nwe will be able to join hands and face, with solidarity, \nintelligence and wisdom, the challenge to spare \nhumanity from the scourges of war, poverty and \nunderdevelopment.

        "file_text": "I congratulate you, Madam President, and \nyour fraternal country, Bahrain, on your election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \nsession. You are the first Arab woman ever to assume \nthis high position. Your selection to this post is proof \nthat the empowerment of women has become an \nintegral part of the Arab experience.  \n I should be remiss if I failed to express to your \npredecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, our sincere appreciation \nfor the efforts he made to bring a successful conclusion \nto the work of last session. I also express our thanks to \nMr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the United \nNations, for his efforts leading the Organization for the \npast ten years. We appreciate the constructive efforts \nhe exerted during his last visit to the Middle East. \n For decades the Middle East region has been the \nstage for many daunting and exacerbated challenges. It \nhas endured continued Israeli occupation of Arab \nterritories since 1967 and the denial of the legitimate \nrights of the Palestinian people. Peoples of our region \nhave lost hope of realizing their aspirations to justice, \npeace and security. A short time ago Israel launched its \ndestructive war against Lebanon. The Palestinian \nsituation, in the grip of Israeli occupation, continues to \ndeteriorate. Acts of aggression are on the rise while the \nrights of the people continue to be trampled under foot. \nPalestinians are subjected to a crippling blockade \nbecause the advocates of democracy were dissatisfied \nwith the results of elections in the Palestinian \nterritories.  \n Our region is in the grip of a volatile situation \nbrought about by a protracted and relentless \noccupation. There are few, if any, prospects for change \nthat will hold the promise of a safe, just and stable life \nfor our people. Can we turn the current situation into a \nprelude to the solution rather than a consecration of \ntension and confrontation? \n That important question is essential to \nunderstanding the suffering of our peoples. For decades \nthey have been yearning for the realization of a just \nand comprehensive peace through a settlement of the \nArab-Israeli conflict that will end occupation, restore \nrights, and allow for the realization of the objectives of \ndevelopment. That is the path to take in order to \naddress the root causes of the problems of the region \nbefore talking about a new or a greater Middle East.  \n The international community must realize that \ncontinued Israeli occupation of Arab territories is the \nhotbed of all the problems of the region. It is the origin \nof the encompassing anger that consumes its peoples. I \nwonder, is the region destined to live one endless war \nafter another? Can any one expect our people to draw \ncomfort and satisfaction from the occupation of their \nterritories and the violation of their rights? Are they \nexpected to exalt the financers and supporters of this \n \n \n19 06-53609 \n \npersistent injustice, who can redress it only if they are \nwilling? Is the region destined to endure a new war, \ncomplementing the war against Lebanon, in favour of a \nnew Middle East, and recalling once again the \nbirthpangs of bloodshed and destruction during the war \nagainst Lebanon, instead of embracing the opportunity \nto open the door to peace in the region? \n The suffering of the Palestinian people continues \nand their tragedy has heightened over the years. Some \nmembers of the international community have become \naccustomed to dealing with the suffering as if it were a \nnatural phenomenon, not an unprecedented \nhumanitarian and national tragedy. We in Syria are \nvictims of that tragedy in all its aspects and are \ninfluenced by its repercussions. We support the efforts \nof our Palestinian brothers to close their ranks and \nencourage them to form a Government of national \nunity. The suffering of our people in the occupied \nSyrian Golan continues as well and all Syrians suffer \nbecause of this occupation. \n From this rostrum I salute the struggle and \nsteadfastness of our people in the Golan and in \nPalestine in the face of the Israeli policies of tyranny \nand terrorism. It is extremely important for the \ninternational community to recognize that the deep-\nrooted anger and resentment consuming our region, \nparticularly after the senseless war against Lebanon, \nand the continued logjam in efforts for peace, \nconstitute a dangerous and complex situation and can \nonly lead to confrontation instead of peace. This will \nnot serve the interests of anyone, inside the region or \noutside it. We too want a new Middle East, one where a \njust and comprehensive peace prevails, based on right, \njustice, and guaranteeing the same security to all. \n Fifteen years ago Syria declared that the \nestablishment of a just and comprehensive peace was \nits strategic choice. It took part in the peace process \nthat began in Madrid, based on Security Council \nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and on the \nprinciple of land for peace. Negotiations continued for \n10 years but did not bear fruit. The Syrian Golan \ncontinues to be under occupation and peace remains \nelusive. It was clear beyond any doubt that the Israeli \npolitical will to make peace was non-existent. \nPeacemaking first requires political will, to be \nfollowed by the implementation of the resolutions of \ninternational legitimacy.  \n Israel launched a brutal war against Lebanon, \ndestroying life and property. Thanks to the courageous \nLebanese resistance, its honourable steadfastness and \nits national unity, Lebanon warded off the aggression \nand defeated the aggressor. The Security Council \nultimately adopted its long-awaited resolution 1701 \n(2006), and my country, Syria, said it would cooperate \nwith the United Nations to implement that resolution.  \n Syria adopted the necessary measures to control \nits borders with fraternal Lebanon. Syria is committed \nto Lebanon\u2019s independence and sovereignty and \ndemands the withdrawal of Israel from all Lebanese \noccupied territories, including from the Lebanese \nSheba\u2019a farms. We hope that Lebanon will be able to \novercome the consequences of the Israeli aggression \nthrough the unity of its people and the assistance \nprovided by its brothers, friends, and the international \ncommunity, so that it will recover and be prosperous \nagain. I stress here Syria\u2019s commitment to the \nestablishment of good relations with Lebanon in the \ninterests of the two fraternal peoples and countries. \n On the other side of the Syrian border, Iraq is \nenduring extremely distressing circumstances that are \ncausing us serious concern as both a brother of Iraq \nand a neighbouring country. Syria supported the \npolitical process in Iraq. I reaffirm today our support \nfor the Iraqi Government that came to power after \nelections in which all segments of the Iraqi people \nparticipated. We express Syria\u2019s readiness to cooperate \nwith this Government in all fields. We support the Iraqi \nGovernment\u2019s plan for national reconciliation and \nstand ready to provide all the necessary support, \nbecause we are committed to the unity of Iraq and its \npeople.  \n Drawing up a schedule for the withdrawal of \nforeign troops from Iraq is essential, since it will assist \nin curbing the violence and ensuring the safety and \nsecurity of its citizens. Syria, which mourns every drop \nof Iraqi blood shed, repeats its condemnation of all the \nterrorist acts that have been and continue to be \nperpetrated in Iraq, resulting in a high toll among \ninnocent Iraqi citizens. \n Five years have passed since the terrorist criminal \nact of 11 September 2001, which left thousands of \ninnocent people dead. I repeat our condemnation of \nthat act and our sympathy with the victims of that \nheinous terrorist crime. To the American people, who \nwere the force behind great scientific achievements \n  \n \n06-53609 20 \n \nthat benefited humanity, I say, \u201cYou are the victims of \npolicies that were proved wrong in the Arab and other \nregions of the world.\u201d Many innocent people in places \nso distant from the United States of America have \nunfortunately paid the price and suffered the dire \nconsequences of those failed policies.  \n Tragically enough, we all end up paying a heavy \nprice when the decision makers in Washington believe \nthat they know better and are in a better position to \nunderstand and grasp the needs and circumstances of \nthe Arabs. They diagnose the ambitions and aspirations \nof the Arab individual in a manner that is tailored to \ntheir own vision.  \n The fact is that we, the people of the region, \nknow our circumstances and the priorities of the \nmillions angered by the denial of their sovereign, \nnational rights. If anyone asked the angry millions \nabout their priorities and objectives, the sure answer \nwould be \u201cWe want an end to the Israeli occupation of \nour lands in Palestine, Lebanon and the Golan. We \nwant to recover all our usurped rights. We want the \nflow of American weapons to Israel, which are sowing \ndeath and destruction, to stop. We refuse hegemony \nover our resources and interference in our affairs. We \nwant a Middle East governed by peace and built on \nright and justice, a Middle East where people can \ndedicate all their energies and resources to \ndevelopment and progress and embrace the positive \ntrends in contemporary human thought and endeavour.\u201d \n After years of the war on terror, one asks \u201cHas \nthe world become a safer place?\u201d It is clear that the \nwar did not achieve its objective and that terror has \nbecome more widespread. That could be explained by \nthe fact that combating terrorism exclusively through \nthe use of force accomplishes nothing unless the root \ncauses of terrorism are addressed. We must mobilize \nthe efforts of the international community to deal with \nthis dangerous scourge, taking into account the need to \ndistinguish between fighting terrorism and people\u2019s \nlegitimate right to resist foreign occupation.  \n We also believe that the war on terror has been \nmisused at times. It looked as if it was masking the \nclash of cultures and civilizations, which eventually \nnot only proved detrimental to the interests of all the \nparties concerned but also played into the hands of \nterrorists and terrorism. \n Israel is the sole Power in possession of nuclear \nweapons in the Middle East. It refuses to adhere to the \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \nand to submit to the comprehensive safeguards regime \nof the International Atomic Energy Agency. That poses \na threat to peace and security in the region. On \n29 December 2003, on behalf of the Arab Group, Syria \nsubmitted to the Security Council a draft resolution to \nrid the Middle East region of all weapons of mass \ndestruction. We still hope to adopt that resolution as \nsoon as possible.  \n My country joins many other developing \ncountries that have expressed concern over the \nrestrictions on access by Member States, particularly \ndeveloping countries, to nuclear technology for \npeaceful purposes. \n In conclusion I stress that the Middle East \ncurrently stands at a crossroads. It has the option either \nto take the road to justice, peace and security, or be \nfaced, even more than before, with tension and \nconfrontation that would not be in the interests of any \nparty inside or outside the region. It is up to the parties \nconcerned to understand the danger inherent in turning \nour backs on the road to peace, not yet taken. \nEverything also hinges on the active role that our \ninternational Organization must play to maintain \ninternational peace and security, beginning with the \nimplementation of Security Council resolutions 242 \n(1967) and 338 (1973). I hope that objectivity and the \ndesire for peace will trump other options so that the \nMiddle East can be ushered into a new, secure and \nprosperous era after decades of suffering. "

        "file_text": "It \nis a source of great satisfaction to be here to represent \nmy people, my homeland, Bolivia, and especially the \nindigenous movement. After more than 500 years of \ncontempt and hatred for peoples once considered \nsavages and animals \u2014 peoples who in some regions \nwere condemned to extermination \u2014 we have come to \nright a historical wrong, to right the wrongs of 500 \nyears, thanks to today\u2019s awareness and the uprising and \nstruggle for the rights of peoples. \n During the period of the Republic, when we were \nalso discriminated against and marginalized, the \nstruggle of peoples for life and humanity was never \ntaken into account. Over the past 20 years, through the \napplication of an economic model, neo-liberalism, the \nplundering of our natural resources and the \nprivatization of basic services continued. We are \nconvinced that privatizing basic services is the best \nway to violate human rights. \n Those minor considerations require us \u2014 and \nrequire me personally \u2014 to speak the truth here about \nthe lives of families. I come to express this feeling for \nthe humanity of peoples, of my people; I come to \nexpress the suffering caused by marginalization and \nexclusion; and, above all, I come to express the anti-\ncolonial thoughts of peoples who are fighting for \nequality and justice. \n In my country, we are beginning to seek profound \ndemocratic and peaceful change. We are in the process \nof identifying ways to recreate Bolivia in order to unite \nBolivians; to recreate Bolivia in order to bring all the \nsectors and regions of my country closer together; to \nrecreate Bolivia, but not to take revenge against \nanyone, although we have been subjected to \ndiscrimination; and, in particular, to recreate Bolivia to \nput an end to this contempt, this hatred for peoples. I \nsay this because my mother told me that when she \nwould go to the city, she did not have the right to walk \nin the main squares of my country\u2019s cities; as recently \nas 30 or 40 years ago, she did not have the right to \nwalk on the pavement. \n Fortunately, however, we have decided to move \nbeyond that social, labour and communal struggle to a \nnew electoral struggle so that we ourselves can resolve \nsocial, economic and structural problems. We are \ncasting our lot with the reform-minded Constituent \nAssembly. I would like the United Nations to \nparticipate in this process of peaceful and democratic \nchange, which is the best thing that we could do for our \nabandoned and marginalized families. \n Surely, many other countries have the same \nproblems as my country, a nation with so much wealth \nbut also so much poverty. Historically, our natural \nresources were stolen, plundered, sold off and \ndelivered to transnational corporations by neo-liberal \nGovernments. The time has come for those in the \nvanguard of the struggle of peoples for power and \nterritory to recover those natural resources for the \nBolivian State so that they can be under the people\u2019s \ncontrol. \n When we talk about recovering our natural \nresources, they tell us, in this dirty campaign of \naccusations, that the Government of Evo Morales is not \ngoing to respect private property. I want to tell them \nthat my Government will respect private property. It is \ntrue that we need investment; we need partners \u2014 not \nbosses, not owners of our natural resources. We \nunderstand perfectly well that an underdeveloped \ncountry needs investment. \n  \n \n06-52737 34 \n \n I would like to clear up for everyone a number of \nconcerns and false accusations. If the Bolivian State \nexercises its property rights over natural resources such \nas natural gas, hydrocarbons and petroleum, we will \nnot expel anyone or confiscate anything. Investors will \nbe respected; indeed, they will be guaranteed a return \non their investment and the right to make a profit. But \nthey will not make fat profits as they did before, and \nthen fail to resolve my country\u2019s social problems. \n I have not come to tell anyone how to govern. I \nhave not come to threaten a country or to start to set \nconditions for a country. I wish only to ask that, as \ninternational organizations, as States with a spirit of \nsolidarity, as nations with principles of reciprocity and \nbrotherhood, all players participate in the process of \nmoving towards democracy. We are very concerned \nthat there be an awareness, in international forums such \nas the United Nations, of the need to work to bring \nabout peaceful change. \n All are aware, in North America in particular as \nwell as in Europe, that many Bolivians are leaving \ntheir country to find work. It used to be Europeans who \ninvaded Latin America, and especially Bolivia. Now, \nhowever, it seems that the situation has changed. It is \nthe Latin Americans and the Bolivians who are \ninvading Europe, as they did previously the United \nStates. Why? Because, at the present time, there are no \njobs. What is needed is fair trade, trade by peoples for \npeoples, trade that resolves employment problems. \n Of course, trade by corporations is important, but \ntrade by small producers is even more important. For \nthe benefit of these cooperatives, these associations \nand these collectives, their products \u2014 not my brothers \nand sisters \u2014 are the ones that should go to Europe. \nThat is what we wish to see. Greater awareness on the \npart of the international community is required if we \nwish to resolve the problem of migration. \n Our brothers and sisters will not go take over \nthousands of hectares, as others did when they came to \nLatin America. They came to take our wealth and our \nresources. It is important to note that, even in my \ncountry, this so-called free trade is affecting major \nagribusiness concerns. As a consequence of the free \ntrade agreement that Colombia signed with the United \nStates, soy farmers, Bolivians, and even Colombian \nagribusiness concerns have lost market share. I am \nconvinced that it is important to import what we do not \nproduce and export what we do produce. That would \nresolve economic problems and the problem of \nunemployment. \n I should like to take this opportunity to speak of \nanother historical injustice: the criminalization of the \ncoca leaf. This coca leaf is green, not white, like \ncocaine. The coca leaf is symbolic of Andean culture, \nof the Andean environment and of the hopes of \npeoples. It is not acceptable that the coca leaf be legal \nfor Coca-Cola and illegal for medicinal consumption \nnot only in our country but throughout the world. \n The United Nations should be aware that \nscientific studies have been carried out in American \nand European universities that have shown that the \ncoca leaf has no negative effects on human health. I am \nvery sorry that because some have a drug habit, the \ncoca leaf has become illegal. We are aware of that. \nThat is why, as coca leaf producers, we have stated that \nthere will not be unfettered coca leaf production, but \nneither will there be zero production. Conditionality-\nbased policies implemented in the past focused on zero \ncoca-leaf production. But zero coca-leaf production is \nequivalent to zero Quechuas, zero Aymar\u00e1s, zero \nMoje\u00f1os, zero Chiquitanos. All of that ended with \nanother Government. We are an underdeveloped \ncountry with economic problems resulting from the \npillage of our natural resources. We are here today to \nbegin to regain our dignity and the dignity of our \ncountry. \n In that context, I wish to say that the best \ncontribution to combating drug trafficking has been \nthrough an agreed, voluntary reduction, with no deaths \nor injuries. I was pleased to hear that the United \nNations report recognizes the honest and responsible \neffort that has been made to combat drug trafficking. \nDrug seizures have increased 300 per cent. However, \nyesterday I heard the United States Government state \nthat it would not accept coca cultivation and that it was \nimposing conditions on us so that we would change our \nsystem. \n I want to say, with all due respect for the United \nStates Government, that we are not going to change \nanything. We do not need blackmail or threats. The so-\ncalled certifications or de-certifications used in the \ncombat against drug trafficking are simply an \ninstrument for the recolonization or colonization of \nAndean countries. We will not accept or allow this. \n We want, and need, an alliance to combat drug \ntrafficking, but it must be genuine and effective. The \n \n \n35 06-52737 \n \nwar on drugs cannot be an instrument or a pretext to \nsubjugate the Andean countries, just as the idea of \npreventive war was invented to intervene in certain \ncountries of the Middle East. We must wage an \neffective battle against drug trafficking. I call on the \nUnited Nations and invite the Government of the \nUnited States to reach an agreement and to forge an \neffective alliance to combat drug trafficking. The war \non drugs should not be used as an excuse or a pretext \nto dominate or humiliate us, or to try to establish \nmilitary bases in our country under the pretext of \ncombating the drug trade. \n I should like also to take this opportunity, in the \ncontext of this process of change, to say that we want \njustice. That is important to our peoples. I believe that, \nthrough the Constituent Assembly, justice will be \ndecolonized and nationalized. That will be true justice. \nAs long as some violate others\u2019 human rights, as long \nas peoples are threatened by military intervention, \nthere will never be justice. \n We are committed, as Presidents and heads of \nState, to safeguarding the dignity of humanity by \nputting an end to the impunity promoted by my \ncountry\u2019s previous Governments and to the massacres \nof people demanding their economic rights and \nclaiming their natural resources. It is not acceptable \nthat the perpetrators of genocide and the most corrupt \ncriminals can escape and move to the United States. \nWith all due respect, I ask the United States, as a \ndeveloped country, to expel those corrupt, genocidal \ncriminals who are living there. If they have nothing to \nhide, why are they not defending themselves before the \nBolivian judiciary? \n I am obligated, as President, to ensure that they \nare tried by the Bolivian justice system. I do not \nbelieve that any country or any head of State can \nprotect criminals or those who are guilty of genocide. I \nhope that, with the support of the American people, \nthrough international organizations, those responsible \nfor so much economic damage and so many violations \nof human rights will be brought to justice, or there will \nnever be respect for human rights. \n I have been entrusted by the Permanent Forum on \nIndigenous Issues to say the following. Previously, \ndebates on the rights of indigenous peoples were held \nin the United Nations Sub-commission dealing with \nthat issue, in Geneva, and in the framework of the \nOrganization of American States (OAS). But I have \nbeen informed that the debate has now moved to this \nhighest of bodies, the United Nations itself. \n I call on the Assembly, on behalf of the \nindigenous peoples of the world, and particularly those \nof Abiallal \u2014 now known as America \u2014 urgently to \nadopt the declaration on the rights of the indigenous \npeoples of the world: the right to self-determination, \nthe right to live in communities, and the right to live a \nlife based on solidarity and reciprocity, and, above all, \non brotherhood. \n There are regions and communities where there is \nno private property, only community property. We \nindigenous peoples want, quite simply, to live well, not \nbetter. Living better means exploiting, pillaging, \nrobbing, whereas living well is living peacefully in \nbrotherhood. That is why it is extremely important for \nthe United Nations, after the Decade of the Indigenous \nPeoples, to adopt as a matter of urgency the \nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, \nincluding the right to natural resources and the right to \ncare for the environment. \n We indigenous peoples, particularly the poor, are \nof the culture of life, not the culture of war. This \nmillennium must really be about defending life and \nsaving humanity. If we want to save humanity, we must \nsave the planet Earth. We indigenous peoples live in \nharmony with Mother Earth, not only in reciprocity \nand solidarity with human beings. We are very sorry \nthat hegemonistic policies and rivalries are destroying \nthe planet Earth. I feel that it is important for all \ncountries, societies and international organizations to \nbegin to debate this subject truly, in order to save the \nplanet Earth, to save humanity. \n This new millennium in which we are living must \nbe a millennium of life, not war, a millennium of the \npeople, not of empire, a millennium of justice and \nequality; and all economic policies must be directed \ntowards ending or at least reducing the so-called \nasymmetries or differences between countries and \nsocial inequalities. There is no question now of \nimplementing policies that involve the economic \nhumiliation or pillaging of others, whether with rules \nor with troops. \n With all due respect, I wish to say that it is \nimportant for the troops to be withdrawn from Iraq, if \nwe want to respect human rights. It is important to \nabandon economic policies that allow capital to be \nconcentrated in just a few hands. I feel that these \n  \n \n06-52737 36 \n \nactions have to be of historic importance in order to \nchange the world and to change economic models and \ninterventionist policies. In particular, we want these to \nbe times which enable us to defend and save humanity. "

        "file_text": "The global game has \nchanged. Interdependence and globalization are \noccurring at an unprecedented speed. With \nglobalization, the concept of national sovereignty has \nchanged. The international order based on the nation \nState \u2014 established in 1648 with the Peace of \nWestphalia \u2014 is being challenged. Non-State actors are \nbecoming more and more influential on the global \nscene. Private militias and transnational criminal \nmovements are increasingly responsible for conflicts \nthat used to be between State actors, as well as for \nundermining agreements entered into and adhered to by \nStates. \n The boundaries between domestic and foreign \npolicy are changing. Developments in one part of the \nworld often trigger unintended actions in other parts of \nthe world. If we look the other way when faced with \nconflicts and human suffering, problems will grow, \nthey will not disappear. To meet the goals and \nchallenges confronting the global community, we need \nmore than ever a dynamic and proactive United \nNations. \n The United Nations has to proactively address the \nagenda set by globalization, and it must be able to \nchange in order to effectively meet and deliver on the \nnew challenges. It is in everybody\u2019s interest to have an \nefficient United Nations. The Organization adds moral \nforce to the international community\u2019s actions in a \nglobalized world. An effective United Nations can \nalleviate the negative effects of globalization and turn \nit into a positive force. All of us have to work to ensure \nthat the necessary reform steps to be initiated. \n Last September\u2019s World Summit set an ambitious \nagenda for the United Nations and the General \nAssembly. I am pleased that we have achieved \n \n \n25 06-53317 \n \nconsiderable results. Prominent examples include the \nestablishment of the Human Rights Council, the \nPeacebuilding Commission and the Central Emergency \nResponse Fund. The two new organs represent a long \noverdue institutional modernization of the United \nNations that, if used as intended, will help the United \nNations to address new challenges. That is why \nDenmark has put so much effort into helping to foster \nthe Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding \nCommission. \n With Burundi and Sierra Leone on the agenda, \nthe Peacebuilding Commission has chosen two nations \nin need, but also two nations willing to join forces with \nthe international community in their endeavour to build \ntheir nations. \n As it should, the Human Rights Council allows \nfor closer scrutiny by the international community of \ndomestic affairs \u2014 not because we wish to punish but \nbecause we wish to help improve. Such scrutiny is a \ndesirable monitoring mechanism to ensure the \nprotection of people from abuse by their own \nGovernments. Let us avoid politicizing the work of this \nnew body and instead, in a spirit of cooperation, ensure \nthat the Human Rights Council is successful in meeting \nthe objectives laid down by the General Assembly. In \nthat context, I would also like to draw attention to the \ndecision by the Human Rights Council to recommend \nto the sixty-first session of the General Assembly the \nadoption of the draft declaration on the rights of \nindigenous peoples. Work on the draft declaration has \nbeen under way for more than 20 years. It is high time \nthat we, the Governments, approve that landmark \ninstrument aimed at furthering the rights and \naspirations of the world\u2019s indigenous peoples. \n In June, as President of the Security Council, \nDenmark sought to highlight the importance of \nstrengthening international law. We picked up the torch \nfrom the 2005 World Summit by calling a special \nmeeting on the critical role of international law in \nfostering stability and order in international relations \n(see S/PV.5474). The Security Council spoke out \nclearly in favour of international law, both in general \nterms and with regard to specific topics such as \ndelisting with respect to sanctions. Denmark will \ncontinue to pursue those topics, and we call upon all \nMember States to join us. \n The reform agenda is far from exhausted. The \nSecurity Council should be reformed to better reflect \nthe world of today. Furthermore, we need to make \nsubstantial progress on mandate review and \nmanagement reform during this session of the General \nAssembly. Otherwise, we will not be able to meet the \nchallenges. Member States should not micromanage \nthe United Nations, but should build a strong and fast-\nresponding Organization to meet new challenges.  \n The United Nations must play a strong role in \norder to secure positive gains from globalization for \ndeveloping countries. Denmark eagerly looks forward \nto the recommendations of the High-level Panel on \nUnited Nations System-wide Coherence. Our aim is to \nenhance on the ground the efficiency and impact of \nUnited Nations development cooperation. \n It is a cause for concern that we have witnessed \nthe resurgence of the notion of respect for national \nsovereignty as a justification for inaction in \ninternational affairs. There is of course no denying that \nnation-States remain the constituent part of the \ninternational system and of this very Organization. But \nrespect for sovereignty can never become an excuse for \naccepting massive human rights violations. That was \nthe key message from the Summit last year, when \nheads of State pronounced their support for the notion \nof the responsibility to protect. \n The Security Council has consistently worked to \nuphold the sovereignty of Lebanon since 2004. In \nAugust of this year, the Council intervened to stop the \nwar between Hizbollah and Israel, and decided to send \nthousands of peacekeepers to help the Lebanese \nGovernment extent its authority to all parts of the \ncountry. We call upon all regional players to work \nconstructively towards that goal. Security Council \nresolution 1701 (2006) must be fully respected by all \nparties. Denmark is actively considering ways to \npromote the implementation of resolution 1701 (2006), \nincluding by assisting the Secretary-General in his \nendeavours to find ways forward on the political \naspects. \n The war between Hizbollah and Israel proved the \nvolatility of the Middle East. For decades, the \ninternational community has sought to address the \nArab-Israeli conflict, which continues to breed hatred \nand fanaticism. We must support moderate forces for \nreform and empower them to stand up against \ncentrifugal tendencies. We need to redouble our efforts \nto finally achieve a comprehensive and lasting two-\nState solution to that tragic conflict. It is in nobody\u2019s \n  \n \n06-53317 26 \n \ninterest that the instability in the Middle East \ncontinues. \n The same goes for the Sudan. The Council\u2019s \ndecision last month to continue preparations for a \nUnited Nations peacekeeping force to relieve the \nAfrican Union force and stop the senseless carnage of \ncivilians in Darfur drew sharp criticism from the \nGovernment of the Sudan and was denounced as neo-\ncolonialism and a violation of its sovereign rights. But, \nI ask, whose rights are really being violated here? \nRather than the rights of the Government of the Sudan, \nI submit that it is the right of the population of Darfur \nto receive protection that is being violated. It is \nincumbent upon the international community to act if a \nGovernment fails to fulfil the responsibility to protect. \nI call upon the Government of the Sudan to work with \nus, not against us, in protecting the population of \nDarfur.  \n In Afghanistan the security situation continues to \nbe of great concern. We are, individually and \ncollectively, being tested on our commitment to assist \nthe Afghan people on their path towards a just and \nprosperous future. Warlords, financed by the opium \ntrade, threaten the democratic rights of the people. The \nUnited Nations must continue to support the \nremarkable transformation process undertaken by the \nAfghan people and their Government. \n We wish to see a stronger role for the United \nNations in Iraq, in order to contribute to peaceful and \ndemocratic development. A necessary precondition to \nimprove the situation is better living conditions for all \nin Iraq. Needless to say, it is in our common interest to \nassist the Iraqi people in their struggle to reform and \nbuild their country. It must not fall victim to \nsectarianism and terrorism. If that happens the whole \nregion will become destabilized. \n The most serious danger associated with \nglobalization is the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction. The Security Council reacted in unity to \ndeplore the 4 July launch of several missiles by the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. We call upon \nPyongyang to return to the Six-Party Talks.  \n Iran has failed to respond to the demands of the \nSecurity Council. We call upon Tehran to suspend \nenrichment activities and accept negotiations on the \ngenerous package. \n Weapons of mass destruction and terrorism \nrepresent a deadly combination. Terrorism is already in \nitself one of the major threats to international peace \nand stability. We all remember the tragedies here in the \nUnited States five years ago, as well as the terrorist \nattacks in London, Madrid, Amman, Bali, Saudi \nArabia, Egypt and Turkey. I am very pleased that the \nUnited Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy \n(resolution 60/288) has now been adopted by the \nGeneral Assembly. That gives us renewed hope that we \nmay also conclude the negotiations on a comprehensive \nconvention this year. I call upon all States to seriously \nattempt to bridge the differing views that exist with \nregard to that very important convention, in order that \nwe can combat the scourge of our time, terrorism. \n As Chairman of the Security Council\u2019s Counter-\nTerrorism Committee, Denmark is working towards the \nstrengthening of the international fight against \nterrorism through improved cooperation between the \nCouncil and Member States. \n Let me conclude my statement by expressing \nDenmark\u2019s sincere appreciation to Secretary-General \nKofi Annan for his tireless efforts to promote a more \njust, prosperous and peaceful world and for his \nleadership of the United Nations. For almost 10 years, \nKofi Annan has served in an office where expectations \nfor action are not always matched by the requisite \npowers and the means to act. He has impressively \ncarried a heavy burden through troubled times, and \nrecently has even undertaken new challenges in the \nMiddle East and in the world at large. His act will be a \ndifficult one to follow. Let his heritage be that the \nstones he lifted do not roll back down the mountain. "

        "file_text": "I congratulate Sheikha \nHaya Rashed Al-Khalifa on assuming the presidency of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-first session. I also \ncommend her predecessor, Jan Eliasson of Sweden, for \nhis outstanding performance as President of the \nGeneral Assembly at the preceding session. \n I acknowledge and pay tribute to Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan for his many years of dedication \nto the United Nations. The Government and people of \nthe Bahamas are profoundly grateful to Secretary-\nGeneral Annan for all that he has done for the United \nNations, and I look forward to welcoming him one day \nto the Bahamas so that we might thank him personally. \n I also congratulate and welcome Montenegro as \nthe 192nd State Member of the United Nations and \nconvey the best wishes of the Government of the \nBahamas for the prosperity and welfare of all its \npeople. \n The Bahamas stands for democracy, the rule of \nlaw and the right to self-determination. In this very \nbody, before the Committee of 24 on decolonization, \nour national leaders made the case for the \nindependence of our country. We were able to achieve \nthat in 1973, and ever since then successive \nadministrations have voiced the Bahamas\u2019 support of \nthe same principles. I do so again today. In doing so, I \nremind this body that the Bahamas and the region of \nwhich it is a part are shining examples to all the world \nof all of those principles. Within the next year, the \nBahamian people will again have the opportunity to \nchoose their Government in a general election based on \nuniversal adult suffrage. There have been, within the \npast year in our region, similar general elections in St. \nVincent and the Grenadines and Guyana. The Bahamas \ndoes not support the use of the military in Government \nor to overthrow legitimately elected Governments. \nWherever that occurs, it must be deplored and there \nmust be a return to constitutional democratic rule \nwithin the shortest possible time. \n In our foreign policy, the Bahamas believes in \npeace with all nations and we seek to avoid ideological \nbattles. Ours is a policy that avoids extremism, while at \nthe same time letting our voice be heard for the \ndispossessed. We have the right to be here to speak for \nourselves and to speak for those who cannot speak. Our \npeople have fought for their voice to be heard and they \nwill be heard. \n My delegation welcomes the attempt by the \nSecurity Council to increase the transparency of the \nselection process in that body for the post of Secretary-\nGeneral by apprising the President of the General \nAssembly of its proposed actions on this matter and on \nthe results of the straw polls. We would take this \nopportunity to assure this body that whoever succeeds \nto the post will have our support and cooperation. \n It was just over a year ago that we adopted the \n2005 World Summit Outcome Document that has \nserved as the road map for reform efforts over the past \n12 months. The Bahamas, like other States Members of \nthis Organization, is pleased that a number of reforms \nhave been implemented. In that regard, we note the \nPeacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights \nCouncil. With regard to the Human Rights Council, we \nhope that it will evolve as an entity dedicated to a \nprocess of constructive dialogue and cooperation in \nwhich all countries may participate on an equal \nfooting. \n The Bahamas renews its commitment to the \nMillennium Development Goals, and in particular to \nuniversal education, fighting HIV/AIDS, equality for \nwomen and cutting poverty in half by 2015. The \ncountry\u2019s international, award-winning Urban Renewal \nInitiative has begun to address in particular the issue of \npoverty in the Bahamas. The further reform of the \nEconomic and Social Council should lead to its being \n \n \n17 06-53615 \n \nempowered to implement the internationally agreed \ndevelopment goals and commitments to the eradication \nof poverty, hunger and all other ills that continue to \nplague humanity. \n I turn now to the United Nations Global Counter-\nTerrorism Strategy and the issue of regional global \nsecurity. We renew our commitments in that area. \nHowever, as we have done for the past four years, we \nwant to take the opportunity to further define our \nsecurity interests as not being limited to the strategies \ndefined by a narrow view of counter-terrorism. We \nbelieve that counter-terrorism strategies should be \ninformed by a much broader definition, namely, as \nensuring the stability of our societies as we fight our \nvulnerabilities to drug traffickers, natural and \nenvironmental disasters and poverty, and our \nchallenges with education and health care. In \nparticular, we call upon the developed economies in \nour region and further afield to remember their moral \nand legal obligations to stop the assault of small arms \non our societies, to cooperate in stopping the flow of \ndrugs through our region, and to work together with us \nin declaring the Caribbean Sea and its environs to be a \nnuclear-free zone. There must be a strategic alliance \nbetween developed economies and those in our region \nto ensure that those security vulnerabilities are \nminimized, if not eliminated. \n The Bahamas is greatly heartened by the fact that \nMember States have agreed on the text of the \nconvention on the rights of persons with disabilities, \nwhich is to be adopted by the General Assembly in the \nmonths ahead. That landmark convention recognizes \nthe importance for persons with disabilities of their \nindividual autonomy and independence, including the \nfreedom to make their own choices, and it \nacknowledges that those persons should have the \nopportunity to be actively involved in decision-making \nprocesses about policies and programmes, particularly \nthose of direct concern to them. That is an important \nstep in empowering not only persons with disabilities, \nbut also the neighbourhoods, communities, societies \nand countries in which they live. For too long, persons \nwith disabilities have been marginalized in many \nsettings, depriving them of their rights as citizens and \ndepriving society of the many contributions they could \nmake in the exercise of their full and unimpeded \nparticipation. The Bahamas plans legislation to further \nempower the disabled during the current session of our \nParliament. \n It has often been said that reform is a process and \nnot an event. We continue to support reform of the \nSecurity Council so that it may more accurately reflect \nthe interests and balance of power in the realities of the \ntwenty-first century, including allowing small island \ndeveloping States to play a greater role in its activities. \nIt is our hope that, during this sixty-first session of the \nGeneral Assembly, we will see some significant \nmovement in the reform of the Security Council. \n Any reform would mean very little, however, if it \ndid not ultimately translate into the well-being of the \npeople of this planet. In that vein, the Bahamas will do \nits part towards the implementation of the global \npartnership for development and the translation of that \npartnership into not only effective international, \nmultilateral economic, trading, financial and \nenvironmental governance systems and mechanisms, \nbut also into the proliferation of healthy, productive \nhouseholds and communities that contribute to \nincreased global welfare and security.  \n We want to take this opportunity to recall our \nconcern about coercive measures by developed States \nthat adversely affect the trade in services in the \nBahamian economy and in our region generally. We \nreiterate our call for levelling the playing field and for \na global forum to address how the issue of a level \nplaying field can be translated into international public \npolicy. \n The Bahamas welcomed and participated in the \nrecent High-level Dialogue on International Migration \nand Development. At that time, the Bahamas outlined \nthe many positive impacts that international migration \nhad made on its economy and cultural development. \nHowever, the Bahamas also noted the many challenges \nthe country had experienced over the previous 60 years \nin managing migration, including those related to the \nprevention of irregular or unauthorized migration.  \n For the Bahamas, irregular or unauthorized \nmigration has given rise to considerable challenges in \nthe social and educational sectors, as well as to serious \nnational security issues. In this regard, the Bahamas \nhas pledged to work with our partners in the region \ntowards the establishment of a better way to match the \nsupply with the demand for migration in safe, legal, \nhumane and orderly ways, in order to maximize the \nsocietal and human development potential of global \nlabour mobility, with the involvement of private-sector \nand public-sector stakeholders. \n  \n \n06-53615 18 \n \n The Bahamas is committed to sustainable \ndevelopment. To a small-island developing State, there \nare few things more important than securing the \nnecessary assistance in order to build resilience against \nthe many hazards that afflict the country on a \nconsistent basis, including violent storms or hurricanes, \nwhich pass through our region even more frequently as \na result of global warming. In this connection, we look \nto our partners in the region, the hemisphere and \naround the world to reduce greenhouse gases. We call \non those countries that have not yet done so to sign the \nKyoto Protocol. It is also imperative that we all \ncommit ourselves to the development of alternative \nsources of energy, in order to become less dependent \non the current polluting technologies that supply our \nenergy needs but threaten our sustainability. \n The Bahamas would like to take this opportunity \nto once again congratulate the people of one of our \nregional partners, Haiti, on the election and installation \nof its democratically elected Government. It is \nimperative that the international community do all it \npossibly can to help Haiti establish stability and \nsecurity and promote sustained and sustainable \ndevelopment within its national borders. \n As I have stated on previous occasions, the \nBahamas, which sits some 90 miles over the seas to the \nnorth of Haiti, has a special interest in its stability and \nprosperity. Instability in Haiti is bound to cause \ninstability in the Bahamas. A significant proportion of \nthe population in the Bahamas is either Haitian or of \nHaitian descent. A migration crisis resulting from \ninstability in Haiti will have an immediate effect on the \nBahamas. Such a crisis would be difficult for our \ncountry to endure and, with the will of the Haitian \ncommunity and the support of the world community, \nwe believe that it can and should be avoided. \n The Bahamas has always made known its support \nfor the people of Haiti and their aspirations for peace, \nsecurity and development. We have and continue to \ntake seriously our commitment to assist the people of \nHaiti in taking charge of their destiny and placing their \ncountry on the path to enduring democracy and \ndevelopment. The Bahamas believes that it is therefore \nimperative that the promised international financial \nassistance to Haiti is delivered in a timely and efficient \nmanner. \n I would also like to take this opportunity to signal \nmy Government\u2019s support for the upcoming Caribbean \nCommunity (CARICOM) and Caribbean Common \nMarket initiative to encourage the United Nations to \nmark and commemorate the 200th anniversary of the \nabolition of the transatlantic slave trade in 2007. \nSlavery and the concomitant slave trade together stand \nas one of the most vicious violations of human rights in \nrecorded history. As the global sentinel for human \nrights, the United Nations has a duty to highlight the \n200th anniversary of the cessation of this crime against \nhumanity with a special event in 2007. We hope that \nthis initiative will receive the wide and enthusiastic \nsupport of this General Assembly and indeed of the \nwider United Nations community. \n This commemoration will present an ideal \nopportunity to pay tribute to peoples of African descent \nacross the entire spectrum of the diaspora who share a \ncommon heritage and, having survived the middle \npassage, have gone on to form the bedrock on which \nthe prosperity of many developed countries has been \nbuilt. For its part, the Bahamas plans to undertake a \nnumber of commemorative events including a festival \nof arts which will run from March 2007 to January \n2008. During the festival, a different country or region \nof Africa will be showcased each month as a means of \nexposing Bahamians to the rich culture of Africa \nthrough theatre, art, music and dance. \n One of the other challenges that we will face \nduring this session is reaching agreement on the scale \nof assessments for the apportionment of expenses of \nthe United Nations for the next triennium. We look \nforward to engaging with other Member States to \nachieve a scale of assessments that is broadly based on \nthe principle of the capacity to pay, and that it is \ntransparent, equitable and stable. \n The Bahamas continues to believe that the \nCharter of the United Nations constitutes a viable and \nfirm foundation on which the Organization can balance \nand achieve its objectives to maintain international \npeace and security and to promote economic and social \nprogress. I want to take this opportunity to reaffirm the \ncommitment of the Bahamas to the principles \nenshrined in that universal document, as well as to the \nongoing process of reform, which seeks to more \neffectively translate these principles into real peace, \nsecurity and sustainable development for all the \nworld\u2019s inhabitants. While dramatic progress may \nsometimes evade us, we must not be swayed from our \ncourse, and we must remain confident that our \n \n \n19 06-53615 \n \nactivities and efforts will benefit future generations. \nNow more than ever we need the United Nations.

        "file_text": "It is a \ngreat pleasure to extend to you, Madam President, the \nwarmest congratulations of my delegation on your \nelection to the presidency of the sixty-first session. In \ngiving you their trust as the third woman to preside \nover the General Assembly, the Member States wished \nto recognize your talents as a skilled diplomat and to \npay tribute to the important contribution of your \ncountry to achieving our noble ideals of freedom, \npeace and prosperity in the world. My country, which \nshares common values with yours, wishes you every \n  \n \n06-53609 4 \n \nsuccess in fulfilling your mandate. I should also like to \ncommend the remarkable work done by your \npredecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, who steered the work of \nthe sixtieth session with great wisdom and \neffectiveness. \n Another very pleasant duty is to convey to a \nvaluable son of Africa, Secretary-General Kofi Annan, \nthe highest appreciation of His Excellency General \nLansana Cont\u00e9, President of the Republic, for his \neminent contribution to promoting the fundamental \nvalues of the United Nations. At this time, when he is \ngetting ready to pass on the torch, I should like to \nexpress to him our deepest gratitude.  \n Guinea also welcomes the admission of \nMontenegro to the great family of the United Nations. \n In September 2005 the General Assembly \nadopted, as the outcome of a high-level meeting, \nimportant decisions which are a road map for \nimplementing the Millennium Development Goals and \nfor reforming the Organization to adapt it to a changing \nworld. My delegation is pleased with the reforms \nbegun and the progress achieved. We welcome the \nestablishment of the Human Rights Council, an \nappropriate tool to promote basic rights as well as good \nnational and international governance. Likewise, we \nhope that the new Peacebuilding Commission will \nmake an important contribution to mobilizing the \nnecessary resources to help countries emerging from \nconflict.  \n However, six decades after the creation of the \nUnited Nations, consistent action by the Organization \nin terms of development, humanitarian aid and the \nenvironment is still an unfinished work. The reform of \nthe Secretariat\u2019s management, which implies individual \nand collective sacrifices, aims not only at reducing the \ncosts of the United Nations, but also at better \ninvestment in order to enhance its effectiveness. To \nmove forward, the international community must \nconsolidate the reforms and extend them to the \nprincipal organs of the Organization. Guinea firmly \nsupports this dynamic, which is the only thing that can \nensure the transparency, representativeness and \neffectiveness of its bodies. This process depends, of \ncourse, on the political will of all its Member States, \nwithout exception. \n In the maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity we see reasons for both satisfaction and \nconcern.  \n In Africa, and in particular the western part, my \ndelegation is happy that peace has been restored to \nGuinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone and Liberia. However, the \nbalance in these States is still precarious. We therefore \nurge the international community to strengthen its \ncooperation with their democratically elected \nGovernments in order to strengthen peace and to \nensure the rapid recovery of their economies.  \n In C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire the peace process is entering a \ndecisive phase, with the settlement of sensitive issues \nrelated to the holding of upcoming free and fair \nelections. Guinea encourages the parties to fully \ncooperate in continued dialogue with a view to a \nsuccessful outcome to the crisis.  \n The significant progress made in the Great Lakes \nregion in recent months is encouraging.  \n The general elections held on 30 July in the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo are a crucial stage \nin the peace process. But keeping troops of the United \nNations Mission in the Democratic Republic of the \nCongo (MONUC) there, in support of Government \nefforts, is still crucial to restoring State authority over \nthe entire national territory and, in particular, to \nbringing peace to the eastern part of the country. \n In Sudan, we greatly appreciate the efforts of the \ninternational community, particularly the African \nUnion and regional leaders, to promote peace and \nsecurity in Darfur. The Abuja Peace Accord of May \n2006 is a stepping stone towards the inclusive, \ncomprehensive agreement that is crucial to that \ncountry\u2019s stability.  \n In Somalia, my delegation encourages all the \nparties concerned to favour the path of negotiation with \na view to restoring peace.  \n With regard to the Western Sahara, the Republic \nof Guinea encourages the parties in conflict to \nstrengthen their cooperation with the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s Personal Envoy in order to find a political \nsolution that is fair, lasting and mutually acceptable. \n In the Middle East, Guinea regrets the fact that \nIsrael\u2019s withdrawal from Gaza was not followed by \nadditional measures to put an end to the occupation of \nPalestinian territory. It calls upon the parties to uphold \nthe relevant United Nations resolutions as well as the \nQuartet road map for the creation of two States, \nPalestinian and Israeli, with secure, internationally \nrecognized borders, living side by side in peace.  \n \n \n5 06-53609 \n \n With respect to the Israeli-Lebanese crisis, \nGuinea greatly regrets the tragedy of the Lebanese \npeople. We support effective implementation of \nSecurity Council resolution 1701 (2006), which \nimposes a ceasefire and the deployment of a stronger \ninternational force in southern Lebanon. \n We stress the need to end the escalating violence \nin Iraq, in order to guarantee the country\u2019s stability and \nsuccessfully carry out national reconstruction. \n In Asia, the Government of Guinea reaffirms its \nattachment to the one-China principle. We also attach \ngreat importance to the peaceful reunification of \nKorea, and the continuation of efforts to preserve \npeace, security and stability in the Korean peninsula. \n The recommendations of the Working Group on \npeacekeeping operations are a reference point for \ntaking up the challenges of peace. We welcome the \ngreater cooperation between the Secretariat and the \ntroop-contributing countries, which has made it \npossible to better understand what is at stake, thus \nfavouring an increased contribution from Member \nStates. The Republic of Guinea regularly takes part in \npeacekeeping operations, and we reaffirm our readiness \nto enhance our contribution within the framework of \nthe new agreements and arrangements that will stem \nfrom the reform process. \n Guinea strongly condemns all forms and \nmanifestations of terrorism, the scourge threatening \ninternational peace and security. We value the crucial \nrole played by the United Nations in fighting it, and \ntherefore support the Global Counter-Terrorism \nStrategy adopted at the sixtieth session of the General \nAssembly. \n In the area of disarmament, Guinea condemns the \nstalemate in the Conference on Disarmament. Nuclear \ndisarmament and non-proliferation are two inseparable \nparts of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and bind all \nparties, without exception.  \n The failure last July of the United Nations \nConference to Review Progress Made in the \nImplementation of the Programme of Action to \nPrevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in \nSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects \nshould not in the least undermine our commitment to \ncombat the proliferation of such weapons and the illicit \ntrade in them. My country is in favour of establishing \nan international, legally binding instrument dealing \nwith all the related issues. In this respect, the \ntransformation of the Economic Community of West \nAfrican States (ECOWAS) Moratorium into a \nConvention on small arms reflects the determination of \nour States to eradicate this other scourge. Its success \nwill depend upon the level of cooperation of member \nStates and also the commitment of its partners. \n The 2005 Summit was a decisive step in \npromoting the Millennium Development Goals. Guinea \nhas made an effort to put in place more ambitious \nnational development strategies. In this context, the \nGovernment has drafted a national poverty reduction \nstrategy based on speeding up economic growth and \naccess to basic social services, as well as improving \ngovernance. In order to implement this policy, the \nGovernment and its development partners have begun \nprogrammes and projects dealing with priority sectors, \nsuch as education, health, integrated rural \ndevelopment, infrastructure, the provision of water, \nand strengthening human and institutional capacities.  \n In the same spirit, the drafting in February 2005 \nof the second follow-up report on the Millennium \nDevelopment Goal made it possible to assess the \nprogress made, note the shortcomings and outline the \nprospects of achieving the Goals by 2015. We regard \nthis as an opportunity to urge our development partners \nto swiftly implement the entire set of internationally \nrecognized development initiatives, including the goals \nand objectives of the Programme of Action for the \nLeast Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010.  \n We reaffirm the urgent need to strengthen official \ndevelopment assistance and to assure the long-term \nviability of debt by cancelling all public and bilateral \ndebt of the most heavily indebted poor countries. \nWhile condemning the impasse in negotiations of the \nWorld Trade Organization\u2019s Doha Round, my \ndelegation calls upon Member States to make a \ncollective effort to prevent a return to protectionism, a \nfactor in the deregulation of international economic \nrelations. \n Guinea took part with great interest in the High-\nLevel Dialogue that the General Assembly has just \ndevoted to the question of international migration and \ndevelopment. We reiterate our conviction that \ncontinuation of this Dialogue within the framework of \nthe global consultative forum will help to identify ways \nand means to better exploit the benefits of migration \nfor development, while mitigating its harmful effects. \n  \n \n06-53609 6 \n \n Although Guinea is not a country in conflict or \nemerging from conflict, the midterm review of the \nhumanitarian appeal, \u201cGuinea 2006\u201d, points out, \n\u201cToday its social indicators have become similar to \nthose of countries emerging from a prolonged war.\u201d \nThat confirms the very serious consequences of the \nsubregional instability that we have seen for more than \n15 years in my country. In this respect, our \nGovernment, through me, wishes to reiterate its appeal \nfor greater assistance in order to help the affected \nregions to recover. We welcome the transformation of \nthe Central Emergency Revolving Fund into the \nCentral Emergency Response Fund. We hope that \nwithin the common country programming process and \nthe United Nations Development Assistance \nFramework, covering the period 2007-2011, the \nfunding gaps apparent in the course of various \nhumanitarian appeals will be filled and better \nprovisions for Guinea will be considered.  \n Furthermore, deeply concerned by child \ntrafficking, Guinea has signed with Mali and C\u00f4te \nd\u2019Ivoire a memorandum of understanding to prevent \nthis phenomenon and to improve border control. \n In our common quest for a new international \norder, this sixty-first session of the General Assembly \nwill be seen as one of important change for the United \nNations. The reforms that we have achieved will be the \nbeacons illuminating the path to a lasting peace and \ndevelopment with greater solidarity. But we must also \nmaintain the impetus of reform and continue in our \ncommon will to make the United Nations the \nirreplaceable instrument to take up the enormous \nchallenges of peace, security, development and human \nrights in the twenty-first century.

        "file_text": "I have the honour to \ndeliver this statement on behalf of His Excellency Paul \nKagame, President of the Republic of Rwanda, at this \nsixty-first session of the General Assembly. \n Each year the General Assembly provides an \nexcellent opportunity for us to review our collective \ncommitments as reflected in the Charter, as well as \nmore recent ones such as those set out in the \nMillennium Declaration and the 2005 World Summit \nOutcome. We therefore view the beginning of the \nsixty-first session of the General Assembly as an \nopportunity to breathe new energy into our collective \nresponsibilities articulated at previous conferences and \nsummits. It is my earnest hope that we shall seize this \nopportunity to take stock of our successes and \nshortcomings and devise practical solutions to realize \nthese commitments, particularly the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). \n In its preamble, the United Nations Charter \nexpresses our collective determination to promote \nsocial progress and better standards of life in larger \nfreedom. This statement formed a basis for the \nMillennium Declaration in 2000 and our renewal of \nthose commitments at last year\u2019s World Summit. All of \nthe outcomes of previous conferences and summits \nreflect the recognition of our collective interests and \nresponsibilities in addressing the common problems \naffecting humankind. \n Today, there is no greater danger threatening \nhumanity than extreme poverty. Forty per cent of the \nworld\u2019s population, or 2.5 billion people, live in \nabsolute poverty on less than $2 a day, while more than \n800 million people suffer from hunger and \nmalnutrition. For sub-Saharan Africa, the statistics are \neven more staggering; in most cases, 60 to 70 per cent \nof national populations live on less than a dollar a day, \nwhile life expectancy at birth is less than 50 years. \n This is clearly unacceptable at a time when the \nrest of the world enjoys unprecedented levels of \naffluence and technological and scientific \nadvancement. As for the poor, their daily lives are a \ntrial that nobody would wish to experience. We must \nnot permit another five years to pass only to find out \nthat no progress has been made and only to simply \nrenew the same commitments. We must, therefore, \ndevise means to do things radically differently and in \nan accelerated manner. \n There are a number of areas that require our \nurgent attention if we are to make progress in attaining \nthe MDGs by 2015 and in eventually eradicating \npoverty. I will highlight a few of these areas, which, in \nour view, are the most salient. Regardless of one\u2019s \ndefinition of good or effective governance, what has \nbeen proved is its importance in the sustained socio-\neconomic development of a nation. We believe that the \nkey features of good or effective governance include a \npolitical culture that fosters inclusive and competitive \nparticipation; robust national institutions that pursue \neffective and coherent national development strategies; \neffective management and oversight institutions; and, \nof course, the consolidation of the rule of law. It is our \nview that, by embracing good-governance principles, \nwe are setting the stage for the attainment of our global \nand national targets. \n Rwanda is strongly committed to these principles \nand has submitted itself to the scrutiny of our African \npeers under the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s \nDevelopment (NEPAD) African Peer Review \nMechanism (APRM). The APRM is an African \n \n \n49 06-53323 \n \ninitiative aimed at promoting good governance through \nconstructive self-assessment and peer review. We \nwelcome the acknowledgements of the progress we \nhave made in many areas and commit ourselves to \ncontinuing to make improvements in the areas \nidentified in the peer review report. \n In the spirit of mutual accountability, it is our \nbelief that the principles of good governance that \nprevail at the national level should also guide our \nrelations with our development partners. Both sides of \nthe ongoing governance debate should be given \nadequate and equal attention, particularly since aid \neffectiveness is also critical to the attainment of the \nMDGs. \n We believe that improving the quality and \nincreasing the quantity of official development \nassistance (ODA) is another important set of measures \nthat would improve development prospects. The \nquality of ODA should be improved by adopting needs-\nbased approaches, providing more budget support, \nsupporting national poverty reduction programmes, \nreducing waste and overhead, and channelling aid to \nsectors that enhance productive capacities rather than \nperpetuate dependence. \n It is critical that there be harmonization of the \nobjectives of trade and development policies on the \npart of our development partners. Trade policies should \ncomplement, rather than undermine, the attainment of \nthe development goals. We must recommit ourselves, \nboth in principle and practice, to an open, rules-based, \nnon-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading \nsystem. Any progress that developing countries like \nRwanda might achieve in attaining the MDGs will not \nbe sustainable unless measures are taken to provide \ngreater opportunity for those countries to access the \nmarkets of the developed world, thereby increasing \nhousehold and national incomes. \n The attainment of the MDGs will require \nadditional resources. We thus consider it essential to \nincrease the quantity of aid. We welcome the decision \nby some developed States to dramatically increase the \nvolume of ODA over the next few years, and we are \ngrateful to them. We also congratulate those States that \nhave reached or exceeded the internationally agreed \n0.7 per cent of gross national income for the ODA \ntarget, and we welcome the decision by those States \nthat have set timetables to achieve or exceed that target \nby 2015. The challenge is, therefore, to translate these \ncommitments into tangible disbursements and the \nimplementation of real poverty reduction programmes \non the ground. \n The most serious challenge to our development \nand the attainment of the MDGs is the unprecedented \nprice level of fossil-fuel energy on the one hand, and \nthe reduction in hydroelectric generation capacity on \nthe other. \n There is a danger that the successes registered so \nfar towards the attainment of the MDGs could easily be \nreversed if the current energy sector cost trends \ncontinue unabated. It is critical, therefore, that we \ninvest heavily in sustainable alternative energy sources \nfor the long term. In the short- and medium-term, \nhowever, we shall need to find ways to mitigate the \neffects of energy price shocks if we are to sustain and \naccelerate the attainment of the MDGs. \n The scourge of war continues to cause the \nmassive loss of human life and blight entire \ncommunities. The ongoing conflicts in some parts of \nAfrica and the Middle East pose a serious threat to \ninternational peace and security and require our \ncollective efforts to reach political settlements to these \nconflicts. \n Our painful experience in Rwanda has taught us \nthat peace comes at a price. There can be no peace \nwithout reconciliation and recognition of the rights and \ninterests of all people, including the rights of States to \nexist and the right of self-determination. We have \nlearned that no community\u2019s rights can or should \nsupersede another\u2019s. We have learned the value of \nsharing and the value of communities\u2019 living side by \nside in peace and mutual respect. \n Rwanda is happy to contribute to the promotion \nof international peace and security through its military \nand police contributions to the United Nations and \nAfrican Union peacekeeping missions in the Sudan, \nLiberia, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and the Comoros. We are \ncommitted to continuing these contributions for as long \nas they are required and as long as our resources \npermit. The Security Council and the Secretariat should \ncontinue to work towards better-conceived and more-\neffective peacekeeping operations, towards greater \nparticipation by regional organizations in conflict \nresolution and towards the institutionalization of \nlessons learned from the past. There is also an urgent \nneed to institutionalize relations between the United \nNations and regional organizations, particularly the \n  \n \n06-53323 50 \n \nAfrican Union, in the areas of conflict resolution and \npeacekeeping. \n We warmly welcome the reforms adopted during \nthe previous session of the General Assembly. We take \nthis opportunity to congratulate Mr. Jan Eliasson, \nPresident of the sixtieth session, and all Member States \non the reforms, including the setting up of the \nPeacebuilding Commission, the establishment of the \nHuman Rights Council and the renewed commitments \nto combat HIV/AIDS adopted at the special session of \nthe General Assembly in June. There has also been \ncommendable progress on management reform, \nincluding the establishment of an ethics office, \nstrengthening whistle-blower protection and reforming \nprocurement procedures to prevent corruption. We look \nforward to working together with other delegations \nduring this session to improve coherence, efficiency \nand effectiveness within the Secretariat and to continue \nto review the Organization\u2019s mandates, so that the \nUnited Nations may be strengthened to respond better \nto the expectations of Member States. \n It is our hope that this session of the General \nAssembly might achieve greater progress with respect \nto Security Council reform. Rwanda supports the \ncommon African position on this issue and believes \nthat reform of the working methods to promote \ntransparency and accountability is most urgent. The \nreform process should enable States that are not \nmembers of the Council to participate more actively in \nits deliberative and decision-making processes, \nespecially on issues that affect them. A reformed \nCouncil should be seen by all States, especially the \nsmaller States, to be more accessible, transparent, \ncredible and legitimate. \n In the next few months, the General Assembly \nwill elect a new Secretary-General upon \nrecommendation of the Security Council. Rwanda \nsupports the common African position that the next \nSecretary-General should be from Asia. As far as the \nelection process is concerned, we appeal for greater \ntransparency in that process in accordance with the \nCharter and the basic principles of democracy. \n In conclusion, in today\u2019s globalized world, our \ninterdependence has never been more self-evident. As a \nresult, the imperative for our collective action is \ngreater than ever. Once again, the onus is on all of us \nto translate our many challenges and opportunities into \na shared destiny of peace, security and prosperity for \nall. "

        "file_text": "I wish to congratulate Her \nExcellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her \nassumption of the presidency of the sixty-first session \nof the General Assembly, and I wish her every success. \nI would also like to pay high tribute to the past \nPresident, His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson, for his \noutstanding leadership during the last session. Japan\u2019s \nsincere thanks also go to Secretary-General Kofi \nAnnan for his dedication and many achievements in \nleading the work of the Organization over the past \ndecade. \n Japan congratulates the Republic of Montenegro \non its accession to the United Nations as its 192nd \nMember. \n Fifty years ago, in December 1956, from this very \npodium, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan, \nMamoru Shigemitsu, expressed the nation\u2019s great \nhonour and delight at becoming the eightieth Member \n \n \n31 06-53615 \n \nof the United Nations and declared Japan\u2019s firm \ndetermination to contribute to the high goals of this \nOrganization. \n Since then, Japan, as a nation committed to \npeace, has worked hard in promoting disarmament and \nthe non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \nsupporting the undertakings of the United Nations for \npeace and stability in the world such as the \npeacekeeping operations, and contributing to world \ndevelopment and prosperity. The Japanese people take \npride in the contributions they have made over the \nyears to the United Nations. \n The challenges we face today differ significantly \nfrom those of 50 years ago. Yet, the common goals of \nhumanity that the United Nations has strived for \u2014 \npeace, development and human rights \u2014 remain \nunchanged. Japan reaffirms the commitment it made at \nthe time of its accession, and, building on its \nexperiences since then, will rededicate its efforts to \nachieve those goals. \n As Member States, we are responsible, not only \nfor the actions we take, but also for our inaction. \nWithin the United Nations, it is the Security Council \nthat bears the responsibility of delivering swift and \ndecisive action in the face of a crisis. This summer, the \nability of the international community to mount a \ncollective response through the Security Council was \ntested on several occasions. Let me cite three major \nevents on which the Council acted: the ballistic missile \nlaunches by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea, Iran\u2019s nuclear-related problem and the conflict \nin Lebanon. \n After the launch of ballistic missiles by the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea on 4 July, the \nSecurity Council, in a unanimous decision in resolution \n1695 (2006), sent a firm message, on behalf of the \nentire international community, condemning that \nreprehensible act. In accordance with that resolution, \nall Member States are now required to take concrete \naction as specified therein, and call strongly on the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea to implement \nthe resolution, fully and without delay. In that \nconnection, Japan introduced on 19 September a set of \nmeasures for the prevention of the transfer of financial \nresources to the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea, in addition to the long-standing strict export \ncontrol measures. \n Furthermore, Japan will continue to make its \nutmost efforts so that the nuclear issue of the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, and the \nabduction issue will be resolved comprehensively and \nin accordance with the Pyongyang Declaration of 2002. \n With regard to Iran\u2019s nuclear issue, it is our belief \nthat the adoption of resolution 1696 (2006) will serve \nas an important step towards a peaceful settlement of \nthe issue through diplomatic negotiations. Japan \nstrongly urges Iran to comply fully with the resolution \nby promptly suspending all enrichment-related \nactivities, and to return to the negotiation process. \n Concerning the recent crisis in Lebanon, Japan \nwelcomes the adoption of resolution 1701 (2006) by \nthe Security Council and supports the efforts under \nway for its implementation. At the same time, the \nprotracted negotiating process for that resolution \nreminded us once again of the importance of the ability \nof the Council to respond, swiftly as well as \ncomprehensively, in such a crisis situation. That is \nnever an easy task, but one we must always strive to \nfulfil. \n In response to some of the recent events affecting \ninternational peace and security, the Council succeeded \nin arriving at concrete decisions for the Member States \nto act upon. Japan is pleased to have played a proactive \nrole in that process as a member of the Council, and we \nintend to cooperate closely with other Member States \nin following up on those resolutions. \n In countries and regions emerging from conflict, \nthe key to realizing sustainable peace and prosperity \nlies in the consolidation of peace and laying the \nfoundations for nation-building. It is encouraging to \nsee the ongoing, concerted efforts of the international \ncommunity towards peace consolidation and nation-\nbuilding in a number of countries and regions. \n Iraq is one such country. Though currently still in \nthe grip of great hardship, we have every confidence \nthat Iraq will overcome the difficulties and develop as \na democratic and stable State, and prosper as a \nresponsible member of the international community. \nThe International Compact for Iraq, which aims at \nforging a new mode of partnership between Iraq and \nthe international community, will help accelerate the \ncountry\u2019s reconstruction. Japan intends to fully take \npart in those international endeavours. \n  \n \n06-53615 32 \n \n In Afghanistan, Japan has also been an active \nsupporter and a leading donor for its reconstruction and \ndevelopment. We have led the disarmament, \ndemobilization and reintegration (DDR) efforts in \ncollaboration with the United Nations, and, upon the \nsuccessful completion of the DDR process, are now \ntaking the lead in the projects for the disbanding of \nillegal armed groups. \n With regard to Timor-Leste, Japan hopes that the \nnewly established United Nations mission will \neffectively support the country\u2019s nation-building \nefforts. As the lead country on Timor-Leste in the \nSecurity Council, Japan will continue to take the \ninitiative to promote peace and stability and achieve \nthe early restoration of law and order in that country. \n In Africa, as a whole, we begin to see the \nsituation on the continent moving towards less conflict \nand greater peace. The ministerial conference on the \nconsolidation of peace, that was held under the \nframework of the Tokyo International Conference on \nAfrican Development (TICAD) in February this year, \nnot only made an intellectual contribution to the \nunderstanding of peace consolidation, but also \nstrengthened the will and solidarity of the African \nStates for peacebuilding. Japan, for its part, has been \nexpanding assistance for the consolidation of peace in \nAfrica, with particular focus on the Sudan, the Great \nLakes region and West Africa.  \n Against such a backdrop, the establishment of the \nPeacebuilding Commission represents a significant \nmilestone in the history of the United Nations. We \nmust ensure that the Commission\u2019s work is translated \ninto tangible, practical value-added support to \npeacebuilding efforts in countries recovering from \nconflict and that it thus helps to make a difference on \nthe ground. Burundi and Sierra Leone, the first two \ncountries on the agenda of the Commission, will \nprovide test cases, in which we must not fail. Japan has \ncontributed $20 million to the Peacebuilding Fund and \nintends to contribute actively to the work of the \nCommission. \n Post-conflict peacebuilding requires knowledge \nand expertise in a wide range of fields, including \nceasefire monitoring, refugee assistance, administrative \nand judicial institution-building, and reconstruction \nand development. Our experts have been working in \nAsian countries to assist their peacebuilding efforts, \nsuch as the establishment of legal and judicial systems. \nIn order to strengthen our cooperation in this area even \nfurther, we are now considering concrete measures to \ntrain civilians not only from Japan but also from other \nAsian countries. We envisage that, one day, civilian \npractitioners who have been trained in my country will \nfind themselves working side by side as fellow Asian \npeacebuilders, including, for example, in Africa. \n Regional conflicts continue to pose serious \nchallenges. In addition, the Secretary-General, as he \npointed out earlier from this rostrum, is concerned \nabout \u201cthose who seem eager to foment a new war of \nreligion\u201d (). While poverty remains the \nmain scourge in many developing countries, \nglobalization has also brought to the fore transnational \nissues such as terrorism, infectious diseases and \nenvironmental degradation. It is clear that the \ninternational community still has a long way to go to \nachieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \nIn tackling these issues, a spirit of tolerance, \ncompassion and closer international cooperation is \nindispensable, and a strengthened United Nations must \nbe at the centre of the concerted efforts of the \ninternational community. At the same time, new \nconcepts should also propel these efforts. Japan has \nadvocated the importance of human security as a \nconcept that stresses the protection of individuals from \nthreats to their life and dignity, as well as the value of \ntheir individual empowerment. Together with other \ninterested countries, we will promote human security \nand the approach based on it during this General \nAssembly session. \n Along with human security, respect for the \nownership of developing countries, based on good \ngovernance, should be a pillar underpinning the \nstrategy for reducing poverty through economic \ngrowth. Given these principles, Japan intends to \nenhance its development assistance to achieve the \nMDGs, by faithfully implementing the commitments \nmade last year to increase the volume of its official \ndevelopment assistance (ODA) by $10 billion over a \nperiod of five years and to double its ODA to Africa \nover a period of three years. On trade, Japan will do its \nutmost to bring about the early resumption and \nsuccessful conclusion of the WTO Doha Development \nRound negotiations. \n Close international cooperation is vital in our \nfight against terrorism. In this regard, Japan welcomes \nthe adoption by the General Assembly of the United \nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution \n \n \n33 06-53615 \n \n60/288) and calls for the early conclusion of \nnegotiations on a comprehensive convention on \ninternational terrorism.  \n Health is another area in which Japan has worked \nextensively in cooperation with the international \ncommunity, including efforts against avian and \npandemic influenza and HIV/AIDS. Japan recognizes \nthe importance of the activities of the World Health \nOrganization and will further strengthen its \ncooperation with that organization, particularly in \nAfrica. \n As is often emphasized, peace, development and \nhuman rights are linked and complement one another. \nJapan\u2019s own experience in the 60 years since the \nSecond World War is eloquent testimony to this fact. \nWe have high expectations for the newly created \nHuman Rights Council and look to it to open a new \npage in the promotion of respect for human rights. As a \nmember, Japan will play a constructive role in the \nCouncil. Japan also supports the early adoption of the \ndraft conventions on enforced disappearance and on \nthe rights and dignity of persons with disabilities. \n The United Nations has heavy responsibilities, in \ntoday\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s world, as an indispensable \nglobal instrument for resolving conflicts, building \npeace, addressing emerging global threats and laying \nthe foundation for prosperity. To fulfil such a mission, \nit must be efficient and effective, as well as \naccountable and broadly representative in its decisions \nand operations. Reform of the Organization\u2019s structure \nand the manner in which it functions is, therefore, \ncritically important. In September last year, leaders \nexpressed their resolve to achieve comprehensive \nreform of this universal body. One year on, some \nencouraging progress has been made, including the \nestablishment of the Peacebuilding Commission and \nthe Human Rights Council. However, reform of the \nSecurity Council remains outstanding on the \ninstitutional reform agenda. \n Perhaps a limited few may find it in their interest \nto leave the Security Council configured in the way it \nwas in 1945. It is clear, however, that no one stands to \ngain from the waning credibility that failure to reform \ncould entail. The call for a more effective, \nrepresentative and transparent Council that can meet \nthe demands of the new century is not mere rhetoric; it \nis real and urgent. An overwhelming majority of the \nMember States, including Japan, agree that the \ninternational community should approach and carry out \nreform with a sense of urgency, and Japan is \ndetermined to continue to take the initiative in this \ncritical endeavour. The Member States now need a new \nproposal on Security Council reform \u2014 one that is \nboth creative and persuasive \u2014 in order to take an \nearly decision during the current session of the General \nAssembly. At the same time, other important areas for \nreform must also be addressed. We need concrete \nresults in management reform if we are to demonstrate \nthat the United Nations is capable of reforming itself. \nIt is also our hope that there will be a constructive \ndialogue on the question of United Nations system-\nwide coherence, based on the report of the High-level \nPanel to be issued later this year. \n In this connection, I would also remind the \nMember States that world leaders resolved last year to \ndelete the long-obsolete \u201cenemy State\u201d clauses from \nthe United Nations Charter. This is another indication \nthat the United Nations is ready to step out of the past \nand into the new era. \n Having made a significant contribution to the \nactivities of the United Nations since its inception, \nJapan has an exemplary record with regard to the \nfulfilment of its duties as a Member State, including \nassessed contributions. Nevertheless, we strongly \nbelieve that the United Nations needs a reformed scale-\nof-assessments structure \u2014 one that is more equitable \nand fair and duly takes into account the status and \nresponsibilities of each Member State. Japan will work \ntogether with other Member States to formulate such a \nstructure, which will bring financial stability to this \nOrganization. \n Our common task for the sixty-first session is to \ncontinue our work and translate the decisions on \nreform made at the World Summit into reality. Let us \njoin forces once again and create an efficient and \neffective United Nations, so that Member States can \nbetter respond to the aspirations and expectations of \nthe international community for a better future.

        "file_text": "Just about a month ago, \nthe people of Guyana went to the polls to vote for the \nGovernment of their choice. Witnessed by an \nunprecedented number of observers drawn from several \ncountries and international organizations, including the \nUnited Nations, the elections were deemed to be free, \nfair and transparent. With a renewed mandate, the \nGovernment led by President Bharrat Jagdeo, has \nrecommitted itself to the pursuit of democratic \ngovernance at home and to a progressive foreign policy \nabroad. \n I am pleased, on behalf of the Government and \nthe people of Guyana to convey to the President of the \nAssembly our warmest congratulations on her election \nand to wish her much success during her term of office. \nTo her predecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson of Sweden, I \nwould like to express our appreciation and thanks for \ndirecting the work of the Assembly this past year with \nconsiderable expertise and aplomb. And to our \nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who demits his \npost later this year, I wish to offer our sincere gratitude \nfor his impressive leadership of the United Nations \nduring an uncertain and challenging period. He leaves \nwith our best wishes for his future health and \nhappiness. \n As a fledgling democracy, Guyana is proud to be \npart of the family of free nations. We are dedicated to \nthe creation of a society based on equity and social \njustice that guarantees to all our citizens their \nfundamental freedoms and rights. To this end, we have \nenshrined in our Constitution provisions for the full \nenjoyment of these entitlements. In the same spirit, we \nhave acceded to the many international treaties and \nconventions that embody agreements on the rights of \npeoples. Article 154 A of our Constitution guarantees \nthat \u201csuch rights embodied in these international \ninstruments shall be respected and upheld by the \nexecutive, legislature, judiciary and all organizations \nand agencies of Government\u201d. We are thus fully \ncommitted to international cooperation for global \npeace and development. \n The President of the Assembly is to be \ncommended for proposing for discussion by this \nAssembly the topic \u201cImplementing the global \npartnership for development\u201d. Ever since its \nestablishment in 1945, the United Nations has laboured \nto produce an effective development strategy. Decade \nafter decade, several proposals were laboriously \ndrafted, only to be quickly relegated to the archives. It \nwas not surprising, therefore, that countries, especially \nthe developing nations, eventually became \ndisillusioned owing to the little that was achieved. \n The World Hearings on Development that were \nheld during Guyana\u2019s presidency of the General \nAssembly at its forty-eighth session sought a new \napproach to the issue of development by bringing \ntogether all the relevant actors \u2014 distinguished world \nleaders, member Governments, the private sector, \nnon-governmental organizations and other elements of \ncivil society \u2014 to analyse deficiencies in international \ncooperation. What was needed, it was said, was a new \ndevelopment architecture, not a tinkering with the old. \n Following up on the promise of these hearings, \nthe General Assembly proceeded in 1997 to elaborate \nan agenda for development. There could be no more \ncomprehensive and compelling document than that. \nYet, it too was soon buried and forgotten. By the year \n2000, the international community had decided that \nenough was enough and that instead of forging yet \nanother declaration it would set for itself certain \nprecise and time-bound goals.  \n Our pursuit of these Millennium Development \nGoals thus far has shown that while our efforts may \nindeed lift some countries out of poverty, significant \nand sustainable development will be achieved only \nthrough the international cooperation required in \nGoal 8. It is worthy of note that, while there are clear \nmeasurements of progress under Goals 1 to 7, no well-\ndefined indicators exist for Goal 8 \u2014 the global \npartnership for development \u2014 an omission that \nclearly limits the effort at cooperation and creates an \nimbalance in the partnership. \n If I have delved into the history of the \ndevelopment challenge, it is not to dwell on the past, \nbut rather to draw from it lessons that may help us in \nthe future to translate our long-held aspirations into \nearly reality. Allow me, therefore, to offer some \nthoughts on how the global partnership for \ndevelopment may be strengthened.  \n  \n \n06-53615 20 \n \n As was determined at Monterrey, partnership, \ncoherence and accountability are vital to the fulfilment \nof our development goals. Without close and genuine \ncooperation between donors and recipients, there is not \nlikely to be significant progress. At the national level \ncountries should own their development strategies, \nwhile at the international level there should be greater \ncoordination and consistency of support in the trade, \nmonetary and financial systems. Much too often it is \nthe developing countries that are scrutinized and \nscolded for their shortcomings, while their developed \npartners are considered above blame. True partnership \nrequires mutual accountability. Accordingly, we would \npropose that there should be some verification of donor \npledges and periodic reviews of performance on both \nsides. \n Implementation of the global partnership would \nbe greatly facilitated if the task were to be seen in \nterms of mutual benefit and not of charity or \nobligation. Both sides must be involved in the \ndecision-making process in all cooperation agreements. \nSuch participation would produce a greater sense of \nownership by the developing countries and, \nconsequently, a deeper sense of commitment to \nexecution. At the recent World Bank/IMF meeting held \nin Singapore and chaired by the President of Guyana, \nthe IMF Managing Director is reported to have \nproposed a rearrangement of quotas that would enable \ndeveloping countries to be more involved in decision-\nmaking. Although the change cannot be considered as \ncomprehensive as necessary, it is, nonetheless, a first \nstep toward more democratic governance in the \nmanagement of development.  \n Furthermore, given the inadequacy of resources \nthat have been available thus far for development, we \nmust endeavour to identify, as we pledged in \nMonterrey, new and additional sources of financing. \nThe Millennium Challenge Account and the \nInternational Finance Facility have been welcome \nattempts to provide fresh funding. More recently, at the \ninitiative of France, Brazil and others a tax on air travel \nhas been proposed \u2014 and implemented by some \ncountries \u2014 and promises to provide substantial \nrevenues to support development. Similar proposals, \nsuch as the Tobin tax, a tax on pollution and a \nlow-elasticity commodities tax, are on the table. What \nis needed now is a serious evaluation of these \nsuggestions to determine their feasibility for \nimplementation by the international community. \n Implementation of the global partnership \nundoubtedly suffers from the \u201cbeggar-thy-neighbour\u201d \nattitude that exists in international economic and trade \nrelations. As evidenced in the recent Doha \nDevelopment Round negotiations, the predominant \ninterests of the developed countries in such areas as \nagriculture, subsidies and services have effectively \ndenied developing nations, more particularly the small \nand vulnerable, any prospect of significant \nparticipation in the global economy. Without expanded \ntrade opportunities, investment and a comprehensive \nframework of support, development for many countries \nwill continue to be elusive. We need, therefore, to \nensure that the Doha Development Round is revived \nand that broad assistance is provided to serve the \npurposes of development. \n An increasingly formidable challenge to \nimplementing the development agenda is the spread of \ntransboundary crime, including arms and drug \ntrafficking, which has reached new and alarming levels \nthat cripple economic growth. Governments can ill \nafford the resources needed to fight the drug lords, who \nare themselves endowed with considerable assets and \nartillery. Unfortunately, whatever assistance is \nprovided by donor countries and relevant agencies is \nwoefully inadequate to deal with the onslaught. This \ngrowing insurgency can be counteracted only by \ngreater determination on the part of the United Nations \nsystem to collaborate fully to crush transboundary \ncrime. Our developed partners therefore need to do \nmore to assist in the fight against this scourge. \n A more serious inhibitor to economic growth and \nsocial progress is the current unsettled international \npolitical climate, in which recourse to conflict is seen \nas a ready means of settling international issues. The \negregious examples of Iraq and Lebanon, where force \nhas been used to achieve political aims and objectives, \nhave clearly shown that violence solves nothing. \nIndeed, the havoc and destruction wrought by war \nseriously diminish the prospects for development, \nwhether in the Middle East or elsewhere. The agenda \nfor peace cannot be implemented without due regard to \nthe agenda for development. \n The Government of Guyana has long been \npersuaded of the need for a new global human \neconomic and social order that is capable of delivering \ntrue democracy and social justice to all peoples. First \nposited in 1994 at the World Summit on Social \nDevelopment by the late President Jagan of Guyana, \n \n \n21 06-53615 \n \nthe concept is premised on a comprehensive and \nholistic approach to development aimed at achieving \nmore inclusive economic and social progress. The new \nglobal human order initiative, which is already being \nconsidered by this Organization and has been \nsupported by many Member States, seeks to create a \nconsensus on a new model of development that would \nbe based on genuine partnership among States and a \njoint endeavour to secure peace and prosperity for all. \n No less formidable and challenging to the \ndevelopment agenda than the international political and \neconomic environment is the fragile ecosystem in \nwhich we now live. We have all witnessed the \nincreasing number of earthquakes, floods, tropical \nstorms and hurricanes, which cause catastrophic \ndamage wherever they occur. Less than two years ago, \nmy own country was struck by a flood, resulting in \ndamage equivalent to 60 per cent of our gross domestic \nproduct. It would be foolish \u2014 perhaps fatal \u2014 if we \ndid not prepare ourselves to anticipate and withstand \nsuch disasters. Early-warning systems should be \nestablished across the globe and financial resources \nmade available to the United Nations fund to facilitate \nearly responses and recovery. In short, disaster \nmitigation should now become an integral part of the \ndevelopment agenda. \n Experience has taught us that development is a \ncomplex and complicated phenomenon, and that the \nmany challenges we now face are such that they cannot \nbe overcome without full international cooperation. Yet \nour responses continue to be ad hoc and woefully \ninadequate to deal with the resolution of the problems \nthat we are confronting. The development agenda has \nnow become more extensive and is very urgent. With \ncourage and vision, we must renew our commitment to \nthe implementation of the global partnership for \ndevelopment. Our common humanity and, indeed, a \ncommon sense of decency and morality, demand no \nless. "

        "file_text": "It is \ngenerally considered that the struggle of ideologies has \npassed into history together with the collapse of the \nbipolar world order. Yet in reality the world continues a \npainful quest for a system of ideas that could ensure its \nsecurity, justice and prosperity. The 2005 World \nSummit and the current General Assembly debate are \ngood evidence of this quest. Nowhere else but on this \nrostrum does one have such an acute sense that ideas \nand the struggle for them are no abstract matter. They \npermeate the flesh and blood of millions and billions of \npeople.  \n  \n \n06-53609 16 \n \n I hope that many of those present will agree that \nfree self-determination is the main ideology of the \nmodern world. Is it not absolutely clear that as long as \nthere is no independent Palestinian State, peacefully \ncoexisting  with all its neighbours, and that as long as \nIraq is not free from occupation, then terrorism and \nextremism will remain inevitable and invincible? \nAttempts to solve the problems of self-determination \nby violent measures, whether military or of any other \nkind, from the outside will result only in increasing the \nranks of the ruthless disciples of terrorism and \nextremism.  \n In the modern world free self-determination is not \nonly an issue of State independence and sovereignty. It \nis also an issue of recognizing \u2014 not in word, but in \ndeed \u2014 a diversity of ways for countries and peoples \nto progress. We must provide the Palestinians, Iraqis, \nLebanese and other peoples with the possibility of \nbuilding their own homes in the way they want. Any \nhelp should come only then and in such manner as they \nwish, not as deemed appropriate by the ideologues of \ncrusades in some capitals. There are no clever and \nfoolish, no superior and inferior, no righteous and \nvicious peoples and religions; there are just people of \nthe planet who are equally eager for happiness, \nuncomplicated and dignified. \n The five years that have passed since \n11 September 2001 have proved with painful clarity \nthat ideology and the practice of crusades do not bring \npeace and democracy. They lead to the devastation of \nStates, the destruction of the fabric of life of entire \nnations, and the death of children, women and innocent \ncivilians. They also result in an upsurge of terrorism, \nswelling the ranks of its followers and supporters. In \nthe same way, religious intolerance and the rejection of \nthe beliefs and conventions of other people do not \nbring spiritual harmony and unity. They cause an \noutbreak of radicalism, fanaticism and extremism. \nEncouragement of religious tolerance within societies \nshould become a responsibility of political and state \nleaders.  \n International security and global stability are \ninseparable from the solution of the world\u2019s \ndevelopment problems. Security and development are \ninseparable. This is not some artificial linkage created \nin the halls of the United Nations. Its real nature has \nbeen clearly shown by the events in the suburbs of \nParis. Are we, here in the General Assembly, and our \ncolleagues in the capitals of the richest countries, \nwaiting for an even more alarming signal? Are we \nwaiting for the spiralling extremism caused by the lack \nof prospects for the future?  \n The situation is as clear as it can get. And it is \nclear that inadequate reflection of the priorities of \ndevelopment and development assistance in the 2005 \nWorld Summit Outcome document (resolution 60/1) \nwas a serious mistake by the international community.  \n How can we correct this mistake? We can do so \nonly by earnest and not hypocritical practical efforts to \nimplement the Millennium Development Goals. Before \ntoo long we will see new proposals based on the results \nof the large-scale study on raising system-wide \ncoherence and coordination of actions of the agencies \nof the United Nations system in the field of \ndevelopment assistance. Our task is to implement these \nimportant initiatives in deed.  \n The Millennium Development Goals are clear. \nNone is easily achievable. These problems are too old \nand too deep-rooted to be solved by incremental and \nshallow methods. Nobody treats a dangerous infection \nwith aspirin. A serious task requires serious tools. That \nis why the time has come for deep transformation of \nthe Bretton Woods institutions. They were established \nin a different era and for different purposes. They \nshould be changed and made to serve the cause of \nglobal development. A special role in making \ndevelopment a success and not a problem will belong \nto the Economic and Social Council, as the major \nUnited Nations coordinating body on development. \nSpecial responsibility will rest on the shoulders of the \nmembers of the Council.  \n Belarus is a candidate for membership of the \nEconomic and Social Council for the period 2007-\n2009. I appeal to Member States to support Belarus in \nthe elections to be held during the current session. The \nAssembly may rest assured that the Republic of \nBelarus will not fall short of its expectations. As a \nMember of the United Nations since 1945, Belarus has \nnever wavered in its devotion to the purposes and \nprinciples of the Charter. As a member of the Non-\nAligned Movement since 1998, Belarus stands actively \nand resolutely for the implementation of the goals and \nprinciples of the Movement and the practical \nstrengthening of its role in international affairs.  \n Our responsibility and concern for the destiny of \nthe world are sincere. There is much evidence to prove \nthat. In its region the Republic of Belarus is a donor of \n \n \n17 06-53609 \n \ninternational security. Belarus was the first country in \nthe world to voluntarily renounce the possession of the \nnuclear weapons it had at its disposal. \n Despite all the difficulties of the transition \nperiod, our country was among the first to respond to \nthe plight of people struck by the tsunami in the Indian \nOcean in 2004, and provided humanitarian assistance \nto the disaster-stricken countries of south-east Asia. \nNor was our country an indifferent spectator of the \nrecent conflict in the Middle East. At the height of the \nhostilities Belarus invited children from war-ravaged \nStates to come to Belarus for health rehabilitation.  \n The adherence of Belarus to the cause of \ndevelopment is also sincere and firm. Implementation \nof the international development agenda will be the \nindisputable priority of our work in the Economic and \nSocial Council. What is most important is that we have \nthe know-how to do it. Having been left 15 years ago, \nafter the collapse of the Soviet Union, without natural \nresources and foreign markets, without a national \ncurrency and international assistance, we have \nachieved our economic and social objectives. They \nmay be considered modest when compared to those of \nthe most developed countries, but they are of critical \nimportance as a stage in our movement forward, as \nevidence of what a medium-sized State can achieve in \nthe most difficult of circumstances. \n Among other hardships, we had to deal on our \nown with the Chernobyl disaster, whose radioactive \ncontamination affected more than 20 per cent of our \npopulation and made it impossible to use more than 20 \nper cent of arable land and 30 per cent of forests. \nChernobyl\u2019s direct damage in Belarus alone is \nequivalent to 35 annual national budgets. It is more \nthan appropriate to recall today, in the year of its \ntwentieth anniversary, the largest man-made disaster in \nthe history of mankind.  \n Having overcome a 50 per cent decline in the \neconomy, and having rejected formulas that the \nInternational Monetary Fund tried to impose upon us, \nBelarus was the first country of the Commonwealth of \nIndependent States to restore gross domestic product to \nits peak Soviet value and then raise the level to 120 per \ncent of that value. We have created a market economy \nwith a strong social emphasis. We have preserved free \neducation, including higher education, and health care, \nas well as the high quality and availability of social \nservices for all people without exception. We have \nreduced unemployment to 1.5 per cent, and we are \nsuccessfully curbing inflation. \n I am confident that the experience, approach and \nknowledge of Belarus will be a useful contribution to \nthe work of the Economic and Social Council on the \nMillennium Development Goals. If the majority of \nnations give us the credit of trust, we will most actively \nand persistently work for a stronger role for the \nCouncil in addressing the development challenges. \nTogether with those who share these approaches, we \nwill work to reform the social and economic sphere of \nthe United Nations. Reform measures are not working \nyet. Without them the activity of different United \nNations funds and programmes at country level can \nnever be effective. To continue a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d \napproach in these matters would mean leaving the \nMillennium Development Goals on paper.  \n There is also a large debit balance in United \nNations activities outside the Economic and Social \nCouncil. There has been no substantial movement \ntowards the enhancement of the role of the General \nAssembly as a principal organ of the United Nations. \nSo far there has been no progress in reorganizing the \nSecurity Council, a key element in United Nations \nreform. The sluggishness of the Security Council in \naddressing the situation in Lebanon has not only \ncaused sorrow and frustration, but once again \nconvinces us of the disparity between the Security \nCouncil and the image of the world as we know it \ntoday.  \n Having made right and important steps in the \nhuman rights area after the 2005 World Summit, the \ninternational community should take new actions at \nthis session. They should be aimed at a true promotion \nof human rights and protection of the real victims of \nhuman rights violations, and not at getting even with \ndisagreeable nations by abusing an unjust instrument of \ncountry-specific resolutions.  \n As a major step towards the practical promotion \nof human rights and the protection of victims of one of \nthe most acute and painful phenomena of the modern \nworld, Belarus has, together with a number of partners, \nelaborated a draft resolution on improving international \ncoordination in fighting human trafficking, and will \npresent it to the Assembly at this session. The global \nscale of that challenge requires from all of us not \nshallow talk, but truly coordinated and purposeful \nactions. We see the goal of these efforts as the \n  \n \n06-53609 18 \n \nelaboration of a United Nations strategy to fight human \ntrafficking. I ask the Assembly to support the \nestablishment of a systems-based approach to a global \npartnership against slavery and trafficking in human \nbeings. Who else but the United Nations should care \nabout the dozens, hundreds and perhaps millions of \nvictims \u2014 above all, women and children \u2014 of \nmodern slavery? Who else but the United Nations \nshould encourage better international coordination in \neradicating this phenomenon, which is an utter \ndisgrace in our century? \n At the World Summit many leaders spoke about \nthe spirit of San Francisco. The spirit of San Francisco \nin 1944 and 1945 came from the sense of responsibility \nof nations in dealing with the problems of the world, \nnot responsibility for their own narrow interests \u2014 that \nis obvious and simple \u2014 but for a common cause. That \nspirit became possible as a result of the huge disaster \nof the Second World War, with about 60 million deaths \nand the inconceivable suffering of hundreds of \nmillions. Do we also need a huge disaster to restore \nthat spirit? I am sure we do not. I hope that we have all \nlearned the lessons of history.  \n After an era of romantic ideals and their tragic \nfailure in the 1990s, mankind today is coming to a \nmore elaborate perception of what kind of world order \nit needs. The Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in \nHavana has demonstrated the clear aspiration of the \nmajority of the nations of the world to move from the \nself-exhausted unipolar world to the multipolar world, \nfair and stable, based on the interdependence of diverse \nglobal and regional centres of power, to a world fit for \nall. The Havana Summit has shown that humanity \nshould be humane. That should be the United Nations \nmotto for a challenging twenty-first century. "

        "file_text": "Just \none year ago, our heads of State or Government \ngathered in this Assembly and reaffirmed that peace, \nsecurity, development and human rights are closely \ninterlinked. They also reaffirmed their faith in \nmultilateralism and an international order based upon \nthe rule of law. The mandate they entrusted to us is \nbeing implemented progressively. We have established \nthe Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights \nCouncil and adopted the Global Counter-Terrorism \nStrategy. Our expectations are high and we hope that \nthe results will meet them. \n During the past year, we have witnessed a rebirth \nof multilateralism, and I am happy about that. What \nwe, the Member States of the United Nations, do \ntogether in a multilateral way will by definition enjoy \ngreater legitimacy. I have in mind in particular, the \nrecent conflict between Israel and Lebanon, a conflict \nin which the Security Council fully assumed its \nresponsibilities \u2014 and of which the good offices of the \nSecretary-General must eventually guarantee a lasting \npolitical settlement.  \n Likewise, it is worth noting that international \ndialogue, rather than the use of force, is again in the \nforeground of multilateral diplomacy. Here I have in \nmind the case of Iran: we must make every effort to \nresolve the difficult nuclear issue while fully \nrespecting the principles of the Charter and the Treaty \non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). \n That being said, multilateralism, as I see it, is \nneither a dogma nor a simple profession of faith. \nMultilateralism is an instrument that should be judged \nby its impact on world issues. In order to be effective, \nit must deliver results. Only action can legitimize its \nraison d\u2019\u00eatre. \n Yesterday morning the President of Finland \naddressed the General Assembly on behalf of the \nEuropean Union (see ). I entirely endorse \nher statement. I will now address a few issues which \nare of particular importance to Belgium. \n The Middle East has just experienced one of the \nworst crises in recent years. A military approach has \nled to unacceptable sacrifices by civilians, both in \nLebanon and in Israel. In the face of such a crisis, \nBelgium and its European partners have clearly \ndemonstrated their willingness to act and have \nanswered the successive appeals of the Secretary-\nGeneral. Belgium, for its part, has contributed to the \nemergency fund to support the Lebanese Government\u2019s \nreconstruction projects. But above all, Belgium has \ndecided to participate in the reinforcement of the \nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), \nrequested by Security Council resolution 1701 (2006). \nIn the coming weeks, 400 Belgian Blue Helmets will \nbe deployed in southern Lebanon.  \n But the international community\u2019s efforts must \nnot stop there. All elements of the Security Council \nresolution must be urgently implemented. I salute the \nefforts of the Secretary-General and of the States \ninvolved, which have brought an end to the blockade. \nThe two kidnapped Israeli soldiers must also be \nimmediately released. Likewise, we have to work on a \nsolution for the release of the Lebanese prisoners in \nIsrael. And above all, the arms embargo must \neffectively be implemented. Finally, the Lebanese \nGovernment must fully exercise its sovereignty and its \ncontrol throughout its territory. It has our full support \nin that process. \n The implementation of Council resolution 1701 \n(2006) shows, moreover, that the European Union is \nbecoming more involved in the quest for a lasting \npeace in the Middle East. That is a welcome \ndevelopment. \n We all agree that lasting peace is predicated on a \nsettlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Therefore \nwe must work on all measures which could rapidly \nopen a path towards the resumption of the dialogue, an \nend to the hostilities, security guarantees for both \nparties, the liberation of the abducted Israeli soldier, \n \n \n47 06-52885 \n \nthe release of the political leaders arrested during the \ncrisis, humanitarian access, the re-establishment of \nbasic services, a start to reconstruction and the transfer \nof the tax and customs income due to the Palestinian \nauthorities. \n We support the efforts of the President of the \nPalestinian Authority to form a government of national \nunity. Nevertheless, we will be attentive to the content \nof its platform and to its response to the three \nconditions set by the Quartet. \n I share the assessment of the Secretary-General: \nin the already tense environment of the Middle East, \nthe region can absolutely not afford a new major crisis. \nGiven the widespread and justified suspicion aroused \nby the Iranian nuclear programme, I appeal to the sense \nof responsibility of the Tehran authorities to respond \npositively to the offers for negotiation made to them. \nIran is a great country, with an ancient and esteemed \ncivilization. That heritage, as well as its role in the \nregion, must encourage Iran to promote peace and \nsecurity and to rebuild confidence with its regional \npartners, rather than isolating itself through useless \nprovocations. Iran must again take its place in the \ncommunity of nations and follow the rules that govern \ninternational relations. Iran must comply with the \nprovisions of Security Council resolution 1696 (2006). \n A first round of presidential elections and \nlegislative elections were recently held in the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, thanks to the \ncombined efforts of the Congolese authorities, civil \nsociety and the international community. It was quite a \nchallenge. The Congolese people voted in an orderly \nfashion and in great numbers, and thereby \ndemonstrated a sense of public responsibility and a \ndesire to exercise their democratic rights.  \n I pay tribute to the United Nations Organization \nMission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \n(MONUC) for the positive role it played, assisted by \nthe European Union-led peacekeeping force (EUFOR), \nin controlling the skirmishes that occurred at the end of \nthe first round. The electoral process now has to be \ncompleted; there is no other option. Calm must return, \nand the protagonists must commit themselves, in good \nfaith, to applying the rules of democracy. The \ninternational community must continue to support the \nprocess. \n However, the elections are but a first step. Next, \nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo has to establish \nsolid and reliable institutions that are ready to shoulder \ntheir responsibilities to the benefit of the people. The \npotential resources of the Congo are enormous, and so \nare the challenges ahead in the reconstruction of the \ncountry. It is crucial that the new authorities \nunambiguously demonstrate, their commitment to good \ngovernance, both political and economic. \n The international community has been a loyal \npartner for the Congo during this transition. Its support \nand collaboration, particularly through MONUC, will \nremain paramount throughout the establishment of the \nnew institutions. I hope that the international \ncommunity will be able to continue a constructive \ndialogue with the new Congolese authorities to the \nbenefit of peace, stability and development of the \nCongo and of the region. \n Following the democratic elections that ended the \ntransition period in Burundi took place, the people of \nBurundi and the international community had high \nhopes for the prospect of stability and development in \nthat country. That is why we welcomed the recent \nceasefire reached with the Forces Nationales de \nLib\u00e9ration (FNL) movement. I fear, however, that \nthose hopes might be dashed. The Government\u2019s \nreactions towards the press and the opposition, as well \nas its management of public affairs, have cast a shadow \nover the evolution of the democratic process.  \n The Secretary-General himself expressed his \nconcerns very clearly about the situation in Burundi. \nThe development partners and the regional partners \nshare those concerns. All possible means must be used \nto consolidate the democratic process in Burundi as \nwell as its development potential. Democracy must be \nfully exercised, and responsible media, and a \nresponsible civil society, are key elements in that \nrespect. The rule of law must be strengthened, in the \ninterest and with the participation of all. From that \nperspective, a dialogue with national political partners \nis indispensable. The new Government has a vital role \nin this respect. The new Peacebuilding Commission \nwill provide us with opportunities to hold a frank and \nopen dialogue on all these issues. \n As all are aware, these days our Organization is \ndevoting greater attention to States emerging from \nconflict that are in a period of transition. The danger of \nnew tensions in such still-fragile States is very real. \nFree and democratic elections are important, but they \nare only one part of the process of rebuilding the rule \n  \n \n06-52885 48 \n \nof law. We cannot lose sight of the way in which power \nis really exercised. We must rebuild States so that they \nare able to assume their responsibilities towards their \nneighbours and their own peoples. They must be able \nto defend their sovereignty and their borders without \nthreatening the stability of their partners; they must \nhave professional and loyal armies at their disposal; \nand in such States, power must be exercised not to the \nbenefit of the few but to respond to the aspirations of \nthe people. Good governance should be at the centre of \nthe process. \n Since the beginning of this year Belgium has held \nthe chairmanship of the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe (OSCE), a regional organization \nunder Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United \nNations. Its principles and values are the same as those \nof the United Nations. Its fields of action are very \nsimilar and complementary; they include promotion of \nhuman rights, democratization, protection of \nminorities, conflict prevention, crisis management and \nprotection of the environment, not to mention dialogue \namong civilizations, the combat against the \nproliferation of small arms, and electoral monitoring. \n The OSCE played a key role in maintaining the \nrelationship between the two parts of Europe divided \nby the cold war. Since that time, the organization has \nelaborated a number of norms, principles and \ncommitments that unite all its members, which \ncontributes to reinforcing their collective security.  \n One of the objectives of our chairmanship was to \nstrengthen the balance between the three dimensions of \nthe OSCE: political and military, economic, and \nhumanitarian. We have tried, where possible, to \nestablish in those areas synergies with the United \nNations, on issues such as the problems of landlocked \ncountries, combating organized crime and combating \nterrorism. During its chairmanship, Belgium has \nworked actively to contribute to a solution to so-called \nfrozen conflicts. But such solutions will be possible \nonly if can count on the genuine will of all parties \nconcerned to move forward. \n Some of the criticisms levelled at the United \nNations are justified, and we must therefore pursue the \nreform process, which must above all strengthen the \nlegitimacy, effectiveness and credibility of the United \nNations. Those criticisms should not minimize the \nsuccesses the United Nations has to its credit. Here I \nam referring to the dramatic increase in the number of \npeacekeeping operations.  \n On the other hand, poverty is decreasing \nworldwide, thanks in particular to the dramatic \nprogress made in Asia. While the trend of increasing \npoverty has not yet been reversed in sub-Saharan \nAfrica, the 2006 report on the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals stresses that many African \ncountries are now showing long-term growth potential \nthat could improve the standard of living of their \npeoples. \n I should like to take this opportunity to pay a very \nsincere tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi \nAnnan. He has worked tirelessly, placing his political \nand negotiating skills in the service of peace, \ndevelopment and human rights. I wish to express my \ndeep gratitude for the dedication he has shown at the \nhelm of our Organization. "

        "file_text": "Let me congratulate \nMs. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her election to the \npresidency and wish her a year relatively free of \nconflict crisis and catastrophe \u2014 in other words, a year \nunlike the one we have just had, during which His \nExcellency Jan Eliasson significantly contributed to the \nsuccessful navigation of troubled waters with his great \nleadership. The \u201cyear of turmoil\u201d, as he called it (see \nA/60/PV.100), included conflicts and crises, as well as \nman-made and natural disasters, all requiring our \ncollective response. We have responded with great \ncommitment to maintain peace and stability in the \nworld.  \n Of the conflicts that we have faced in this past \nyear, the one that emerged to be the most tragic was \nthat of the war in Lebanon. I believe the international \ncommunity has lost some credibility and moral \nauthority in the eyes of the peoples of the world, who \nwatched the Security Council bicker over minute issues \nwhile bombs were being dropped in Lebanon and \ninnocent people were being killed. It was a great shame \nfor the international community not to be able to \ndeliver and establish an immediate ceasefire. When an \ninternational body loses moral authority, our ability to \neffectively tackle problems and issues that require a \ncollective response is certainly undermined.  \n In other areas, however, the collective efforts of \nthe international community have indeed succeeded. I \nbelieve we played a role in the civilized process of \nbringing Montenegro to this day and to this body. \nCollectively, we created and empowered the \nPeacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights \nCouncil, two bodies that hold great promise for \ndelivering deeper and more profound commitment on \nthe part of the world community to building peace and \nprotecting human rights.  \n The most threatening challenges in the world \nremain those of poverty and hopelessness. When our \nleaders gathered in this Hall six years ago, they \ndecided that the United Nations was the most effective \nbody in which to address the ills facing our societies. \nThey collectively recognized their responsibility to \ndeliver, worldwide, more equitably distributed social \nand economic development, at an accelerated pace. \nThey said to the world that they were willing to \nchannel international processes and multilateral \nresources in order to tackle the needs of the world\u2019s \npoor. They will be judged by their adherence to the \nprinciple, promise and commitment of collective \naction. Six years have now passed and the world still \nearnestly looks on to see whether individual and \nregional interests can be overcome and those problems \njointly addressed. \n We in Armenia also face similar problems. We are \nencouraged and rewarded by the extensive political and \neconomic reforms that we have conducted over the past \n10 years. The results are evident. We are now preparing \nto engage in the second generation of political and \neconomic reforms in order to continue to build on the \npast decade of progress. We are moving forward on \nlegislative and administrative matters; we are today a \nmore democratic society and a more open and more \nliberal economy. We have been registering double-digit \ngrowth over the past six years.  \n While we are encouraged by this economic \nprogress and the positive macroeconomic indicators, \nwe are now turning our attention to the rural areas in \norder to eradicate poverty in our society. We are \nreminded of the remarkable promise, made in 2000, to \nthe victims of global poverty to \u201cfree our fellow men, \nwomen and children from the abject and dehumanizing \nconditions of extreme poverty\u201d (resolution 55/2, \npara. 11). To be able to do that in Armenia, we will \nleverage the philanthropy of international organizations \nand friendly countries with the traditional generosity of \nour diaspora, so that we can build and repair \ninfrastructure and thus create new conditions for \neconomic development and social change. But we also \nunderstand that infrastructure alone is not enough to \nintroduce that kind of change that reduces poverty. We \nneed to invest in people; we need to invest in women \nand children; and we need to educate them and train \nthem for the future. \n We will begin that programme in Armenia\u2019s \nborder villages. Unlike other countries, where border \nvillages are points of interaction and activity, \nArmenia\u2019s eastern and western borders are closed, thus \nstifling economic interaction and regional cooperation. \nWith our neighbour, Turkey, it is not only economic \ncooperation that suffers, but also the dialogue between \nour two peoples. Turkey\u2019s insistence on keeping the \nborder closed and not allowing interaction between the \ntwo communities freezes the memories of yesterday, \ninstead of promoting dialogue and interaction to create \nnew experiences and new memories for tomorrow. We \nstill believe and hope that Turkey will eventually \nunderstand that keeping the border closed until there is \nharmony and mutual understanding between our two \n  \n \n06-53341 8 \n \npeoples is not a policy. On the contrary, it is avoidance \nof a responsible policy to forge and promote regional \ncooperation and economic development at a time and \nin a region that are the object of growing global \nattention. \n Let me address the issue of Kosovo, as many \nhave done from this podium. We closely follow the \nprocess of self-determination in Kosovo because we \nArmenians, ourselves, are extremely supportive of the \nprocess of self-determination for the people of \nNagorno Karabakh. But we do not draw parallels \nbetween the two conflicts or with any other conflict. \nWe believe and insist that conflicts are all different, \nand each must be decided on its own merits. While we \nourselves do not consider the Kosovo outcome to be a \nprecedent for other conflicts, we are extremely anxious \nabout the possibility that it may raise artificial \nobstacles for other self-determination movements, \nsimply because others cite it as a precedent. This is of \nextreme concern to us because we believe that there are \nmovements in the world today that have earned the \nright to self-determination. The Kosovo outcome \nshould not serve as an excuse or reason to put a damper \non those self-determination movements. \n Yet, such attempts are already apparent in this \nHall as the principle of self-determination is being \nundermined compared to other principles. But this goes \ncontrary to the lessons of history. There is a reason that \nthe Helsinki Final Act enshrined the principle of self-\ndetermination as equal among other principles in \ninternational relations. In international interactions, \njust as in human relations, there are no absolute values. \nThere are also responsibilities. A State should gain and \nearn the right to govern. States have the responsibility \nto protect their own citizens, and the people have the \nright to choose the Government that they think should \ngovern them.  \n The people of Nagorno Karabakh decided long \nago not to be represented by the Government of \nAzerbaijan, because they suffered from State violence. \nThey tried to protect themselves, and they succeeded \nagainst all odds, only to hear the State cry foul and \nclaim sovereignty and territorial integrity. But \nAzerbaijan has lost every iota of the moral right to talk \nabout guaranteeing the security of the people of \nNagorno Karabakh, let alone to claim custody over that \npeople.  \n Azerbaijan did not act responsibly or morally \ntowards the people of Nagorno Karabakh, people that it \nconsidered to be its own citizens. It unleashed military \naction; it sanctioned pogroms and massacres in urban \nareas. It bombed and displaced more than 300,000 \nArmenians. When it lost the war and accepted a \nceasefire, it began to destroy all traces of Armenians by \neliminating Armenian monuments throughout the \nterritory. Over the past two years, the remaining 2,000 \ncarved stone crosses, representing Armenian \ncemeteries, were desecrated and eliminated. The \nterritory has now been turned into a shooting range for \nthe Azerbaijani army. This reflects the fact that \nAzerbaijan still does not believe in the peaceful \nresolution of this conflict.  \n Armenians cannot be blamed for thinking that \nAzerbaijan is not serious about a peaceful solution. \nHaving rejected the past two offers of the international \ncommunity, Azerbaijan is now concerned about being \naccused of rejecting the current peace plan. That is why \nit is manoeuvring and manipulating every possible \nsituation \u2014 from State violence to introducing \nresolutions in other forums outside the peace process \nso that the Armenians are forced to do the rejecting.  \n But Armenia is clearly on record as stating that it \nstands by every single principle included in the \ndocument it submitted. However, in order to give a \nchance to that document, one cannot think or even \npretend to think that there is a military option to this \nconflict. There is no military option. That option has \nbeen tried and has failed. The only option today is \nrealism and compromise. The path that the people of \nNagorno Karabakh have chosen over the past two \ndecades is a path that has become irreversible. \nSolidifying and formalizing the process will greatly \ncontribute to peace and stability in our region. \n Karabakh is not a cause. It is an ancient place, a \nbeautiful garden with people who have earned the right \nto live in peace and prosperity. That is what we seek, \nand we cannot accept anything less. "

        "file_text": "Forty-four years ago, \nSamoa became independent, and when we joined the \nUnited Nations it was a reaffirmation of our support for \nthe principle of multilateral cooperation which the \nUnited Nations embodied. It was also our statement \nthat all States matter, that none was too small and weak \nto be represented in the United Nations on equal terms \nwith the large and strong nations of the world. Those \nsentiments underpinned Samoa\u2019s belief in the United \nNations as an expanding global family and its Member \nStates as the custodians entrusted with the future of our \nworld and the generations to come.  \n In essence, lasting peace and the sustained \nprosperity of the world depended on harmonious \ncooperation and effective global partnership amongst \nall nations. Those were the ideals that motivated us to \nbe part of the united family of nations, and they remain \nrelevant and valid for our country today. \n A year ago, we met here in an act of solidarity, to \nchart a new course for our Organization that is aligned \nto meet the emerging challenges confronting our world \ntoday. Our Summit Outcome document was not just a \nroad map to guide the work of our Organization. While \nit mirrored the intergovernmental nature and diverse \nmembership of our Organization, the document, \nultimately, was a reminder of the cooperative and \nshared interests we all have regarding issues vital to \nthe United Nations and its Member States. It also \nbrought to bear the importance of global partnerships \nin these times of interdependence, for the achievement \n \n \n15 06-53005 \n \nof sustainable development and peace and security for \nour peoples. \n In less than twelve months, we have transformed \nrhetoric into reality. Solid progress has been made in \nthe implementation of the Summit document. The \nHuman Rights Council and the Peacebuilding \nCommission are now operational; credible reforms in \nthe Secretariat and management have been \nimplemented; a Central Emergency Response Fund has \nbeen set up; and a Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy \nhad been unanimously adopted. But, as we well know, \nthat is just the start; the real work lies ahead. In our \nview, it is imperative that even in the early stages of \ntheir work, those bodies must immediately adhere to \nthe guiding principles of respect, integrity, credibility \nand professionalism to ensure that the objectives of \nrelevance, efficiency and transparency envisioned for \nthe Organization are delivered. \n Development, security and human rights are the \nthree pillars of the United Nations. All are mutually \nreinforcing. The United Nations commitment to the \nachievement of these goals, particularly for the least \ndeveloped countries (LDCs) and the developing \ncountries, is set out in a number of internationally \nagreed initiatives such as the Brussels Programme of \nAction for the Least Developed Countries, the \nJohannesburg Plan of Action, the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, and the Mauritius Strategy for \nSmall Island Developing States. \n Those development frameworks provide for \nglobal partnerships for the achievement, in small and \nvulnerable economies, of economic growth, sustainable \ndevelopment and the resilience to endure external \nshocks. Samoa looks forward to the implementation of \nthe partnerships indicated in the development \nframeworks approved by the United Nations.  \n In Samoa\u2019s case, the implementing framework for \nthe partnerships of the Government with the donor \ncommunity, civil society and the private sector are \ndesigned to address the development priorities of our \ncountry as set out in the Strategy for the Development \nof Samoa. It is through such partnerships that we look \ntoo, for the effective delivery of programmes that \naddress major health challenges such as HIV/AIDS and \nthe potential threat of the avian bird flu. Similarly, \nthere is the collaborative work with our partners to \nsupport the empowerment of our women. \n As to security and the specific context of stability \nand harmony within communities, I cannot \noveremphasize the importance of global actions to \ncontrol and limit the availability of small arms \nweapons. These weapons in the hands of the wrong \npeople can easily destabilize communities and plunge \nsmall nations into deadly conflict. We therefore renew \nour call for the early implementation of the Programme \nof Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit \nTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its \nAspects.  \n During the review of the Brussels Programme of \nAction this week, I shared with Member States the \nchallenges that continue to confront my country. \nSamoa is both a least developed country and a very \nsmall island developing State. The United Nations has \nreceived a proposal for Samoa to be graduated from the \nlist of LDCs. However, the vulnerabilities and the \nfragility that characterize our small island economy, as \nreflected in Samoa\u2019s poor ranking under various \neconomic vulnerability indices have, not gone away. \n Working closely with our traditional development \npartners, we have tried our best to develop and manage \nour economy, and we have made good strides in \nimproving the welfare of our people. But we know \nvery well from grim past experience that it takes just \none devastating disaster to wipe out our modest \nachievements and set back the economy for years. Our \nrequest, therefore, is for Samoa\u2019s graduation from the \nlist of LDCs to be deferred and reconsidered when \nSamoa has met the graduation threshold according to \nthe economic vulnerability index. \n Last week we broke new ground with the \ndiscussion for the first time in the United Nations \ncontext of the multidimensional aspects of \ninternational migration and development. The \nenthusiasm to consider migration and development as a \npriority concern in the United Nations agenda was well \nsupported. The concrete outcomes that emerged from \nthat initiative will ultimately depend on the willingness \nof the source countries and the destination countries to \nwork out imaginative and humane arrangements \nbeneficial to both. \n The significance of international migration, \nwhether permanent or temporary, as a development \noption for our region has not escaped the attention of \nPacific leaders. It is also an option that raises difficult \nissues that touch on the welfare and humanitarian \n  \n \n06-53005 16 \n \ntreatment of migrants, as well as on sensitive \nconsiderations on the part of receiving countries. \n In just six years into the millennium, it has \nbecome more and more evident that many of the \nchallenges we face have significant global dimensions. \nThey are borderless, do not discriminate between \ndeveloped and developing countries and have no \nrespect for national sovereignty. Those global \nconcerns, imaginatively called problems without \npassports, include climate change, epidemics, \nhumanitarian concerns, conflict containment, security \nconcerns and terrorism. By their very nature, the \nsuccessful resolution of those challenges requires a \ncollective and concerted effort of the whole United \nNations membership, because no one country or group \nof countries is capable of tackling them alone. \n Terrorism, in its various forms and \nmanifestations, is responsible for the horror and fear \nthat has gripped the world\u2019s attention in recent years. \nNo country is immune to the reaches of terrorism and \nwe are all affected in varying degrees. We must \ncontinue to be resolute in our fight against terrorism. \nLet us reiterate in the strongest terms possible that \nterrorist acts, committed under whatever pretext or \npurpose, can never be justified as morally acceptable. \nEqually, countering terrorism does not confer \nimmunity from the rule of law, nor the abandonment of \nthe principles of a civilized society. \n The unanimous adoption of a United Nations \nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy two weeks ago was \nboth a condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and a \ncommitment by Member States to take concrete \npreventative measures, collectively and individually. \nThe work ahead is to turn commitment into \nimplementation. \n The Middle East conflict continues to defy \nattempts to usher in a new era of trust and hopeful \nbeginnings for the region. Sustainable peace remains \nan elusive goal, permanently out of our Organization\u2019s \nreach as long as the root causes of the problem are not \naddressed. Too much is at stake.  \n Let us not forget the voiceless majority, \nunwillingly caught in the crossfire of the conflict, who \nyearn for a lasting peace. We should, therefore, not be \njudgmental or partisan in our approach. Ultimately, the \nPalestinian people need a permanent and an \nindependent State, living in peace, with a secure Israel. \nThe Security Council, by responding decisively to \nrecent developments in the Lebanon-Israel conflict, \ngives us hope that perhaps an eventual resolution of \nthat long drawn-out conflict is finally within sight. \n The humanitarian and security situation in Darfur \nis a cause for concern. The recent resolution adopted \nby the Security Council will, we hope, be agreeable to \nall the parties with a genuine desire to expeditiously \nresolve the issue. \n We continue to hope that the elected \nGovernments of Iraq and Afghanistan will ultimately \nsucceed in achieving conditions that will allow their \npeoples to live meaningful lives and consolidate the \ndemocratization of their societies. \n Many other countries in different parts of the \nworld are also still mired in tragic conflict and look to \nthe United Nations and its stronger Members for \npeacekeeping arrangements that can give time for those \ncommunities in strife to re-establish and find lasting \nsolutions. Samoa, despite our small size, will continue \nto support that important work. At present we \ncontribute police personnel for the United Nations \nMissions in the Sudan, Liberia, Timor-Leste and in the \nSolomon Islands. \n Climate change issues remain a priority for the \nPacific region. In our small islands, natural \ncatastrophes are capable of destruction that devastates \nthe entire country. They bring great pain and upheaval \nto the lives of our people, as well as set back the \nnational economy for years. We know that from \nrepeated past experience. The need, therefore, for good \nearly-warning systems for natural disaster alerts in our \nPacific region is a priority. The willingness of our \npartners to assist and share expertise in that area is \nmost welcomed. \n The Global Environment Facility Trust Fund \u2014 \nrecently replenished for the fourth time \u2014 \ndemonstrates very well the joint partnership between \nthe developed and the developing countries in \nimplementing programmes to address environmental \nproblems. \n Samoa continues to strongly support international \nand regional efforts to combat global warming and \nenvironmental degradation. In our view, the evidence \nof global warming and its causes are well established. \nApportioning blame and point scoring should no longer \nbe allowed to deflect efforts at effective and collective \nresponses. We now know that concerted action should \n \n \n17 06-53005 \n \nhave been taken much earlier and further delays would \nsimply make the size of the problem greater and the \nsolutions more costly. \n Good progress has been achieved in the efforts to \nreform our Organization. I would like to pay tribute to \nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his \ninspirational work in balancing the interests of Member \nStates, which did not always coincide, and for his \ninfluence that made it possible for agreement to be \nreached on the reform agenda. I thank the Secretary-\nGeneral for his courage and leadership, so that even in \nthe face of great controversy, the United Nations \nremained relevant to the crises and challenges that our \nworld and the Organization has faced during his watch."

        "file_text": "Ghana, like many other \nnations here, is delighted and feels proud that a \ndistinguished lady endowed with excellent diplomatic \nskills has been elected to the presidency of this body. \nWe have no doubt that she will continue the skilful \nstewardship of her predecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, the \nForeign Minister of Sweden, who presided over the \nsixtieth session of the General Assembly. \n Ghana would also like to welcome the Republic \nof Montenegro as the 192nd Member of the United \nNations, and looks forward to the day when the \nOrganization will attain full global and universal \nmembership. \n A year ago, we met at this historic venue to adopt \nthe 2005 World Summit Outcome Document \n(resolution 60/1), in which we acknowledged that \npeace and security and development and human rights \n \n \n11 06-52737 \n \nwere the pillars of the United Nations system and the \nfoundations of our collective well-being. We also \nrecognized that those pillars were interlinked and \nmutually reinforcing and that, while each country had \nthe primary responsibility for its own development, \nindividual efforts should be complemented by \nsupportive global programmes, measures and policies \naimed at expanding development opportunities, \nespecially for developing countries. \n Ghana therefore attaches the utmost importance \nto the Summit\u2019s decision that developing countries \nshould adopt and begin to implement by 2006 such \nrequisite national strategies as would enable them to \nachieve the goals and objectives that have been agreed \nupon, including the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs). Ghana has therefore been working \nrelentlessly towards that end, in the firm belief that our \ndevelopment partners, both bilateral and multilateral, \nwill support us in our efforts to improve the living \nconditions of our people. For effective implementation, \nall concerned must show commitment and dispatch. \n Ghana recognizes good governance as crucial to \nsustainable development. We have therefore worked \nassiduously at establishing a robust culture of \ndemocracy, sound economic management and \nadherence to the rule of law. The free and fair elections \nthat have been held successfully in Ghana over the past \n15 years bear eloquent testimony to the determination \nof Ghanaians to create an equitable, free and stable \nsociety in which each individual can develop his or her \nfull potential. The media, freed from intimidating \nlegislation, have blossomed into a vibrant watchdog for \nthe probity and accountability expected of the \ngovernors and the responsibility expected of the \ncitizens. \n It is against that background that Ghana readily \nsubmitted itself to the African Peer Review Mechanism \nunder the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development to \nhave an objective assessment of its institutional \nstructures and their functioning for the improvement of \nits governance. \n But our collective objective within this \nOrganization to alleviate the economic plight of the \nmajority of mankind may continue to elude us unless \nthe pursuit of international peace and security is \neffectively and satisfactorily addressed. Ghana \ntherefore views with grave concern the continuing \nspread and persistence of terrorist activities. The \ninternational community must rally to contain and \neffectively eradicate that menace to mankind. \n In that regard, the Secretary-General\u2019s proposal \nfor a Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy is welcome. \nIndeed, it is the view of Ghana that there must be a \nquick conclusion of the deliberations on the proposed \ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism. \n Yet another scourge to the security of the world \nare the snail-paced talks on the elimination of nuclear \nweapons and the added threat of the proliferation of \nthose weapons. Ghana shares the concerns of the \nmajority of Member States that this body must \ncontinue with and intensify its pressure for the total \nelimination of those weapons, for as long as 27,000 \nnuclear weapons continue to exist, as they do now, our \nworld will remain vulnerable to the threat of mass \ndestruction. \n We make this appeal not unaware of the positive \nuses of nuclear energy, but so long as those nations \nwhich already possess these weapons and those on the \nverge of breaking into the mastery of the technology do \nnot show transparency with their know-how, the world \nwill feel insecure. So Ghana appeals to such nations to \nshow candour and transparency in their cooperation \nwith the International Atomic Energy Agency by their \ncompliance with the terms of the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. \n The spread of small arms and light weapons is yet \nanother scourge, especially for Africa. This \nOrganization\u2019s collective efforts to rein in that menace \nsince 2001 have indeed yielded significant results. \nHowever, we are still far from achieving the desired \ntarget. That was borne out by the outcome of the recent \nReview Conference of the United Nations Programme \nof Action. Ghana therefore welcomes the current \nmomentum within the international community to \nmove closer to the ultimate goal of drastically \nremoving the menace. \n Without a doubt, the United Nations \nresponsibility for maintaining international peace and \nsecurity has been tremendously facilitated by \npeacekeeping operations in many troubled spots around \nthe world. Ghana has been a dedicated and regular \ncontributor to those operations. It is thus committed \nbecause of its conviction that the lack of peace and \nstability in any country can have far-reaching negative \nrepercussions beyond its immediate borders. We \ntherefore commend moves to enhance the United \n  \n \n06-52737 12 \n \nNations peacekeeping activities that bring hope to \nvictims of conflict. \n African nations are more and more demonstrating \ntheir proactive commitment to the management and \nresolution of conflicts on their continent. That is why \nGhana commends and supports the Secretary-General\u2019s \ndetermination to take the necessary measures to effect \nthe envisaged close partnership between the \nOrganization and the African Union in that sphere, \nwith particular reference to Darfur, in order to save the \nmany lives threatened by the looming crisis there. \nDeepening Africa\u2019s peacekeeping capacity to meet that \nchallenging mission through training, logistical and \nfinancial support is crucial to the success of that goal. \nThe decision taken at the 2005 World Summit in that \nregard must therefore be expeditiously implemented. \n A monumental product of the Summit was the \nbirth of the Peacebuilding Commission, of which \nGhana is a member. Our expectation is that the 30-\nmember Commission will discharge its functions \ndiligently. Another significant milestone achieved by \nthis Organization was the establishment of the Human \nRights Council. I must express appreciation to this \nAssembly for electing Ghana with the highest number \nof votes to the Council. \n The many resolutions and the launching of \nvarious Commissions clearly indicate the \ndetermination of our Organization to make the world a \nbetter and safer place for mankind. The truth is, \nhowever, that if this desire is to be actualized, the \nUnited Nations must undergo more radical reforms and \nbe better equipped to effectively implement its \ndecisions. Such a streamlined Organization will create \nthe critical mass for tackling effectively the many \nchallenges that threaten international peace and \nsecurity. Thus, the debate to reform the Security \nCouncil based on the principles of democracy, the \nsovereign equality of States and equitable geographical \nrepresentation, among others, is very much in order \nand must be supported. \n Permit me at this stage to try to discharge an \nhonourable duty that I feel uniquely placed to \nundertake. That is to pay tribute to the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, who is my compatriot and \nmy friend, at the end of his exemplary tenure. He has \nbrought much honour and distinction to our nation, \nGhana, by his excellent stewardship of the United \nNations over the past 10 years. Indeed, his entire adult \ncareer over the past 40 years has been at the exclusive \nservice of this Organization, through the ranks of \nwhich he rose until he attained the pinnacle 10 years \nago. His dedicated and illustrious service during the \nfirst 30 years led to his historic election as the first-\never career officer to become Secretary-General. \n Destiny also marked him out as the Secretary-\nGeneral to see out the last century and also usher the \nOrganization into the twenty-first century. It cannot be \ndisputed that these 10 years of his tenure have \nwitnessed the phenomenal acceleration of the world in \nthe process towards globalization. He can also claim \nsome credit for having succeeded in shepherding our \nOrganization deftly through the complicated and \ntransformational challenges that the times confronted it \nwith. He has been able to provide this masterful \nleadership not only through competent administration, \nbut also in ideas as well as lofty humanistic ideals. His \nvision for a more proactive Organization, able to \nrespond to the challenges of the twenty-first century, \nhas been lucidly published in his report \u201cIn larger \nfreedom: towards development, security and human \nrights for all\u201d. \n He is a much decorated personality all over the \nworld, and his winning the Nobel Peace Prize \nespecially attests to the quality of the human being he \nis. There is no doubt that he retires with an enviable \nlegacy of contributing immensely to shaping the \ndestiny of this Organization and the affairs of the \nworld. Ghana is proud of him and looks forward to \nreceiving him heroically at home. I say to him in our \nlanguage \u201cAyekoo\u201d, meaning \u201cwell done!\u201d "

        "file_text": "It is a \ngreat honour and pleasure to speak here on behalf of \nmy delegation and to take part in this important \ngathering, where all the Member States of our \nOrganization will consider today\u2019s most pressing \nissues. \n I wish to express to the President, on behalf of \nmy delegation and in my own name, our warmest \ncongratulations on her election. We also congratulate \nMr. Jan Eliasson on the effective way in which he led \nthe work of the previous session. \n We also take this opportunity to express once \nagain my country\u2019s support for, and appreciation of, the \nexcellent work of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi \nAnnan, who has led our Organization with courage, \nlucidity and determination during his term of office. \n Burundi is taking part in the sixty-first session of \nthe General Assembly a year after the setting up of \ndemocratic institutions. It was a historic event in \nBurundi for us to have democratically elected \ninstitutions, which have just reached the end of their \nfirst year in office, the first time this has happened \nsince we gained independence. \n This is a good time for us to report to the \nAssembly on the political, social and economic \nsituation in our country and the efforts that have been \nmade to meet the many challenges that the people of \nBurundi face. It is also an opportunity for us to address \nsome of the issues of current concern at the regional \nand global levels. \n In the post-conflict situation that my country is \ngoing through, the first concern was to re-establish \npeace and security throughout the country. Carrying \nout this task was made possible thanks to the \ndeployment in Burundi of a United Nations force and \nthe training of a new national defence force, in \naccordance with the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation \nAgreement for Burundi and the Comprehensive \nCeasefire Agreement of Pretoria. So far, this \nintegration has proceeded uneventfully, and we thank \nGod for this. \n The signing of a comprehensive ceasefire on \n7 September 2006 by the Government and the last rebel \nmovement, the Palipehutu-FNL movement, encourages \nus to accelerate the programme for disarming civilians \nin order to establish peace and security throughout the \ncountry. Over the last three months the people have \nbegun to voluntarily hand in to the authorities weapons \nthey acquired during Burundi\u2019s crisis. So far about \n5,000 weapons have been handed over. The agreement \nrepresents a very important stage in the life of our \ncountry, which is now going through its reconstruction \nphase.  \n The enjoyment of political liberties has become a \nreality in Burundi, whether in terms of political parties, \ncivil society or the media. With regard to the media, a \nlaw has just been passed to create more diverse and \nmore professional press institutions. \n We have also just passed an anti-corruption law. \nMeasures to implement it include an anti-corruption \ncourt and a force to deal with corruption. We are \nconvinced that they will allow us to work with more \ntransparency in the management of public resources \nand in our fight against corruption. State income is \nincreasing by nearly 20 per cent each month; we are \nalready enjoying the benefits of this policy. \n  \n \n06-52988 16 \n \n With regard to promoting the rule of law and the \nrights of the individual, we are making progress \nthrough the reforms taking place in the justice sector \nand with regard to human rights, national solidarity and \ngender equality. The Burundi Government\u2019s \nprogramme has placed promoting the rights of women \nand gender equality amongst its priorities. We urge the \nUnited Nations to give particular attention to this issue \nduring its reform process. The Government also \nappeals for, and supports, a specific structure to ensure \nthat women emerge from poverty and thus have \ngenuine equality. \n Still with regard to the rule of law, in addition to \nthe 5,000 or more political prisoners already freed, on \nthe occasion of the celebration of the forty-fourth \nanniversary of national independence on 1 July this \nyear, we decided to release undocumented detainees \nbeing held under irregular circumstances. Similarly, the \nGovernment has started to improve conditions for \nprisoners who have been properly sentenced. However, \nwe are aware that much more needs to be done in this \narea, with the support of the international community. \n Establishing the rule of law and peacebuilding \nalso depend on the peaceful settlement of the issue of \nland ownership. This was behind the Government\u2019s \ncreation of the national commission dealing with land \nand other assets, whose task it is to settle disputes over \nthe ownership or recovery of land and other assets that \nhave changed hands during the various social and \npolitical conflicts in our history. Its work is an essential \ncomplement to that of the truth and reconciliation \ncommission, with regard to which the Government of \nBurundi hopes agreement will soon be reached with the \nUnited Nations, because we are convinced that it will \ncontribute to combating the fallout from genocide, as \nwell as impunity in our country, and enhance the \nnational reconciliation process. \n With regard to national reconciliation, we firmly \nbelieve that sport is a very important factor in \npeacebuilding and reconstruction and in achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals. In Burundi we have \ntaken measures in this area, and we hope that other \ncountries going through a post-conflict period will \nfollow our example. \n The Government of Burundi continues to have to \ndeal with a significant number of vulnerable people. \nWe have today nearly 400,000 refugees, 120,000 \ninternally displaced persons and thousands of others \nwho need to be cared for, including persons with \ndisabilities, orphans, widows, widowers and old people \nunsettled by the war. Our Government needs help to \ndeal with this situation. Since the recent ceasefire \nagreement, refugees have started to return to Burundi \nen masse. \n The Government of Burundi has also sought to \nimprove the country\u2019s socio-economic situation. Aware \nof the general impoverishment of our people due to a \ndecade of war, we prepared an emergency programme \nfor the current year, and submitted it to donors for \nfunding on 28 February. The programme covers in \nparticular free primary education for all children of \nschool age, counteracting hunger, access to health care, \njob creation, rehabilitation of the communication \ninfrastructure, improving prison conditions and \nimproving the management of public finances. \n In order to ensure the proper management of \nfunds provided by donors within the framework of \ncooperation with Burundi, the Government has \nestablished a national committee to coordinate aid. \nWith the same desire for efficiency, we have created a \nnational committee to monitor and manage Heavily \nIndebted Poor Countries funds, budgetary support and \ndebt. \n The Government\u2019s efforts to alleviate poverty \ninclude measures such as reducing the price of most \nessential commodities, the abolition of some taxes, free \nhealth care for children under the age of five and for \nmothers who give birth in state clinics, and the fight \nagainst AIDS. A new status for civil servants and a 15 \nper cent increase in their salary from 1 July this year \nare intended to give them more motivation and halt the \ndecline in their standard of living. \n However, our country\u2019s reconstruction, efforts to \ncounteract poverty and the relaunching of Burundi\u2019s \neconomy require more than an emergency programme. \nThe preparation of a strategic framework for growth \nand counteracting poverty, covering a period of three \nyears, meets this concern. We plan to organize next \nNovember a donors\u2019 round table on the basis of this \nstrategic framework. We rely on the active \nparticipation of Burundi\u2019s partners, both long-standing \npartners and new ones, in order to help Burundi \nrespond positively to the many priority expectations of \nour people, who are impatient to enjoy the dividends of \npeace at last. \n \n \n17 06-52988 \n \n At the same time, we are pursuing or launching \nother measures aimed at creating a favourable \neconomic environment that is conducive to prosperity. \nThey include liberalizing the coffee sector, simplifying \ncustoms procedures, liberalizing the circulation of \ncurrency through private financial institutions, \nconstructing new communication routes and improving \nthe road network. Furthermore, the investment code \nhas been revised in order to encourage investment in \nBurundi. \n The Government\u2019s adoption of the five-year plan \nfor 2006-2010 and the launching of a study for the \nperiod to 2025 are part of this medium- and long-term \nstrategy for our socio-economic and political \ndevelopment. We have thus sought to establish for our \nsociety a plan based on a minimum number of common \nobjectives and a shared vision of the future of Burundi \nand its people. \n We welcome the decision by the American \nAdministration to put Burundi on the list of countries \nthat benefit from the facilities offered in the framework \nof the African Growth and Opportunity Act. We have \ninvited businessmen to organize themselves in order to \ntake advantage of this new opportunity for our \neconomy. \n Burundi attaches great importance to regional \nintegration initiatives. We take this opportunity to \nwelcome the electoral process taking place in the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, which is now in its \nfinal stages. We hope that it will be successful and that \nit will result in the democratic establishment of \nlegitimate institutions. Similarly, we welcome the \nsigning of a ceasefire between the Government of \nUganda and the LRA, which we sincerely hope will \nquickly lead to lasting peace. \n We continue to be concerned over the continuing \narmed conflict in the Horn of Africa, Darfur and the \nMiddle East, as well as by the deadlock in the peace \nprocess in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. As Members of the United \nNations, we must work tirelessly to end these sad \nsituations. \n Terrorism is a further harsh reality that the world \nstill confronts. Far from being discouraged, we must \nstep up our vigilance and consider new initiatives to \ncounteract this scourge and evil, and to deal with its \nunderlying causes. \n Globalization is one of the major challenges of \nthe twenty-first century, but we also see it as an \nopportunity for developing countries to benefit from \nthe considerable progress and advantages that it offers, \nprovided it is combined with openness and autonomy. \n For our part, we will spare no effort to make our \ncontribution to building peace and prosperity. The \nelection of Burundi to the Peacebuilding Commission \nis a source of pride and additional motivation to work \nto strengthen peace in our country and throughout the \nworld. Unfortunately, changes in anti-democratic \nthinking and behaviour do not take place automatically \nin countries emerging from crisis, such as Burundi. \nHowever, we welcome the successes already achieved \nand our increased capacity to control the situation. \n Our Organization is going through a critical \nperiod. Although the United Nations was set up \u201cto \nsave succeeding generations from the scourge of war\u201d, \ncertain conflict situations have been haunting it for \nmany years. It must therefore be made into an \ninstrument at the service of all, able to inspire hope, \ndispel concerns and restore respect for order and \ninternational law. This mission must be fulfilled in full \ncooperation with regional organizations, whose \neffectiveness in conflict prevention and rapid \nintervention has already been proved, despite \ninsufficient resources. \n The General Assembly\u2019s agenda must reflect the \nmain concerns of the day. These include, in particular, \nnuclear disarmament, which continues to poison \ninternational relations. Other concerns are combating \nthe illegal trade in small arms, poverty and epidemics \nthat kill on a large scale, such as AIDS and malaria. We \ncommend the international drug purchasing facility \n(UNITAID) initiative, which gives hope to those \nsuffering from AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. It \nproves that a partnership between the North and the \nSouth can change the lives of millions of people \nthroughout the world. \n The new millennium was warmly welcomed. \nWorld leaders place great hopes in this new time, as \nshown by the Millennium Development Goals adopted \nin 2000, which were reaffirmed in the declaration of \nthe summit of heads of State and Government in \nSeptember 2005. Those Goals represent a platform that \nis particularly important for developing countries, \nlandlocked countries and small island developing \nStates in their efforts to combat hunger and poverty \n  \n \n06-52988 18 \n \nand to promote health and education, to mention just a \nfew subjects. \n Other commitments were made in Paris and at the \nG-8 summit in Gleneagles, particularly for improved \naid coordination and further aid and debt relief. \n Before closing, I would like to express our deep \ngratitude to Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General, \nand to all the members of the Security Council, the \nEuropean Union and the African Union, as well as to \nall the members of the Regional Initiative that have \nsupported our peacemaking and peacebuilding efforts, \nwhich have resulted in the achievements already seen. \nWe think in particular of certain countries of the \nregion, such as Uganda, Tanzania and South Africa, \nwhich were tireless godfathers in facilitating our peace \nprocess. To all those partners, we again say a big \n\u201cThank you\u201d for the remarkable success that my \ncountry has just witnessed with the signing of the \nceasefire with the Palipehutu-FNL. "

        "file_text": "Madam \nPresident, at the outset, on behalf of the Vietnamese \ndelegation, may I extend our warmest congratulations \nto you, the third woman in United Nations history to be \nelected as President of the General Assembly. I am \nconfident that, under your wise leadership, this sixty-\nfirst session will be crowned with success. I also wish \nto convey our deep appreciation for the tremendous \nefforts undertaken and active contributions made by \nHis Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson during his presidency \nof the General Assembly at its sixtieth session. \n As His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan\u2019s last term of \nduty as Secretary-General of the United Nations comes \nto a close, I wish, on behalf of the Vietnamese \nGovernment, to express our deep appreciation for his \ndedication and commitment to our Organization. His \nvisit to Viet Nam last May was another milestone in the \nhistory of the ever-growing Viet Nam-United Nations \ncooperative relationship. \n The 2005 World Summit lit up our hopes for the \nachievement by the international community of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) set out by our \nleaders at the Millennium Summit in 2000. One year \nhas elapsed, and, regrettably, the picture of the world \nwe see today is made up of paradoxes. Although the \ntrend of peace, cooperation and development continues \nto prevail, so do the unilateral use of force, escalation \nof regional and ethnic conflicts and international \nterrorism. We have also seen serious hardships faced \nby developing countries under the pressure of \nglobalization, and inequality in international economic \nrelations. Poverty, epidemics, drugs and transnational \ncrime pose even greater threats to hundreds of millions \nof people around the world. \n Against this backdrop, in the view of the \nVietnamese delegation, continued joint efforts to create \na favourable environment for the achievement of the \nMDGs are even more imperative. We consider the \ntheme chosen for this sixty-first session of the General \nAssembly, focusing on global partnership for \ndevelopment, to be highly relevant. \n Peace and socio-political stability are \nindispensable to development. In turn, positive \neconomic development and improved living standards \nof people help to consolidate peace and stability in \nevery country and region and the world as a whole. It \nis essential that nations work together to settle \ndifferences and disputes through dialogue, abandon the \nuse of force in their relations and fully comply with the \nUnited Nations Charter and international law in order \nto build a peaceful and stable environment in the \ninterest of all. \n I wish to reaffirm Viet Nam\u2019s strong support for \nefforts to reach early peaceful settlements of \ninternational and regional conflicts and differences, \nincluding the nuclear issues on the Korean Peninsula \nand in Iran, and the crisis in the Middle East, where the \nrecent hostilities in Lebanon, which caused heavy loss \nof innocent life and destruction of the country\u2019s \ninfrastructure, serve as a typical example of harm \nbrought about by unilateral actions. \n In this connection, I wish to state Viet Nam\u2019s \nconsistent policy of supporting the just struggle of the \nPalestinian people for their inalienable rights. I call on \nall parties concerned to implement the United Nations \n \n \n33 06-53341 \n \nSecurity Council resolutions on the Middle East, \nincluding resolution 1701 (2006), and soon arrive at a \nfair and lasting solution for peace and stability in the \nregion. \n Viet Nam is deeply concerned by the upsurge of \nterrorism in the world. We will continue to support the \njoint efforts of the international community to combat \nterrorism on the basis of the fundamental principles of \nthe United Nations Charter and international law, as \nwell as respect for national sovereignty. The deep roots \nof terrorism, including poverty, inequality and \ninjustice, must be eliminated. What should also be \nmentioned here is the unfortunate reality that, in many \ncases, the suppression of terrorist organizations, \nincluding those targeting Viet Nam, is being \nundertaken selectively, with double standards. It is our \nview that such conduct may leave room for more \ninternational terrorist acts. \n Achievements in science and technology, \nespecially information technology, and globalization \nhave brought about great opportunities for all \ncountries. They have also brought about the dark side \nof international economic relations. A widened \ndevelopment gap between the rich and the poor poses \npotential threats to world peace and security. In the \nOutcome Document of the 2005 World Summit, our \nleaders called for the establishment of a global \npartnership for development to enhance cooperation in \nall financial, trade and investment areas and called for \nincreased assistance to developing countries, \nconsidering that such steps by the international \ncommunity would contribute to establishing a \nfavourable environment for the achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). \n Such global partnership is yet to be seen, and we \nare concerned with increasing adverse impacts of \nglobalization. The failure of the Doha Round, the \nstrengthening of protectionism in a number of \ndeveloped countries and fluctuating oil and gold prices \nare causing more and more difficulties for developing \nnations in their efforts to achieve the MDGs. A typical \nexample of this situation is the anti-dumping tariff \nimposed on Vietnamese catfish and shrimp in past \nyears and on footwear at present; this measure is \naffecting the lives of millions of poor people. It runs \ncounter to World Trade Organization (WTO) rules and \nthe spirit of trade liberalization pursued by Member \nStates. It should also be pointed out that the increased \nintegration of developing nations in the world economy \nis indeed an important element in ensuring the \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs).  \n Developing countries should be supported and \nassisted to join the World Trade Organization (WTO) \nas early as possible. Non-tariff barriers under the guise \nof hygiene and safety standards, among others, should \nbe removed to facilitate developing countries to access \nthe markets of the developed economies. We have on \nmany occasions expressed our view that, in our times, \nembargo and sanctions are completely obsolete \npolicies. We once again call for an early lifting of the \nunilateral economic and trade embargo against Cuba. \n Viet Nam welcomes the fact that a number of \ncountries have set up road maps to allocate 0.7 per cent \nof their gross national product to official development \nassistance without any conditions. Technology transfer, \ncapacity-building and human resource development \nshould be further promoted. We welcome initiatives to \nsettle the debts of poor countries, the solutions outlined \nin the Monterrey Consensus and the recent efforts of \nthe international community towards this end. The \nUnited Nations should work out, especially at the \nnational level, measures to further incorporate the \nMDGs in the implementation of global commitments \nundertaken during the past decade in the areas of \nwomen, children, population, development, HIV/AIDS \nprevention, housing, environment and social \ndevelopment. \n Viet Nam supports efforts to strengthen \nmultilateral mechanisms in which the United Nations \nplays a central role with a view to building and \nensuring a peaceful and stable environment in the \nworld. The United Nations should be reformed to \nimprove its effectiveness, democratization and modes \nof operation on the basis of the fundamental principles \nenshrined in its Charter.  \n While welcoming initial successes in the United \nNations reform process, such as the establishment of \nthe Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding \nCommission, we realize that much remains to be done. \nMeasures are needed to consolidate the central role and \npower of the General Assembly. The Security Council \nshould also be reformed in both its composition and \nmethods of work to ensure that it really represents the \nconcerns and interests of all United Nations Members \nas stipulated in the Charter. \n  \n \n06-53341 34 \n \n Viet Nam has made remarkable progress in \nimplementing the MDGs and we are in a good position \nto meet the 2015 deadline. Based on our own \nexperience, we believe that each country should, first \nand foremost, strive to create and maintain a peaceful \nenvironment for development, mobilize broad \nparticipation by people of all walks of life in poverty \nreduction efforts and reserve preferential treatments for \nthe poor, vulnerable groups and people living in remote \nand difficult areas, with a view to helping them catch \nup with the majority. Furthermore, effective prevention \nof natural disasters and mitigation of their \nconsequences are crucial factors. \n To create a peaceful environment for national \ndevelopment, Viet Nam will continue with its foreign \npolicy of sovereign independence, peace, cooperation \nand development. We continue to be a friend and \nreliable partner of all countries in the international \ncommunity striving for peace and cooperation and we \nwill continue to actively participate in regional and \ninternational cooperation.  \n We are in the final stage leading to accession to \nthe World Trade Organization. Viet Nam is also \nrunning for non-permanent membership of the United \nNations Security Council for the term 2008-2009. In \npursuing our policy of international integration and in \ncontributing to the common endeavours of the \ninternational community, we look forward to continued \nsupport from all Members of the United Nations.

        "file_text": "At the \noutset, it is my great pleasure to express to you, \nMadam, the heartfelt congratulations of the delegation \nof Mali on your outstanding election to the presidency \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. Your \nelection attests to your eminent personal qualities and \nis a tribute to your country, Bahrain, with which Mali \n  \n \n06-53005 44 \n \nenjoys fruitful cooperation. I assure you and other \nBureau members, whom I also congratulate, of the \nsupport of my delegation. \n I should also like to express our satisfaction to \nyour predecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, for his excellent \nguidance of the work of the General Assembly at its \nsixtieth session. History will recall his spirit of \ninitiative and his commitment, which were decisive to \nthe implementation of the outcomes of the September \n2005 World Summit. \n I should also like to pay tribute to Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan, who, throughout his two terms, \nhas carried out his mission with devotion and \ncommitment. \n Tomorrow, Mali will celebrate the 46th \nanniversary of its independence, but Mali is an ancient \ncountry, a country of traditions, a crossroads of \ncivilization, a land of culture, dialogue and tolerance. \nUnder the leadership of President Amadou Toumani \nTour\u00e9, our country continues every day to consolidate \nits model of democracy, which has been unanimously \nhailed in Africa and throughout the world. A new \nMali \u2014 a democratic, united Mali \u2014 is on the march. \n A symbol of that dynamic was the signing in \nAlgiers on 4 July of the accord for the restoration of \npeace, security and development in the Kidal region. \nThe Algiers agreement bolsters Mali\u2019s firm resolve to \nopt for the peaceful settlement of disputes, fruitful \ndialogue and concerted action. The restoration of peace \nin the northern part of our country has allowed the \nvarious components of the Malian nation to work \ntogether in building our nation in a spirit of solidarity \nfocused on the well-being and prosperity of all. \n Similarly, our political system is being \nstrengthened daily in a context of peaceful democracy, \nto the great satisfaction of our people, who have made \nthe irreversible decision that any devolution of power \nmust occur within a democratic and constitutional \nframework. To that end, in the first quarter of 2007 the \npeople of Mali will be called to the polls \u2014 for the \nfourth time since the establishment of multiparty \ndemocracy in 1992 \u2014 to elect a president and renew \nthe mandate of the deputies to the National Assembly.  \n Mali welcomes the choice of theme for the sixty-\nfirst session of the General Assembly on implementing \na global partnership for development. In that respect, it \ngoes without saying that the 2005 World Summit \nrepresented a decisive moment in the international \ncommunity\u2019s determination to ensure a better life for \nall the peoples of the world. At that time, our heads of \nState and Government reviewed the implementation of \nthe internationally agreed development objectives, in \nparticular the Millennium Development Goals, and \nreaffirmed their relevance, thereby confirming their \nimportance at the heart of the development agenda. \n In that regard, Mali has made the fight against \npoverty a priority of the Government\u2019s actions. In May \n2002, my country adopted a strategic framework for \nthe fight against poverty, which sets priority \ndevelopment guidelines, particularly in the social \nspheres, in order to better meet the basic needs of our \npeople by creating an environment conducive to \nsustained growth, enhanced participatory democracy, \ngood governance and entrenched rule of law.  \n With respect to results achieved, the Government \nof Mali, with the assistance of its partners, is finalizing \na new so-called second-generation strategic framework \nthat will encompass, above and beyond the social \nsectors, the productive sectors of agriculture, industry \nand trade. In the same vein, we recently adopted a law \non agricultural guidelines that makes agriculture the \ndriving force of the national economy in order to \nguarantee food self-sufficiency and to ensure the well-\nbeing of our people.  \n Mr. Chungong-Ayafor (Cameroon), Vice-President, \ntook the Chair. \n Security cannot be ensured in an environment in \nwhich the movement of small arms and light weapons \ncontinues to destroy human lives, destabilize States \nand impede their economic and social development. In \naccordance with the United Nations Programme of \nAction to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit \nTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its \nAspects, we are firmly committed to mitigating the \nunspeakable suffering caused by those weapons and to \nensuring individual security for all.  \n In that regard, in West Africa and in the context \nof the Economic Community of West African States \n(ECOWAS), we have taken significant measures to \nstem the scourge of the proliferation of light weapons. \nIndeed, the thirtieth conference of ECOWAS heads of \nState and Government, held at Abuja on 14 June, \ndecided to back up the ECOWAS moratorium on the \nimport, export and production of small arms and light \nweapons with executive power by converting it into a \n \n \n45 06-53005 \n \nbinding convention. That new instrument should \ncontribute to building the capacities of Governments to \nexert stricter control over the traffic in small arms and \nto improve security arrangements within the \nCommunity. \n Similarly, we cannot fail to welcome the \nlaunching, in Bamako on 6 June, of the new ECOWAS \nSmall Arms Control Programme (ECOSAP). Over the \ncourse of six years, ECOSAP \u2014 via the intermediary \nof national commissions \u2014 will not only provide \nmember States with technical and financial support, but \nwill also contribute to building the capacities of a \nspecial unit in the ECOWAS Executive Secretariat.  \n On the other hand, we can only regret the fact \nthat the United Nations Conference to review the \nimplementation of the Programme of Action to \nPrevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in \nSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects \nfailed to draft an agreed text because of the lack of \nprogress in the priority areas of the bearing of arms by \ncivilians, the management of stockpiles, references to \nhuman rights and the participation of civil society. As a \nresult, we have fallen far behind in the Programme, the \nprovisions of which we were supposed to improve. For \nits part, Mali reiterates its readiness to continue to \nwork with other Member States to make progress on \nthat important issue. \n Rarely have international peace and security been \nput to such a harsh test by the resurgence of hotbeds of \ntension and conflict and acts of international terrorism. \nInternational terrorism is, as we all know, one of the \nmost serious threats to international peace and security. \nIn that respect, the attacks perpetrated worldwide \nvividly remind us that no country is safe from that \nphenomenon. \n In order to create conditions conducive to \nresponding to terrorism, it is urgent that we build \nnational and regional capacities. To that end, we must \novercome our differences in drafting a consensus \ndefinition and adopting a comprehensive strategy in \nthat area. No cause, howsoever just or right, justifies \nthe deliberate use of violence against innocent \ncivilians. In that vein, we must promote a dialogue \namong civilizations, which remains fully relevant in an \ninternational context marked by a lack of trust among \nnations in terms of culture and religion. \n The maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity is a prerequisite of any development process. \nMali therefore continues to be fully committed to the \nideals of peace and stability, both within and beyond its \nborders.  \n On the African front, I welcome the progress \nmade towards reconstruction and national \nreconciliation in many countries, including Guinea-\nBissau, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Burundi and the \nComoros. In C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, despite the clear lack of \nprogress in the implementation of the road map, the \npeace process has reached a critical phase. Mali \nreaffirms its readiness to assist the Ivorian political \nactors in restoring lasting peace in that brotherly \nneighbour country. \n In the Sudan, the implementation of the Darfur \nPeace Agreement, signed on 5 May in Abuja, is a major \nconcern of the international community. We urge all \nparties involved to fulfil their commitments and to \nwork to restore peace and preserve national unity. \n In the same vein, we can only welcome the \nsuccessful convening of the first general, free, \nmultiparty elections to complete the process of \ndemocratic transition in the Democratic Republic of \nthe Congo.  \n The recent outbreak of violence in the Middle \nEast recalls \u2014 as if there were any need to do so \u2014 the \nnecessity for the international community to take \nappropriate measures to create conditions conducive to \na lasting, negotiated and peaceful settlement to that \ncrisis. While reaffirming our active solidarity with the \npeople of Lebanon and Palestine, we are closely \nfollowing developments in that region and will \ncontinue to support relevant United Nations resolutions \non the Middle East and the Palestinian question.  \n While it is now recognized that trade is a factor \nfor growth and development, we must also note that \ndeveloping countries continue to suffer the \nrepercussions of an unfair and discriminatory trade \nsystem, particularly given the tariff and non-tariff \nobstacles and subsidies for production and export that \ndistort competition. Given their negative effects, such \nmeasures prevent the development of our agriculture, \ndeny our producers \u2014 Malian cotton growers among \nthem \u2014 a decent income, and keep them in the poverty \nthat we have committed ourselves to eradicating by \n2015. \n In that regard, the hopes placed in the Doha \nDevelopment Round contrast starkly with the major \n  \n \n06-53005 46 \n \nuncertainties arising from the recent failure of the trade \ntalks on agricultural products. That is a source of \nlegitimate concern to us. Mali urges all parties to be \nflexible and promptly to relaunch the Doha Round to \nensure that trade liberalization serves the development \nof all nations without exception, particularly the \npoorest, so that we may raise millions of people out of \npoverty. \n The issue of external debt is of particular \nimportance to developing countries, especially the least \ndeveloped. Indeed, despite the welcome measures to \ncancel the multilateral debt of certain countries, \nincluding Mali, the debt burden continues to weigh \nheavily on developing countries, undermine their \ndevelopment efforts and prevent their economic \nrecovery. Those countries are locked in a cycle of \ndependence on outside financing and, if nothing is \ndone, will fall behind in their efforts to achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals. \n In such circumstances, we need to explore lasting \nsolutions for making the debt less burdensome, \nincluding the cancellation of bilateral debt. Those \ncountries need investment and to strive for the well-\nbeing of their peoples. There must also be accelerated \nprogress towards a substantial increase in official \ndevelopment assistance if the ultimate goal of 0.7 per \ncent of the gross national income of the developed \ncountries is to be reached.  \n The AIDS pandemic has spread so alarmingly \nthat, beyond its health dimensions and given its vast \nreach, it has today become a development problem \nthroughout the world. Indeed, in Africa it has become a \nhealth emergency, despite our national and \ninternational efforts. In the face of the pandemic, we \nneed to step up our efforts and strengthen our resolve \nfully to implement the 2001 Declaration of \nCommitment and the General Assembly\u2019s Political \nDeclaration issued at the High-level Meeting on \nHIV/AIDS in May and June this year. The XVI \nInternational AIDS Conference, held at Toronto in \nAugust 2006, it should be recalled, has highlighted the \nseriousness of the situation and the urgent need to take \naction. \n At the national level, Mali has established a \nmultisectoral programme for combating HIV/AIDS, \nwhose implementation has made it possible to provide \nfree access to antiretroviral treatment for patients and \nto carry out an awareness and education prevention \ncampaign to stem the disease and its disastrous social \neffects. In the same vein, the Government has created a \nNational High Council against AIDS under the direct \nauthority of the President. I would like to take this \nopportunity to stress that the international community \nmust continue to give the same priority to other \ndiseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis and polio, \nwhose consequences are just as devastating for our \npeople as AIDS. \n As for the situation of the disabled, Mali is \npleased to have been a member of the working group \nthat prepared the text that was the basis for a draft \nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. \nWe welcome the negotiations under way within the Ad \nHoc Committee, and we remain convinced that such a \ntool will create the framework for equality and the full \nparticipation of the disabled in efforts to build their \nrespective societies. \n As for the institutional reform of the United \nNations, Mali welcomes the creation of the \nPeacebuilding Commission, one of the major results of \nthe Summit of September 2005. For many years the \nmanagement of post-conflict situations has been the \nweak link of our Organization. As is known, the \nimpulse that gives rise to peacekeeping, for both donor \ncountries and troop contributors, subsides once there is \na semblance of stability. As a result, such situations \nquite often result in a resurgence of conflicts less than \nfive years after they have ended, as we have seen from \nexperience in this area.  \n How can we not welcome the creation and \nimplementation of the Human Rights Council, of \nwhich Mali is a member, the Central Emergency \nResponse Fund and the adoption of a series of \nresolutions on the follow-up to development? All those \nmeasures work together for the attainment of the \nwishes of the world\u2019s leaders to address better the \nproblems and the challenges of our time in order to \nbring changes in the priority areas of development, \npeace, collective security, human rights and reform of \nthe Organization. \n The progress achieved must not cause us to forget \nthat much remains to be done, especially the necessary \nreform of the Security Council. While that need is \nunanimously accepted, it is no less true that not one of \nthe formulas proposed has so far won consensus. \n Mali, drawing on the Ezulwini Consensus and the \nSyrte Declaration adopted by the heads of State and \n \n \n47 06-53005 \n \nGovernment of the African Union, strongly supports \nAfrica\u2019s claim to two permanent seats and five \nnon-permanent seats. A Council thus reformed would \nbetter reflect the geopolitical realities of today\u2019s world \nand would redress the historical injustice done to \nAfrica, the only region without a permanent seat on the \nSecurity Council. \n I would like to end by recalling that millions of \npersons in the world have placed their hopes for peace, \nsecurity, development and solidarity in the United \nNations. We have no right to disappoint them. As the \ncommunity of nations, we have the obligation and the \nmeans to achieve all that through collective awareness \nand protection of our common values. This is what it \nwill take for us to be in a position to guarantee future \ngenerations sustainable development that will protect \nthem from the scourge of war. "

        "file_text": "I am indeed very happy to \nsee a sister from fraternal Bahrain presiding over the \nGeneral Assembly at this important session. Your \nelection, Madam, symbolizes the increasingly \nsignificant role that women are playing in the Muslim \nworld. You will have Pakistan\u2019s full support in carrying \nout your challenging responsibilities. \n  \n \n06-52731 18 \n \n This is the first time that I have addressed this \nbody since the devastating earthquake that occurred in \nthe northern regions of Pakistan last October. I \ntherefore take this opportunity to express our deepest \ngratitude for the relief and financial assistance that we \nreceived from around the world. We were deeply \nmoved by the global solidarity displayed in the hour of \nour distress and need. \n Multilateral cooperation is the key to addressing \nthe existing and emerging challenges of the twenty-\nfirst century: political disputes, terrorism, proliferation, \npoverty, hunger, disease, economic disparities, \nmigration, unemployment, environmental degradation \nand natural disasters. We appreciate the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s initiatives to equip the United Nations to \nrespond to those challenges. But we are yet a distance \nfrom the vision endorsed at the 2005 United Nations \nSummit. \n Over the past six years, despite daunting external \nand internal challenges, Pakistan has been transformed \ninto a dynamic nation, moving rapidly towards the \nvision of our founder, namely, a modern, progressive, \nIslamic and democratic republic. We have reformed our \ninstitutions of governance and our economy. \nDemocratic governance has been introduced at the \ngrass-roots level. We are focusing on lifting up the \nunderprivileged sectors of our society: poor people, \nwomen and minorities. Women are being politically \nand economically empowered and protected against \ndiscrimination. Minorities have been politically \nmainstreamed. We have also unshackled the media. \n Having successfully put our economy on an \nupsurge, we are now embarked on second-generation \nreforms to spread the benefits of growth to all our \npeople. One of our strategic aims is to utilize \nPakistan\u2019s unique geostrategic position to build trade, \nenergy and communication corridors linking South \nAsia, West Asia, Central Asia and China. Regional \nintegration will accelerate economic growth and \nprosperity in our part of Asia and even beyond. Of \ncourse, Pakistan still faces daunting challenges from \nwithin and without. We are facing them boldly to build \nan environment of peace and stability in our region. \n Pakistan desires a peaceful environment in the \nregion. We have been engaged in a peace process with \nIndia aimed at building confidence and resolving \nissues \u2014 including the Jammu and Kashmir dispute \u2014 \nthat have been the source of tension and conflict \nbetween the two countries in the past. The improved \nrelations and the conducive international environment \nhave brought an acceptable solution to this long-\nstanding dispute within reach. I am confident that my \npositive meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh \nin Havana will help to carry the peace process forward, \nwhich is vital for the future of both countries and for \npeace in South Asia and beyond. \n A stable security environment is also important \nfor peace in our region. Pakistan has proposed the \ncreation of a strategic restraint regime in South Asia, \nencompassing minimum nuclear deterrence and a \nbalance of conventional forces. We do not want to \nenter into an arms race. But we will do whatever is \nnecessary to preserve the credibility of our minimum \ndefensive deterrence level. \n Pakistan has a legitimate requirement for nuclear \npower generation to meet the energy needs of our \nexpanding economy and our expanding industry. As a \nresponsible nuclear State, we will continue to seek \nnuclear technology for power generation under \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. We \ncannot accept discrimination in the nuclear field. \n Peace and stability in Afghanistan is in Pakistan\u2019s \nvital interest. It will assure tranquillity on our western \nfrontiers. It will also enable Pakistan to realize its \nambition of linking Central Asia and South Asia \nthrough Afghanistan and Pakistan. \n Afghanistan confronts complex security, political \nand economic challenges, including a resurgent Taliban \nthat also threatens Pakistan\u2019s efforts to combat \nextremism and terrorism. The common challenge \nimposes a joint responsibility on Pakistan, Afghanistan \nand the coalition forces. \n Problems in the border regions of Pakistan and \nAfghanistan are compounded by the continuing \npresence in Pakistan of over 3 million Afghan refugees, \nsome of them sympathetic to the Taliban. The \nincentives offered by the international community to \nthe refugees for their voluntary return are minimal. A \nserious international commitment is required to \nfacilitate their repatriation to their country. \n The unfortunate history of our region has placed \nPakistan in the frontline of the global campaign against \nterrorism. We cooperate daily with many countries, \nincluding the United States and the United Kingdom. \nOur cooperation has pre-empted several terrorist plots, \n \n \n19 06-52731 \n \nsuch as the one uncovered recently to blow up airliners \nflying from London. Over the past five years, Al-Qaida \nhas been significantly degraded as an organization in \nour region. \n While we confront terrorism our strategy must \nseek to eliminate this phenomenon comprehensively. \nWe cannot do so unless we understand and address the \nroot causes of terrorism today. How are terrorists able \nto find willing recruits, even among educated young \npeople, in advanced and democratic societies? The \nreasons are clear. Across the Muslim world, old \nconflicts and new campaigns of military intervention \nhave spawned a deep sense of desperation and \ninjustice. Each new battleground involving an Islamic \nState has served as a new breeding ground for \nextremists and terrorists. Indiscriminate bombings, \ncivilian casualties, torture, human rights abuses, racial \nslurs and discrimination only add to the challenge of \ndefeating terrorism. \n In my view, a two-pronged strategy, which I call \nenlightened moderation, is required to address the \nsituation. That strategy envisages that, apart from \ncombating terrorism frontally, the international \ncommunity must undertake resolute efforts to resolve \nthe conflicts afflicting the Islamic world. Unless we \nend the foreign occupation of Muslim countries and \nsuppression of Muslim peoples, terrorism and \nextremism will continue to find recruits among \nalienated Muslims in various parts of the world. \n We also need to bridge, through dialogue and \nunderstanding, the growing divide between the Islamic \nand Western worlds. In particular, it is imperative to \nend racial and religious discrimination against Muslims \nand to prohibit the defamation of Islam. It is most \ndisappointing to see personalities of high standing \noblivious to Muslim sensitivities at these critical \nmoments. \n The greatest challenge to global security, to the \ncampaign against terrorism, to the promotion of \nharmony among civilizations and to the credibility of \nthe United Nations is the cauldron of conflict that is \nthe Middle East \u2014 exemplified by the latest Israeli \naggression against Lebanon. We hope that the \nresolution painstakingly brokered in the Security \nCouncil will lead to a rapid and complete Israeli \nwithdrawal and the restoration of Lebanon\u2019s \nsovereignty over its entire territory. \n The attack on Lebanon has far-reaching \nimplications for the Middle East. The ability and \nrelevance of moderate forces to bring about a just \npeace in the region has been put to a very severe test. \nThe world must, however, still support them to address \nthe festering problems of the region comprehensively \nand fairly. It is time to end Israel\u2019s conflicts with all its \nneighbours. It is time, first and foremost, to end the \ntragedy of Palestine. There is no doubt in our mind \u2014 \nthere should be no doubt in anyone\u2019s mind \u2014 that that \nlies at the core not only of tackling the problems of \nIraq and Afghanistan, but also of dealing with the \nmenaces of terrorism and extremism at their roots. \n The confrontation over Iran\u2019s nuclear programme \nthreatens further instability in this already inflamed \nregion. We are encouraged by the \u201cIran and 5 + 1\u201d \nnegotiations and believe that this issue can be resolved \npeacefully in a manner that accommodates the \nlegitimate rights and interests of all parties involved. \nResort to coercion and worse, the use of force, could \nlead to grave consequences in the region and globally. \n The dynamic economic performance of several \ndeveloping countries, especially in Asia, has \ntransformed the world\u2019s geo-economic map. Yet, most \ndeveloping countries find that international trade and \nfinancial structures are weighted against them. With \nthe Doha Round in the doldrums, new modalities must \nbe found so as to utilize the full potential of trade for \ndevelopment. Similarly, the international financial \nsystem should ensure a more equitable share of \ninternational liquidity and investment for developing \ncountries. \n Unless the activities of the United Nations \naccommodate the concerns and priorities of its general \nmembership, the Organization risks losing its global \nmoral authority. The General Assembly should reassert \nits Charter responsibilities, and the Security Council \nshould be reformed to make the activities of the \nCouncil more democratic, transparent, inclusive and \naccountable to the general membership. The reform of \nthe Security Council is of vital interest to every \nMember State and must therefore be adopted by \nconsensus or by the widest possible agreement. \n This important session of the Assembly will elect \nthe next Secretary-General of the United Nations. \nPakistan hopes that consensus will soon develop in the \nSecurity Council and the Assembly on a qualified \ncandidate from Asia. Pakistan will extend its full \n  \n \n06-52731 20 \n \nsupport to the new Secretary-General, as we have done \nto Mr. Kofi Annan, to build a United Nations that can \ndecisively advance the world towards the noble vision \nof preventing the scourge of war and promoting better \nstandards of living for all peoples of the world in \nfreedom.

        "file_text": "Lebanon \nhas again been set ablaze by war, a further \nmanifestation of the interminable conflict in the Middle \nEast whose tragedies have, for 60 years now, \npunctuated the life of the United Nations. \n By endlessly deferring its settlement, this \nconfrontation has become the epicentre of international \ninstability, the main source of incomprehension \nbetween the different worlds and an easy alibi for all \nforms of terrorism. \n This situation is not a foregone conclusion. With \nSecurity Council resolution 1701 (2006), the United \nNations is shouldering its responsibilities. The \nunanimous adoption of this resolution has brought the \nfighting to an end. France, Europe and Asia have \ncontributed to the strengthening of United Nations \nInterim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). \n But the fire is still smouldering. It is now up to \nall the parties to work towards the consolidation of \npeace and the recovery of Lebanon. \n It is now up to Israel to complete the withdrawal \nof its forces. It is up to the Lebanese Government to \naffirm its sovereignty throughout its territory. And it is \nup to the countries in the region to cooperate fully in \norder to ensure the success of resolution 1701 (2006), \nto cooperate with the United Nations. \n In this highly sensitive region where divides \nmeet, the status quo has become unbearable. Because \nthe conflict in the Middle East is a threat to global \npeace and security, the world has no option but to be \nthe guarantor of peace. Let us tread off the beaten track \nof habit. Let us define a global strategy the key to \nwhich is an Israeli-Palestinian settlement. \n The parameters for that settlement are well-\nknown, namely, the secure coexistence of two viable \nStates, as has already been widely accepted by both \npeoples; safe and recognized borders; and a fair \nsolution for refugees and for Jerusalem. All that still \nstands between Israelis and Palestinians and the peace \nto which they aspire is the deep-seated, mutual distrust \nof two peoples shattered by history and reeling from \ntheir sufferings and ordeals. Let us now stop extremists \nfrom laying down the law! Let us help peoples and \nleaders bold enough to seek peace! Like, before them, \nSadat and Begin, Rabin and Arafat! Before this \nAssembly, I call on the world to commit itself to \nrestoring the conditions for confidence. \n The Quartet should meet shortly to start preparing \nan international conference. I propose that the \nconference define in advance the guarantees that we \nare prepared to provide to the parties as soon as they \nreach an agreement. I also propose that the conference \npave the way for a new future in the Middle East \nthrough a regional framework for collective security, \neconomic integration and dialogue among cultures. \n Building peace means fighting terrorism. It \nmeans preventing proliferation. It means shouldering \nthe \u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d that we enshrined here \nlast year. \n International legality must prevail over the threats \nof proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In the \ncrisis with Iran, confidence has been impaired by the \nexistence of hidden programmes. We have extended \nambitious offers of cooperation to that major country, \n \n \n21 06-52731 \n \nprovided it restores confidence by suspending its \ncontentious activities. Dialogue must prevail. Let us \ntalk in order to enter into negotiations. \n Given the seriousness of what is at stake, the \ninternational community must stand firm and united. \nWe do not aim to call regimes into question. We aim to \nensure security in accordance with international law \nand with due regard for the sovereignty of all \ncountries. \n The \u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d \u2014 that was what \nwe affirmed here. In Darfur, millions of people are \nthreatened. A crime against humanity looms. \nBloodshed and turmoil are about to convulse the very \nheart of Africa again. \n France entreats the international community to \nward off a further humanitarian catastrophe. I solemnly \ncall on Sudan to accept the United Nations peace \nmission without delay. I call on the International \nCriminal Court to bring to justice those responsible for \nthese crimes. \n The time has come for the immense continent of \nAfrica, with its wealth of peoples and vibrant youth, \nwhich has embarked on the road to growth and reform, \nto find, at long last, a destiny worthy of it and of the \ncradle of humanity it represents. Humanity must be \nunited and there must be solidarity among its diverse \npeoples. Humanity needs, more than ever, a strong and \nrespected United Nations, the irreplaceable tool for \nshared sovereignty and responsibility. \n It is here that universal and sacred human rights \nmust be defended and protected. With the new Human \nRights Council and the International Criminal Court, \nthe United Nations returns to this primary vocation. Let \nus not disappoint the hopes of all those who love \nfreedom and justice. \n At a time when the world\u2019s wealth is increasing \nas never before, the separation between the rich and \npoor is becoming intolerable. From its inception, the \nUnited Nations has stood for the moral imperatives of \nfairness and solidarity. For this reason France wishes to \nsubmit to the United Nations the idea of innovative \ndevelopment financing mechanisms such as the \ninternational solidarity levy on airplane tickets, a \nmodern, pragmatic and experimental response to the \nneed to fight poverty and pandemics. In this spirit we \nwill be launching the International Drug Purchase \nFacility (UNITAID) initiative this afternoon. Let us \novercome selfishness and dogmatism and give the \ngenerous idea of a world united for human progress a \nchance. \n Finally, we all know that uncontrolled human \nactivity is bringing about a sort of slow collective \nsuicide. Disaster can only be averted if nations can \ncome together to support jointly agreed commitments. \nLet us create a United Nations for the environment, as \nthe expression of the world\u2019s ecological conscience and \nthe premier forum in which we take common action for \nfuture generations. France will host an international \nconference next year to bring together all those who \nwant to make progress on this project, which is crucial \nto the future of the planet. \n For 10 years now, a man has held high the torch \nof the United Nations and our universal values. Today, \nI wish to pay Kofi Annan the solemn and merited \nhonour of our profound admiration, of our respect and \nof our recognition. \n In a few weeks\u2019 time, we will appoint a new \nSecretary-General, who will be faced with immense \nchallenges. He will be able to count on the support of \nFrance, on its unswerving commitment to serving \npeace and justice, fraternity and progress. "

        "file_text": "Let me begin by \ncongratulating you, Madam President, on your \nappointment and assuring you of Ireland\u2019s full support \nfor the coming year.  \n This session of the General Assembly is the last \nunder the stewardship of Secretary-General Annan. I \nsalute his achievements and pay tribute to his \nleadership. He has carried out his heavy \nresponsibilities with wisdom and dignity. He can step \ndown from office fully satisfied with the service he has \ngiven to the peoples of the United Nations. I was proud \nlast year to act as one of his envoys in the vital reform \nagenda that he pioneered. \n Since the 2005 World Summit significant \nprogress has been made. The Peacebuilding \nCommission and the Human Rights Council have been \nestablished. But there is more to be done. Management \nreform is essential to revitalizing the Organization and \nensuring that the Secretariat can focus on the priorities \nwe all share. It is in the interest of us all \u2014 developed \nand developing countries alike \u2014 for it to succeed.  \n The continuing stalemate over the reform of the \nSecurity Council leaves it insufficiently representative \nof the world as it now is. That serves those who for \ntheir own reasons would challenge its legitimacy. This \nsituation cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely, so \nI welcome recent efforts to restart negotiations on \npossible options likely to win widespread support. \n The true test of the United Nations is, however, \nnot the efficiency of its structures, but the effectiveness \nof its actions. As the Secretary-General said last week, \nthree key challenges face the world: first, achieving \nsustainable development and the elimination of poverty \nand disease; secondly, the promotion of universal \nhuman rights and the rule of law; and, thirdly, ensuring \nsecurity, the prevention of conflict and the ending of \nwar.  \n In setting our own national aid target of meeting \nthe goal of 0.7 per cent of gross national income by \n2012, three years ahead of the European Union \nschedule, Ireland has put the Millennium Development \nGoals at the heart of its aid programme, with a special \nfocus on Africa, poverty reduction, tackling hunger, \nand HIV/AIDS. Last week we published a White Paper \nwhich sets out clearly and in detail how we aim to \nachieve our development objectives. Sustainable \ndevelopment must include addressing the immense \nglobal threat of climate change. Development is also \nthe key to addressing the enormous challenges posed \nby migration. \n Ireland is deeply committed to Africa. Despite its \nhuge problems, there are encouraging signs. We are \ninspired by the efforts to shape new institutions and \nmore cohesive societies in the aftermath of conflicts \nand cruelties in Sierra Leone, Burundi, Rwanda, \nLiberia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \nIreland is honoured to assist these and other countries \nthrough their difficult transitions, including through aid \nand the presence of our troops in the United Nations \n \n \n7 06-53609 \n \nMission in Liberia (UNMIL). We particularly support \nthe efforts of the African Union to bring peace and \nprosperity to Africa, helping to place Africans firmly in \ncontrol of their own destiny. \n However, not all of our collective efforts have \nmet with success. The suffering of the people of Darfur \nshames the world. There has been human tragedy there \non a massive scale, with the intimidation, rape and \nmurder of hundreds of thousands of innocents and the \ndisplacement of vast numbers from their homes. Just \ntwo months ago I visited a displacement camp myself, \nin Aboushouk in Darfur. I have seen how precarious \nthe lives of the people are there and also their \ndetermination to return home to a better future for \nthemselves and their children.  \n The people of Darfur have three essential needs. \nFirst, humanitarian aid must be delivered safely and \nwithout restrictions. Secondly, there must be an \ninternational peacekeeping force with a robust \nmandate. As set out by the Security Council, it should \nbe a well-equipped and substantial United Nations \nforce. I again appeal strongly to the Sudanese \nGovernment to agree to the deployment of such a \nforce, and to all those with influence on it to persuade \nit so to do. I cannot emphasize enough the urgency of \nthis. Pending the arrival of a United Nations force, the \nAfrican Union force \u2014 whose continuation I \nwelcome \u2014 should have the resources necessary to \nplay a more effective role. Thirdly, long-term security \ncan only be guaranteed by the full implementation of \nthe Darfur Peace Agreement. \n Last year the World Summit defined the \ninternational community\u2019s responsibility to protect \npopulations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic \ncleansing and crimes against humanity should national \nauthorities fail to do so. It would be a disgrace if this \nmajor advance became an exercise in empty rhetoric. \nThe Government of Sudan has fundamental \nresponsibility for the safety of its own people. The \ninternational community must find ways to persuade it \nto live up to that responsibility, if need be including \nfurther measures against it. We cannot indefinitely \nstand by and watch with horror from the sidelines. \n There can be no lasting development or security \nwithout full respect for human rights. The human rights \nof the most vulnerable are especially important. I \nstrongly welcome the recent conclusion of negotiations \non the Convention on the Rights of Persons with \nDisabilities. The Human Rights Council must, in \ndeveloping its new ways of working, build on the \nachievements of its predecessor. It must demonstrate \nthat it can provide strong leadership, particularly in \ndealing effectively with grave human rights abuses. \nThe human rights situation in Burma/Myanmar remains \nparticularly grave. I again call on the regime to move \ntowards democracy and to release all political \nprisoners, in particular Aung San Suu Kyi. \n The centrality of the United Nations to \ninternational peace and security is once again \nunderlined by the issues dominating the debate in the \nAssembly. The question is not whether the United \nNations is relevant, but, rather, whether it can respond \neffectively to all the situations which clamour for its \nattention. The Peacebuilding Commission adds an \nimportant new dimension. It must be properly \nresourced, and Ireland is pleased to be contributing \n\u20ac10 million to that fund. \n The single greatest challenge to international \npeace and security is the situation in the Middle East. \nThe dreadful events of recent months have again \nbrought before the eyes of the world the continuing \nsuffering being borne by the peoples of the region. \nFrustration at the long agony of the Palestinian people \ncreates and sharpens wider divisions across the world. \nA comprehensive settlement of the interrelated \nproblems of the region is more urgently required than \nat any time in the past 60 years.  \n In Lebanon there are signs of hope, but there is \nno room for complacency. Security Council resolution \n1701 (2006) offers a path to a stable peace, and good \nprogress is being made in its implementation. European \ncountries in particular have responded well to the call \nfor contributions to the United Nations Interim Force \nin Lebanon (UNIFIL) II. Ireland will very shortly be in \na position to offer its own contribution to that force.  \n But the conflict between the Israelis and the \nPalestinians will continue to generate surges of conflict \nacross the region until it is resolved. Any illusion that \nthere can be a unilateral or a military solution has \nsurely been shattered. This is a conflict about the \nsharing of space. The only solution lies in a negotiated \noutcome. It is time for a major international effort to \nlaunch serious negotiations for a settlement \u2014 the \nestablishment of two sovereign democratic States \nliving together in peace and security. \n  \n \n06-53609 8 \n \n But to achieve peace there must be partners for \npeace. Ireland strongly supports the continuing efforts \nof President Abbas to create a national unity \ngovernment committed to the peace process and \nreflecting the Quartet principles. If he succeeds the \ninternational community must be generous and creative \nin response. Israel\u2019s absolute right to exist in peace and \nsecurity should be unchallenged. But, not least in its \nown interests, Israel must engage seriously and openly \nwith the Palestinians. It must cease all activities, in \nparticular the expansion of settlements, which are \nagainst international law and which make a lasting \npeace harder to attain. \n Ireland shares the Secretary-General\u2019s continuing \noutrage at the failure of last year\u2019s Summit to make \nany reference to nuclear disarmament. It is simply folly \nto let this issue languish. In the next review of the \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \nwe must do better. Ireland will work with like-minded \npartners to keep this issue on the agenda. Dr. Hans Blix \nhas already offered us a range of fresh and practical \nideas from which we can draw. The world is right to \ninsist on nuclear non-proliferation, but progress on \ndisarmament would make that insistence still more \ncompelling. Ireland, with its European partners, wants \nto see a diplomatic solution to the issue of Iran\u2019s \nnuclear programme, and we call on Iran to respond \npositively and rapidly to the wide-ranging proposals \nthat have been put to it. We equally support efforts to \nrenew the six-party talks on North Korea. \n The world must also act to reduce the supply of \nsmall arms and light weapons, which facilitate the \nescalation of local tensions into all-out conflicts. \nIreland strongly supports the negotiation of an arms \ntrade treaty. The disturbing reports from Lebanon also \nhighlight the need for further restrictions on the use of \ncluster bombs. \n On behalf of my Government, I pay particular \ntribute to Prime Minister Blair for his commitment and \ndedication to the peace process in Northern Ireland. He \nand my Prime Minister, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, have \ndevoted almost 10 years to driving it forward. Credit is \nalso due to the parties in Northern Ireland, who, \ndespite deep and abiding divisions reaching far back \ninto our history, are committed to addressing those \ndivisions purely within the political arena.  \n In Northern Ireland the word has finally replaced \nthe weapon as the way to resolve disputes. The \nNorthern Ireland peace process is now at an important \njuncture. We have worked hard to implement the 1998 \nGood Friday Agreement, but its capstone, a sustained \npower-sharing government, has for far too long proved \nelusive. The British and Irish Governments are \ndemanding that the political parties there agree by \n24 November this year to form such a government. \nThat deadline is real, reflecting our shared belief that \ndrift and uncertainty on the political front are not in the \ninterests of peace and reconciliation, and cannot be \nsustained. \n If the parties fail to agree, both Governments will \ndeepen their cooperation to deliver improvements in \npeoples\u2019 daily lives. But that is not our preferred \noption. We want local politicians in Northern Ireland \ntaking responsibility for the issues that concern their \npeople. The conditions for a power-sharing government \nhave never been more favourable. It is what the people \nwant. Inevitably it will happen some time. But if it \ndoes not happen in November the opportunity may not \ncome again for a considerable time. \n The great Irish writer George Bernard Shaw once \nsaid that making war was hard, but that making peace \nwas infinitely more arduous. Peacebuilding and \nconflict resolution are ultimately about psychology \u2014 \naddressing fears, perceptions and beliefs about the past \nand about the future. A conflict does not begin when \nthe trigger is pulled; it begins in the heart and mind of \nthe person who pulls that trigger. We have learned this \nat first hand in Ireland. We know the pain and \ndifficulty of dealing with the legacy of division. But \nover the years we have learned some things about \nbuilding peace, encouraging reconciliation, improving \nhuman rights and the rule of law and addressing social \nand economic alienation.  \n Our own national experience reinforces what we \nhave learned at the United Nations and from our \ndevelopment programme. That is why we have just \nestablished in Ireland an Irish Conflict Analysis and \nResolution Support Unit. It will seek to harness our \nexperience and help to share it. It will work closely \nwith the Peacebuilding Commission. We do not \noverestimate what we can do, nor do we underestimate \nthe difficulty of peacebuilding, but I genuinely believe \nthat our track record means that we can bring \nsomething distinctive to the table. I would encourage \nall countries represented here to find ways of sharing \ntheir own experience and exchanging and enhancing \n \n \n9 06-53609 \n \nour collective knowledge of how to prevent and resolve \nconflict. \n Since the establishment of the United Nations the \nworld has been spared a repeat of the catastrophic \nglobal conflicts that made the first half of the twentieth \ncentury the bloodiest era in human history. But the \nchallenges ahead of us remain grave and pressing. \nWhen we met here last year we agreed an ambitious \nagenda for the twenty-first century. We have made \nprogress since then, but there is still so much to do. We \nmust now focus on making our ambitions real. "

        "file_text": "I would like to \nexpress my sincere congratulations, and those of my \ndelegation, to you, Madam President, on your election \nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \nsession. \n My delegation wishes to commend Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan for the leadership and courage he \nhas displayed during his tenure at the helm of the \nSecretariat. Secretary-General Annan assumed office at \na time when the United Nations was facing severe \ncriticism and its very relevance was being questioned. \nHis dedication and professionalism have contributed \nsignificantly towards enhancing the efficiency and \ncredibility of our Organization and its Secretariat. His \ninitiatives to promote the development agenda of the \nUnited Nations have been of crucial importance, in \nparticular to Africa. As the Secretary-General prepares \nto relinquish his office in the next few weeks, we thank \nhim warmly and wish him well in all his future \nendeavours. \n Since our last annual meeting, several ongoing \nconflicts have remained unresolved and new ones have \nemerged. The situation in the Middle East continues to \nbe a major preoccupation for the international \ncommunity. While violence is still raging in Iraq and \npeace still eludes the Palestinian people, the recent \nconflict involving Israel and Hizbullah has not only \ncost so many innocent lives but has also resulted in the \nwanton destruction of vital infrastructure within \nLebanon. Now that the guns have finally fallen silent, \nwe urge all concerned in this unnecessary month-long \nconflict to abide fully by the provisions of Security \nCouncil resolution 1701 (2006) and to settle their \noutstanding issues through United Nations mediation. \n There seems to be a unanimous view in the world \ntoday that the Middle East remains the epicentre of \nglobal insecurity and instability. Global peace and \nprosperity will remain an elusive dream unless and \nuntil the international community stretches all its \ndiplomatic sinews to create conditions for lasting peace \nin the region. Mauritius strongly believes that a fair \nand final peace settlement in the Israel-Palestine \nconflict rests in the early implementation of the \nexisting road map that has been endorsed by the \ninternational community. \n We reiterate our support for an independent and \nsovereign Palestinian State existing side by side with \nthe State of Israel. \n The situation in Darfur remains a matter of \nserious concern not only to us in Africa but to the \ninternational community as a whole. We are confident \nthat Security Council resolution 1706 (2006) has the \ncapacity to lend strong support to the efforts already \ndeployed by the African Union to put an end to that \ncrisis. \n Terrorism continues to be a major disruption for \npeace and development. The recent adoption of \nresolution 60/288 \u2014 the United Nations Global \nCounter-Terrorism Strategy \u2014 sends a clear message \nthat terrorism is unacceptable no matter who commits \nit, no matter where it takes place and no matter what \nthe reason. Mauritius unreservedly condemns terrorism \nin all its forms and manifestations. But let us not \ndelude ourselves into thinking that we can address the \nscourge of terrorism without addressing its root causes. \n Fifteen years ago, the Assembly initiated \ndiscussions on the reform of the Security Council. \nNumerous proposals have been made since then. Each \nproposal, whatever its merits, has met determined \nresistance from some members defending their own \nnarrowly defined interests. It is unacceptable that the \nAfrican and Latin America and the Caribbean regions \nare not represented in the permanent membership of \nthe Security Council. It is also morally and politically \nunacceptable that the world\u2019s most populous \ndemocracy is still denied a seat as a permanent member \nof the Council. It is imperative that a reformed Security \n \n \n13 06-53317 \n \nCouncil should include India among its permanent \nmembers. \n The establishment of the Human Rights Council \nconstitutes a significant step in the implementation of \nour common reform agenda. That new organ of the \nGeneral Assembly should perform efficiently so as to \nestablish itself as a credible universal institution for the \npromotion and protection of human rights. My \ndelegation would like to thank the General Assembly \nfor electing Mauritius as one of the 47 members of the \nCouncil at the elections held earlier this year. We will \ndo our utmost for the universal promotion and \nprotection of human rights in accordance with the \nmandate conferred upon the Council by the Assembly. \n The multilateral approach to disarmament has \nbeen on the back burner for some time. It is \nunfortunate that little progress has been achieved in \nrespect of strengthening the foundations of the Treaty \non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. \nMauritius supports the aim of the total elimination of \nall nuclear weapons on the basis of a comprehensive \nand non-discriminatory disarmament regime. \n My delegation wishes to draw the attention of the \nAssembly to the fact that, 38 years after its \nindependence, Mauritius has still not been able to \nexercise its sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago, \nincluding Diego Garcia. The Archipelago was excised \nfrom the territory of Mauritius by the former colonial \nPower to be subsequently used for military purposes \nbehind our back, in total disregard of Assembly \nresolutions 1514 (XV) and 2066 (XX). That exercise \nalso involved the shameful displacement of the \ninhabitants of the Chagos from their homeland, thereby \ndenying them their fundamental human rights. \nInternational law must prevail, as must respect for the \nsovereignty of all countries. We therefore call once \nagain on the United Kingdom to pursue constructive \ndialogue in earnest with my Government, with a view \nto enabling Mauritius to exercise its sovereignty over \nthe Chagos Archipelago. \n We view positively the visit jointly organized by \nthe Governments of Mauritius and of the United \nKingdom in April this year to enable the former \ninhabitants of the Chagos to visit the Archipelago for \nthe first time since their displacement to pay respects at \ntheir relatives\u2019 graves on the Archipelago. \n We hope to continue meaningful dialogue with \nFrance on the question of sovereignty over Tromelin, \ngiven our excellent bilateral relations. We view the \nagreement reached in Paris at the expert level in \nJanuary 2006 to set up a French-Mauritian joint \ncommission for the co-management of the Tromelin \nzone as a positive first step. \n My delegation is pleased that you, Madam \nPresident, have chosen development as the focus of \nyour presidency. We welcome your proposal to \ndedicate this session of the General Assembly to the \nissue of implementing a global partnership for \ndevelopment. The biggest dilemma is how to secure the \nnecessary financial flows towards developing \ncountries. We call on the international community to \nhonour commitments made to developing countries \nconcerning official development assistance. Equally, \nwe hope for conditions that will allow better access to \nthe markets of the more affluent countries to generate \nresources for development. \n Our meeting today coincides with the end of the \nFirst United Nations Decade for the Eradication of \nPoverty. The progress towards achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals, including halving the \nproportion of people suffering extreme poverty by \n2015, has been below expectations, as reflected in \nhuman development indices. Poverty continues to \nprevail from generation to generation in many parts of \nthe world, in particular in the sub-Saharan region. The \npolitical, social and economic marginalization or \nexclusion of poor people very often undermines the \nstability and development potential of many countries. \n Does that imply that conventional solutions have \nfailed because they do not really address the root \ncauses of persistent poverty? Or is it because instead of \ntaking a bottom-up approach we have adopted a top-\ndown approach, relying too much on the trickle-down \neffect? The fight against poverty is becoming more and \nmore complex. Only a holistic and comprehensive \napproach will allow us to push back the frontier of the \nmisery, conflict and hardship that afflict such a \nsizeable proportion of humankind. \n In our own subregion, we have initiated measures \nto address the issue of poverty in earnest. At the recent \nSouthern African Development Community (SADC) \nsummit, held in Lesotho in August, we debated the \nissue of poverty alleviation. An extraordinary SADC \nsummit on regional integration, scheduled for next \nmonth, will discuss a road map on poverty and \ndevelopment. \n  \n \n06-53317 14 \n \n There is an almost symbiotic relationship \nbetween poverty and ill health, with disease often \nfurther impoverishing the poor and impacting \nnegatively on the stock of scarce human capital in poor \ncountries. Apart from malaria, HIV/AIDS and \ntuberculosis \u2014 and now avian flu \u2014 which are getting \na lot of attention, other vector-borne diseases have \nmanifested themselves, and are growing in an \nexponential manner.  \n The alarming rate with which the HIV/AIDS \npandemic is ravaging our populations has far-reaching \nimplications for our socio-economic development. It \nimpedes our global efforts to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. We appreciate the political \ncommitment of the international community to combat \nthis scourge so as to bring solace to those already \nafflicted and to prevent the further spread of the \ndisease. Mauritius promptly and spontaneously joined \nthe innovative financing mechanism initiated by France \nand Brazil to introduce a solidarity levy on air tickets \nto fight HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. The \nlaunching this week of UNITAID \u2014 the International \nDrug Purchase Facility \u2014 has aroused new hopes. \n Climate change is yet another serious threat. For \ntoo long, some of us have conveniently decided to \nignore it. In fact, well-known institutions and eminent \nscientists have reached the conclusion that climate \nchange may be one of the biggest threats to \nhumankind. Of particular concern is the impact of \nglobal warming on certain vectors of disease, leading \nto their proliferation. It is estimated that in Africa, for \nexample, we may witness many more millions of cases \nof malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases as a \nresult of climate change. \n Mauritius is fully committed to the successful \nconclusion of the Doha Development Round. We look \nforward to a multilateral trading system that will be \nfair and equitable and that provides for the specific \nsituations and needs of small and vulnerable \neconomies. The recommendations of the World Trade \nOrganization Aid for Trade Task Force, submitted in \nJuly 2006, should be implemented urgently to enable \ncountries, particularly those with small and vulnerable \neconomies, to access resources to undertake adjustment \nand restructuring programmes and to enhance their \ntrade infrastructure and supply capacities. \n Globalization does not seem to be living up to its \npromises. We should not allow it to be a process that \nunleashes the potential of the few while suppressing \nthe aspirations of the many. It will have to be tamed \ninto a development process that will provide an \nopportunity to every single citizen of the world to \nachieve his or her full potential. \n Mauritius, like so many small island economies \nwith meagre resource bases, has had to adjust to the \nrealities and challenges of increasing liberalization and \nglobal economic competition \u2014 especially the erosion \nof trade preferences, which have so far helped in \naddressing our inherent disadvantages. My \nGovernment has embarked upon a programme of bold \nand wide-ranging economic reforms to adapt to the \nnew realities of the international economy. \n At the end of the day, what is the ultimate role \nthat each of us here has as heads of State and heads of \nGovernment? We have been entrusted with the destiny \nof our people and of our countries. We are but \ntemporary custodians of the welfare of our people and \nthat of humankind. If we really want to build better \nsocieties and a better world for future generations, we \nmust indeed make a significant dent on the issue of \npoverty. We must channel significant resources and \nenergy towards reaching the Millennium Development \nGoals. And we must ensure that we create stable and \nsustainable societies.  \n To achieve that, we can no longer afford to \nsimply keep talking about noble intentions. We must \nwalk the walk, not just talk the talk. Each one of us \nhere has the responsibility to implement national \npolicies that provide opportunities for those who have \nalways been deprived of their human dignity as a result \nof living perpetually on the margins of the socio-\neconomic mainstream. \n My Government is guided by the notion of \ncitizenship with dignity as a moral compass for action. \nWe believe that socio-economic justice is a \nfundamental pillar of human dignity. We are therefore \ndetermined to provide concrete opportunities to the \neconomically disenfranchised, in order to lift them out \nof the vortex of unjust economic inequalities. I have \nalways upheld the ideals of social justice. I have \ntherefore ensured that my Government dedicates no \nless than 12 per cent of our last national budget to an \nambitious empowerment programme. That programme \nis funded by State and non-State actors, thereby \nheralding a new partnership for development in my \ncountry. It will provide tangible avenues for the poor \n \n \n15 06-53317 \n \nand unskilled to equip themselves with the tools \nnecessary for them to join the economic mainstream. It \nalso seeks to create a new and flourishing class of \nentrepreneurs. That is one of the effective and concrete \nways by which we can truly ensure that we widen the \ncircle of opportunities. \n(spoke in French) \n Resolving the problems to which I have referred \nto a large extent requires openness, responsiveness, \ndialogue and solidarity. We in Mauritius have the good \nfortune of being situated in a major crossroads as far as \nphilosophies and religions are concerned. The history \nof the settlement of our islands has made that the case. \nWe are the children of several traditions. Our identity \nhas been shaped by various influences, from the East, \nWest, North and South. Numerous ethnic groups, \ncultures, religions and languages have been evolving in \nour territory, and we are endeavouring to ensure that \nthey enrich each other. We seek the commingling of \ncultures, which provides us Mauritians with a complex \nand dynamic identity. We believe that that is the best \nway to build a nation and to assert ourselves. As one \ncan imagine, that situation requires ongoing vigilance \non the part of political, religious and media leaders as \nwell as rigorous and transparent application of the \nprinciples of justice.  \n We would like to believe that the experience of \nMauritius can be applied at the international level. We \nalso hope that dialogue between peoples and \ncommunities and communication between heads of \nState and Government will bring about the end of the \ndisagreements that are today undermining our world, \nwhich is the only one we have.

        "file_text": "Allow me to express the warmest congratulations of \nthe delegation of Niger to Ms. Al-Khalifa upon her \nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-first session. She is the third woman in the \nhistory of the United Nations called upon to take up \nthis office, and her election is richly symbolic on \nseveral counts. In her we have a seasoned diplomat of \ngreat competence and sure qualities that augur well for \nthe positive results that we will see under her \npresidency.  \n We also congratulate her predecessor, Mr. Jan \nEliasson, President of the Assembly at its sixtieth \nsession, for the remarkable work he accomplished \nduring his presidency.  \n Finally, allow me to reiterate the congratulations \nof the Republic of Niger to the Secretary-General, \nMr. Kofi Annan, who will be leaving the Organization \nafter ten years of intense activity, ingenious initiatives \nand staunch devotion. There can be no doubt that the \nvigour he brought to the Organization, the important \nreforms he launched and the new bodies that have been \ncreated during his mandate stand out in the annals of \nthe United Nations. \n More than ever before, the international \ncommunity is confronted by challenges to peace and \nsecurity. Despite noteworthy progress in this area and \ndespite multiple efforts, horror and despair continue to \nreach us from certain areas of conflict.  \n Some positive developments have certainly been \nrecorded in Africa in the area of conflict resolution, \nnotably in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, \nLiberia and Sierra Leone. Those developments remind \nus that we need an operational and effective decision-\nmaking mechanism so that we can quickly deal with \nany threat to international peace and security, \nirrespective of its complexity. Only substantial reform \nof the Security Council, along with revitalization of the \nGeneral Assembly, can enhance legitimacy and \neffectiveness, especially if it takes into account \nequitable representation accompanied by an \nimprovement in working methods. For Niger, only \nequitable enlargement of the Security Council can \nimprove its functioning and make it possible to \nestablish the bases for decisions that will be acceptable \nto and accepted by everyone. \n In C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, the United Nations must \nredouble its efforts to reach a definition of a new \ntransition in consultation with all parties, ECOWAS \nand the African Union so that the matter can be dealt \nwith calmly after 31 October 2006. \n The situation in the Middle East \u2014 especially in \nLebanon, which has held the attention of the \ninternational community over recent weeks \u2014 proves, \nif proof were needed, that the United Nations is still \nthe prime forum for promoting negotiations on \npreserving international peace and security. \n The same degree of attention should be paid to \nthe resurgence of the Israeli-Palestinian crisis. The \nestablishment of a comprehensive peace in the \nsubregion involves going back to the negotiating table \nin order to make progress in implementing the road \nmap towards the creation of a sovereign and viable \nPalestinian State, in conformity with the relevant \nresolutions of the United Nations. \n With regard to Western Sahara, the United \nNations must pursue and intensify its efforts with a \nview to finding a definitive solution to the question. As \nto Jammu and Kashmir, the Niger encourages India and \nPakistan to continue with their talks. \n Another serious threat to international peace and \nsecurity is posed by nuclear weapons. In this regard, \nthe Niger would like to reaffirm its support for the \n  \n \n06-53005 48 \n \ncommitments made within the framework of the Treaty \non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), \nwhile recognizing the importance and the usefulness of \nresearch for peaceful purposes. However, the \nincreasingly marked division which this issue \nengenders requires an appropriate response in the \nongoing quest for consensus through the current \nnegotiations.  \n The Niger welcomes the establishment of the \nPeacebuilding Commission, which is one of the first \nconcrete achievements to emerge from the World \nSummit. We should give it our full support so that it \ncan provide effective assistance to countries in post-\nconflict situations. In my capacity as a representative \nof the country currently holding the chairmanship of \nthe Economic Community of West African States \n(ECOWAS), a region which is still ravaged by \nconflicts, I am happy to report on the progress that has \nbeen made in our subregion in the area of conflict \nprevention and resolution. Sierra Leone, Liberia and \nGuinea-Bissau, which I referred to just now, today are \ncountries in a post-conflict situation. They therefore \nneed to be effectively helped in order to consolidate \ntheir return to peace and to create the conditions for an \nenvironment that is favourable to their economic and \nsocial development. In order to maintain the ban on the \ncirculation of illegal weapons, which, as every one \nknows, have stoked many conflicts in our subregion, \nthe heads of State and Government of the member \ncountries of ECOWAS have decided to convert the \nmoratorium on small arms and light weapons into a \nlegally binding convention, in order to strengthen the \ncapacity of Member States to fight effectively against \nthis scourge. \n The Niger also welcomes the establishment of the \nnew Human Rights Council. This body merits the \napproval and backing of all Member States, which \nshould fully cooperate with it. For its part, the Niger \nundertakes to do everything in its power to participate \neffectively in its activities. \n In another area, the United Nations Central \nEmergency Response Fund (CERF) will certainly help \nus to exercise greater control over such scourges as \nfood insecurity and cyclical droughts, which have \ncaused so much damage and have plunged a substantial \nportion of the populations of some West African \ncountries into an unacceptably precarious situation \nowing to the slow reaction of the international \ncommunity. For the Niger, as well as for other \ncountries of the subregion, the human development \nindex would have been higher if development \ncooperation had seen qualitative and quantitative \nincreases in line with the commitments contained in \nthe Monterrey Consensus with regard to official \ndevelopment assistance (ODA) and other initiatives on \nthe subject. \n The debates at the current session are particularly \nimportant for the Niger because they come one year \nafter the historic Summit of 2005. The High-level \nPlenary Meeting which prepared the above Summit \nalready stressed the importance of partnerships, \nparticularly with respect to achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). In this regard, the central \ntheme of the sixty-first session, namely, the \nimplementation of a global partnership for \ndevelopment, is very appropriate because it illustrates \nperfectly the need and the importance of a multilateral \nand collective approach in order to find the most \nappropriate solutions to the current problems in the \nworld.  \n I would like here, on behalf of the Niger, to \ncommend the initiatives taken to find new sources of \nfunding in order to provide an initial response to the \ninsufficiency of resources noted during the evaluation \nof the 2005 Summit. I would particularly like to \nwelcome the International Drug Purchase Facility \n(UNITAID) initiative launched by the French \nGovernment to finance the fight against AIDS and \nmalaria. The Niger is one of the first 17 countries to \nhave endorsed the tax on airline tickets. \n It is also within the framework of this kind of \npartnership that the positive nature of international \nmigration could be stressed and could be included in \nour search for appropriate responses, which would take \ninto account the concerns of the countries of origin, \ntransit and destination. \n I would like to end my statement by pointing out \nthat, for the Niger, the effective implementation of the \nactions planned to deal with global issues must be \nmultilateral in character and must assign a central role \nto the United Nations system. \n And here I would reiterate the faith that the Niger \nhas in the United Nations, not only because the \nOrganization remains the most appropriate framework \nand the most relevant multilateral mechanism with \nwhich to promote development, but also because it \npursues the noble causes which it embodies. The \n \n \n49 06-53005 \n \nUnited Nations therefore must be revitalized in order to \nbe in a position to satisfy the deepest aspirations of the \npeoples and nations of the world, particularly those \nthat are weakest.

I am \nfully confident that your vast experience will guide the \nwork of the Assembly to a successful conclusion. \nAllow me to pay tribute to your predecessor, His \nExcellency Mr. Jan Eliasson, for the manner in which \nhe conducted the work of the previous session. \n I would also like to commend Mr. Kofi Annan, \nthe Secretary-General, for his efforts to equip this \n \n \n27 06-53317 \n \nOrganization with the appropriate tools to properly \nrespond to world events and challenges. \n This session is convening in difficult times and \namid important changes. Despite the successes \nachieved by the United Nations in establishing the \nHuman Rights Council, the Peacebuilding Commission \nand the Central Emergency Response Fund, numerous \ndangers and challenges still lie ahead. The situation in \nthe occupied Palestinian territories remains very tense \nas a result of Israel\u2019s actions, including killing, \nterrorizing, collective punishment, the demolition of \nhomes and other practices that run counter to the noble \nobjectives of the peace process. There are requirements \nand obligations that must be fulfilled in order to reach \na peaceful settlement between Israel and the \nPalestinians. \n Hence, we express our support for the call by the \nLeague of Arab States to refer the entire Arab-Israeli \nconflict to the Security Council, in order to find a \nlasting, comprehensive and peaceful settlement. That \ncall reaffirms the commitment of the Arab States to \npeace \u2014 as a strategic option and a basis for peaceful \ncoexistence between the Arab countries and the State \nof Israel as envisioned in the Arab peace initiative. \n The world has recently witnessed the tragedy of \nthe Israeli invasion of Lebanon, with the resulting \ndestruction and huge loss of life and property. We \naffirm our support to the brotherly Lebanese people in \nthat brutal crisis. We welcome the adoption by the \nSecurity Council of its resolution 1701 (2006) and \nhope that it will enhance security and stability in the \nregion. The positive response to the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s call for greater participation in the enhanced \nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) is \na clear indication of the support the international \ncommunity accords to Lebanon. \n My country is deeply concerned by the \ndeteriorating security situation and the internal \nviolence in Iraq. We call upon all parties in Iraq to give \nprecedence to their national interests and to support \ntheir National Government in accordance with a \nconciliatory political programme that would look after \nthe interests of all segments of the Iraqi people. \n We welcome the conclusion of the Abuja Peace \nAgreement between the Sudanese Government and the \nrebel groups, and we hope that it will stop further \nbloodshed among the brotherly Sudanese people. We \nlook forward to seeing a positive and effective role by \nthe Security Council in the Sudan, in cooperation with \nthe Sudanese Government. \n Although the African continent enjoys immense \nnatural and human resources and potential, it is \nplagued by conflict, the spread of disease and poverty. \nWhile we support the efforts of the African \nGovernments to deal with those difficulties, we also \ncall upon the international community to do all it can \nto help the African countries to reinforce their efforts. \n Environment is the common heritage of all \nmankind. Conserving the environment is therefore a \nduty shared by all countries, and we hope that during \nthis session further light will be shed on environmental \nissues. Aware of the importance of striking a balance \nbetween achieving development, on the one hand, and \nprotecting the environment, on the other, my country \nhas launched a national strategy aimed at protecting the \nenvironment that incorporates environmental \nconsiderations at all stages of planning.  \n We are making concerted efforts to protect our \nenvironment, our territorial waters and our economic \nareas from pollution. We are also cooperating with a \nnumber of national, regional and international \norganizations and agencies in protecting our natural \nresources and preventing their deterioration. \n All are agreed that globalization has positive \naspects. However, it has been noted that in some cases \nglobalization has hurt the interests of developing \ncountries. For that reason, my country supports the call \nfor the establishment of a world trade order that is \nnon-discriminatory and multidisciplinary. Such a \nframework would seek to achieve a balanced outcome \nin the decisions of the Doha Round of negotiations. It \nis our hope that current negotiations on multilateral \ntrade issues, especially those related to agriculture and \nthe service sector, will achieve success in a way that \nserves the interests and rights of all States equally. \n We look forward to seeing the international \nfinancial, economic and trade institutions play a \npositive role in bridging the growth gap between \ndeveloped and developing countries. We urge those \ninstitutions to provide support to developing countries \nto help them to attract investment funds and to gain \naccess to global markets for their exports, without any \nrestrictions or protectionist measures. In this regard, \nwe welcome the offer of the brotherly State of Qatar to \nhost the International Conference on Financing for \nDevelopment in 2007. \n  \n \n06-53317 28 \n \n My country supports the call for a review of the \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \n(NPT) with a view to closing loopholes in the Treaty \nand guaranteeing the right of all States parties to obtain \nnuclear technology for peaceful purposes. While we \nfavour a Middle East region free from all weapons of \nmass destruction, we also call on all parties to the \ncurrent talks on the Iranian nuclear issue to keep the \ndoor open to negotiation, since direct dialogue remains \nthe best way of reaching a suitable compromise on \npending contested issues. \n An effective international counter-terrorism \nstrategy requires a balance to be struck between \nsecurity considerations and respect for human rights \nconventions. It is really not wise to endanger the \nsecurity and stability of States on the ground of \ncombating terrorism, nor is it fair to subject innocent \npeople to injustice or mistreatment on the basis of mere \nsuspicion. \n Bearing in mind that human beings are the centre \nand focus of development, my country has designed \npolicies aimed at the self-fulfilment of Omani citizens \nand the development of their potential. Social welfare \nprogrammes for individuals with special needs are a \nkey element in the rehabilitation of those groups, so \nthat they can participate in society alongside other \ncitizens. In cooperation with the International Labour \nOrganization, my country has also adopted a \nrehabilitation strategy focusing on local communities. \n Emphasizing the comprehensive nature of the \ndevelopment process, my country has devoted special \nattention to the role of women by encouraging them to \nparticipate in development. We have introduced a draft \nnational strategy for the advancement of women, which \nis the result of cooperation between governmental \nbodies and civil society organizations.  \n The Sultanate of Oman takes pride in its \nachievements in the area of childcare. Because of the \nimportance of childhood in securing out investment in \nhuman resources, children are given priority in our \ncomprehensive development programme. Our national \ncommittee for child protection and welfare was \nestablished by Royal Decree No. 71 of 1997. \n Today, more than ever before, we need an \neffective United Nations that is able to shoulder its \nresponsibility for the maintenance of international \npeace and security. That can be achieved only through \nconcerted efforts and political will on the part of \nMember States, which will enable the Organization to \ncarry out its mission and responsibilities in the best \npossible manner.

        "file_text": "Considerable \nprogress has been made in implementing the specific \nset of actions to ensure peace, development and human \nrights that was agreed upon by more than 150 heads of \n  \n \n06-53005 20 \n \nState or Government at last year\u2019s World Summit. The \nPeacebuilding Commission, the Human Rights \nCouncil, the Central Emergency Response Fund, the \nUnited Nations Democracy Fund, the United Nations \nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy and other \nachievements speak for themselves. \n However, we cannot afford to be complacent \nabout what we have achieved so far. Redoubled efforts \nought to be made to ensure that people in every corner \nof the world feel the benefits of development in their \neveryday lives. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in his \nannual report on the work of the Organization, \nobserves that  \n \u201cThe words of 2005 have yet to have a direct \nimpact on the lives of the poor people they are \nmeant to help. Nor have they produced the \nimplementation breakthroughs required to \nachieve the Millennium Development Goals\u201d. \n(A/61/1, para. 27)  \nThat conclusion is sad, but true. \n My delegation therefore welcomes the most \ntimely initiative of the presidency to focus our \nattention at this session of the General Assembly on the \nimplementation of the global partnership for \ndevelopment. The global partnership for development \nwas framed as Millennium Development Goal (MDG) \n8 and thus cannot be divorced from other development \ngoals and objectives.  \n In our view, the global partnership for \ndevelopment means a global compact between \ndeveloped and developing States. It is the \nresponsibility of developing countries to formulate and \nimplement sound policies to ensure their sustainable \neconomic and social development and, to that end, to \nmobilize domestic resources. For the developed \ncountries, it entails an obligation to support such \nefforts through the provision of development financing, \nincluding official development assistance (ODA), in a \ntimely and sufficient manner and to ensure increased \nmarket access for developing countries. Mongolia, for \none, takes its responsibilities seriously and is \ncommitted to its development objectives. \n Allow me to describe the policies and specific \nactions taken by my country to implement the MDGs, \nas well as my views on the need to build partnerships \nto achieve them. First, Mongolia attaches particular \nimportance to its implementation of the MDGs. Our \nfirst progress report was discussed at both the Cabinet \nand parliamentary levels, resulting in parliament\u2019s \nadoption in April last year of a resolution \ninstitutionalizing Mongolia\u2019s MDGs. Thus, the Goals \nhave been mainstreamed into the guidelines for the \ncountry\u2019s economic and social development, and the \nfunds necessary to meet the individual goals are \nreflected in the annual State budget. \n Secondly, to honour its commitment made in the \n2005 World Summit Outcome Document (resolution \n60/1), Mongolia is developing an MDG-based \ncomprehensive development strategy and plans to \nsubmit the first draft to parliament during its autumn \nsession. The active participation of political parties, \ncivil society and the private sector in that undertaking \nwill ensure the sustainable implementation of the \nnational development strategy over the years. \n Thirdly, the adoption of an additional, ninth, \nMillennium Development Goal (MDG) \u2014 on the \npromotion of human rights, fostering democratic \ngovernance and combating corruption \u2014 was an \ninnovative step that reflected the indissoluble link \nbetween development, good governance, human rights \nand democracy in our national policy. Within the \nframework of working towards meeting that goal, the \nparliament recently passed a new law against \ncorruption, thereby creating a legal environment to \nremove the shackles that that phenomenon imposes on \ndevelopment. In accordance with the new law, a new \nanti-corruption body is to be set up to deal with raising \npublic awareness and to address ways to prevent and \nuncover corruption, investigate cases of corruption and \naudit the financial and income declarations of public \nofficials. \n Fourthly, the Government of National Unity, \nwhich was formed early this year, is undertaking a host \nof quick-impact projects on poverty reduction and \nincome-generation in the implementation of its MDGs, \nin order that the benefits of the social security policy \ncan reach various strata of the population. Allow me to \ncite a few examples.  \n Salaries in the public sector have been raised by \n33 per cent, and the minimum wage by 30 percent. A \nmonthly allowance is being provided to every one of \nthe nearly 1 million children in Mongolia, which \naccounts for almost half of the entire population. \nMarried couples and new-born children are provided \nfinancial support on a one-time basis. Mothers with \n \n \n21 06-53005 \n \nfive or more children and older persons have seen \nconsiderable increases in their monthly allowances and \npensions. In collaboration with the private sector, this \nacademic year my Government introduced a free \nschool-meal programme for elementary school \nchildren. The launching of all those quick-impact \ninitiatives will contribute to our efforts to reduce \npoverty and achieve the MDGs. \n Fifthly, on the policy level, my Government is \nplacing particular emphasis on the human development \ndimension of the MDGs, including in such areas as \neducation and health. For example, a programme on \nthe theme of \u201cA healthy Mongolian\u201d, which is to be \nimplemented between 2006 and 2008, will provide for \nmedical check-ups and diagnosis and carry out surveys \nof the prevalent illnesses among the population over  \n15 years of age. The programme will also include \npreventive measures and treatment. Furthermore, the \nimplementation of our education master plan for the \nperiod 2006-2015, will improve access to education \nand the quality and competitiveness of our national \neducation system, ultimately advancing the level of \nhuman development. The plan will also contribute to \nthe goal of increasing employment by means of \ndeveloping human resources in a way that corresponds \nto the economic structure of the country and meets the \ndemands of the labour market.  \n In addition, on the initiative of my Government, \namendments have been made to the tax code that aim \nat easing the overall tax burden, thereby creating a \nfavourable business environment, promoting greater \neconomic growth and generating new jobs. \n Although Mongolia is poised to achieve most of \nits MDGs by 2015 in the areas of education, gender, \nchild and maternal health and combating various \ndiseases, the goals of halving poverty and ensuring \nenvironmental sustainability continue to be a source of \nconcern. It goes without saying that, like many other \ndeveloping countries, Mongolia will not be able to \nachieve those goals on its own. Genuine partnership \nand effective cooperation between all stakeholders \u2014 \nincluding bilateral and multilateral donors, \ninternational financial organizations and the private \nsector \u2014 is therefore required in order to substantially \nreduce poverty and promote development in the \ndeveloping world.  \n The quality of aid should also be improved \nthrough the tailoring of foreign grants and loans to the \nimplementation needs of the MDGs and MDG-based \nnational development strategies. That improvement \nshould also be achieved by providing more predictable \nand multi-year aid flows, addressing weaknesses in \ninstitutional capacity and harmonizing the distribution \nof aid with the priorities of recipient countries, in \naccordance with the principles set out in the Paris \nDeclaration on Aid Effectiveness. \n Mongolia is a landlocked developing country \ndependent on a few export commodities. We are \ntherefore highly susceptible to fluctuations in the \nworld\u2019s commodity and energy markets. I believe that \nthe establishment of commodity-price stabilization \nmechanisms and anti-shock facilities could make a \ntangible contribution to poverty reduction measures in \nlow-income commodity-dependent countries. At the \nsame time, trade and investment are among the driving \nforces of development. The World Trade Organization \nDoha Development Round of negotiations should \ntherefore be revived, with a view to creating a more \nfavourable and just trade regime that involves market \naccess and trade and industrial capacity-building \nassistance for developing countries, particularly for \neconomically vulnerable States. For its part, Mongolia \nis preparing to host a conference of trade ministers of \nlandlocked developing countries in 2007. \n I should also like to urge the international \ncommunity to focus its attention on the declaration \nadopted at the first-ever Meeting of the Heads of State \nor Government of Landlocked Developing Countries \nheld last week in Havana. That document reflects the \ncommon position of landlocked LDCs. Its full \nimplementation will be instrumental in assisting \nlandlocked LDCs, including Mongolia, as they carry \nout their development and poverty reduction efforts. \n Democracy plays an important role in bringing \nabout peace and development. Although democracy is \nrooted in the soil of individual societies, it has to be \nsupported through international cooperation. In its \ncapacity as Chair of the fifth International Conference \nof New or Restored Democracies, Mongolia has \nendeavoured to promote democratic values at the \ninternational level. We have undertaken a set of \nconcrete measures as follow-up to the fifth Conference, \nincluding the development of nationally owned \ndemocratic-governance indicators, a country \ninformation note and a national plan of action to \nconsolidate democracy. We have also introduced a \ntripartite structure in the Conference to include \n  \n \n06-53005 22 \n \nGovernments, parliaments and civil society. We have \nalso set up a friends-of-the-chair group and are fully \nutilizing the follow-up mechanism in New York. It is \ngratifying to note that the international follow-up \nconference to the fifth International Conference, which \nwas held in Ulaanba\u00e1tar last June, highly commended \nthe work done over the last three years. My country is \nprepared to report on its activities and to share its \naccomplishments and lessons learned with the greater \nmembership of the movement during the sixth \nInternational Conference of New or Restored \nDemocracies, which is to be held next month in Doha, \nQatar. \n This year marks the 800th anniversary of the \nestablishment of the great Mongol State \u2014 a \nremarkable date for my country. The General \nAssembly, in resolution 60/16, adopted last year, \ninvited Member States, international organizations and \nacademia to take an active part in the commemorative \nevents associated with the anniversary. I wish to \nexpress our great appreciation to all persons \u2014\nincluding people of Mongol ethnicity, academics and \nguests from various countries and organizations \u2014 for \ntheir active participation in the many international \nconferences organized in the spirit of that resolution. \nThose meetings included the international conference \non traditions of Mongolian statehood, the ninth \ninternational forum of Mongolists, the convention of \nworld Mongolians and the international workshop on \nthe traditions of nomads. I am also happy to \nacknowledge that more than 300 high-level guests \nrepresenting more than 30 States and Governments \nattended our national day ceremony \u2014 Naadam \u2014 \nwhich was the main commemorative event of the year. \n The year-round celebration of activities and \nevents are of particular importance, as they help us \nmodern-day Mongols heirs to statehood preserve and \ndevelop nomadic culture and traditions and to re-\nintroduce to the world our rich history and culture, \nalong with the progress and challenges facing us today. \n The sixty-first session has special meaning for us, \nas it coincides with the 45th anniversary of Mongolia\u2019s \nmembership in the world Organization. Our admission \nto the United Nations as a full-fledged Member, on  \n27 October 1961, was a historically important event for \nthe people of Mongolia. Over the years, our \ncooperation with the United Nations has expanded in \nterms of both content and scope. The Organization\u2019s \nsupport and assistance have been instrumental in \nhelping Mongolia meet its development goals, build \ncapacity and consolidate democracy. For its part, \nMongolia has all along supported the United Nations. \nWe have also striven to participate actively in its \nactivities and to make our contribution to the efforts of \nthe international community to find solutions to the \npressing issues facing the world. \n This autumn, we are about to select the next \nSecretary-General of the United Nations. Beginning in \n2007, that person will represent the international \ncommunity on the world stage. The next Secretary-\nGeneral must be someone who will effectively follow \nthrough with the bold initiatives and reform efforts \ncarried out by the current Secretary-General, Kofi \nAnnan, in the areas of peace, development and human \nrights. That person must also be committed to making \nthe world a better place, and possess strong managerial \nskills, vision and experience. In short, he or she must \nbe a genuine leader. I am convinced that such a person \ncan, and should, come from Asia, which is home to \nhalf of the world\u2019s population. \n Mongolia is prepared to participate actively in the \nwork of the United Nations and of other multilateral \norganizations and processes. We reaffirm our \ncommitment to the world Organization as a central \ncoordinating instrument of the common efforts of the \nworld\u2019s nations to maintain peace and promote \ndevelopment. "

        "file_text": "When I first \naddressed the Assembly from this rostrum, in 2003, I \nstressed the need for urgent and relentless action to \nfight the scourge of hunger and poverty in the world. \nThis is what we are doing in Brazil: we have combined \neconomic stability with social inclusion policies; the \nstandard of living of Brazilians has improved; \nemployment and income have grown; the purchasing \npower of the minimum wage has increased. Our \nresources are scarce, but even so we have achieved \nsurprising results. \n The family stipend at the core of our zero-hunger \nprogramme assures a basic income to over 11 million \nBrazilian families. Well-fed people can enhance their \ndignity, their health and their learning capacity. Putting \nresources into social programmes is not expenditure; it \nis investment. \n If we in Brazil have done so much with so little, \nimagine what could have been done on a global scale if \nthe fight against hunger and poverty had been a real \npriority for the international community. Where there is \nhunger, there is no hope; there is only desolation and \npain. Hunger nurtures violence and fanaticism. A world \nwhere people starve will never be safe. \n The sheer size of the task will not daunt us, \nespecially if we are not alone. All here know that some \n840 million human beings \u2014 nearly one out of seven \non the planet \u2014 do not have enough to eat. \n An additional $50 billion each year are needed to \nreach the Millennium Development Goals on time. The \ninternational community can afford it. On the positive \nside, think, just for instance, of the hundreds of billions \nof dollars invested to move forward with the full \nintegration of Eastern European countries into the \nEuropean Union. Then, on the other hand, think of the \ncost of wars and other conflicts. Everyone here is \naware that the second Gulf war has probably cost \nhundreds of billions of dollars to date. With much less \n  \n \n06-52731 6 \n \nwe could change the sad reality of a large portion of \nthe world\u2019s population. We could alleviate the plight of \nthose people and lift them out of destitution. We could \nsave millions of lives. \n However strong they are today, rich countries \nshould have no illusions: nobody is safe in a world of \ninjustice. War will never bring security; it can only \ngenerate horrors, bitterness, intolerance and \nfundamentalism and create damage associated with \nhegemonism. The poor must be given reasons to live, \nnot to kill or die. Humanity\u2019s greatness lies not in \nbellicosity, but in humanism, and there can be no true \nhumanism without respect for the other. \n There are, in fact, those who are different from \nus, but who are no less dignified, no less precious and \nno less entitled to the right to happiness, because we \nare all creatures of the same creator. \n There can be security only in a world where all \nhave the right to economic and social development. \nThe true path to peace is shared development. If we do \nnot want war to go global, justice must go global. \n That is why, with the serene conviction of a man \nwho has dedicated his life to fighting peacefully for the \nrights of working people, I say to the Assembly: the \nsearch for a new, fairer and more democratic world \norder is not only in the interests of poor or emerging \nnations; it is also \u2014 and perhaps to an even greater \nextent \u2014 in the interests of rich countries, so long as \nthey have eyes to see and ears to hear, so long as they \ndo not make the mistake of ignoring the haunting cry \nof the excluded. \n We have seen some progress in the past few \nyears. At the Summit of World Leaders in 2004, we \nlaunched the Action against Hunger and Poverty \ninitiative. Together, we were able to achieve strong \ninternational engagement around that issue. Our \ncollective efforts have begun to bear fruit. We are \nestablishing innovative mechanisms, such as a \nsolidarity levy on international air tickets. \n Hunger and disease walk hand in hand. \nTherefore, we have joined with other Governments in \nestablishing an International Drug Purchase Facility to \ncombat AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. That initiative \nwill provide new sources of funding and facilitate \naccess to medication at lower costs. We cannot shirk \nour responsibilities in this area. \n That is why I salute the leaders of vision who are \nengaged in this war: the war against the debasement of \nhuman beings and against hopelessness. That is the \nonly war in which final victory will mean a triumph for \nall of humanity. \n The fight against hunger and poverty is based on \nthe creation of a world order that gives priority to \nsocial and economic development. There will be \npermanent solutions to destitution only when poorer \ncountries can make progress through their own efforts. \n Once international trade is free and fair, it will be \na valuable tool for wealth creation, income distribution \nand job creation. It is essential that we break the bonds \nof protectionism. Subsidies granted by richer countries, \nparticularly in the area of agriculture, are oppressive \nshackles that limit progress and doom poor countries to \nbackwardness. Time and again, I must repeat that, \nwhile trade-distorting support in developed countries \namount to the outrageous sum of $1 billion a day, 900 \nmillion people get by on less than $1 a day in poor and \ndeveloping countries. That situation is politically and \nmorally untenable. \n The only thing worse than inaction stemming \nfrom ignorance is neglect born of accommodation. The \nold geography of international trade must be \nprofoundly reshaped. Brazil, together with its partners \nin the Group of Twenty (G-20), is engaged in that task. \nThe creation of the G-20 has changed the dynamics of \nnegotiations at the World Trade Organization (WTO): \nuntil recently, developing countries played only \nperipheral roles in the most important negotiations. \n Eliminating the barriers that prevent poor \ncountries from developing is an ethical duty of the \ninternational community. It is also the best way to \nensure prosperity and security for all. \n Today, for the first time in the history of the \nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade/WTO system, \nthe word \u201cdevelopment\u201d appears in the title of a round \nof trade negotiations. However, the Doha Development \nAgenda, which will decide the future of the world trade \nsystem, is now in crisis. \n If they are successful, the WTO negotiations will \nhelp to pull many people out of extreme poverty. \nFarmers who cannot compete against multi-billion-\ndollar subsidies will at last have a chance to prosper. \nPoor African countries will finally be able to export \ntheir products. If the round fails, however, the fallout \n \n \n7 06-52731 \n \nwill extend far beyond trade. The credibility of the \nWTO system itself will be jeopardized, with negative \npolitical and social repercussions. Scourges such as \norganized crime, drug trafficking and terrorism will \nfind fertile ground in which to proliferate. \n I have called on world leaders to shoulder their \nresponsibilities. The importance attached to this issue \nat the most recent summit of the Group of Eight has \nnot yet produced practical results. Our generation has a \nunique opportunity to show the world that selfish \ninterests will not prevail over the common good. \nHistory will not forgive us if we miss that opportunity. \nFair trade, based on a solid consensus and on a \ntransparent WTO that is aware of the needs of \ndeveloping countries, is one of the pillars of the world \norder that we uphold. \n In the field of international peace and security, \nanother such pillar is the United Nations. Brazil is a \nstaunch supporter of international organizations as \nforums for cooperation and dialogue. There is no more \neffective way to bring States together, to keep the \npeace, to protect human rights, to promote sustainable \ndevelopment and to work out negotiated solutions to \ncommon problems. \n Conflicts such as that in the Middle East continue \nto challenge the authority of the United Nations. The \nrecent crisis in Lebanon exposed the Organization to a \ndangerous erosion of credibility. The effectiveness of \nthe United Nations is being seriously questioned. \nUnable to act when it is needed, the Security Council is \naccused of being lethargic. \n World public opinion is impatient in the face of \nsuch incomprehensible difficulties. The deaths of \ninnocent civilians \u2014 including women and children \u2014 \nhave shocked all of us. In Brazil, millions of Arabs and \nJews live together in harmony. Thus, Brazil\u2019s interest \nin the Middle East stems from a profound objective \nsocial reality in our own country. \n Apart from the countries directly involved, \nMiddle Eastern issues have always been addressed \nexclusively by the major Powers. So far, they have \nfound no solution. Thus, we might ask: is it not time to \nconvene a broad-based conference under United \nNations auspices, with the participation of countries of \nthe region and others that could make a contribution on \nthe basis of their successful experiences in living \npeacefully despite differences? \n Brazil believes in dialogue. For that reason, we \nheld a summit of South American and Arab countries in \n2005. We also have good relations with Israel, whose \nbirth as a State came about when a Brazilian, Oswaldo \nAranha, was the President of the General Assembly. \nConflicts among nations are not resolved only with \nmoney and weapons; ideas, values and feelings also \nhave their place, particularly when they are based on \nreal-life experiences. \n More than ever before, the authority of the United \nNations needs to be strengthened. We have already \nmade significant progress through the administrative \nreform process and the establishment of both the \nHuman Rights Council and the Peacebuilding \nCommission. But the task will remain irreparably \nincomplete without changes in the Security Council, \nthe body responsible for overseeing issues related to \npeace. \n Together with the other members of the Group of \nFour on Security Council reform, Brazil believes that \nany expansion of the Council must envisage the \nadmission of developing countries as permanent \nmembers. That would make the Council more \ndemocratic, legitimate and representative. The great \nmajority of Member States agree with that view and \nrecognize the urgency of this matter. \n We cannot deal with new problems using \noutdated structures. Sooner or later, we must open the \nway to democratizing international decision-making \nbodies. As the Secretary-General has said, we travel \naround the world preaching democracy to others; we \nmust now apply democracy to ourselves and show that \nthere is genuine representation in the political bodies \nof the United Nations. \n South America is a priority for Brazilian foreign \npolicy. Our region is our home. We are expanding the \nCommon Market of the South (MERCOSUR) and \nstrengthening the South American Community of \nNations. The future of Brazil is linked to that of its \nneighbours. A strong and united South America will \ncontribute to the integration of Latin America and the \nCaribbean. \n We also feel connected to the African continent \nby historical and cultural ties. As the country with the \nsecond-largest black population in the world, we are \ncommitted to sharing Africa\u2019s challenges and its \ndestiny. But regional matters are only part of the global \nproblems we face. \n  \n \n06-52731 8 \n \n The fight against hunger and poverty, the \nbreakdown of the Doha round and the stalemate in the \nMiddle East are interconnected issues. The appropriate \nhandling of these matters requires trust in negotiated \nsolutions at the multilateral level. \n This trust has now been shaken. This is extremely \nserious. The world order that it is our task to build \nmust be based on justice and respect for international \nlaw. That is the only way to achieve peace, \ndevelopment and genuine democratic coexistence \nwithin the community of nations. \n There is no lack of resources. What is missing is \nthe political will to use them where they can make a \ndifference. They can then turn despair into joy and find \na reason to live. "

        "file_text": "My delegation has already congratulated \nthe President on her assumption of her high office. I \nwould like to reaffirm our confidence in her ability to \naccomplish her task and to lead our deliberations to a \nsuccessful conclusion. I also wish to express our \ngratitude to her predecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, Foreign \nMinister of Sweden, for his conduct of the work of the \nGeneral Assembly during the previous session. Lastly, \nwe are indebted to the Secretary-General for his efforts \nto advance the process of reform at the United Nations \nand fulfilment of the purposes and principles of its \nCharter. \n Last year our efforts were focused on reform. \nSome progress has now been made, and we have \nestablished the Human Rights Council and the \nPeacebuilding Commission. However, there is still a \nlong way to go, since any reform that does not include \nthe Security Council and enhance the role of the \nGeneral Assembly will be of little value and will not \nmeet the expectations of our peoples. \n Unfortunately, our quest for reform of the \nSecurity Council has met with further encroachment by \nthe Council on the functions and powers with which \nthe General Assembly was endowed by the Charter. It \nis therefore incumbent on the Assembly to take \nimmediate action to prevent the Council from \ninfringing further on its authority. \n We also take this opportunity to call on the \npermanent members of the Security Council not to \nhamper the reform efforts but rather to promote a \ngenuine reform of the Organization. Such reform \nshould place the power of decision-making in the \nhands of all members of the Assembly, a forum in \nwhich all States are entitled to vote. The Security \nCouncil will then become an executive tool for \nimplementing the decisions of the Assembly. We can \nthus remedy the current situation in which the Council \nhas become a domineering and inequitable body, \napplying double standards, lacking democracy and \nopen to abuse of the veto.  \n History bears witness to the fact that the Council \nhas never achieved peace and security in the world. On \nthe contrary, it has served as a tool for aggression and \nwars and for the curtailment of peace mechanisms. \nConsequently, it is the General Assembly, in which all \nthe peoples of the world are represented, that should \ntake decisions on peace and war, and the power to \napply Chapter VII of the Charter should be vested \nsolely in the Assembly. The Security Council, with its \nlimited membership, cannot be entrusted with such \nmomentous decisions. \n If we fail to agree on such a change, we must find \na new formula for granting permanent membership of \nthe Council. Permanent membership should be \nconferred on geographical groups rather than specific \ncountries. We therefore demand that the African Union \nbecome a permanent member of the Security Council, \nas Africa is the only continent without a permanent seat \non the Council. \n More than three decades ago, Libya called for \nabolition of the veto. It submitted draft resolutions on \nthis subject at the thirty-fourth session of the General \nAssembly and the six following sessions. Libya holds \nthat this prerogative of the permanent members is the \ngreatest of the obstacles preventing the Council from \nfulfilling its mandate. It therefore renews its call for \nabolition of the veto and urges the Assembly to take \nsteps to restrict use of the veto until it is finally \nabolished. Within the framework of the current \nconsultations on reform of the Council, we would like \nto reaffirm Libya\u2019s adherence to the common African \nposition issued by the Fifth African Union Summit, \nheld in Sirte, Libya, on 4 and 5 July 2005, and later \nconfirmed by the Extraordinary Summit of the African \nUnion, held in Addis Ababa on 4 August 2005. \n Maintenance of international peace and security \nis a noble goal of the United Nations. Undoubtedly, \ngeneral and complete disarmament, starting with \nweapons of mass destruction, constitutes the essential \ncomponent for achievement of this goal, which, \nhowever, will remain beyond reach unless all Member \nStates cooperate in good faith and in a fully transparent \nmanner. Libya has voluntarily abandoned all its \nprogrammes related to weapons of mass destruction \nand has expressed the hope that all States in possession \nof weapons of mass destruction or programmes for \nsuch weapons will follow its example. \n It is important not to confuse weapons of mass \ndestruction and nuclear non-proliferation with \nprogrammes for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. \nUnder international law, all States have the right to \nconduct research and develop their scientific \ncapabilities for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. \n  \n \n06-53341 24 \n \nLibya strongly rejects the use of double standards \nwhen dealing with this issue and the practice of \ndiscrimination between States with respect to nuclear \nnon-proliferation. \n The establishment of the Peacebuilding \nCommission is an important step in promoting peace in \ncountries emerging from conflict. We hope to see soon \nthe achievements of this new body in Africa, where the \nAfrican Union has been able, with the assistance of the \ninternational community, to achieve peace in several \nAfrican countries. African peoples look forward to the \nassistance of the United Nations in the consolidation of \npeace in order to implement development programmes \nand combat poverty, disease and illiteracy. \n Terrorism is a phenomenon that threatens \ninternational peace and security. Such a threat cannot \nbe countered by the action of a single State or group of \nStates. Furthermore, it is a problem that cannot be \nresolved through attribution to a particular religion or \nnationality. It is also shameful and unacceptable to \ndescribe the legitimate struggle of a people against \nforeign occupation as an act of terrorism. \n Libya was among the first States that called for \ncoordination of international efforts against \ninternational terrorism. Fifteen years ago it called for a \nspecial session of the General Assembly to study this \nphenomenon and develop measures to combat it and \neradicate its root causes. It is high time to respond to \nthat call so that we can coordinate our efforts, under \nthe auspices of the United Nations, to study this \nphenomenon and reach a clear definition of terrorism \nthat distinguishes between terrorism and the legitimate \nstruggle of peoples for self-determination and \nindependence. \n The change of the Human Rights Commission \ninto the Human Rights Council reflects the great \nattention the international community gives to \nenforcing human rights and guaranteeing basic \nfreedoms. We hope that the inception of this Council\u2019s \nwork will constitute a beginning towards addressing \nthe issues impartially and non-discriminately, free from \nselectivity and double standards. We hope that human \nrights issues will not be used as a means of pressure \nagainst small nations. We emphasize that attempts by \nsome States to use protection of human rights as a \npretext to interfere in the internal affairs of other States \nwill only lead to the destabilization of peace and \nsecurity, causing more problems rather than solving \noutstanding ones. \n Sustainable development is a major challenge \nfacing developing countries. It is incumbent upon the \nUnited Nations to establish an international partnership \nfor development that aims to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, based on the activation of \ndialogue between North and South. All this should be \ndone within the framework of respect for sovereignty, \nequality and the sharing of benefits, guaranteeing the \nachievement of the agreed goal of a 0.7 per cent \nallocation of the gross national product of developed \ncountries as development assistance to developing \ncountries. Furthermore, such a partnership should \nguarantee the appropriate application of all principles \nof free multilateral trade and the enforcement of all \nmeasures related to special and preferential treatment \nfor developing countries, within the framework of \nWorld Trade Organization, including facilitating the \naccession of developing countries to that organization. \n Countries with a colonial past bear the greatest \nresponsibility for assisting developing countries as \ncompensation for the damage caused them during the \ncolonial period. The big Powers that waged wars on the \nterritories of developing countries must bear \nresponsibility for demining and removal of explosive \nremnants left in those countries. They should begin \nimmediately to provide maps and the necessary \ntechnical equipment for the rehabilitation of the \naffected lands in some of the developing countries. \n The massacres and repression that are committed \nby Israeli occupation forces in occupied Palestine \nagainst the Palestinian people and the flagrant \nviolations of human rights confirm that the so-called \npeace process is but a mirage that will not yield any \nresults, particularly given the inability of the Security \nCouncil to take any action to protect the Palestinian \npeople and to compel the occupation force to respect \nits commitments and stop its aggression and crimes \nagainst the Palestinian people. Libya therefore \nreiterates its emphasis that any proposed solutions that \nseek to impose a fait accompli will not resolve the \nPalestinian question, nor will they provide peace for \nthe area. The only solution that can achieve peace is to \nguarantee the return of all Palestinian refugees to their \nhomes and to establish a democratic State on the land \nof historical Palestine, in which Arabs and Jews live on \nequal footing, similar to South Africa, where blacks \nand whites manage to coexist after decades of conflict \n \n \n25 06-53341 \n \nand bloodshed. Unless that is achieved, the region will \ncontinue to live in a state of conflict, in which no one \nwill enjoy any peace or security. \n The recent Israeli aggression against Lebanon and \nits targeting of the infrastructure and civilians there \nemphasize the need for urgent action to compel the \noccupation forces to withdraw from the Sheba\u2019a farms \nand return them to Lebanon. Additionally, urgent \naction is needed regarding the withdrawal from and \nreturn to Syria of the occupied Syrian Golan. The \nIsraelis should be forced to pay reparations for the \ndamage they caused in Lebanon due to their brutal \naggression. \n The situation in brotherly Iraq is a cause of \nsadness and concern. It is, in fact, a catastrophe \nbrought about by an occupation that has left behind \ntens of thousands of dead and hundreds of thousands of \nwounded and handicapped persons. No matter how \noptimistic we may be, this catastrophic situation will \nnot end as long as there are occupation forces in the \ncountry, forces that feed divisions inside Iraqi society \nand encourage sectarianism in Government institutions. \nWe believe it is high time to stop the bloodshed in Iraq \nand find a solution to end the crisis so that all Iraqis \nmay enjoy peace and security, as well as their basic \nrights, in a unified and democratic Iraq enjoying full \nsovereignty and free from foreign forces and bases.

        "file_text": "I am greatly honoured to congratulate Her Excellency \nMs. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa of Bahrain upon her \nelection, the first woman from the Middle East, to \npreside over the work of the sixty-first session of the \nGeneral Assembly. She has the great responsibility to \npromote dialogue and harmony in the midst of the \nspread of conflict throughout the world. Likewise, we \nwish to pay tribute to the Secretary-General for his ten \nyears at the head of this Organization and for his \nimmense efforts to promote peacekeeping, security and \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. \n In the interest of continuity in the pursuit of \nUnited Nations reform, so notably promoted by the \nSecretary-General, our country wishes to reiterate its \nconviction that any reform must provide for greater \ndemocratization. We recognize the unquestionable \naccomplishments achieved during this process, such as \nthe creation of the Human Rights Council and the \nPeacebuilding Commission. Notwithstanding, reform \nwill be incomplete if it does not include reform of the \nSecurity Council, the body specifically responsible for \ntaking political decisions within this Organization. It is \nour conviction that the Security Council must be \nexpanded to make it more diverse and participatory, \nwith the aim of ensuring more equitable regional \nrepresentation and taking into account the regional and \nnational interests that prevail in today\u2019s world. There is \nalso a need for closer cooperation between the Security \nCouncil and other important United Nations bodies, \nsuch as the General Assembly and the Economic and \nSocial Council. \n One of the global issues of great concern to the \nDominican Republic and other parts of the world is \nthat of human security. We have observed with great \nconsternation that there has recently been an erosion of \ndomestic security in countries, leading to increased \nviolence and criminality. That situation has, without a \ndoubt, been fuelled by a combination of factors, among \nthem drug trafficking, the illicit traffic of arms, the \ntrafficking of persons and other criminal activities. In \naddressing this dramatic situation, which is driving \nsome populations to desperation, the Dominican \nRepublic remains vigilant in the continuous struggle \nand urges the international community to strengthen \ncontrol and prevention mechanisms that are needed to \nmeet these modern challenges that only increase fear \nand desperation among defenceless civilian \npopulations. \n Another issue of great importance for the \nprogress and well-being of our countries is the \nrelationship between migration and sustainable \n  \n \n06-52885 12 \n \ndevelopment, which constitutes the main item on the \nGeneral Assembly\u2019s agenda. We believe that the \nphenomenon of migration is positively linked to the \ncause of development. However, there is an inherent \ncontradiction in this modern, globalized world in that \nwe promote the free flow of merchandise, capital and \nservices, while we restrict the free flow of human \nlabour. \n Although each State exercises its sovereign right \nin implementing its migration policies, it is our \nconviction that the asymmetry currently existing \nbetween the free flow of production inputs and the \nrestricted flow of persons will have to cease to exist \nover time. According to the conservative voices in the \ndeveloped world, migration is a sort of invasion from \nthe underdeveloped countries to the most developed \ncountries. It is also considered to be an act of revenge \nfor the territorial expropriation that took place in the \ncolonial era and is seen as a threat to their current way \nof life. \n This is a fallacy. Migration is not about the poor \ninvading the developed countries, nor is it a threat to \ntheir current way of life. Frankly speaking, migration is \none of the historical means used by human beings and \nto which they continue to resort to in order to achieve \ngreater well-being, liberty and justice. As it will be \nimpossible to do away with this phenomenon, we can \nonly seek to control it in a legal and organized fashion, \nin a framework of respect for the human rights and \ndignity of all persons. In the meantime, many people \ncould benefit from this situation, through remittances, \nthe creation of networks of contacts and cooperation, \ncapacity-building in human resources, technology \ntransfer and diverse forms of collaboration and \nexchange. \n In another regard, the serious events that recently \ntook place in the Middle East have filled us with alarm \nand consternation. They are a dramatic reminder that \ntensions affecting the peace of entire regions still \npersist. As with other conflicts, the dispute between \nIsrael and its neighbours can be resolved only through \ndialogue and the good offices of the United Nations, \nwhich recently achieved the cessation of hostilities \nbetween the two disputing parties. We are confident \nthat a definitive peace will prevail in this region and \nallow the development of enhanced levels of \nunderstanding, tolerance, and co-existence among its \ninhabitants. \n The Dominican Republic maintains its interest in \nparticipating in the promotion of peacebuilding and \nconflict resolution. We reiterate our deep commitment \nto the activities and objectives of the United Nations \nInternational Research and Training Institute for the \nAdvancement of Women (INSTRAW). We consider \nthem suitable for the advancement and dignity of all \nthe women of the world and, in particular, the women \nof countries such as the Dominican Republic. As the \nhost country, we warmly appreciate the support of \nMember States to INSTRAW. \n The Dominican Republic is deeply committed to \nre-establishing stability in Haiti, and we applaud the \nrecent decision of the Security Council to extend the \nmandate of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in \nHaiti (MINUSTAH) for six months. The Dominican \nRepublic has special interest that there be an increase \nof international cooperation aimed at preserving the \npace of the reconstruction process of this sister nation. \nWith regard to our two countries, our warm relations \nare also expressed through the Dominican-Haitian Joint \nCommission, a forum which our Governments are \nreviving because we recognize it as the most \nappropriate mechanism for discussion and for reaching \nagreements on many topics of shared concern.  \n In conclusion, we wish to see the United Nations \nrenew and strengthen itself with a view to playing a \nmore active, dynamic and effective role \u2014 one that \nwould guarantee the realization of the values and \nprinciples enshrined in the San Francisco Charter, so as \nto ensure that peace on Earth will become the daily \nform of existence among human beings.

        "file_text": "Allow me to \nextend to you, Madam President, our sincere \ncongratulations on your assumption of the Presidency \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-first session and to \nexpress our full confidence in your ability to guide the \nsession successfully. \n Let me also express our appreciation to your \npredecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, for his leadership during \nthe sixtieth session. \n My delegation\u2019s appreciation also goes to the \nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his selfless \n \n \n15 06-53958 \n \ncommitment and devotion to the objectives of the \nUnited Nations, in general, and for his contributions, \nthrough various initiatives, to the efforts of reforming \nour Organization and for his dedication to their \npractical implementation, in particular. \n In our view, one of the key accomplishments of \nthe international community in recent years is the \nagreement on the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs). It is imperative that we all commit to \nbuilding stronger partnerships to achieve these noble \ngoals and targets. In this regard, we are cognizant of \nthe fact that each country is responsible for its \ndevelopment. It should also be equally recognized that, \nfor those countries at the early stage of economic \ndevelopment, there is a need for stronger support from \nthe international community if they are to meet the \nMDGs.  \n For low-income countries, there is nothing more \nimportant than a partnership that is predictable, \nconsistent and based on mutual obligations defined in \nadvance. The long-awaited opening up of international \ntrade, especially through the elimination of agricultural \nsubsidies, should also be expedited.  \n On our part, we have intensified our efforts to \nimprove the socio-economic conditions of Ethiopia. \nToday, in the decade and a half since the dictatorship \nwas swept out of our country, our socio-economic \nprogress has been substantial. We have succeeded in \nchannelling our limited resources into capacity-\nbuilding and infrastructure programmes serving the \nentire country. We have opened up new universities \nand technical institutions of higher learning, expanded \nprimary health-care services and built roads, airports, \npower plants, transmission and telecommunication \nfacilities and services, among others. As attractive \nopportunities have become more apparent, domestic \nand foreign investment has grown. \n In this regard, I would like to highlight some of \nthe achievements recorded so far. In the past three \nfiscal years, the Ethiopian economy has grown by an \naverage of 9.5 per cent annually. Over the same period, \nour export trade has grown by 28.5 per cent per annum. \nOur primary school enrolment ratio has increased to 89 \nper cent from a mere 30 per cent in the early 1990s. In \norder to strengthen our capacity for development, we \nare building 13 public universities. In two to three \nyears, when these universities are fully operational, the \ntotal annual intake of public universities would \nincrease from the current 30,000 to 150,000 students. \nSimilar results have also been achieved in the health \nsector, where the Government is equally determined to \nenable rural people in Ethiopia to have adequate access \nto basic health care by 2010. \n Benefiting from the encouraging results of the \nfirst five year plan and the experience gained in its \nimplementation, the second five year plan, namely, the \nProgramme for Accelerated and Sustained \nDevelopment to End Poverty, was drawn up on a much \nwider and enhanced scale. The main objective of this \nlatest plan is to alleviate poverty by ensuring food \nsecurity and meeting the MDGs. \n As it carries out its development agenda, Ethiopia \nstrongly believes that the prevalence of peace and \nsecurity in the country and its region is an absolute \nnecessity. For this reason, Ethiopia will not allow its \ndispute with Eritrea to distract it from its focus on \ndevelopment, although that has been the main objective \nof Eritrea since the conflict began eight years ago. For \nthe last four years, Eritrea has been blaming Ethiopia \nfor its own aggression against us and for the current \nstalemate in the peace and demarcation process. In \nfact, now, the whole world is being blamed for \nEritrea\u2019s own failure and for its inability to behave like \na normal State. \n For the benefit of this Assembly, it would be \nfitting to place the conflict in the proper context and \nperspective for a better appreciation of the current \nimpasse in the peace process. It should be recalled that \nEritrea launched an unprovoked attack against Ethiopia \nin May 1998 in blatant disregard of international law, \nthereby igniting the war and leading to the present \ncrisis. In this respect, I wish to draw the Assembly\u2019s \nattention to the decision of the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims \nCommission regarding issues of liability in the war \nbetween the two countries.  \n In its decision, the Commission set forth, inter \nalia, the following conclusions. First, Eritrea is liable \nfor committing unprovoked aggression against \nEthiopia. The Commission stated that Eritrea violated \nArticle 2, paragraph 4, of the Charter of the United \nNations on 12 May 1998 and the days immediately \nfollowing when it resorted to armed force in attacking \nand occupying areas peacefully administered by \nEthiopia. Secondly, Eritrea is liable to compensate \nEthiopia for the damages caused by that violation of \ninternational law. Thirdly, the Commission rejected \n  \n \n06-53958 16 \n \nEritrea\u2019s argument that its recourse to force was \njustified, because some of the territory question was \nterritory to which Eritrea had a claim. \n The Commission\u2019s decision shows not only \nEritrea\u2019s warped understanding of international law but \nunambiguously confirms that Eritrea\u2019s illegal act \nconstituted aggression. \n Before Eritrea launched its aggression and during \nthe war and after, Ethiopia has shown its strong desire \nand willingness to resolve the conflict with Eritrea by \npeaceful means. It should be recalled that, in order to \ncreate conditions for a sustainable peace and in order \nto re-establish all-around cooperation between the two \ncountries, Ethiopia presented a five-point peace plan, \nwhich the international community, including the \nSecurity Council, had welcomed. However, the \nproposal was flatly rejected by Eritrea.  \n We have also cooperated fully with the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s Special Envoy. Furthermore, Ethiopia has \nwelcomed the peace initiative presented by the \nWitnesses to the Algiers Agreement, which is \nsupported by the Security Council and made the \nfollowing proposals. The current impasse should be \nresolved with the assistance of a neutral facilitator in \nthe demarcation process. Freedom of operations by the \nUnited Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea \n(UNMEE) should be restored, together with the \nsanctity of the Temporary Security Zone. The threat or \nuse of force should be eliminated. There should be \nnormalization of relations between the two countries. \nIn this connection, I would like to assure the \ninternational community that we shall continue to \npersevere in our search for a lasting peace. \n Ethiopia has on various occasions expressed its \nreadiness to demarcate the boundary, through dialogue, \nin accordance with the decision of the Boundary \nCommission, and has attended in good faith the \nmeetings convened by the Commission. It has also \nreaffirmed its readiness to normalize its relations with \nEritrea. Ethiopia has done so not because it is desperate \nfor closer relations with Eritrea, but rather because \nnormalization is critical for durable peace. But Eritrea \nwill have none of this. Why? Because Eritrea\u2019s \nstrategic goal is neither peace nor a peaceful common \nboundary. What it wants is interminable boundary \nproblems with Ethiopia.  \n The latest report of the Secretary-General on \nEthiopia and Eritrea, of 19 September (S/2006/749), \nand the report of the Boundary Commission annexed to \nit clearly indicate that the Commission\u2019s June and \nAugust meetings were cancelled because Eritrea \nrefused to attend. Eritrea has also issued ultimatums as \na condition for its cooperation with the Boundary \nCommission. I wish to underline here that Eritrea has \nno reason to be frustrated by the lack of the speedy \nimplementation of demarcation. Eritrea is the reason \nwhy the boundary between the two countries has still \nnot been demarcated. \n Eritrea\u2019s illegal and anti-peace stance is not \nlimited to issuing ultimatums. It has blatantly violated \nthe Algiers Agreement by threatening the use of force \nand has violated the integrity of the Temporary \nSecurity Zone by deploying its armed forces there. It \nhas tightened its blatant restrictions on the United \nNations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) and \nits personnel. The Secretary-General has reported time \nand again that Eritrea has not only prohibited the \nMission from carrying out its mandated tasks, but also \nengaged in a series of arrests and detentions of its \npersonnel. Those are naked violations of the Algiers \nAgreement, Security Council resolutions and the \nCharter. \n The way forward to break the current impasse in \nthe peace process is very clear. Eritrea needs to abide \nby the relevant Security Council resolutions and the \nAlgiers Agreement, withdraw its armed forces from the \nTemporary Security Zone and restore the Zone\u2019s \nintegrity and UNMEE\u2019s freedom of operation. It must \ndemonstrate its compliance with article 1 of the \nDecember 2000 Agreement by renouncing the use of \nforce to resolve the dispute between the two countries. \nIt should cooperate with the international community \nin its efforts aimed at resolving the dispute peacefully \nand through dialogue. Only when Eritrea decides to \ncooperate with those legal measures will we be able to \nbegin to resolve the dispute in accordance with \ninternational law.  \n Eritrea should behave as a responsible State and \nresolve any dispute through diplomatic means. Eritrea \nmust understand that that is its only option. Its \ncontinued, dangerous tactic of using brinkmanship \nagainst many actors in the international community is \nnot acceptable. \n Ethiopia shares a border of more than 2,000 \nkilometres with neighbouring Somalia and is home to \nabout 3.5 million Ethiopian Somalis. It is in the \n \n \n17 06-53958 \n \ninterests of Ethiopia that peace, stability and national \nharmony prevail in that country. It is precisely for that \nreason that we have spared no effort over the past 15 \nyears \u2014 working together with partners in the Inter-\nGovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and \nthe African Union (AU) \u2014 to help the Somalis to \nachieve peace and national reconciliation.  \n The Transitional Federal Government of Somalia \nis the product of the efforts made by Somalis \nthemselves, with the support of IGAD countries, the \nAU and the international community in general. That \nGovernment is now facing a major challenge from \nthose who have ambitions that have nothing to do with \nSomalia but everything to do with chaos, instability \nand terror. The international community would do itself \na great disservice if it failed to appreciate the \nimplications of what is currently happening in Somalia \nand did not respond in an appropriate manner.  \n Somalia is being dragged into the abyss by those \nwho are using religion as a cover to deny the people of \nSomalia peace and the opportunity to revive a nation \nthat has been in a state of collapse for 15 years now, \nmaking it possible for those who have no interest in \npeace and stability to thrive. The latest opportunistic \nmove in this regard was made by Eritrea, but it is \nbound to fail. IGAD and the AU are asking for political \nand diplomatic support so that the Transitional Federal \nGovernment can be in a position to contain those who \nare the agents not of love, but of disharmony \u2014 not of \npeace, but of war. That is not too much to ask of the \ninternational community.  \n Only when the Transitional Federal Government \nis in a position to protect itself from the internal and \nexternal enemies of peace will dialogue provide a \nsolution to the crisis in Somalia \u2014 a crisis that the \nextremists within the Islamic Courts Union hope will \nengulf the whole region. It is precisely for that reason \nthat the partial lifting of the arms embargo is so \ncritical. There are those who want to wish away the \ndanger in Somalia. There are, on the other hand, those \nwho want to benefit from the danger. It is obvious that \nthe latter group, to which Eritrea belongs, is taking \nadvantage of the naivety of the former. \n There should be no doubt that Ethiopia will \ncontinue to be a pillar of peace and stability in the \nHorn of Africa. That is Ethiopia\u2019s vocation, whether \nwith respect to the problem in Somalia or in connection \nwith the difficulty we have in ensuring that Eritrea \nchooses the peaceful path. Resort to force is never a \nbasis for sustainable peace. That is the philosophy that \nunderpins our policy towards Eritrea and towards the \ncrisis in Somalia. There is no better guarantee for \npeace and stability than the nurturing of mutual \nconfidence and trust, regardless of differences in \noutlook or in political or other values. This also \nexplains Ethiopia\u2019s legendary commitment to the \nUnited Nations and to its principles and purposes. As I \nconclude, therefore, I would like to reaffirm Ethiopia\u2019s \ndevotion to the United Nations and to the values of \ninterdependence, which the Organization embodies. "

I wish her \nevery success. \n I also want to express my appreciation to the \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixtieth \nsession, His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson. The World \nSummit Outcome (resolution 60/1), which addresses \nthe challenges of our time, was the joint product of our \nwork and his tireless efforts. His sound guidance \nenabled us to move forward on the pressing issues \nrelated to reform. The Peacebuilding Commission, the \nHuman Rights Council and the Global Counter-\nTerrorism Strategy are the hallmarks of those efforts.  \n In addition, it is my distinct pleasure to pay a \nheartfelt tribute to our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi \nAnnan. His name will continue to inspire us whenever \nwe think of his dedication to global peace and stability \nand his tireless reform efforts.  \n The hostilities and the outright destruction in \nLebanon tested the faith placed in the United Nations. \nIn the end, the resolve of Member States was \nmanifested. From the very beginning, Turkey was \nengaged in active diplomacy and took its place at the \nforefront of the international efforts to end the \nbloodshed. At the same time, we remained in close \ncontact with all the parties to the conflict. Throughout, \nwe provided humanitarian aid to the people of Lebanon \nand assisted in the rapid evacuation of some 10,000 \nforeign nationals. \n We supported the adoption of Security Council \nresolution 1701 (2006).

Yet, \ngiven the many challenges that remain, it is only a first \nstep towards bringing peace and stability to the region. \nWe have decided to contribute to the implementation of \nthe resolution, which is aimed at restoring the political \nsovereignty of the Lebanese Government. \n Indeed, we must try to seize the opportunity \nrepresented by resolution 1701 (2006). We hope that its \nspirit will be translated into a broader political \nperspective for the entire region. The tragic events in \nLebanon should have reconfirmed that unilateralism is \nnot the answer and that the use of force is not the \nsolution. Similarly, they revealed for all to see that the \nquestion of Palestine continues to lie at the core of the \nproblems in the Middle East.  \n This issue is not simply a conflict between two \ncountries. It is a problem for which everyone pays a \nheavy price \u2014 a problem that has huge ripple effects \non a global scale. Indeed, the continuation of this \nproblem is used to justify extremism around the world. \nTherefore, progress made towards a lasting peace in \nthe Middle East would have a positive impact on many \nother problems. \n We note that everyone has drawn lessons from \nwhat took place in Lebanon. Now, in the aftermath of \nthat tragedy, there is a different climate, conducive to a \nrenewed peace initiative. Now is the time to revive \nefforts to put the Middle East peace process back on \ntrack. We make a heartfelt appeal to all the parties and \nto the international community not to let this \nopportunity pass by. What we need now is strong and \ndetermined leadership that will resolutely follow the \npath towards peace.  \n Let us not forget that the growing sense of \ninjustice associated with the Middle East problem \ndeepens the rift in terms of cultural perceptions. We \ncannot permit events in the region to undermine the \nprospects of the cross-cultural harmony that we are \nworking so hard to achieve. We believe that better \nunderstanding among cultures is indispensable for \nglobal harmony. That is precisely why the Prime \nMinisters of Turkey and Spain co-sponsored the \nAlliance of Civilizations initiative, launched by the \nSecretary-General. The objective is to emphasize the \nelements that unite various societies around our \ncommon humanity. \n The High-level Group for the Alliance of \nCivilizations will soon submit a comprehensive report \nto the Secretary-General setting out concrete and \npractical measures to improve intercultural dialogue. \nThat is obviously what the world needs now. \nTherefore, we hope that the initiative will receive \nstrong and sincere support from Member States. \n Indeed, regardless of where we come from \u2014 \nwhether it be the East or the West \u2014 whatever faith we \nprofess and whatever tradition we represent, we must \nall act responsibly. In today\u2019s world, in which \ninformation travels at the speed of light, we must all \nrefrain from acts and statements that can be \nmisconstrued and can strengthen the hand of \nextremists. Likewise, our reactions must demonstrate \n  \n \n06-53323 8 \n \nsuch a sense of responsibility. Thus, we call upon \neveryone to act with common sense and to keep \nhumanity\u2019s best interests at heart. \n As we focus on the Middle East, we must not lose \nsight of Iraq. It is equally urgent that we build a \ndemocratic and prosperous Iraq that is whole and free \nfrom ethnic and sectarian violence. I should like to \nrecall that a staggering number of people have lost \ntheir lives as a result of violence. We must all help the \nIraqis to achieve a national consensus and to resolve \ntheir differences through dialogue and democratic \nprocesses. First and foremost, the Iraqis themselves \nmust work towards that end. \n Throughout the past year, terrorism has continued \nto claim innocent lives. There is a growing realization \nthat no degree of leniency can be extended to those \nwho commit acts of terror. There is no room for double \nstandards, and we can make no distinction between \nterrorists. At the same time, we must keep in mind that \nterrorism, an age-old method of coercion, has no deep \nlinks to any culture or religion. We should also be \ncautious not to associate any faith with terrorism. \n By voting in favour of the proposed United \nNations comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus \nproblem in the April 2004 referendum, Turkish \nCypriots responded positively to the expectations of \nthe international community. Notwithstanding the \nintensive and sincere efforts of the Secretary-General, \nthe Greek Cypriot side rejected that plan. Despite that \nrejection, the Turkish side remains committed to a just, \npeaceful and comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus \nquestion, based on the well-established parameters \ndetermined through the good offices mission of the \nSecretary-General. Turkey and the Turkish Republic of \nNorthern Cyprus continue to support strongly the \nSecretary-General\u2019s mission. Indeed, the United \nNations is the only sound platform that can help deliver \nlasting peace, cooperation and prosperity to all \ninhabitants of the island of Cyprus. The Turkish side \nstill maintains the hope that the Greek Cypriot leaders \nwill support the vision of a new partnership based on \npolitical equality with their Turkish Cypriot \ncounterparts. The Turkish Cypriots have already given \ntheir support to the 8 July agreement and their consent \nto the United Nations suggestions for implementing \nthat agreement in due course. There should be full-\nfledged negotiations on substantive issues between the \ntwo leaders of the island. Our proposal of 24 January \n2006 for the simultaneous lifting of all restrictions \nrelated to the island remains on the table. In this day \nand age, living under unjustly imposed restrictions \ndefies all reason. It is time for the Turkish Cypriots to \nintegrate into the global economy. We appeal to the \ninternational community to heed the call of the \nSecretary-General to end the current isolation of the \nTurkish Cypriots, which has no legal or moral basis. \n Turkey is close to the centre of most of the issues \nof concern to the international community, which \nnaturally figure prominently on my country\u2019s foreign \npolicy agenda. Our objective is to establish conditions \nfor a lasting peace and enhance cooperation for \nintegration in the greater region. In this context, our \nrelations with our neighbours continue to diversify. We \nbelieve that our good-neighbourly relations with \nGreece will enhance cooperation, stability and \nprosperity in the Balkans and the Eastern \nMediterranean. \n In a similar vein, we have prepared several \nregional initiatives. We take part in peacekeeping and \npolice missions around the world. These greater \nobjectives help explain our active diplomacy, primarily \nin regions such as the Balkans, the Middle East and the \nCaucasus surrounding Turkey. In all such instances, we \nwork to avert outright conflict and consolidate stability. \nWe try to put out the fires of discord and cultivate \nreconciliation. We are committed to political processes \nand diplomatic solutions and are in the forefront of \npost-conflict rehabilitation, reconstruction and \nassistance. \n The Balkans are passing through a profound \ntransformation. In order not to relive the pain and \nsuffering of the 1990s, we must vigilantly keep watch \nover peace. We must promote the building of viable \nState structures in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We must \nalso promote a peaceful transition in Kosovo. We \nwelcome Montenegro as a new Member of the United \nNations.  \n Frozen conflicts in the Caucasus also demand our \nurgent attention. Resolution of the Nagorny Karabakh \nconflict on the basis of Azerbaijan\u2019s territorial integrity \nis of vital importance for peace and prosperity in the \nregion. We would like to see this region become an \narea of prosperity based on cooperation. \n We will continue to support the political process \nand reconstruction effort in Afghanistan. In addition to \nour strong presence in the International Security \nAssistance Force, Turkey is establishing a provincial \n \n \n9 06-53323 \n \nreconstruction team in the Vardak province of \nAfghanistan. Turkey will continue to be active in the \nareas of health, education and development in \nAfghanistan.  \n On the Kashmir question, we continue to \nencourage the parties involved to work for a just and \nlasting solution to the problem through dialogue. \n We advocate reform at a time when transparency, \nthe rule of law, gender equality, good governance and \nsimilar common values can no longer be denied to \npeoples, especially in an age of globalized \ncommunications.  \n Turkey\u2019s efforts are not, of course, confined to its \nimmediate vicinity. Having consolidated our place \namong the largest economies of the world, we want to \nenrich and improve our relations with more distant \nregions. Our aim is to strengthen bilateral ties with \nAfrica, Latin America and the Caribbean, East Asia and \nthe Pacific. We are actively engaged in efforts to \nresolve the problems of the African continent, having \nestablished local offices of the Turkish International \nCooperation Agency in Addis Ababa and Khartoum to \nhelp coordinate this larger effort across the African \ncontinent. More branches will follow. Turkey has been \nrecognized by the World Food Programme as a major \ndonor of food to Africa. Turkey is also contributing to \nfive United Nations and two European Union missions \nin Africa. \n The fate of Africa is our common destiny, and we \ncannot remain indifferent to that continent\u2019s acute \nproblems. We must not let down Africa. We appeal to \nthe more fortunate to help that continent achieve its \ntrue potential.  \n After reviewing our activities within the United \nNations, we have selected a number of areas as a \npriority in our work. These are issues related to \ndevelopment, peacekeeping operations, the \nstrengthening of peacebuilding activities, humanitarian \nand relief operations, combating terrorism in all its \nforms and enhancing global energy security through \nthe creation of safe transportation routes.  \n Turkey firmly believes in the need for \ninternational cooperation to achieve environmentally \nfriendly and socially sustainable development. We \nmust better cater to the needs of the developing \ncountries, particularly in the field of poverty reduction, \neliminating infectious diseases, reducing infant \nmortality and improving maternal health. If we fail to \ncreate equal opportunities for women and provide \neducation for children, none of the above will ever be \nachieved. \n I am pleased to say that Turkey is becoming a \nmajor donor country. Last year, Turkish official \ndevelopment assistance reached US$ 600 million. This \nfigure does not reflect the contribution of the Turkish \nprivate sector, which contributes an almost equivalent \namount. In this regard, we will further increase our \ncontributions to the United Nations funds and \nprogrammes that serve the least developed countries, \nlandlocked developing countries and small island \ndeveloping States. \n The President returned to the Chair.  \n Over the past two years, we have been \ncampaigning for a seat on the Security Council for the \nterm 2009-2010. Turkey has not served on the Council \nsince 1961. This is an anomaly. We believe that, in the \nspirit of equitable rotation, our turn to be represented is \nlong overdue. Turkey\u2019s membership will enrich the \nwork of the Security Council in a singularly important \nmanner. We will bring our unique attributes to bear on \nthe work of the Council. Our membership will bring \nnew insights and perspectives at a time when we see \nthe United Nations becoming increasingly relevant in \nfulfilling the rightful hopes of humanity. "

        "file_text": "I \nam honoured and grateful to address the General \nAssembly at its sixty-first session, and in so doing I \njoin other Members in congratulating you, Madam, on \nyour historic assumption of the presidency of this body. \n \n \n5 06-53323 \n \nLet me assure you of my country\u2019s full support. We are \nconfident that under your leadership, the Organization \nwill be steered safely through the challenges ahead. I \nwould also like to pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. \nJan Eliasson, for his dedication and stewardship of the \nOrganization during the past year. \n Just recently, the Pacific island countries lost one \nof its leaders. The Federated States of Micronesia is \ndeeply saddened by the passing of King Tupou IV of \nthe Kingdom of Tonga. We express our profound \ncondolences to the people and the leaders of Tonga \nduring their period of national mourning and wish them \nwell in their transition to a new leadership. \n We are keenly aware of the remaining awesome \ntask of implementing measures to reform the \nOrganization. We are nonetheless encouraged by the \nsignificant achievements made so far since the \nadoption of the Outcome Document of the World \nSummit last year. The United Nations has made great \nstrides, for instance in constituting the Human Rights \nCouncil, in launching the Peacebuilding Commission \nand in adopting the resolution on implementing \ninternational development goals. \n Reform of the Security Council should remain a \nhigh-priority agenda item. My country would like to \nreiterate its position as expressed in previous years. We \nsupport a restructured Security Council that reflects the \ncurrent realities of international society. For the \nCouncil to be effective and its work meaningful, its \nworking methods should be improved and its \nmembership, both permanent and non-permanent, \nexpanded. We must give new impetus to the reform \nprocess and seek, with an open mind, new ways to \nachieve the institutional reform of the United Nations. \n The small island developing States in the Pacific \nsuch as my country, recognized as among the most \nvulnerable, stand to benefit from an efficient and \nrelevant United Nations. It is for that reason that we \nplace high hopes on the relevant reforms. We hope that \nsuch reforms will facilitate our achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) and other \ninternationally recognized commitments, which, if left \nto our own devices, we cannot reach, even with the \nbest of intentions and efforts. \n Thus, we are pleased with and grateful for the \ndecision to establish additional United Nations offices \nin our Pacific region, including in my country. Taken \nwithin the context of the overall reform of the \nOrganization, the presence of those offices is mutually \nbeneficial to the United Nations and to our peoples in \nmany ways, including through effective coordination in \nthe delivery of much-needed assistance and services. \n My country, with a large exclusive economic \nzone, attaches great importance to the sustainable \ndevelopment and conservation of our marine resources \nand ecosystem. Consistent with that priority, we have \njoined forces with some of our neighbouring States in \ncalling for an immediate moratorium and a total ban on \ndeep bottom trawl fishing. The Organization must not \nclose its eyes to activities that result in commercial \ngain for only a few at the expense of the integrity of \nthe ecosystem that supports the livelihood of our \npeople, especially those living in areas that are widely \nrecognized as vulnerable. We appeal to the \ninternational community to mobilize support to put an \nend to bottom trawl fishing and other activities that are \necologically destructive and unfriendly to the marine \necosystem. \n It is well established by the Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change (IPCC) and other highly \nrespected scientific organizations that the Earth\u2019s \nclimate is adversely changing due to our carbon \neconomy and the emission of greenhouse gases. Within \nthis decade alone, we have witnessed unprecedented \ndestruction caused by extreme weather events. The \nincreasing magnitude, intensity and frequency of \ntyphoons, hurricanes and other natural disasters, \nincluding the unprecedented melting and disappearance \nof glaciers, are directly linked to human activities. This \nobviously calls for a more robust post-Kyoto regime. \n As an island nation composed mostly of low-\nlying small islands with large coastal areas, the \nFederated States of Micronesia is vulnerable to the \nadverse impact of climate change. Exposed to the \neffects of extreme weather events, our livelihood and \ntraditions as an island people \u2014 in fact, our whole \ncivilization \u2014 are under greater threat than ever \nbefore. \n The sad irony is that those of us who contribute \nlittle to the causes of climate change and sea-level rise \nare the first in line to suffer the consequences. In the \nface of that reality, Micronesia will continue to speak \nout for concerted global action to mitigate the adverse \nimpact of climate change, taking into consideration the \nprinciple of common but differentiated responsibility. \n  \n \n06-53323 6 \n \n While adaptation measures require national \nactions, the \u201cpolluters pay\u201d principle should apply. \nTherefore, those who pollute should underwrite the \ncosts of adaptation, particularly for small island \ndeveloping States. \n Sustainable development remains a top priority \nfor small island developing States such as Micronesia, \nbut it cannot be achieved by us alone. Our development \nstill requires official development assistance from \nbilateral and multilateral donor partners alike. But \nofficial development assistance on its own is not \nsufficient. Ongoing propositions for active foreign \ndirect investment and effective development \npartnerships, among others, should be translated into \nconcrete action, as they are critical components of \nsustainable development. \n The small island developing States continue to \npin their hopes on the Mauritius Strategy as a blueprint \nfor their sustainable development. But what good is the \nStrategy if the support necessary to implement it is not \nforthcoming? The international community must \nprovide that support, which would include facilitation \nand improvement of access to existing resources and, \nwhere appropriate, allocation of dedicated financial \nresources. For the Mauritius Strategy to be effective \nand meaningful, it must be mainstreamed into all \nUnited Nations processes, including the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change process. \n In addition to the Mauritius Strategy, we support \nthe principles of the Information Society and the \nCommunity of Democracies as vital to our national \nprogress. In particular, we seek help in the formulation \nof our national plan on information and communication \ntechnologies and in access to broadband connectivity, \nwhich we believe will help overcome the obstacles to \nour development that result from the geographical \nconfiguration of our island country. \n Dependency on fossil fuel is an obstacle to our \nsustainable development. To mitigate that obstacle and \nprevent the perpetuation of this carbon economy, my \nGovernment has prioritized renewable energy as the \nway forward. I therefore reiterate the call made by \nmany small island developing States, including my \nown, for accelerated efforts in the development, \nutilization and distribution of renewable energy \ntechnologies to small island developing States. We will \ncontinue to look to the international community, \nincluding our development partners, to help ensure that \nsuch technologies are transferred and put in place \neffectively. \n Terrorism affects all countries, large and small, \nrich and poor. Micronesia condemns, in the strongest \nterms, terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. \nThe taking of innocent life is unambiguously \nunjustifiable, regardless of one\u2019s grievances. \n We therefore call once again on the United \nNations to do everything in its power to prevent \nterrorism and to mitigate its root causes. While we are \ndoing our best to uphold our responsibilities and \nobligations under the United Nations counter-terrorism \nresolutions, we need the assistance of the international \ncommunity to more effectively implement and carry on \nthe fight against this scourge. \n In that spirit, we would like to commend the \nefforts that resulted in the recent ceasefire in Lebanon. \nWe hope that the ceasefire will lead to a lasting peace \nfor the Israeli and Lebanese peoples. We also hope \nthat, by building on that momentum, the conflict \nbetween Israel and Palestine will be resolved. The \npeople of Israel have the right to live within secure, \nrecognized borders, free from the fear of terrorism. The \nPalestinian people have the right to have their own \nState and to coexist peacefully with their neighbours. \n Micronesia is concerned about the threats to \nregional stability and international peace and security \nposed by nuclear proliferation. We urge the \ninternational community to continue its efforts to \naddress that problem. \n In closing, I would like to pay tribute to our \noutgoing Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi \nAnnan, for his distinguished leadership and his decades \nof dedicated service to the Organization. My country \nexpresses to him our gratitude and best wishes. "

        "file_text": "Let me begin by offering my \ncongratulations to you, Madam President. We would \nalso like to thank former Assembly President Jan \nEliasson for his able leadership over the past year. Our  \n \ndeep appreciation also goes to Secretary-General Kofi \nAnnan, who has served the Organization with skill and \ndevotion. \n Palau joins others in welcoming Montenegro, the \nnewest State Member of the United Nations. We look \nforward to its participation in our debates.  \n Participation in the United Nations has special \nmeaning for Palau. We were the last country to emerge \nfrom the United Nations Trusteeship System. During \ntrusteeship, it was the United Nations that showed us \nthat every country, regardless of size, had a role to \nplay. The United Nations provided our nation with a \nplatform from which we could achieve independence \nand establish our sovereignty. For that we are forever \ngrateful. \n Palau is often seen as a paradise of swaying palm \ntrees and ocean breezes. But that simplistic view fails \nto recognize the challenges we face as a small island \ndeveloping State. In this shrinking world, the actions of \ndistant countries are having a profound effect on us. \nWe come to the Assembly now, asking for its help once \nagain as we face those difficult issues. \n One of the issues that we hope the General \nAssembly will act on this year is deep-sea bottom \ntrawling. As the Secretary-General has reported, \nbottom trawling is responsible for 95 per cent of the \nworldwide damage to seamount ecosystems. It is an \nirresponsible practice, and Palau has passed a law \nbanning all bottom trawling within our waters. In doing \nso, Palau followed the lead set by Japan, the United \nStates, Norway, Australia and many other responsible \ncountries. \n It is now time to ensure that similar measures are \ntaken for international waters. That is why Palau has \njoined with our Pacific colleagues in Tuvalu, the \nMarshall Islands and Micronesia to propose an interim \nprohibition on unregulated bottom trawling. Our \nproposal represents the strong determination of our \nregion to protect the oceans upon which we all \nultimately rely. \n Another issue of great importance is that of \nglobal warming. Coral bleaching, a rise in sea level and \naltered fish migration all threaten the future of Palau \nand other small island nations. Reversing that trend is \none of our top priorities. We continue to urge the \ninternational community to act aggressively to reduce \nemissions that lead to global warming. \n  \n \n06-53317 18 \n \n Palau is a democratic society. Our children know \nthe importance of culture and community. We \nguarantee human rights in our nation. We also know \nthat flying our flag here at the United Nations carries \nwith it certain obligations, and we have met them all. \nPalau has deployed peacekeepers to regional and \ninternational missions. When natural disasters strike, \nPalau responds willingly and voluntarily. When the \ninternational community called upon countries to \npreserve biodiversity, Palau came forward with the \nMicronesian Challenge. That initiative will protect 462 \ncoral species, which represent 58 per cent of all known \ncorals. \n Our future as a nation and the future of our \nchildren depend upon the viability of our environment, \nespecially of the oceans. Palau relies on the health of \nits amazing reefs and waters to provide food for our \npeople and to support our tourism industry. Without \nthose we will not be able to develop a sustainable \neconomy that will allow our children to live and work \nin their homeland. To provide for them, we look to the \nUnited Nations for leadership and support. To that end, \nPalau remains open to ideas for harmonizing the \nenvironmental agencies at the United Nations. We \napplaud efforts to streamline the process of accessing \nthose agencies; that would make them more responsive \nto small nations. In the same vein, Palau would like to \nstate that difficulties in accessing assistance in \nclaiming our extended continental shelf have made it \nclear that we will have a hard time meeting the 2009 \ndeadline for submissions. \n Last year, in this historic Hall, we noted our \nconcern that the United Nations, its offices and \norganizations did not have a permanent representative \nin Palau. In June, it was announced that a coalition \ncomprised of the United Nations Development \nProgramme, UNICEF and the United Nations \nPopulation Fund would open a total of eight new \noffices in Pacific island countries, including Palau. We \nwelcome that historic accomplishment. It is a giant step \ntowards harmonization within the United Nations. For \nPalau, it will give us one of the tools we need most for \nsustainable development, namely, local capacity-\nbuilding. \n Let us not forget the continuing threat of \nterrorism. We recognize that terrorism anywhere is a \nthreat to people everywhere. We have looked for \nassistance to improve our anti-terrorism capacity. Palau \nhas met, and worked with, the Counter-terrorism \nExecutive Directorate to advance our requests for \nassistance, particularly in the area of combating \nmoney-laundering and the financing of terrorism. \nUnfortunately, the efforts of the Directorate have been \ninsufficient. Our hope is that, during the sixty-first \nsession of the General Assembly, the United Nations \nwill be able to help smaller countries in addressing that \nthreat. \n We would also like to take a moment to thank a \nfew of the many partners that have assisted Palau this \npast year. The efforts of the Global Environment \nFacility (GEF) Small Grants Programme deserve \nspecial recognition. The GEF programme in the North \nPacific has resulted in an effective mechanism to \nprotect our environment through grass-roots projects.  \n Palau has also partnered with a number of \ncountries that have supported our development. First, \nthe United States has provided in-country diplomatic \nrepresentation and years of support. We acknowledge \nthe generosity of the United States in responding to \nnatural disasters in Asia and the Pacific region. We \nthank them for that. Japan has also provided invaluable \nassistance to Palau. The addition of Japan as a member \nof the Security Council would help inform other \nCouncil members that are less familiar with our \nregional needs and concerns. We have supported, and \ncontinue to support, the G-4 draft resolution, and hope \nthat the Assembly will address the draft resolution this \nyear. \n Taiwan has been another steady supporter of \nPalau\u2019s development. We continue to assert that the \nworld would benefit from Taiwan\u2019s membership in the \nUnited Nations and other international institutions. \nThis year, Palau co-sponsored a draft resolution calling \nfor a proactive role for the United Nations in \naddressing the tensions in East Asia. We were \ndisappointed that the actions of the General Committee \nprevented a debate on that draft resolution. \n Palau would also like to recognize Australia\u2019s \nsteadfast commitment to stability in our region, as well \nas its dedication to capacity-building. Through such \ninitiatives as its patrol boat programme, Australia \nenables Palau to address illegal, unregulated and \nunreported fishing, which threatens our sovereignty \nand the marine habitats that surround our island nation. \n We call on all parties in the Sudan to work \ntogether to mitigate the humanitarian crisis in Darfur. \nAs Mr. Jan Eliasson stated on 11 September,  \n \n \n19 06-53317 \n \n \u201cwe have ... seen the horrors of Cambodia, \nRwanda and Srebrenica without taking action. \nThe same tragedy must not befall the people in \nDarfur or elsewhere. The responsibility to protect \nmust move from declaration to action.\u201d \n(A/60/PV.100, p. 6 ) \n Lastly, Palau would like to take this opportunity \nto express our hope that the Middle East peace process \ncan be successfully restarted. We are hopeful that the \nexpanded United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon \n(UNIFIL) will bring peace and security to both Israel \nand Lebanon. We stress the need for full \nimplementation of Security Council resolution 1701 \n(2006), including its preamble. We join the call for the \nunconditional release of the kidnapped Israeli soldiers. \nIt is critical that the reconstructed UNIFIL force be \neffective and capable of enforcing the arms embargo as \ncalled for. \n On behalf of Palau, a small island nation in the \nwide Pacific Ocean, let me thank the entire Assembly \nin my country\u2019s native language. Kom Kmal Mesulang. \nGod bless you all. "

I am convinced that your eminent \nqualities will enable you to skilfully guide the work of \nthis General Assembly. And I assure you of my \nreadiness to work with you towards the successful \naccomplishment of the difficult mission entrusted to \nyou by our General Assembly.  \n I take advantage of this opportunity to address \nour Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and to express \nmy deepest gratitude for the total and resolute \ncommitment that he has always shown as head of our \nOrganization, in particular, in the promotion of its \nideals. We are all aware of the immeasurable efforts \nthat he consistently deploys to defend the noble causes \nof our institution \u2014 the fight against poverty, the \nmaintenance of peace in the world, to list but the main \nones. \n It is a great honour to take the floor today and to \naddress this Assembly in my capacity as the newly \nelected President of the Union of the Comoros.  \n Allow me, therefore, at this historic time, to \naddress my deep gratitude to all of the brother \ncountries, to the United Nations system and to the \nAfrican Union, in particular, for having become \nengaged in order to ensure that, for the first time, a \ndemocratic and peaceful political transition was able to \ntake place in my country following free and transparent \nelections. That was indeed a first in the Comoros in  \n30 years of independence. \n At this junction, I would like to underline the \nprincipal role played by the Republic of South Africa \nand by its President, Mr. Thabo Mbeki, in monitoring \nthe electoral operations during the last presidential \nelections held in the Comoros. These elections are an \nexemplary model for Africa, in spite of certain \nimperfections. \n I wish to convey to the Government and to the \nbrethren people of the Republic of South Africa the \nsincere gratitude of the people of the Comoros and my \npersonal acknowledgment for the unfailing support that \nthey provided to the process of national reconciliation \nin the Comoros. \n  \n \n06-53005 2 \n \n I wish to convey to France, a country with which \nwe have long-standing relations, the gratitude of the \npeople and the Government of the Comoros for the \nconstant support that it continues to provide to our \ncountry. We are convinced that France, the home \ncountry of human rights and freedoms, will meet the \nrequest of my Government to ensure that together we \ncan guarantee a harmonious development in the \nComoros, with democracy, the rule of law and good \ngovernance. \n The People\u2019s Republic of China also deserves our \ndeep admiration. With great vigour, this brother \ncountry has supported the development of the \nComoros, ever since we gained independence more \nthan 30 years ago. Through the quality of its relations, \nChina has earned the friendship of all the people of the \nComoros, and I remain convinced that it will continue \nto provide aid and support for my country\u2019s socio-\neconomic development, a matter which remains a \npriority for my Government. \n The Republic of Mauritius deserves a special \nmention for its invaluable support to my country \nthroughout the national reconciliation process. By \nhosting the donor conference for the Comoros in \nDecember 2005, this brother country has demonstrated \nits great solidarity with the Comoros. We therefore \nexpress to it our deep appreciation here today. \n Madagascar is a country with which we enjoy, \nover and above formal cooperation, very close relations \nby virtue of good neighbourliness, blood ties, a shared \nlanguage and commerce, and it will remain a crucial \npartner for us. Madagascar has consistently \ndemonstrated the importance of preserving common \nvalues, in particular through closer ties. I know that \nwith this brother country we still have a long way to \ntravel together, as our destinies are linked. \n From this platform, I would be remiss not to \nconvey our sincere gratitude to all other bilateral and \nmultilateral partners of the Comoros, in particular, the \nLeague of Arab States, the International Organization \nof la Francophonie and the European Union, which, \nthrough the African Union, has provided valuable \nsupport and assistance in recent years in the context of \nthe national reconciliation process.  \n I would like to thank sincerely the entire \ninternational community for the spirit of solidarity \noften expressed towards my country. Moreover, I \nremain convinced that the entire international \ncommunity will continue to support the Comoros to \nhelp it complete national reconciliation. This is the sine \nqua non to ensure that a period of peace and political \nstability can take root in my country. \n The people of the Comoros hope to see an end to \nthe hellish cycle of coups d\u2019\u00e9tat that have spoiled their \ndaily lives over the past three decades. Since my \nelection as President, my Government and I have \nstrived to find the ways and means to promote social \nand economic development. We are aware of the need \nto diversify our cooperation abroad and to create \nconditions that are propitious to investment. On the \ndomestic level, my Government is resolutely \ncommitted to fighting corruption and the \nembezzlement of public funds, to reestablishing an \nindependent and equitable judiciary and we are \ncommitted to improving public housing. In order to \nachieve these goals, we require the backing our \npartners in support of our own efforts. That is why I \nmake a solemn appeal to this Organization and to its \nMembers to provide diverse forms of aid in order to \nensure the success of this task. \n I would be remiss if I did not also touch on the \nmajor global issues that we face. The situation in the \nMiddle East remains critical. The conflict that occurred \nin Lebanon between Israel and Hezbollah deeply hurt \nus in our flesh and in our hearts. Once again, we \nquestion the grounds for waging that war, the reasons \nfor the destruction of economic infrastructure in that \nbrother country, and finally the loss of thousands of \nlives. My country deeply deplores the shedding of \ninnocent blood in Lebanon and in the Middle East. \nWhy is there so much violence? Why is there so much \nsuffering? Why is there so much inhumanity?  \n What is there to say about the situation in \nPalestine where the same scenario persists with its toll \nof martyrs, children and women who are victims of \nblind bombing? It is high time for the international \ncommunity, working within the framework of the \nUnited Nations, to respond and to put an end to that \nconflict by ensuring that a negotiated solution is \nreached promptly. \n We have the right to ask why the situation in Iraq \nremains catastrophic. It would be a shameful lie to say \nthat we do not awake each day, learning of a growing \nnumber of deaths in each community in Iraq.  \n In Africa, even though some conflicts have been \nsettled, instability and the risk of war and the threat of \n \n \n3 06-53005 \n \nwar still persist in Chad, the Darfur region of the \nSudan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia, \njust to mention some instances.  \n The question of Moroccan Sahara in no way \nleaves us indifferent. It is high time that the \ninternational community uses the prestige of the United \nNations to expedite a solution based on law to that \nlong-standing dispute. In any such situation, only the \napplication of international law can guarantee the \nrestoration of legality. \n Asia is not spared its share of armed conflicts, for \nexample those in Sri Lanka, Timor and southern \nPhilippines. To mention all such conflicts would be \ntedious. Wherever or whenever war takes place, armed \nconflict inevitably results in millions of displaced \npersons, destroyed economic infrastructure and \nirreversible human, social and economic tragedy and \ndamage. We must acknowledge and appreciate the vast \neffort of the international community to ensure that \ndialogue, discussion and negotiation prevail over force, \ndestruction and war. Our Organization plays a major \nrole in this respect. We must acknowledge that the \ncrucial missions undertaken by the United Nations are \nirreplaceable. \n We live in a time of paradoxes. On the one hand, \nwe are living through an exceptional period marked by \nextraordinary growth of knowledge and know-how in \nthe areas of technology, science, economic output, \ninformation technology and communications, just to \nmention a few. Yet on the other hand, we continue to \ndevote almost unlimited financial and technical \nresources to producing more and more weapons \ncapable of destroying our planet. Our countries are \ncaught up in an arms race, instead of concentrating on \ndevelopment and combating disease and poverty.  \n At a time when science makes possible \nconsiderable progress, as I said earlier, the \ncontradiction persists at the start of the twenty-first \ncentury that millions of individuals do not have enough \nto eat, millions of persons are totally destitute, and too \noften abject poverty, famine and devastating pandemics \nprevail. Many families live without shelter or in \nprecarious and unhealthy conditions. Side by side with \nan increasingly prosperous world, more and more \npeople live in increasingly difficult situations. We must \nask ourselves how to overcome these contradictions in \norder to meet the challenges of the future. \n Without going into detail, I wish to touch on the \nroot causes of these problems, their consequences and \nprospects for the future. In my humble opinion, the \nreasons for these conditions are twofold. The first \nconcerns governance in countries themselves. It will \nnot surprise you to hear that in many countries, \nespecially in the poorest countries, there is injustice, \ncorruption and a lack of respect for fundamental human \nrights. The second point concerns international \ngovernance and all the related problems. While we live \nin a globalized world, we must recognize that \ndegradation of the environment from uncontrolled \npollution by business motivated by easy profit \nendangers the lives of future generations. In economic \nterms, we stand by powerless, witnessing deteriorating \nterms of trade, which plunge the poorest countries into \never-deepening poverty while the richest countries \ncontinue increasingly to prosper.  \n We believe that in order to achieve peace among \nmen, to seek peace among countries and to ensure \nlasting peace for each and every one, we must prevent \nand resolve the conflicts and ills that beset our world. \nWe meet in this forum to seek \u2014 and to find \u2014 \nsolutions to the problems that I have touched upon in \nmy statement. The permanent quest for material and \nsocial well-being should guide us towards a guarantee \nof better lives for our children. We must attack the root \ncauses of the conflicts breaking out everywhere in the \nworld. It is crucial that we combat pandemics such as \nAIDS, which has destroyed millions of people \nworldwide.  \n Mr. Majoor (Netherlands), Vice-President, took \nthe Chair. \n Finally, I wish to use the words of Saint Francis \nof Assisi who said, \u201cGive us love, my God, so that we \nmight instil it where the forces of evil dominate\u201d. May \nGod the almighty and most merciful inspire our \ndecisions to ensure that a time of peace comes upon us \nand that we see an end to the spilling of the innocent \nblood of people in countries at war.  \n(spoke in Arabic) \n The Union of the Comoros has entered into a new \nperiod since my accession to the post of head of the \nsupreme Council following the free and transparent \nelections that were held in May and June. We hope to \nstrengthen our ties with all friendly countries on the \nbasis of mutual respect and common interests. We \nreaffirm our firm commitment to all international \n  \n \n06-53005 4 \n \nconventions and agreements that seek to ensure peace, \nwell being, security and development for all peoples of \nthe world.  \n The Comoros occupies a distinct strategic \nposition and embraces many civilizations. In spite of \nthe challenges it faces, the Comoros has managed to \npreserve its African and Arab identities, and its \naffiliation with Islam: a religion of love, amity, \ntolerance and peace.  \n Our country is among the world\u2019s poorest, in \nspite of the priceless natural resources that we enjoy, \nsuch as agriculture, fishing and tourism, in addition to \nour strategic position in the Mozambique Channel. \nIncorrect economic politics applied since we gained \nindependence in 1975 and political instability have \nbeen among the negative factors that made our country \nespecially poor and backward. Average gross domestic \nproduct per capita stands at about $300 per year.  \n We have therefore developed a far-reaching plan \nseeking to provide substantial shelter for our \npopulation, in place of straw huts. We have sought to \nestablish an independent judiciary in order to ensure \nthe justice and equality of all before the law, and we \nare combating unemployment and poverty. If we are \nunable to provide decent and dignified housing and \nunable to guarantee a minimum of justice, then we will \nbe unable to fight unemployment and poverty.  \n I would like once again to call upon the \ninternational community to continue to provide aid and \nassistance to my country. I assure members all that \ntheir generosity and assistance will reach secure hands \nand will be used properly and appropriately.  "

        "file_text": "On behalf of the \nGovernment and the people of the Republic of \nSuriname, I should like to take this opportunity to \nextend to you, Madam, and to the Government and the \npeople of the Kingdom of Bahrain, my sincere \ncongratulations on your election to preside over the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-first session. \n We express our gratitude to His Excellency \nMr. Jan Eliasson, President of the General Assembly at \nits sixtieth session, for his contribution to the work of \nthe Organization. I should also like to pledge our \nsupport to the Secretary-General, His Excellency \nMr. Kofi Annan, and to pay tribute to him for his \nleadership, his valuable contribution to the resolution \nof global challenges and his constructive role in \nrestructuring the United Nations. \n In today\u2019s world, guaranteeing necessary \ninfrastructure and ensuring the availability of health \nservices and education for all are still major \nchallenges. The world order continues to deny the vast \nmajority of the members of the international \ncommunity the opportunity to escape poverty and to \nutilize their abilities and skills to achieve progress and \nprosperity. There is a need for enhanced cooperation in \nareas of relevance to humanity if we are to create an \ninternational community that can offer all of its \nmembers a fair chance of a decent life. \n The call for an enabling international \nenvironment for sustainable development and poverty \neradication is still a strong one. The international \ncommunity needs to support the call of the vast \nmajority of its members for fair terms of trade, \nincreased market access for products from the \ndeveloping countries and a more effective and \nsupportive international financial architecture. \n Given the international state of affairs, Suriname \nsupports the implementation of the international global \npartnership for development. The partnership for \ndevelopment can obtain guidance for its decisions from \n  \n \n06-52737 32 \n \nthe many commitments adopted at the major United \nNations conferences and summits in the economic, \nsocial and related fields, in particular those reflected in \nthe Millennium Development Goals and the Monterey \nConsensus. This partnership should aim to energize the \npolitical will of all States to implement those \ncommitments and to create genuine opportunities for \nall States in the field of trade, as well as for \ninvestments that promote sustainable development and \npoverty eradication. \n My delegation continues to plead for a rule-\nbased, predictable, non-discriminatory trading and \nfinancial system, and for an international system that \npromotes decent and productive work and extends the \nbenefits of new technology to all parts of the globe. \n The focus of the partnership for development \nmust be the establishment of a supportive international \nenvironment to achieve, in particular Millennium \nDevelopment Goal 8 and its targets. \n Building a global partnership for development \nwill require the involvement and cooperation of all \nstakeholders \u2014 Governments, the private sector and \ncivil society alike. The partnership should enhance the \ninvolvement of the private sector, taking into account \nthe redefinition of the role of the private sector in \nsociety, based on a common understanding of the \ninfluence of business in spurring development and \nimproving the human condition. \n The contribution of the private sector is pivotal to \na national policy geared towards enhancing human \ncapital and infrastructure and gaining access to world \nmarkets. We note with satisfaction the leadership of the \nUnited Nations in this area, and believe that the United \nNations Global Compact should collaborate with the \npartnership for development. Civil society should \ncontribute actively to the partnership for development \nat all levels, in particular at the national level. Its \nactivities should be in harmony with and \ncomplementary to national development efforts. \n The challenges we face in the area of \ninternational peace and security are equally serious. \nThe increased efforts of the United Nations to save \nhumanity from the scourge of warfare are not always \nsuccessful. Too often the international community is \nconfronted with situations that seriously jeopardize the \nsafety of individuals and populations. \n The Government of Suriname believes that there \nis a need for us to realize that the United Nations is in \nfact still our partnership for international peace and \nsecurity. This partnership should be based on the firm \ndetermination of all States to cooperate in seeking fair \nand lasting solutions to persistent problems that \nadversely affect international peace and security. \nTolerance, mutual respect and mutual interest, leading \nto the peaceful coexistence of States, good-\nneighbourliness and unity in diversity, should be the \nbasic principles that guide the recommendations of the \npartnership for international peace and security. \n Recently, the General Assembly adopted the \nUnited Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy \n(resolution 60/288). This is certainly a step forward \ntowards an effective international response to \nterrorism, in conformity with international law, \ninternational human rights law and international \nhumanitarian law. My delegation notes with \nsatisfaction that the Strategy includes the promotion of \ndialogue, tolerance and understanding among \ncivilizations. Of equal importance is the recognition \nthat capacity-building in all States is a core element of \nthe global counter-terrorism effort. In this regard, we \nanticipate a genuine partnership being established to \nimplement the Strategy. \n The illegal drugs trade and organized crime also \naffect international security. Increased cooperation at \nall levels is needed if the international community is to \nbe able to respond adequately to those threats. In this \nconnection, the Government of Suriname will host an \nanti-narcotics conference in October 2006. The main \npurpose of the conference is to enhance coordination \nand collaboration among participating countries, aimed \nat combating trafficking in narcotic drugs, dismantling \ndrug-related criminal organizations and combating the \nillicit trade in small arms and light weapons, given the \nincreased levels of crime that it generates. \n A restructured United Nations must ensure that \nthe Organization remains the source of redress for the \ninternational community and the home of international \njustice and equitable decision-making. Given the less-\nthan-satisfactory international development and \nsecurity situation, we, the States Members of the \nUnited Nations, should be more than willing to act in \nconformity with the Charter, to employ the \ninternational machinery for promoting the economic \nand social advancement of all peoples, to unite our \nstrengths to maintain international peace and security, \n \n \n33 06-52737 \n \nand to practise increased tolerance and live together in \npeace as good neighbours. Suriname believes that the \npresent session of the General Assembly can contribute \nsignificantly to those endeavours. "

        "file_text": "I should \nlike to say how pleased the Government of Panama is \nat your election, Madam, to preside over the sixty-first \nsession of the General Assembly. Your illustrious \nprofessional record and your extraordinary action in \ndefence of women\u2019s rights lead us to believe that you \nwill guide us in an exemplary manner. I also \ncongratulate the Secretary-General on his encouraging \nwords yesterday. The ovation that ensued bears witness \nto the Assembly\u2019s gratitude for his efforts over 10 years \nof heading the Secretariat. \n Over the past few years we have dedicated \nconsiderable effort and time to the task of reforming \nthe United Nations. We are doing this for one simple \nreason: we want it to work better. That aspiration is \nbased on a profound conviction that the Organization is \nindispensable for humanity. Those who criticize the \nOrganization must be honest when they wonder what \nthe world would be like without the United Nations \nand its specialized agencies. Those who govern are \nexamined on a daily basis by their peoples and \nsometimes they are criticized very severely, but nobody \nsuggests that there should not be a government. We \nwant governments to be better because they are \nnecessary, just as we want the United Nations to be \nbetter because it is equally necessary. We do not want \nto imagine a world without a United Nations. That is \nwhy at the Summit in September last year, as the \nculmination of long debate and tremendous collective \neffort, we agreed on a series of reforms for the United \nNations machinery. \n What is at stake today is not just the fate of a \nsingle initiative, but, rather, the effectiveness of the \nUnited Nations in complying with the purposes and \nprinciples of the Charter. The General Assembly has \nacted with diligence, and we are proud in particular of \nthe decision to create a Human Rights Council, whose \nestablishment should strengthen respect for human \nrights and spread their promotion globally. Panama, \nborn closely linked to international affairs, continues to \nbe committed to strengthening human rights \nthroughout the world. It is in this field that we see the \ngreatest paradox: where the United Nations has made \nthe most progress is where there remains the most \nprogress still to be made. Before its inception human \nrights violations were almost ignored. Today the \ndenunciations made at the United Nations have a \ntremendous deterrent power, so those violations do not \ncontinue to be perpetrated. At the same time, it is true \nthat there have been horrendous violations during the \nlife of the United Nations, but no one can deny that the \nreality and consequences are very different from the \nsituation that prevailed only a few decades ago. \n The United Nations and its specialized agencies \nhave the important task of coordinating efforts to \nprotect the millions of human beings living in poverty. \nPoverty is the daily denial of man\u2019s fundamental rights. \nWhile genocide causes indignation and is emphatically \nrejected by the international community, there should \nbe the same indignation over poverty, as it afflicts a \n  \n \n06-52879 4 \n \nlarge part of the world\u2019s population. Governments have \na moral obligation to help people and communities \nliving below the poverty line. Economic growth rates \nare deceptive, and almost offensive, if there is no direct \nrelief for those who have less and who, without \nassistance, have no chance of breaking out of the \nvicious circle of poverty. \n Within the reforms to the Organization now being \ndebated, we should, in order more effectively to \naddress poverty in the world, give greater weight and \nauthority to the General Assembly to adopt measures of \nuniversal scope, not resolutions, repeated year after \nyear, with no binding power. \n Similarly, I should like to address the need to \nexpand the Security Council so that it truly represents \ntoday\u2019s world and not the world as it was 60 years ago. \nNot to reform the Security Council would be \ndetrimental to its purposes. A Council that is not \nrepresentative cannot be as legitimate or effective. \nHowever, although there is consensus about the need to \nreform, how to reform has provoked more disunity than \nagreement. From Panama\u2019s perspective, geographical \nrepresentation is an important factor to be considered, \nbut it cannot be the only one. A member of the Security \nCouncil does not sit on the Council to represent itself \nor the geographic region to which it belongs; it \nrepresents all Member States, which have entrusted it \nwith this responsibility because it has shown the \ncommitment and capacity to further the effort to \nmaintain international peace and security. \n It is time now to look at this topic with different \neyes. The facts that are developing continuously in the \nMiddle East, and the fact that terrorist attacks continue \nto occur throughout the world, show that it is crucial to \nstrengthen the Security Council as soon as possible \nthrough a process of reform that includes a moderate \nexpansion of the membership while the Council \nremains legitimate in the eyes of the rest of the \ninternational community. Strengthening the organs of \nthe United Nations, and more particularly the Security \nCouncil, will make it possible for events such as those \nin Lebanon to be met with a prompt and effective \nresponse. If the Organization had had the required \ninstruments to act robustly with legitimacy, we could \nhave put an early end to the confrontations; in fact, \nthey could have been avoided entirely if we had had an \nadequate preventive force. The rapid escalation of the \nconflict has highlighted the imperative need to resolve \nthe Middle East crisis so that Jews, Muslims and \nChristians can coexist in peace, as they do in Panama \nand many other parts of the world. \n There are tested ways to promote confidence \namong parties, to reconcile positions and to achieve \nconsensus. The use of arms can help some people to \ngain some short-term objectives but the atmosphere is \npoisoned and there cannot be peaceful coexistence \namong neighbours, families and peoples that \ngeography has placed so close to one another. It is \nobvious from every perspective that a solution to the \nconflict requires the immediate and unconditional \nwithdrawal of Israel from the occupied territories, \nestablishment of the Palestine State and recognition of \nIsrael\u2019s right to exist as a State. All the countries in the \nregion must have sufficient guarantees that conflicts \nwill not be resolved through force and that no territory \ncan be used to attack a neighbour. Peace in the Middle \nEast has to be built by each and every State with the \nresolute support of the international community. \n Our vision is the same for other regions of the \nworld where a high degree of political tension still \nprevails and endangers the peace. Peaceful solutions \ncannot be postponed, for there is always the risk of \nviolent confrontations of unsuspected dimensions that \nwe will all deplore. \n I should like to draw attention to a significant \nevent that will take place in my country in the next few \nweeks and will have an impact on world trade. On \n22 October there will be a referendum to decide \nwhether the Panama Canal should be expanded. The \nhistoric and emotional dimension of the canal for the \nPanamanian people means that its expansion is the only \ndecision of the legislature and the Executive that needs \na referendum for confirmation. The Panama Canal \nlinks the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. It is therefore the \nbest route for the transport of goods between different \ncontinents, between two countries in the American \ncontinent, and even between two coasts in a single \ncountry. Five per cent of world maritime trade passes \nthrough the Panama Canal. The percentage varies from \none country to another: 3.5 per cent of an economy the \nsize of China\u2019s; 16 per cent of the United States foreign \ntrade; and 35 per cent of Chile\u2019s trade. The fact is that \nthe future of the Panama Canal affects the international \ncommunity as a whole. \n Only seven years ago the canal was run by the \nUnited States. After a long and complex negotiation \nthat included a special meeting of the Security Council \n \n \n5 06-52879 \n \nin Panama \u2014 one of only two times that that body has \nmet outside New York Headquarters \u2014 it reverted to \nPanama on the last day of the twentieth century. Since \nthen Panama has administered the canal with efficiency \nand safety, and it is now about to decide whether to \ntake the tremendous step of expanding the canal to \nenhance its capacity and allow larger ships to use it. \n The United Nations has always been involved in \nPanama\u2019s fate, the fate of the canal. It was on the \nagenda when it was a continuing source of conflict \nbetween Panama and the United States. It supported the \nUniversal Congress on the canal in 1997 and finally it \nwelcomed the canal\u2019s orderly transfer to Panamanian \njurisdiction. That is why Panama once again wishes to \ndraw the General Assembly\u2019s attention to the canal and \nto reiterate its gratitude to the Non-Aligned Movement, \nbecause last week the Heads of State and Government \nadopted a declaration recognizing the efficient \nadministration of the Panama Canal and expressing \ntheir support for the initiative to expand its present \ncapacity. The canal is the most important resource for \nmy country\u2019s development and is a valuable strategic \navenue at the service of trade and communications for \nthe entire world. \n In my country there is full awareness that our \ngeographic position is our major asset, but that its \nexploitation involves responsibilities towards the \ninternational community. That is why, while we \nwelcome international recognition of the manner in \nwhich we have been administering the canal, we also \nwish to tell the world body that the Panama Canal will \ncontinue to be managed so as to be efficient, neutral \nand safe, for the benefit of all ships in the world, flying \nevery flag.

        "file_text": "Madam President, I bring to you the greeting of the \npeople and Government of the Eastern Republic of \nUruguay to this Assembly. This Assembly is the \nbroadest and most representative and important forum \nin the world today. \n Madam President, may I express my personal \nsatisfaction at seeing you exercise such an important \nfunction and I am sure that as a woman you will be \nable to add to the office an additional share of \nmoderation and restraint. \n In Uruguay, like the United Nations, we feel that \nit is very important to preach by example. That is why \nthe Government I represent has also assumed, among \nits many tasks, that of elevating the status of women \nand increasing their participation in various areas.  \n Likewise, I am very happy to bring to you a \nspecial message from the President of Uruguay, \nMr. Tabar\u00e9 V\u00e1squez, for the Secretary-General, \nMr. Kofi Annan, to thank him for his unrelenting \nefforts to drive the immense process of reforming the \nOrganization. My country and the other Members of \nthis house are fully committed to this reform. \n On the occasion of the sixteenth Ibero-American \nSummit that will take place in Uruguay, the countries \nof the conference will express to the Secretary-General \ntheir thanks for his outstanding work. I would also like \nto say that the main subject of the Summit will be \nmigration and development. Recently, we had a very \nconstructive high-level dialogue on this subject in this \nhouse. \n A year ago, during the sixtieth session of this \nforum, the President of our country said that the \ncommitment of Uruguay to the United Nations \nOrganization is both demanding and hopeful. \n Our commitment is demanding because of the \nchallenges that the current world faces and because of \nthe opportunities implicit in the present, upon the \nmanagement of which our future depends.  \n Our commitment is hopeful. Although we realize \nthat there are difficulties and limitations on the \ninternational scene and at the regional and national \nlevels, we believe in human beings, we believe in \nsociety, we believe in democracy as a common house \nand in freedom as the mother tongue of humanity. \n The Eastern Republic of Uruguay reaffirms the \nprinciples that characterize our foreign policy, namely, \nour commitment to peace, sovereignty, democracy and \nsolidarity; a firm rejection of all types of terrorism, \nviolence and discrimination; the inalienable right of \ncountries to have stable and secure borders and to fully \nexercise their sovereignty and self-determination; the \nrespect for international law as a guarantee of \nsovereignty of peoples and their peaceful cohabitation; \nnon-intervention in the internal affairs of States; \nmultilateralism as a way of strengthening international \nlaw and as a way to organize the role of the United \nNations; and the recognition of the indivisibility of all \nhuman rights, be they political, social, economic, civil \nor cultural, including collective rights, such as the right \nto development and the environment. Consequently, \nour country feels that progress in reforming the \nOrganization must be achieved and we are making our \ncontribution to that process, which will enable the \n \n \n35 06-53341 \n \nUnited Nations to fulfil its tasks with greater \neffectiveness. \n Greater effectiveness should also be sought by \nthe important recently created bodies, the Human \nRights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission. \nUruguay is already actively participating in the Human \nRights Council and we hope to join the organizing \ncommittee of the Peacebuilding Commission.  \n As a country that is a major contributor of troops \nand in support of the goal of peacekeeping, we have \nparticipated in peacekeeping missions since the \ncreation of this Organization. The most recent example \nof this our active undertaking and participation in the \nUnited Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti \n(MINUSTAH), which is an essential mechanism for \nsecuring a lasting peace and for restoring the social \nfabric of a dear Latin American nation. \n Likewise, Uruguay would like to renew its active \ncommitment to the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs) as agreed to by the Heads of State and \nGovernment. When I say \u201cactive\u201d, I say this as a \nreflection of how much progress has been made \ntowards the goals set forth in the agreement signed in \nSeptember 2005.  \n I cannot refer now to each of these goals at this \ntime, but one of the main goals is \u201cthe eradication of \nextreme poverty and hunger\u201d. In Uruguay, by means of \nthe interaction of various governmental programmes, \nwe have implemented an emergency social plan that \ndeals with the most basic needs of those in extreme \npoverty.  \n Poverty has begun to decrease, dropping from \n32.6 per cent of the recorded population in 2004 to \n29.8 per cent at the end of 2005. We feel that this is \nstill not sufficient, but it is progress, not only in terms \nof social protection, but also in terms of social \nintegration. \n This is so because the great problems that have \nproduced poverty in our country, as in other countries, \nare not just hunger, the lack of housing, illiteracy, \nacademic failure or teenage pregnancies, but also \ndiscrimination, stigmatization, insecurity and despair, \nindeed, situations that indicate being integrated in \nsociety is much more than subsisting. \n Social integration is essential, too, because the \nright to participate in social life also involves \nrecognizing individuals as active citizens and not just \nas people who need to be helped. \n And social integration is key, because the right \nthat our citizens are asking for \u2014 all of them, even the \npoorest \u2014 is not just the right to live, but also the right \nto be recognized as individuals and the right to live \ntogether in society. This is called democracy and \ncitizenship. \n Allow me from this important podium and on \nbehalf of the Government I represent to refer to three \nmatters of particular importance for our country. One \nof them has to do with the facts of the recent past. \nThere can be no future without memory, no freedom \nwithout justice. That is why, within the framework of \nlegislation in force, Uruguay is taking concrete steps to \nheal the wounds caused by the violation of human \nrights during the dictatorship that ruled the country \nbetween 1973 and 1985. It has been difficult work and \nit is also very difficult to learn and accept the truth, but \nit does strengthen democracy as a form of Government \nand condition in society. Moreover, truth and justice \nhelp to ensure that the horrors of the past are never \nrepeated. \n I am very happy to inform this General Assembly \nthat my country has taken one further step in the \npromotion and defence of human rights. The \nUruguayan parliament has just unanimously approved a \nbill on genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes \nand cooperation with the International Criminal Court. \n Another subject that relates to the current \nsituation and the future is climate change and the \ndegradation of the environment. Uruguay is a party to \nthe main international conventions in this area and, \nwhile stressing the indispensable international \ncooperation on this subject, we do particularly stress, \nonce again, the individual responsibility of each State \nto actively protect the environment in its territory and \nwaters and to make the vigilant participation of civil \nsociety a high priority. \n It is not enough to simply protest pernicious \ntransfers of polluting industrial processes. It is \nincumbent upon the State to act firmly to be vigilant \nand monitor and to impose high environmental \nstandards on foreign and domestic companies.  \n Uruguay receives significant investment for \nindustrial development on its territory, but we have \nvery strict controls on the environmental aspects of \n  \n \n06-53341 36 \n \nthose investments and we apply an internationally \nrecognized standard that reflects our motto \u201cNatural \nUruguay\u201d. We require the use of the most modern \ntechnologies available, and we monitor effectively, on \nthe ground, the environmental effects of such ventures. \n The Government of Uruguay reiterates its \ncommitment to the protection of the environment in all \nparts of the world as a human right and as the \ncornerstone for achieving true sustainable \ndevelopment. In this sense, Uruguay calls upon the \ninternational community, and particularly the donor \ncountries, to increase their cooperation in the area of \nthe environment for developing countries and assume \nin a responsible manner global environmental goals \nthat involve shared but differentiated responsibilities \nfor everyone. \n Finally, I would like to address our commitment \nto the strengthening of the multilateral trading system \nand the need to bring the Doha Development Round to \na successful conclusion, in order to ensure that the \ndevelopment dimension is reflected in specific results \nand not just programmatic measures. For that, it is \nimportant to resume, as soon as possible, the \nnegotiations in Geneva, always bearing in mind that we \nwill not achieve satisfactory results without the \nelimination of agricultural subsidies, in the form of \nexports that receive internal support and the significant \nopening up of access to markets, particularly in the \ndeveloped countries. \n Everyone here in this Hall knows that there is no \npeace in intolerance and terrorism, and there is no \nfreedom in poverty, nor democracy in inequality. We \nreaffirm our conviction that these threats can only be \novercome if we join our efforts together and fully \nappreciate the wealth of our own cultural diversity, \nboth among nations as well as within our respective \nnations. \n Among nations, we must rely on the respect of \nour traditions and cultures and a broad-based dialogue \namong them in order to find useful synergies. And \nwithin each of our countries, we must rely on active \npolicies promoting social cohesion that embrace our \nvery cultural, ethnic and religious diversities. We have \nto move from words to acts, from declarations to \naction. This is not easy, but it is essential. \n We are not starting from zero. The brief history of \nthis Organization is testament to that. \n But we still have a lot of work to do. It is a large \ntask which, honestly, will never end and the results will \nnever be perfect. \n But these zones of continuity and imperfection \nestablish the ideals that call on us to act and the \ncommitments that drive us forward.  \n If this sixty-first session of the General Assembly \nof the United Nations is able to help us in this task, it \nwill have fulfilled its mission.

        "file_text": "Every year our gathering \nunder this roof does homage to the foresight of our \npredecessors, who, by founding the United Nations, \nenvisioned the unity of nations. Today, this Assembly \nembodies that vision: the vision of our interdependence \nas members of a single community of nations. This \nvision has a strong resonance in Afghanistan, where \nboth our past troubles and our recent accomplishments \nare, in large part, related to the outside world. \n When I last addressed the Assembly in 2004 I \nspoke about the tremendous progress that Afghanistan \nhad achieved since 2001. Today that story of success \ncontinues. Over the past two years we have taken \nfurther significant steps forward, attaining all the \nmilestones in Afghanistan\u2019s post-war transition. \nMillions of Afghans have participated in two general \nelections, one for the president and another for the \nparliament. With the inauguration of our National \nAssembly last year all three independent branches of a \ndemocratic state were completed. We have continued to \nbuild schools and clinics and create employment \nopportunities for our people. Our trade with the region \nand beyond is growing very rapidly. Industrial activity \nis gradually taking root. As a result, Afghanistan\u2019s \nincome per capita has doubled since 2002. \n At the London Conference earlier this year our \nGovernment presented Afghanistan\u2019s National \nDevelopment Strategy for the next five years, which \nthe international community endorsed. Afghanistan and \nits international partners also entered into a compact, \nthe Afghanistan Compact, which provides the \nframework for continued international cooperation in \nAfghanistan. Under the compact we Afghans \ncommitted to continue to work towards a stable and \nprosperous Afghanistan, with good governance and \nhuman rights protection for all under the rule of law. In \nreturn, the international community pledged continued \nand long-term political, military and financial \nassistance. \n Regrettably, it is not all positive news that I have \nto share today. Over the past year our efforts to build \nAfghanistan into a stable, prosperous and democratic \npolity have also encountered setbacks. We have seen \nterrorism rebounding as terrorists have infiltrated our \nborders to step up their murderous campaign against \nour people. Terrorism sees in the prosperity of the \n  \n \n06-52879 2 \n \nAfghan people its ultimate defeat. That is why our \nschools and clinics get burned down, and our ulema, \nour teachers and our doctors get killed. That is why \ntoday 200,000 of our students who went to school a \nyear ago are no longer able to do so. \n It is also sobering to know that polio, the \nchildren\u2019s disease, increased from only four cases in \n2005 to 27 this year. All those cases occurred in some \nareas of southern Afghanistan where terrorists are \npreventing children\u2019s access to vaccination and health \ncare. \n Terrorists are prepared to cross any boundary and \ncommit horrific acts of violence to try to derail \nAfghanistan from its path to success. They want the \ninternational community to fail in its collective \nendeavour to help Afghanistan to rebuild. That is why \nthey decapitate elderly women, blow up mosques full \nof worshippers and kill schoolchildren in \nindiscriminate bombings of civilian areas. That is why \nthey are killing international soldiers and civilians who \nhave come to Afghanistan to help the Afghan people, \nsuch as the four Canadian soldiers who were killed \nfour days ago while distributing notebooks and candies \nto children in a village in Kandahar, or the Turkish \nengineer who was building roads in Helmand. Clearly, \nunless we confront them more decisively, terrorists will \ncontinue to take lives and inflict greater damage. \n To be sure, terrorism does not emanate from \nwithin Afghanistan; Afghanistan is its worst victim. \nMilitary action in Afghanistan alone, therefore, will not \ndeliver our shared goal of eliminating terrorism. We \nmust look beyond Afghanistan to the sources of \nterrorism. We must destroy terrorist sanctuaries beyond \nAfghanistan, dismantle the elaborate networks in the \nregion that recruit, indoctrinate, train, finance, arm and \ndeploy terrorists. We must ensure that political currents \nand entities in the region are not allowed to use \nextremism as an instrument of policy. \n Fighting terrorism effectively is also tied to our \nfight against narcotics. The menace of narcotics feeds \nterrorism and threatens the foundation of legitimate \neconomic development in Afghanistan and also, of \ncourse, in the region. \n A combination of factors \u2014 mainly the lack of a \nsecurity environment conducive to our counter-\nnarcotics efforts, the absence of a comprehensive \nalternative livelihoods programme and clandestine \ncredit flows to poppy farmers \u2014 is behind the \nnarcotics trade. Afghanistan is committed to fighting \nnarcotics, alongside terrorism, with strength and \ndetermination and through a combination of law \nenforcement and economic measures. We expect that \nthe international community will continue to support us \nin this fight by enabling us to provide meaningful \nalternative livelihoods to our farmers. \n In the context of the United Nations role in \nenhancing global security we endorse the \nrecommendations of the Secretary-General for a \ncomprehensive counter-terrorism strategy and welcome \nthe recent adoption of the strategy by the General \nAssembly. \n We also express our support for the proposal to \nconvene a high-level conference on international \nterrorism with a view to concluding the draft \ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism at \nthe earliest possible opportunity. \n Afghanistan also attaches great importance to the \nvarious initiatives undertaken to promote \nunderstanding and cooperation among civilizations. \nAfghanistan stands ready to contribute to further \nenriching these initiatives with our knowledge and \nexperience of international cooperation and \ninterdependence. \n Meanwhile, we remain deeply concerned at the \nincreased incidence of Islamophobia in the West. This \ntrend does not bode well for the cause of building \nunderstanding and cooperation across civilizations. As \na Muslim nation, Afghanistan is committed not only to \nsafeguarding the interest of our Holy Faith but also to \nbuilding bridges of understanding and friendship \namong followers of all faiths. \n The situation in the Middle East, including the \nquestion of Palestine, remains a source of great \nconcern to us in Afghanistan. Afghanistan strongly \nsupports the full realization of the rights of the \nPalestinian people, including the right to sovereignty \nand an independent State of Palestine living side by \nside in peace and coexistence with the State of Israel. \nAfghanistan also shares the pain of the people of \nLebanon as they suffer a terrible relapse into \ndestruction caused by war. We hope that the \ninternational community will step in with concern and \ngenerosity to address Lebanon\u2019s needs so that it may \nrecover. \n \n \n3 06-52879 \n \n To conclude, I thank the Secretary-General, \nMr. Kofi Annan, for his exemplary leadership in \nserving the cause of global security and prosperity. I \nthank him especially for his interest in and \ncommitment to Afghanistan and for his contribution to \nmaking our world a more secure place. \n I also thank the members of the international \ncommunity for their steadfast and generous support for \nAfghanistan over the past five years. I convey the \ngratitude of the Afghan people for the sacrifices that \nthe men and women in uniform from about 40 \ncountries throughout the world have made in the fight \nagainst terrorism in Afghanistan. We will honour those \nsacrifices by remaining true to our vision of building a \nsecure, democratic and prosperous Afghanistan that \nwill contribute to the progress of our region and to the \nsecurity of the world at large.

        "file_text": "At the outset \nallow me to congratulate you, Madam, on your election \nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \nsession and to wish you every success in this very \nhonourable and responsible position. My \ncommendation also goes to your predecessor, Mr. Jan \nEliasson.  \n I should also like to express my deepest \nappreciation and praise to Secretary-General Kofi \nAnnan for the commitment and determination he has \nshown in discharging his important duties. Concerning \nthe forthcoming elections for the new Secretary-\nGeneral, I take this opportunity to recall that eastern \nEurope is the only region that has not been represented \nin this high position. In this regard, we welcome the \ncandidature of Mrs. Vaira Vike-Freiberga, President of \nthe Republic of Latvia. \n The terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 still \nloom large in our memory. The fifth anniversary of this \ntragedy has again filled our television screens with \nhorrific scenes of suffering and death. It has served to \nremind us of the resolve that is necessary to combat \nterrorism, which constitutes one of the most serious \nthreats to international peace and security. \n With this in mind, Moldova fully supports the \nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy adopted recently by \nthe General Assembly, and welcomes the Assembly\u2019s \ndecision to continue, during the current session, \nconsideration of the Secretary-General\u2019s progress \nreport on the prevention of armed conflict (A/60/891). \nWe consider that the specific measures in the Strategy\u2019s \nplan of action are comprehensive in their details and \nfar-reaching in their insight. We need to take practical \nsteps individually and collectively to implement the \nprovisions of the plan. Likewise, we believe that the \nrecommendations outlined in the Secretary-General\u2019s \nprogress report will serve as guiding points for \nMember States in preventing conflicts throughout the \nworld. \n Many regional organizations have been entrusted \nby the United Nations, under the provisions of Chapter \nVIII of the Charter, with dealing with a number of \nconflicts that are not in the focus of the Security \nCouncil. We need a more systematic outreach to these \nregional organizations. No conflict in the world should \nescape the attention of the United Nations, whether or \nnot it is on the Security Council\u2019s agenda. \n From this perspective, we are delighted that the \nGeneral Assembly, despite opposition from some \nMember States, agreed to include in the agenda of this \nsession a new item, item 27, proposed by Azerbaijan, \nGeorgia, Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova \u2014 \n  \n \n06-53609 2 \n \nGUAM: \u201cProtracted conflicts in the GUAM area and \ntheir implications for international peace, security and \ndevelopment\u201d. These unresolved conflicts continue to \nimpact negatively on the political, social and economic \ndevelopment of the GUAM States and the millions of \npeople living in the region. We believe that bringing \nthe matter to the international community through the \nGeneral Assembly will facilitate the resolution of \nconflicts in Azerbaijan, Georgia and the Republic of \nMoldova, and will not, as some fear, undermine the \nexisting mechanisms to negotiate settlement of these \nconflicts. In this context, I should like to express on \nbehalf of the Government of the Republic of Moldova \ndeep gratitude to those countries that have supported \nour initiative. \n The Transdniestrian conflict is first and foremost \na product of geopolitical interests and designs. It was \nunleashed with external support immediately after the \ncollapse of the Soviet Union and the declaration of \nindependence and sovereignty by the Republic of \nMoldova. Unlike other internal conflicts generated and \nfostered by ethnic and religious antagonisms, it has a \npurely political character. The similarity of the ethnic \nstructure of the population on both sides of the Dniestr \nriver speaks for itself in this regard and cannot be \ndenied.  \n Over the years the Moldovan authorities have put \nin place specific policies aimed at ensuring full respect \nfor the human rights of ethnic minorities, in accordance \nwith the highest international standards. International \norganizations dealing with human rights issues have \nrepeatedly attested that in the Republic of Moldova all \nthe conditions for the preservation of the cultural and \nlinguistic identities of ethnic minorities have been \ncreated. These conditions include the functioning of \nmany schools based on the languages of minorities, as \nwell as the broad use of Russian as the language of \ninter-ethnic communication. \n The satisfactory resolution of the Gagauz issue by \ngranting special status to the region concerned is one \nof the greatest achievements of Moldova\u2019s national \npolicy. It offers a unique example in post-cold-war \nEurope of an internal conflict settled successfully by \npolitical means. These developments, against the \nbackdrop of the lack of democracy and growing \ncriticism by the international community of the \ntotalitarian Transdniestrian regime of Tiraspol, have \nconvinced the separatist leaders to cease the political \nexploitation of cultural and linguistic factors within the \nnegotiation process. \n It should be emphasized here that the territory \ncontrolled by the separatists is one of the few regions \nof its kind in the world, one where political parties and \nnon-governmental organizations opposed to the \nseparatist regime are prohibited; where freedom of the \nmass media and of opinion is non-existent; and where \nother fundamental freedoms, especially those of the \nnative Moldovan population, are systematically \nviolated. \n Moreover, various types of conventional \nweapons, including those prohibited or restricted by \nthe relevant international arms control regimes, \ncontinue to be manufactured illegally in the region. \nThe process of military build-up in Transdniestria is \nconducted vigorously by the separatist leaders, despite \nsteady efforts by Moldova to reduce its military forces \nand to settle the political conflict exclusively through \npeaceful means, without giving up its status of \npermanent neutrality. \n The Moldovan authorities are determined to find \na political solution to the Transdniestrian conflict based \non respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity \nof the country. This regional security problem should \nbe resolved through negotiations, with the participation \nof key actors in the \u201c5+2\u201d format. The end goal of \nnegotiations should be the drafting of a special legal \nstatus for the Transdniestrian region within the \nRepublic of Moldova. The region\u2019s democratization \nand demilitarization are indispensable conditions for \nprogress in the settlement process. \n We have a sound road map for settling the \nconflict, the Ukrainian plan, together with the \ndocuments approved by the Moldovan Parliament in \nthe summer of 2005. It is important that the \nnegotiations resume as soon as possible, without any \npreconditions. The calls for such negotiations are \nstrongly supported by the Republic of Moldova. \nAlthough little progress was achieved in the four \nrounds of the \u201c5+2\u201d negotiations, we believe it is \ncrucial to hold talks rather than to preserve the status \nquo. \n With a view to advancing the settlement process, \nthe Moldovan authorities have taken a number of \ncomplementary actions. Thus, on 22 July 2005, the \nMoldovan Parliament adopted the Law on Fundamental \nRegulations of the Special Legal Status of Settlements \n \n \n3 06-53609 \n \non the Left Bank of the River Nistru. This law grants \nTransdniestria the right to solve, independently, \nproblems related to legal, social and economic \ndevelopment, while complying with the Constitution \nand laws of the Republic of Moldova. Moreover, the \nlaw grants the Transdniestrian region the right to have \nits own legislative and executive bodies, as well as \nmore official languages. \n In the same vein, conditions have been created to \nbring the activities of Transdniestrian companies \nwithin the legal framework of the country through their \nregistration with the relevant constitutional authorities, \nwhich should allow those companies to benefit fully \nfrom the trade preferences Moldova has with its \npartners, including the European Union. That has been \npossible due to a joint commitment of the Moldovan \nand Ukrainian authorities to secure our common \nborder. The deployment on the ground of the European \nUnion Border Assistance Mission facilitated \ncooperation between the relevant Moldovan and \nUkrainian services aimed at establishing a single \ncustoms regime and efficiently controlling the frontier. \nWe are confident that this trilateral interaction will \ncontribute to settling the Transdniestrian problem. \n We take this opportunity to inform the Assembly \nthat on 17 September the separatist Transdniestrian \nregime held a so-called referendum on the region\u2019s \nfuture. We condemn this pseudo-referendum, which \nflagrantly infringes the Constitution of the Republic of \nMoldova, undermines the country\u2019s territorial integrity \nand defies democratic values and standards. The \nRepublic of Moldova is grateful to the mediators and \nobservers of the negotiation process \u2014 the European \nUnion, the United States of America, the Organization \nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe and Ukraine \u2014 \nfor their resolute position on non-recognition of that \nfarce. \n We continue to be concerned about the tensions \nin the security zone. The inefficiency of the current \npeacekeeping mechanism dictates the need for its \ntransformation into a multinational peacekeeping \nmission with an international mandate. We welcome \ncertain proposals made in this sense, and are ready to \ntackle this issue, in a result-oriented manner, without \ndelay. With regard to the military aspect, I should \nreiterate our concern and deep regret that the Russian \nFederation has not yet fulfilled its Istanbul \ncommitments. The complete implementation of these \ndecisions will facilitate the process for the entering \ninto force of the adapted Treaty on Conventional \nArmed Forces in Europe. We also underline the need \nfor an early international inspection of depots with \nammunition in the Transdniestrian region. Monitoring \nof the military-industrial enterprises in the eastern \nregion of the Republic of Moldova is long overdue. \n This year the Republic of Moldova celebrates the \nfifteenth anniversary of its independence. During these \n15 years, as a Member State of the United Nations, we \nhave fully shared the common values, responsibilities, \nachievements and setbacks of the Organization. \nNevertheless, we laid the foundations for a democratic \nsociety where basic human rights and the rights of \nnational minorities are fully respected. The main \nachievement has been the consolidation of the \nRepublic of Moldova as a peace-loving, independent \nEuropean country. The Republic of Moldova has \nirreversibly chosen the way of European integration as \na strategic objective of its foreign policy. We are fully \ncommitted to the idea of integrating into the system of \npolitical, economic and social values of the European \nUnion\u2019s family. We hope that the successful \nimplementation of the European Union-Moldova \nAction Plan will open up for us the possibility of \nelevating contractual relations with the European \nUnion to a new level. \n In conclusion, I voice our hope that the \nproceedings of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \nsession will be conducted in a spirit of solidarity and \nwith a realistic and constructive approach to the \ncomplex issues confronting the world today. The \ndelegation of the Republic of Moldova is committed to \ncontributing, alongside other Member States, to the \nfulfilment of the lofty goals of the United Nations. "

There is no \ndisputing the fact that the United Nations has been and \ncontinues to be the largest and most prestigious \ninternational Organization that has been entrusted with \nthe coordinating role in world affairs and on which \nhumankind pins its hopes for peaceful development. \n Turkmenistan welcomes efforts by the United \nNations, the General Assembly and the Security \nCouncil aimed at achieving goals of sustainable \ndevelopment, as well as meeting the challenges set by \nthe 2005 Summit, which determined how the world \ncommunity should address the most pressing problems \naffecting stability, humanitarian issues and \nstrengthening and improving the work of the United \nNations. \n We believe that the tangible results of the \ncollective efforts aimed at finding the best ways for the \nUnited Nations to proceed include such practical steps \nas the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission, \ncreation of the Human Rights Council and other \nconstructive steps. Improvement in the work of the \nSecurity Council is clearly one of the most important \nelements in completing the reform of the Organization. \nWe firmly believe that it is essential to carry out this \ntask; it is made necessary because of the objective \nprocesses of international development, increasing \ninteraction among States and increased need for \ncombining regional and global problems. \n The United Nations is the most important \ninternational structure, where comprehensive account \nhas to be taken of all factors underlying the processes \nin the world. Turkmenistan advocates strengthening the \nrole of the United Nations and its major bodies, when \ndecisions concerning the most pressing problems of \ntoday are taken. \n In this context, our country supports expansion of \nSecurity Council membership on the basis of the \ngreatest possible agreement among United Nations \nMember States. We also support initiating more \neffective and constructive dialogue between the \nSecurity Council and the General Assembly. We \nbelieve that progress will continue in the reforms \nstarted at the United Nations. Turkmenistan also \nwelcomes expansion of the number of States \nrepresented in United Nations structures and \ninstitutions, while emphasizing the importance of \ngeographical distribution; this is in line with the basic \nvalues of our Organization. \n Turkmenistan\u2019s steadfast position is that it \nfavours strengthening the United Nations in the \ninternational arena as the highest international forum \n \n \n35 06-53615 \n \nfor establishing a just and humane world order. \nTurkmenistan fundamentally advocates increasing the \npeacebuilding potential of the Organization, in \naccordance with the realities of global development. \nTherefore, our country devotes great attention to \nmaintaining most close contacts with offices of United \nNations specialized agencies, whose importance is \ncontinually growing today. \n One of Turkmenistan\u2019s main achievements since \nindependence has been the primacy of the principle \nwhereby each nation has the right to chose its own path \nof development and acceptable form of State system. \nThis is an essential condition for stability and \nsustainable and progressive development in all spheres \nof society. Today, independent and neutral \nTurkmenistan is confidently advancing along its \nchosen path. Annually, our country\u2019s economic growth \nsurpasses 20 per cent, with the volume of production \nper capita exceeding $8,000. \n Turkmenistan is celebrating its 15th anniversary \nas a State that has guaranteed its own food \nindependence. It provides its people with free natural \ngas, electricity, water, salt and low, in fact, symbolic \nprices for bread, utilities and public transport services, \ngasoline and so forth. All this is a tangible result of the \nlong-term programme of social and economic reform \ncarried out in our country under the leadership of the \nHead of the nation. Under this programme, over 60 per \ncent of the State budget is allocated to social spending. \n As a democratic State based on the rule of law, \nTurkmenistan is unwaveringly implementing the \nhighest principles allowing people to express their will. \nIn this regard, the Turkmen people possess a vast \nhistorical experience of democratic traditions, which \nare organically and progressively finding their way \ntoday into the social and political life of the country \nand are reflected in the continual enjoyment by citizens \nof their constitutional rights and freedoms. In this \nrespect, 2006 was a significant year for Turkmenistan. \nIn accordance with the decision of the highest \nrepresentative body of Government, the People\u2019s \nCouncil, our country held elections to local self-\ngovernment on an open, democratic and competitive \nbasis. As of now, this practice is being implemented at \nother levels of Government. In this, we see the basis \nfor consistent and irreversible processes of \ndemocratization, with the ever-increasing involvement \nof citizens and public organizations in managing the \ncountry. In Turkmenistan, this process is advancing in \na natural way, thereby instilling in the people the sense \nthat they are masters of their land and that they are \nresponsible for their destiny and the destiny of their \ncountry. \n In terms of preserving peace and security, \nnon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is \none of the most acute problems on today\u2019s global \nagenda. Our country fully supports efforts by the world \ncommunity in this area and participates in their \nimplementation, both at the national and international \nlevels. We are taking concrete, practical steps in this \ndirection. \n It should be especially emphasized that, at the \nend of October 2005, the People\u2019s Council of \nTurkmenistan adopted a Declaration in support of the \ninitiatives of international organizations against the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Also, on \n8 September, Turkmenistan, together with other States \nof the region, signed a treaty creating a Nuclear-\nWeapon-Free Zone in Central Asia. \n By these actions, our country is demonstrating in \npractice its firm commitment to the processes of \ndisarmament and non-proliferation. In this connection \nwe pledge our readiness to implement the initiative of \nthe President of Turkmenistan \u2014 which was supported \nby the United Nations Secretary-General \u2014 to \nestablish a United Nations regional centre for \npreventive diplomacy in Central Asia. All the \nnecessary conditions and appropriate infrastructure are \nalready available in the capital of our State \u2014 \nAshgabat. \n The President returned to the Chair. \n Turkmenistan has demonstrated its existing \npotential and capabilities through its active cooperation \nwith the United Nations in organizing major \ninternational forums and conferences to discuss \npressing problems involving global and regional issues. \n Through practical multilateral dialogue we have \nbecome convinced that the prevention of potential \nconflicts requires early warning of emerging situations, \na broad-based analysis and elaboration of preventive \nstrategies. Therefore, Turkmenistan will continue to \nmake its contribution to improving multilateral \ncooperation in this important area in partnership with \nthe United Nations and its organs, while recognizing \nthe great importance of international experience in \npreventive diplomacy. \n  \n \n06-53615 36 \n \n Turkmenistan is a principled and determined \nparticipant in the struggle against the threat of \nterrorism. We regard terrorism in all its forms as a \nphenomenon that must be placed outside the \nframework of human civilization. We are convinced \nthat in order to combat terrorism today we need the \ncooperation of all States, including with regard to such \nimportant issues as cooperation in the search for and \nextradition of the organizers and participants of \nterrorist acts, as well as their collaborators. \n Turkmenistan fully supports the efforts of the \nSecretary-General in elaborating a global strategy in \nthe fight against terrorism and stands ready to provide \npractical assistance to the international community in \nits efforts in that direction. \n The United Nations is a unique reflection of \nactual changes occurring in the world and it has clearly \ndemonstrated the will and desire of States for \ncooperation within a stable environment. The strategic \ndirection of reforms and the chosen path towards \nqualitative improvement in the work of the community \nof nations has become the defining vector of those \nchanges. \n Turkmenistan views the reform of the United \nNations as a road map towards the further \nstrengthening and enhancement of its authority. We are \nconvinced that the United Nations has always been and \nremains the most universal international structure and \nthe most important guarantor of global stability, \nsecurity and development. Turkmenistan will continue \nto cooperate more closely with the United Nations in \nthe future with a view to helping it to fully display its \nenormous potential. "

        "file_text": "On behalf of the \nZambian delegation, I congratulate you, Madam \nPresident, on your election as President of the sixty-\nfirst session of the United Nations General Assembly. \nIt is indeed significant to have a lady holding the \nhighest office of the General Assembly after almost \nthree decades. To us, this attests to the commitment of \nthe United Nations to the principle of gender equality. \n I would like to take this opportunity to welcome a \nnew member to the United Nations, the Republic of \nMontenegro. \n Madam President, I wish to pay tribute to your \npredecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, the Foreign Minister of \nSweden, who successfully presided over the sixtieth \nsession. He rendered selfless commitment and devotion \nto the search for consensus on a number of issues, \nincluding the 2005 World Summit Outcome. It is \npleasing to note that during his presidency, a number of \ndecisions were taken, including the establishment of \nthe Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights \nCouncil. \n Allow me to also pay fitting tribute to the \noutgoing Secretary-General of the United Nations, \nMr. Kofi Annan, for the outstanding leadership he has \nprovided to our Organization, particularly in his efforts \nto reform it into a more vibrant and accountable body. \nHis vision and stewardship of the Organization has set \nthe United Nations on a new course. We wish him well \nin his future endeavours as he leaves office. It is now \nup to us Member States to summon sufficient will to \nmake his vision a reality. \n The world today is faced with challenges of \nextreme poverty and underdevelopment, conflicts \namong and between nations and terrorism, which have \n \n \n37 06-53341 \n \ngiven rise to increased insecurity all over the world. In \naddition, human trafficking is on the increase \nworldwide. Often, innocent women and children in \nsearch of a better life, are sold and made to engage in \nillicit activities. That is a gross violation of human \nrights, which must be seriously addressed by the \ninternational community. \n The 2005 Summit Outcome set a global agenda to \naddress those challenges. Much has been achieved, but \nmore remains to be done if we are to build a world \nbody that is effective and relevant to the challenges \nfaced. Indeed, as Mr. Kofi Annan has indicated in his \n\u201cIn Larger Freedom\u201d report, \n \u201cwe will not enjoy development without security, \nwe will not enjoy security without development, \nand we will not enjoy either without respect for \nhuman rights.\u201d (A/59/2005, para. 17) \n The guiding principles of the United Nations \nCharter incorporate the promotion and protection of \nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms. We believe \nthat without the protection of those rights and \nfreedoms, meaningful development cannot be \nachieved. \n As one of the 47 Member States elected to the \nnewly established Human Rights Council, Zambia is \ncommitted to upholding the tenets of human rights in \nour country and the world at large. In that regard, \nZambia commends the United Nations for establishing \nthe Human Rights Council, and as a pioneer member, \npledges to give it all the support that it will require. We \ncommit ourselves to assist in formulating rules and \nstructures designed to ensure a strong Council that is \ntransparent, non-selective and non-politicized and that \npromotes dialogue and cooperation among Member \nStates. \n I am pleased to state that Zambia has made \nprogress in consolidating human rights and good \ngovernance. Zambia has further strengthened the rule \nof law and upheld the highest standards of individual \nfreedoms for all citizens, without discrimination based \non sex, colour, race or religious affiliation. In that \nregard, we appeal to the international community to \nassist us to strengthen and build the capacities of \nhuman rights institutions and all related institutions \nthat have an important role to play in the promotion \nand protection of human rights and fundamental \nfreedoms. \n Permit me at this juncture to thank the \ninternational community for electing Zambia to the \nHuman Rights Council, with the second highest \nnumber of votes. \n With regard to increased global insecurity, \nZambia reaffirms that a new vision of collective \nsecurity is required. Member States of the United \nNations expect the collective mechanism to address \nthreats, such as war, weapons of mass destruction, \nterrorism, organized crime and civil conflict, infectious \ndiseases, extreme poverty and environmental \ndegradation. If the United Nations is to strengthen the \noperations of that collective mechanism, Member \nStates must work through the United Nations Security \nCouncil and other United Nations agencies to develop \nstronger anti-terrorism, nuclear non-proliferation, \ndisarmament and crime prevention regimes. \n Zambia will continue to actively pursue measures \nintended to curtail terrorism through various actions, \nincluding taking appropriate national legislative \nreforms. To that end, we welcome the recent adoption \nby the General Assembly of the Global Counter-\nTerrorism Strategy and look forward to the adoption of \nthe comprehensive convention on international \nterrorism. \n Our Organization cannot afford to avoid \naddressing situations that threaten international peace \nand security, such as the recent case of Lebanon. \nPitifully, we witnessed a case of the inaction of the \nSecurity Council, a body charged with the \nresponsibility of maintaining international peace and \nsecurity. That state of affairs only reaffirms the need to \nreform the Security Council, with regard to its working \nmethods and the enlargement of its membership. In that \nregard, Zambia reaffirms Africa\u2019s well-known position \non the matter. \n At this stage, I would be remiss if I did not \nmention the Great Lakes region, which is emerging \nfrom a protracted period of conflict, followed by a \nperiod of successful transition towards democracy. The \nInternational Conference on the Great Lakes Region \nwill hold its second summit in Nairobi in December \n2006, to adopt the draft pact on security, stability and \ndevelopment in the region. In that regard, we need the \ncontinued political and financial support of the \ninternational community to ensure its adoption. \n It is important to confirm that the peacebuilding \nand development process in the Great Lakes region has \n  \n \n06-53341 38 \n \nreached a very advanced stage at all the three-\ndimensional levels, namely: international partnership, \nregional ownership and national stewardship. The \nvision for integrated and sustainable human \ndevelopment in the Great Lakes region is now \nreassured. The cessation of conflicts in the region, has \nalready fed into the collective will to transform the \nsubregion into a place of sustainable peace, political \nsecurity and development. \n Extreme poverty and deprivation breed disease. \nThe number of people living with or affected by \nHIV/AIDS and the deaths caused by AIDS have \ncontinued to grow in the world today. Furthermore, \nbetween 350 and 500 million people per year are \nexposed to malaria, which is estimated to be the \nnumber one cause of mortality in most developing \ncountries. \n Zambia, like many of the developing countries \nadversely affected by those diseases, supports all the \nefforts made by the international community in \ncombating HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. We \ntherefore welcome the creation of an international drug \npurchase facility to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis \nand malaria. This will not only facilitate easy access to \nmedicine but will also lower the costs and therefore \nbenefit many countries, especially in the developing \nworld. \n Poverty in the world today accounts for many of \nthe social and economic injustices that people are \nsubjected to in many developing countries. Four years \nago, a bargain was struck in Monterrey between \ndeveloped and developing countries on the \nimplementation of a comprehensive strategy bold \nenough to achieve the United Nations Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by 2015. Developed \ncountries were urged to support those efforts with \naction on aid, trade and debt relief. \n While we commend the developed countries for \ntaking tangible steps to fulfil their commitments, we \ncall upon them to do so as a matter of urgency. It is \nsaddening to note that six years after the Millennium \nDeclaration was signed, the majority of our people in \nAfrica are still exposed to abject poverty and live on \nless than $1 per day. Although there has been \nsignificant progress in achieving the MDGs, much \nmore remains to be done in order to reverse the \nnegative trends of poverty and the continued \nmarginalization of people across the world. \n We call for the removal of the unjust multilateral \ntrade system, which continues to hamper the fair \nparticipation of the developing and least developed \ncountries in the global market. We would like to draw \nthe attention of the Assembly to the role of our \ndeveloping partners, particularly, in the quick and \nconcrete implementation of the Doha Development \nAgenda. It should be pointed out that with fair trading \npractices, developing and least developed countries \nwould take a significant step towards self-sustenance \nand reduce dependence on aid. \n Furthermore, we welcome the outcome of the \nGleneagles Summit, at which the leaders of the Group \nof Eight pledged to increase aid to Africa by \n$25 billion a year by 2010. We also express our \ngratitude to those leaders for extending and deepening \ndebt relief to the poorest countries through the \nMultilateral Debt Relief Initiative. That Initiative has \nresulted in 100-per-cent cancellation of the debt owed \nto the international multilateral financial institutions by \nthe poor countries that have reached the completion \npoint under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt \nInitiative. Zambia is one such country. In addition, our \ngratitude goes to the other cooperating partners for \nagreeing to expand aid to developing countries by \napproximately $50 billion. Those resources will indeed \ncontribute to the advancement of the MDGs. \n Although in the recent past we have seen an \nincrease in the commitment of aid resources and action \nand a reaffirmation of the principle of mutual \naccountability, there is still an urgent need to ensure \nthat aid is managed efficiently and used effectively for \nthe achievement of the MDGs. It is equally important \nto closely monitor the donor commitments and aid \nflows targeted at achieving the MDGs that we have set \nfor ourselves to improve the lives of the poor and most \nvulnerable in the global community. The people in the \ndeveloping countries have been listening attentively to \nthe promises that we have made in various \ninternational forums. They continue to monitor those \ncommitments. Their expectations and aspirations are \nvery high. It is therefore incumbent on us to ensure that \nthose commitments and promises are fulfilled. \n The twenty-first century has been declared the \ncentury for the development of Africa. Let us therefore \nshow true commitment to that cause. In a world where \nthere is no true partnership between the rich nations \nand the poor nations, there can be no global security, \nno universal justice, no human rights and no \n \n \n39 06-53341 \n \nmeaningful development. More than ever before, all of \nus \u2014 rich and poor nations alike \u2014 have to work \ntogether to create a sense of equal partnership. We all \nneed to fulfil our commitments within a given time \nframe and enter into new ones in order to reach our  \n \ngoal of a world free of hunger, extreme poverty and \ndisease \u2014 indeed, a world where we can live in a \nsecure, clean and sustainable environment.

        "file_text": "Two years ago, at this same rostrum, as the conclusion \nof my statement (see A/59/PV.10), I quoted these \nfamous verses of the Spanish poet Antonio Machado:  \n \u201cTraveller, your footsteps \n Are the road, and nothing else; \n Traveller, there is no road. \n The road is made by walking; \n Walking makes the road.\u201d \n What a road we have travelled since then. Indeed, \nthe opening of the sixty-first session of the General \nAssembly is above all the opportunity for us to look \nback and assess the progress we have made, \nparticularly since the September 2005 World Summit, \nbut also to try to assess the work that still needs to be \ndone to implement the noble ambitions we all agreed \n  \n \n06-53323 10 \n \nupon one year ago in this Hall where we meet every \nyear as a real parliament of nations. On that historic \noccasion, we forcefully reaffirmed that peace and \nsecurity, development and human rights are the pillars \nof the United Nations system and constitute the \nessential element of a more just and a more peaceful \nworld order. \n One year later, what have we accomplished, and \nhow can that progress be assessed in the light of these \ncriteria: the reality of the situation, and the way in \nwhich the complex international situation and the \nnever-ending future are evolving?  \n When we look at the current situation, we have to \nsee that areas of shadow coexist with reasons for hope, \nand we have some cause for concern. More than ever, \nthe Middle East is the centre of deep political, military, \nsocio-economic and cultural tensions, with military \nconfrontation on Lebanese lands and bombings in \nnorthern Israel, to mention only the most recent \nexamples. A month of war has left behind it a terrible \nlegacy of death and injury, destruction and \ncontamination by mines and unexploded ordnance, as \nwell as major economic consequences. My country \nimmediately joined international solidarity efforts. The \nStockholm conference enabled us to coordinate \ninternational support and to move towards \nreconstruction under the aegis of the United Nations \nand the Lebanese Government. \n But beyond that immediate reaction, now that a \ncessation of hostilities has been brought about \u2014 late, \nit is true \u2014 we now have to consolidate the ceasefire \nand lay the foundations of a sustainable political \nprocess, the principal elements of which are defined in \nSecurity Council resolution 1701 (2006). As reaffirmed \na few days ago from this podium by the current \nPresident of the European Council, Ms. Tarja Halonen \n(see ), the European Union is prepared to \nfully play its role in this context. Already, European \ncontributions \u2014 to which my country is committed to \nparticipate \u2014 constitute what Secretary-General Kofi \nAnnan has called the backbone of a strengthened \nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).  \n So the task of supporting the emergence of a fully \nsovereign and independent Lebanon which can exercise \nits sovereignty and a monopoly on armed force \nthroughout its territory must be completed; all regional \nplayers must make their contribution to this process. \nBy bringing about the lifting of the blockade of \nLebanon, and by concretely addressing the issue of \nprisoners, the Secretary-General has laid the \nfoundations for a lasting solution. We thank him for his \neffective work. \n I was in Beirut, Tel Aviv and Ramallah a few \ndays ago, and I realized once again the extent to which \nthe absence of true peace in this region has had a \nnegative effect on civilian populations, particularly in \nthe occupied territories, where the humanitarian \nsituation is getting worse day by day. I also realized the \nextent to which confrontation, violence and despair \ntend to spread and become entrenched. It is this \ngrievous machine that we have to stop. More than ever \nbefore, it is clear that there can be no military solution \nor unilateral solution to the continuing conflicts in the \nregion.  \n On 15 September, the ministers for foreign affairs \nof the European Union reaffirmed our full support for \nthe search for a negotiated solution. We welcomed the \nannouncement by President Abbas with regard to an \nagreement on the formation of a government of \nnational unity, and we expressed the hope that such a \ngovernment\u2019s programme would reflect the principles \nof the Quartet. Two days ago, as we know, the Quartet \ntoo endorsed that position. \n However, persistent tension in the Middle East \nmust not divert our attention from Africa. That \ncontinent continues to be scourged by poverty, disease \nand armed conflict. But at the same time there is hope, \nthanks to the continent\u2019s extraordinary vitality and \ncreativity. Although far too many internal conflicts and \ninternational crises remain in many areas in Africa \u2014 \nfor example, in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire; the Sudan, in particular \nthe Darfur region, where a large-scale humanitarian \ncrisis is looming; the Horn of Africa; and other areas as \nwell \u2014 there are some signs of hope, sometimes fragile \nto be sure, are to be seen in countries as diverse as \nLiberia, Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of \nthe Congo, where an electoral process of \nunprecedented scale is under way with the massive \nsupport of the United Nations and the European Union, \namong other partners. \n The African Union is also playing an increasingly \npositive role in crisis management on the African \ncontinent, as illustrated by its action in Darfur through \nthe African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS). It is \nessential that this crucial action be speedily taken up \nby the deployment of an enlarged United Nations \n \n \n11 06-53323 \n \nmission, as provided for in Security Council resolution \n1706 (2006).  \n With the creation and the operationalization a few \nmonths ago of the Peacebuilding Commission, another \nWorld Summit commitment has now been met. The \nUnited Nations now has an innovative instrument to \nmanage post-conflict situations in order to ensure \noptimal transition from peacekeeping and urgent \nhumanitarian assistance to restarting the development \nprocess. We wish every success to this new body, \nwhich certainly gives rise to great hope throughout the \nworld. \n Before leaving the issue of peace and security, I \nmust briefly mention two subjects that have a major, \nhorizontal impact: terrorism and the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction and their delivery \nsystems.  \n With regard to the scourge of terrorism, concerted \nand decisive action at the international and region \nlevels must obviously be taken. I am pleased that at the \nend of its sixtieth session, under the energetic \npresidency of Mr. Jan Eliasson, whom I congratulate \nfor his work, the General Assembly adopted the United \nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution \n60/288). The Strategy must both address the conditions \nthat encourage the spread of terrorism and seek to \nprevent and act against terrorism, including through the \nvarious bodies of the United Nations, while at the same \ntime guaranteeing respect for human rights and the rule \nof law. As European Union ministers for foreign affairs \ndeclared a few days ago, that latter consideration \napplies in particular to the treatment of all detainees, as \nwell as to the problematic issue of secret detention \ncentres.  \n The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \nand their delivery systems continues to give rise to \ngrave concern at the international level. The attitude \nand the activities of North Korea in the area of nuclear \nproliferation recently led the Security Council \nunanimously to adopt its resolution 1695 (2006).  \n Another subject of concern is Iran. In its \nresolution 1696 (2006), the Security Council defined \nthe main parameters which will guide the way in which \nthe Iranian nuclear issue is approached by the \ninternational community and the European Union, \nwhich has been in discussion with Iran for more than \ntwo years. If those demands \u2014 particularly the \nsuspension of all enrichment activity \u2014 are met, \nnegotiations on a comprehensive agreement can begin \nand confidence can be restored.  \n The Summit Outcome Document (resolution \n60/1) highlighted in particular the importance of \ndevelopment, which directly affects the fate of billions \nof human beings. While 2005 was the year of great \ndevelopment commitments, with the holding of the \nGroup of Eight Summit at Gleneagles and the decision \ntaken by the European Union \u2014 under the Luxembourg \npresidency \u2014 to meet the target of 0.7 per cent of \ngross national income in official development \nassistance by 2015, 2006 has been the year of \nimplementation, particularly with the adoption of \nresolution 60/265, which reflects the international \nconsensus in that area. \n For its part, Luxembourg continues to be proud of \nits participation \u2014 still too limited unfortunately \u2014 in \nthe 0.7 per cent club, with 0.82 per cent of its gross \nnational income devoted to official development \nassistance in 2005. We hope to reach 1 per cent within \nthe next few years.  \n The meeting held earlier this week to consider the \nimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Action \nfor the Least Developed Countries showed once again \nthat the establishment of a true development \npartnership remains a priority and urgent task. \nUnfortunately, that also remains true for international \naction against HIV/AIDS, which was the subject of a \nhigh-level meeting in June.  \n Concerned about improving the quality and \neffectiveness of aid to the most impoverished, my \ncountry looks forward with great interest to the \nproposals of the High-level Panel on United Nations \nSystem-wide Coherence which will be made public in \nthe next few months. The maxim \u201cdevelopment is the \nother name for peace\u201d remains amazingly current.  \n In September 2005, the participants in the \nSummit formally recognized that development, peace, \nsecurity and human rights are linked and mutually \nreinforcing. To strengthen the international framework \nfor the promotion and protection of human rights, the \nGeneral Assembly decided in March 2006, as we know, \nto replace the old Commission on Human Rights with a \nHuman Rights Council. While the new Council\u2019s first \nsession enabled it to make some important progress in \nterms of standards, we must now bolster its \nestablishment by providing it with all the means and \ninstruments it needs \u2014 including special procedures \u2014 \n  \n \n06-53323 12 \n \nto promote the cause of human rights and to react \nswiftly and effectively to specific situations of serious \nhuman rights violations.  \n Likewise, we welcome the recent conclusion of \nthe negotiations on a draft international convention on \nthe rights of persons with disabilities. We hope that \nthat important instrument can be adopted this fall by \nthe General Assembly. Another significant innovation, \nadopted at last year\u2019s Summit \u2014 the notion of the \n\u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d in case of genocide, war \ncrimes, ethnic cleansing or crimes against humanity \u2014 \nshould be applied in accordance with the criteria and \nconditions defined in the Summit Outcome Document \nso that it can progressively become an undisputed \nstandard to guide the action of the international \ncommunity as the situation requires.  \n While peace and security, development and \nhuman rights are the three basic pillars on which the \nUnited Nations is based, those fundamental values can \nbe fulfilled and fully expressed in real terms only \nthrough an effective and credible multilateral system. \nMultilateralism must not remain only a word. In the \nlight of recent events in the Middle East, no nation, \nlarge or small, can escape the conclusion that \nmultilateralism offers the only viable framework for \nfinding solutions to the conflicts and threats that \nconfront us.  \n It is our responsibility to provide the multilateral \nsystem with adequate means to carry out its principal \nmissions. We must also ensure that the working \nmethods and decision-making procedures of our bodies \nare defined and structured so that they can produce the \nbest results and can best meet the legitimate \nexpectations of Member States. Achieving a better \ncost-effectiveness ratio to benefit our peoples must be \nan objective of all Member States, large or small, of \nthe North or the South. What is at stake is the \ncredibility \u2014 perhaps even the survival \u2014 of \nmultilateralism as a way to manage the major problems \nshared by humanity. \n Some progress was made over the past year in \nreforming administrative and financial management, \nbut much remains to be done. We must unite to bring \nabout essential reform to transform the United Nations \ninto an instrument fully capable of addressing the \ngrave and multiple challenges at the beginning of the \ntwenty-first century. \n In that context, we cannot overlook the organ to \nwhich the Charter of the United Nations entrusts a vital \nrole in the maintenance and preservation of \ninternational peace and security: the Security Council. \nFor many years, ways and means to strengthen the \nlegitimacy and effectiveness of that essential body \nwere the subject of in-depth discussions, without any \nsignificant progress being made. For our part, we are \nconvinced that Security Council reform remains \nindispensable. It must be carried out both to strengthen \nthe Council\u2019s representativity \u2014 by increasing the \nnumber of its permanent and non-permanent members, \nbut without overburdening its functioning by granting \nthe right of veto \u2014 and to improve its rules of \nprocedure in order to enhance the effectiveness and \ntransparency of its work and, thus, the legitimacy of its \naction.  \n I should like to conclude by referring to the \nperson who has guided us and provided us with \nbenchmarks as he has led the Organization for the past \n10 years. I am, of course, speaking about our \nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan. Although there is \nstill some time before the end of his mandate \u2014 and I \nam sure that he intends to carry out a number of \nimportant missions before then \u2014 it is important that I \nnow pay tribute to him and thank him for the work \naccomplished over the course of a lifetime devoted to \nserving the Organization. \n The country that I have the honour to represent in \nthis Hall, Luxembourg, also intends to be an important \npart of the life and the future of the Organization, \nwhich, more than 60 years after its establishment, \ncontinues to represent a noble ideal and hope for \nmillions and millions of men and women. Luxembourg \nwants to put itself at the service of that ideal and of the \ninternational community and to shoulder its part of the \nresponsibility in that regard. That is why, five years \nago, we decided to submit our candidacy for a non-\npermanent seat on the Security Council for the \nbiennium 2013-2014. Luxembourg, a founding \nMember of the United Nations that has not yet held a \nCouncil seat, views this candidacy as a new expression \nof its commitment to the purposes and principles of the \nCharter, to peace and security, development and human \nrights and to an effective multilateral system. \n Despite difficulties and obstacles, we must \npersevere, through dialogue and diplomacy, to fashion \na United Nations worthy of our expectations. As we do \nso, let us be inspired by the reflection of the great \n \n \n13 06-53323 \n \nMichelangelo, who said, \u201cThe greatest danger is not \nthat our aim is too high and we miss it, but that it is too \nlow and we reach it\u201d.

        "file_text": "Let me begin my statement \nby echoing the sentiments of those who have \ncongratulated you, Madam on your assumption of the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \nsession, as well as of those who have expressed their \nappreciation for the manner in which your predecessor, \nMr. Jan Eliasson, successfully conducted the business \nof the sixtieth session. In the same vein, I should also \nlike to congratulate the Republic of Montenegro on its \nadmission to the United Nations family. \n I also wish to pay special tribute to the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his vision and exemplary \nleadership of the United Nations over the past 10 years. \nWe commend him for his tireless efforts to assist \nMember States in transforming the United Nations into \na dynamic, relevant and effective instrument for \nmeeting challenges that confront us as we try to make \nthe world a better place for everyone. \n The achievements of the Secretary-General, \nespecially in the area of the promotion of peace and \ndevelopment \u2014 notable among them the Millennium \nSummit in 2000 and the review Summit held last \nyear \u2014 will always be remembered as historic because \nof the important decisions that we made on both \noccasions. As he nears the end of his tenure of his high \nOffice, we wish him the best in his future endeavours \nand hope that he will be available to serve the \ninternational community wherever he may be needed. \n The theme for our debate this year \u2014 \nimplementation of the global partnership for \ndevelopment as a follow-up to the 2005 World \nSummit \u2014 is very appropriate. We acknowledged last \nyear that fighting poverty was a collective undertaking. \nTogether, we recognized that mobilizing financial \nresources for development is central to a global \npartnership for development in support of the \nimplementation of internationally agreed goals, \nincluding the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \n For many years now, the international community \nhas acknowledged the need for accelerated economic \ndevelopment in Africa. There have been many \ninitiatives and programmes of action aimed at \nachieving that objective. Indeed, the history of the \nUnited Nations in the past three decades is littered with \nwell-meaning initiatives, many of which unfortunately \nnever made the transition from theory to practical \nimplementation. \n We have agreed on goals and set targets for \nourselves in our quest to meet our economic and social \ndevelopment challenges. Given this impressive array of \ninitiatives, it is curious and ironic that the aggregate \neconomic performance of our countries has not made a \ndifference in the lives of the majority of our people. \n Mr. Belinga-Eboutou (Cameroon), Vice-President, \ntook the Chair. \n One explanation for our development \npredicament and the many failed initiatives is the wide \ngap between rhetoric and concrete action on the \nground. We have on many occasions agreed on making \navailable the means of implementing agreed goals. We \nhave set targets for making those resources available. \nYet, at the same time, we have witnessed some \ncountries and groups taking concerted action, such as \nillegal economic sanctions, to frustrate our \ndevelopment efforts. \n In the case of Zimbabwe, those countries have \nblocked balance of payments support and other types \nof assistance from the international financial \ninstitutions that they control. Following the heroic and \nsuccessful efforts of the people of Zimbabwe to clear \nrequisite arrears to the International Monetary Fund, \nthose negative forces have manipulated decision-\nmaking at that institution so as to deny us any new \nsupport. They have even tried to restrict investment \ninflows, all on account of political differences between \nthem and us.  \n Is it not a paradox that, while we are denied \nresources for development, funding is readily made \navailable to support elements bent on subverting the \ndemocratically expressed will of the majority of our \ncitizens and to unconstitutionally effect regime \nchange? We condemn such interference in our domestic \n \n \n9 06-52885 \n \naffairs. Let me repeat what I have said before: regime \nchange in Zimbabwe \u2014 as, indeed, in any other \ncountry \u2014 is a right of the people of that country; it \ncan never be a right of people of other countries. The \ngolden key to regime change is in the hands of the \npeople of Zimbabwe and is very well guarded. No one \nfrom Washington or London has the right to that key; it \nis our key and ours alone. \n Let it also not be forgotten that those who want \nregime change are the very same people whom we \nfought yesterday. They represent British colonialism \nand imperialism. We spent many years in jail; I spent \n11 years in jail. Then we went into exile in order to \nmuster the military strength needed to overthrow \ncolonialism. Many of our people died in the process. \nMany were killed by the British regime headed by Ian \nSmith. Finally, our people were victorious. On 18 April \n1980, a representative of the royal family, Prince \nCharles, was sent to lower the British flag. I was there \nto hoist the flag of independence, which today \nrepresents the full sovereignty of the people of \nZimbabwe, never again to be lost. Never again shall \nZimbabwe become a colony. \n And so, these manoeuvres and manipulations \ncontinue, and my Government is well aware of them \nand is well guarded. At every turn, we will take the \nsteps necessary to protect our sovereignty, defend our \npeople and defend our right to continue to ensure that \nthat sovereignty reposes in the hands of the \nZimbabwean people. From this rostrum, I want to warn \nthat any attempt to change that mandate through \nunconstitutional means, by agents sent to undertake a \nprocess that we regard as illegal, will meet with the full \nwrath of the law.  \n It is for that reason that we welcome this debate, \nwhich seeks to address the yawning gap between \nagreed action plans and implementation, and between \nrhetoric and what actually happens on the ground. We \nfully acknowledge that national Governments shoulder \nthe primary responsibility for implementing their \ndevelopment plans, including achieving the MDGs. \nHowever, it is absolutely necessary that our efforts at \nthe national level \u2014 including adopting and \nimplementing correct and relevant programmes \u2014 be \nsupported, not hampered by a lack of international \ncooperation. This session, therefore, would be of great \nvalue if agreement were to be reached on financing for \ndevelopment, including the establishment of \nmechanisms to measure aid flows. Such financing, if it \nis to have a meaningful impact, should be adequate, \npredictable and consistent. \n The HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to cause \nuntold havoc in Africa \u2014 particularly Southern \nAfrica \u2014 owing to high levels of poverty, which make \nit difficult for the affected people to gain access to \nmedication. Zimbabwe welcomes the continuing efforts \nby the international community of nations to find \nlasting solutions to the scourge of HIV/AIDS. We urge \nthe donor community, in cooperation with \npharmaceutical companies, to assist in scaling up \naccess to affordable essential drugs, particularly for \ndeveloping countries. \n The tendency to use assistance in the fight against \nHIV/AIDS as a reward for political compliance and \nmalleability is one that the United Nations should \ncondemn. Given the fact that the pandemic does not \nrespect borders, the denial of assistance to countries on \npolitical grounds, through a self-serving and selective \napproach, will do more harm and weaken international \nefforts to fight the pandemic. For example, in my \ncountry, a Zimbabwean AIDS patient receives, on \naverage, approximately $4 per year in international \nassistance, compared with an average of approximately \n$172 per year for other countries in the region. \nHowever, even against that background, my \nGovernment has registered some modest success in \nreducing the HIV/AIDS prevalence rate from \napproximately 29 per cent in 2000 to 18.1 percent in \n2006, on the strength of its own resources and \nprogrammes. \n While we do not dispute the inevitability of \nmigration, the problem of the brain drain is of great \nconcern to my Government and, indeed, to other \ndeveloping countries. The brain drain has proved to be \na handicap to sustainable development. If it is not \naddressed now, the chances that developing countries \nwill achieve the MDGs by 2015 are minimal. While \ndeveloping countries are losing skilled manpower \nthrough migration, the benefits associated with migrant \nremittances are far less than the cost of developing \nhuman resources and skills. We need to develop \nsolutions that give due recognition and respect to the \ninvestments made by Governments in human resources \nand in developing the skills of citizens, as well as to \nthe human rights of migrants. \n While official development assistance is \ndesirable, what developing countries need more is an \n  \n \n06-52885 10 \n \nopen, rules-based, predictable, non-discriminatory \ntrading and financial system. If developing countries \nare to realize the full potential of international trade to \nenhance economic growth, it is essential that the main \nbarriers to their exports be removed. In that regard, we \nare concerned that tariffs have remained high on \ngoods \u2014 such as textiles and farm products \u2014 that are \nstrategically important to developing economies. Much \ncould be done with the right partnerships and with fair \nterms of trade. We share the view that the \nimplementation of the development aspects of the \nDoha Work Programme will go a long way towards \nassisting developing countries to compete in this global \nvillage. It is therefore disturbing that there has been no \nprogress in breaking the deadlock on the Doha Round \nof international trade negotiations. The failure of \nmultilateral negotiations will give rise to bilateral \narrangements that are inimical to fair trade. We cannot \nhelp but suspect that the breakdown was deliberately \nengineered in order to perpetuate the status quo that \nfavours one group of countries at the expense of \nanother. \n The United Nations is uniquely placed to provide \nthe framework for international cooperation. There is \nconsensus that the United Nations should play a \nfundamental and central role in the promotion of \ninternational cooperation for development. In that \nregard, it is important that coherence and coordination \nbe enhanced, as agreed in the 2005 World Summit \nOutcome. At the country level, the United Nations \nsystem should be effectively coordinated in order to \nsupport national efforts in poverty reduction and \nsustainable development. \n While my Government applauds the United \nNations continuing efforts to elaborate a convention on \nterrorism, we urge Member States to guard against a \nsituation in which established international conventions \nare ignored and resolutions of the General Assembly \nand other United Nations bodies on that issue are \ndisregarded. In our attempt to deal with the scourge of \nterrorism, it is also necessary to address the underlying \ncauses of that phenomenon. To demonstrate its \ncommitment to fighting terrorism, the Parliament of \nZimbabwe has come up with the Suppression of \nForeign and International Terrorism Bill, which seeks \nto fight foreign and international terrorism, as well as \nmercenary activities. \n The recent developments in the Middle East are a \ncause of great concern. We condemn the \ndisproportionate use of force by Israel in Gaza and \nLebanon and the detention of elected Palestinian \nmembers of Parliament and ministers. We firmly reject \nthe collective punishment of the Palestinian and \nLebanese people and the intrusion into their territories \nin violation of international law. We call upon the \ninternational community, particularly the Security \nCouncil and the Quartet, to make every effort to ensure \nthat the brokered ceasefire continues to hold. \n It is sad that the Security Council dithered and \nfailed to take timely action to stop the massacres and \nwanton destruction of civilian infrastructure in \nLebanon, all because of the misguided national \ninterests of one super-Power. The status quo in the \nCouncil, where a few powerful countries hold the \nworld to ransom, is no longer tenable. There is \ntherefore a strong case here for addressing the core \nissue of the democratization of international \ngovernance. Africa remains the only continent that \ndoes not have a permanent seat with veto power in the \nSecurity Council. That situation is unacceptable. It \nneeds to be corrected and corrected now. The position \nof the African Union on that issue is very clear. Africa \ndemands two permanent seats, complete with veto \npower \u2014 if the veto power is to continue \u2014 plus two \nadditional non-permanent seats. We will not \ncompromise on this matter until our concerns are \nadequately addressed.  \n Those who take objection to that are perhaps \nStates that would want to remain in the position in \nwhich they are considered to be superior to everyone \nelse. There cannot be superiority under the Charter of \nthe United Nations, which recognizes the equality of \nnations. We are all equal under that Charter, and that \nprinciple has got to be recognized, but it would appear \nthat some countries that have amassed military power \nover time consider themselves to be superior to all the \nothers because they have that muscle of power. But the \nmuscle of power is not the consideration that we take \ninto account in judging the worth of nations. The \nCharter of the United Nations has got to be taken into \naccount, and who knows whether the Goliath of today \nmay tomorrow not be the same. Anyway, every Goliath \nhas his own David. \n In many parts of Africa, the dawn of an \nunprecedented era of peace and tranquillity has \nallowed us to refocus our attention and resources \ntowards economic development. There can be no better \ntime than now for the international community to \n \n \n11 06-52885 \n \naugment our own efforts to bring home to our people \nthe peace dividend we have so patiently waited for. We \ntherefore call on the international community to renew \nits solidarity with Africa through tangible support in \nthe form of increased resources, decisive debt relief, as \nwell as new and additional financial resources for \ninvestment and growth. \n Let me conclude by reiterating the fact that the \nfuture of the international community is best served by \nan international order that is based on strengthening \nmultilateralism and thereby destroying the present \nunipolar system. It is our conviction that only through \na multilateral approach can we achieve peace and \ndevelopment. For us to successfully tackle the \nchallenges that we face, there is a need for more than \njust pious expressions of solidarity. Together as global \npartners in development, we can guarantee a \nprosperous future for generations to come. Such a \npartnership should be based on the principle of the \nsovereign equality of nations and on mutual benefit. \nThat is the path we should strive to follow. "

        "file_text": "Our President arises in this Assembly as a \nbreath of fresh air and presides as an inspiration to \nwomen, particularly in the Middle East, and to human \nbeings all over the world who treasure the stone that \nthe builder rejects and that becomes the head \ncornerstone. I am sure that her presidency will make a \npositive and lasting impact on our General Assembly. I \nthank her very much for being and doing. \n Humanity\u2019s condition today is difficult, complex \nand challenging, yet pregnant with possibilities for a \nbetter future. Everywhere the faces of men and women \nare strained and anxious; yet, amidst the anxieties, pain \nand sorrows there is joyous laughter, which soothes the \nsoul and summons the human race to embrace the \npromise of a redeeming grace, which eschews hate, \ngreed, callousness, oppression, injustice and violence. \nIt is still possible for this divided world of inequity and \nthe inhumanity of man to man to sing with meaning \nour redemption song of peace and justice, prosperity \nand freedom, democracy and tolerance, unity amidst \ndiversity, equality and mutual respect. \n This quest to mend the broken world is grounded \nin the ideals that constitute the core of the United \nNations. This idealism seeks not a world of perfection, \nbut one of goodness, one of civilization over \nbarbarism, of humanity over inhumanity. The world, \nespecially the majority of its inhabitants who happen to \nbe poor and disadvantaged amidst an orgy of plenty \nthat resides in a minority, looks to the United Nations \nas their hope, as a brightness that illuminates, not \nblinds. I bring this simple but powerful message from a \nsmall, developing country in the nearby Caribbean Sea \non behalf of the marginalized of the world, without the \nvanity of a pretentious hegemony, an arrogance of \npower, or a triumphalism of a presumed manifest \ndestiny. It is both necessary and desirable to speak this \ntruth to power. \n So more than 80 per cent of the people who \nreside in the developing world, and, indeed, all right-\nthinking persons, want and demand in this regard \ncoherent leadership from a reformed United Nations \nthat is true to its central mandate to serve humanity \nwell. Unfortunately, the reformation of the United \nNations is moving at a snail\u2019s pace, which frustrates its \nwork, undermines its efficacy, and damages its \ncredibility. \n To be sure, some modest progress has been made \nby way of the establishment of a new Human Rights \nCouncil and the Peacebuilding Commission. But, \nfrankly, too much time is wasted on fussing and \nfighting on esoteric issues touching and concerning the \nso-called mandate review and management reform, \nrather than focusing on the critical matter of the \nimplementation of the \u201cdevelopment resolution\u201d \nadopted by the General Assembly. In the process, too, \nlet us have a reform of the Security Council that is \nmeaningful and democratic. \n The world\u2019s marginalized and disadvantaged look \naskance at a United Nations that daily seeks to \nchoreograph the dancing of angels on the head of a pin. \nThey care very little for the bureaucratic harangue that \nthe United Nations \u201csystem-wide coherence\u201d has been \naddressed and enhanced, important as that may be for \nsome professional diplomats. The world\u2019s people want \nto know, and to see the practical evidence, that the \nUnited Nations is tackling in a purposeful way the \nissues of global poverty, environmental degradation, \nclimate change, the empowerment of women, the \nprotection of children, the promotion of peace and \nsecurity, the HIV/AIDS pandemic, the provision of \nclean water and an adequate supply of food, among \nother such telling requisites. \n Undoubtedly, many, if not most, of the \nGovernments of the rich and powerful countries show \nsigns of fatigue and disengagement towards the \ndeveloping world. This is evident in their parsimony on \nofficial development assistance and their failure and/or \nneglect to advance meaningfully the Doha \nDevelopment Round. Better must be done here. \n Please note that my strictures are levelled at the \nGovernments of those countries, and not their people \nor their civilizations. Sufficient persuasive evidence \nexists that the people in many, if not most, of these rich \ncountries are sensitive to the concerns of the \ndeveloping world, but their Governments do not \nsufficiently reflect these sensitivities, despite their \noccasional rhetoric to the contrary. Accordingly, the \npeoples and civilizations across national boundaries \nmust link themselves in a tighter nexus or bond, with \nor without the mediating formal state apparatuses, and \nname and shame those Governments that ought to be \nnamed and shamed. \n \n \n27 06-52988 \n \n In this regard, the proposal before the United \nNations for an alliance of civilizations holds immense \npromise, provided that it is not captured by those states \nthat hanker after an ignoble, unattainable, \nunsustainable and fundamentally immoral hegemony. \nOur Caribbean civilization, and its Vincentian \ncomponent, stands ready and willing to be part of this \nmagnificent quest for an ennobling brotherhood and \nsisterhood of humanity. \n While many rich countries turn aside from the \ndevelopment thrust of the world\u2019s marginalized and \ndisadvantaged, there is an encouraging trend towards \nmore and better South-South cooperation. In the case \nof Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, we are benefiting \nfrom a closer integration network through the \nOrganisation of Eastern Caribbean States and the \nCaribbean Community Single Market and Economy. \nFurther, countries such as Cuba, Venezuela, Mexico, \nMalaysia and Taiwan, among others, have special and \nmodel relations with our country. \n Recently, at the Summit of the Heads of State and \nGovernment of the Non-Aligned Movement, held in \nCuba, the leaders of this 118-member body redefined \nits purpose and mandate, in an increasingly unipolar \nworld, to embrace a thorough-going development \nagenda and to facilitate the building of a more \npeaceful, just and secure architecture of international \nrelations. This renewed enthusiasm of the Non-Aligned \nMovement strengthens the hands and voices of those \nwho truly believe that a better, more civilized world is \npossible and nigh. \n Next year, in March, people of African descent \nand all freedom-loving peoples and nations will \ncommemorate and celebrate the two-hundredth \nanniversary of the passage of the act abolishing the \nBritish trade in African slaves to the Caribbean and the \nAmericas. This is an occasion for historical \nreclamation and the righting of historic wrongs. The \ntrade in, and enslavement of, Africans was a monstrous \ncrime against humanity and an exercise in genocide \nunmatched in the history of the Western world. \n European nations and their North American \ncousins have failed and/or refused to acknowledge this \nsufficiently or at all. There has been no apology for this \ncrime against humanity and this genocide, conducted \nover a prolonged period. There has been no practical \nrecompense in the form of reparations to the affected \nnations and peoples in Africa, the Caribbean and the \nAmericas. Surely, this issue must be put squarely on \nthe agenda of the United Nations for speedy resolution. \n Without in any way diluting the force of this \nrepresentation \u2014 indeed in bolstering it \u2014 we find it \nnecessary and desirable to link it in our Caribbean \nregion with the genocide of indigenous peoples, \nincluding the Callinago and the Garifuna of Saint \nVincent and the Grenadines, and the wholly wrong and \ninhumane exploitation by colonialism and imperialism \nof indentured labour from Africa, Madeira, India and \nChina after the abolition of African slavery in the \nCaribbean. Europe has much to answer for on these \nmatters, and should be made to answer properly and \nappropriately. Historic wrongs not righted remain scars \non the soul of the oppressor and the oppressed alike, \nwhich continue to haunt over the ages; it is a hateful \nburden that must be lifted. This dark night must give \nway to a brightened day. \n Of all the tragedies engulfing our modern world, \nfew touch the human soul and spirit as does the \ncondition of the people in Darfur and Palestine. The \nentire world knows who are responsible for the crimes \nagainst humanity in Darfur and in all areas of the \nPalestinian homeland. Yet the basic human and \nnational rights of the people in those geographic \nregions are trampled upon daily by alien forces. \nMeanwhile, the United Nations appears helpless and its \nauthority is undermined. Surely, the time is long past \nfor a resolution of these conflicts, and other enduring \nconflicts worldwide, including Lebanon and Western \nSahara. Oppression will not endure indefinitely. That is \nthe powerful lesson of history. The people\u2019s right to \nself-determination must be fully respected. \n Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is pleased to \nsee Haiti\u2019s restoration to democracy. The cynical ouster \nof the former democratically elected President, Jean-\nBertrand Aristide, in February 2004, ushered in \nimmense suffering in Haiti under a so-called interim \nadministration installed by imperialism. The Haitian \npeople, who endureth for ever, must be applauded for \ntheir commitment to democracy and progress. Their \nelection of President Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val represents a strong \nrebuke of those who mistakenly believe that the \ndangling of money is everything. We heartily \ncongratulate the new Haitian Government and pledge \nto work closely with it in its efforts to develop its \nheroic country, the land of Toussaint L\u2019Ouverture. \n  \n \n06-52988 28 \n \n Saint Vincent and the Grenadines again pleads \nwith the United Nations to permit Taiwan, a democratic \nand progressive country of 23 million people and a \nlegitimate political expression of the Chinese \ncivilization, to be accorded its rightful admission to the \nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies. There is \nno adequate justification for the continued exclusion of \nTaiwan from participation in the numerous global \nexchanges in the several international bodies, including \nthe United Nations. \n Further, the United Nations has a major role to \nplay in ensuring an easing of tensions across the \nTaiwan straits. Aggressive conduct must be restrained \nin a context in which Taiwan is committed to peace and \na comprehensive political dialogue. \n Modern terrorism is a barbarism out of sync with \ncivilized life. It affects adversely not only powerful \nnations, but developing ones in Asia, Africa, Latin \nAmerica and the Caribbean. The evil of terrorism, \nincluding state-sponsored terrorism, must be fought \nrelentlessly. It must be given no space to thrive. At the \nsame time, terrorism must be attacked sensibly and not \nin a counter-productive way. Too many innocent lives \nhave been lost through terrorist acts. Saint Vincent and \nthe Grenadines pledges itself to continue to work \nresolutely and fearlessly, without hypocrisy, with all \nnations and the United Nations, to eliminate the \ndastardly scourge called terrorism and its causes. \n Permit me to thank Secretary-General Kofi \nAnnan for his splendid work at the United Nations and \nthroughout the world. His accomplishments have been \nimmense, and we applaud him as his incumbency \ndraws to a close. We wish him and his family well. \n I conclude by reaffirming that it is our sacred \nduty to humanity and those unborn to ensure that we \ncontribute to a safer, more peaceful, more prosperous, \nmore civilized world. We who have come from \nyesterday with our limiting burdens must face \ntomorrow with our enabling strengths. We must never \nforget that in our work here at the United Nations it \nbecomes possible to glimpse morning before the sun, \npossible to see early where sunset might stain \nanticipated night. Let us thus not sleep to dream, but \ndream to change the world, for the better. "

        "file_text": "On behalf of \nthe Government and the people of the Republic of San \nMarino, I wish to congratulate Her Excellency Haya \nRashed Al-Khalifa on her election as President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-first session. I am \nconfident that her abilities and expertise will be key to \nthe success of this session. Along with my satisfaction \non the election to such a high position of a woman after \nso many years, I add my best wishes. \n I also wish to thank the outgoing President, \nMr. Jan Eliasson, for his valuable work and total \ncommitment and resolve in implementing the reform \nprogramme started by the Secretary-General. \n The Republic of San Marino firmly believes that \nthe role of the United Nations needs strengthening in \norder to enable the Organization to operate as \nefficiently as possible and with optimal coordination \namong its bodies. With special reference to the General \nAssembly, the most important decision-making body of \nthe United Nations, San Marino believes that it should \nfocus more closely on the actual implementation of its \nresolutions and create mechanisms to make its \ndecisions more binding. \n For the small and medium-sized countries that \nrepresent the majority of the Member States, the \nrevitalization of the General Assembly \u2014 the main and \nsometimes only forum in which they can make their \nvoice heard \u2014 is essential. Indeed, the General \nAssembly is the organ that fully implements the \nprinciples of democracy and equal representation upon \nwhich this Organization is founded. \n There is no doubt that Security Council reform is \nthe other major objective of the United Nations. San \nMarino believes that it is necessary to resume dialogue. \nIn our opinion, the new Security Council should be \n  \n \n06-53341 16 \n \nfounded upon a flexible base so that it can adjust \nappropriately to future changes. The enlargement and \ndemocratization of the Council can only improve peace \nprocesses and thereby the defence of the weakest \nMember States. \n San Marino also expresses its deep satisfaction \nwith the new Human Rights Council, which is already \nfully operational. We hope that there will be a clear \ndivision of tasks between the Human Rights Council \nand the General Assembly in order to avoid duplication \nand ensure complementarity and efficiency in a \nbalanced relationship and mutual independence. \n San Marino followed with great interest the \nintense negotiations leading to the adoption on 30 June \nof the resolution on the follow-up to the 2005 World \nSummit, including the Millennium Development \nGoals, and fully endorses the call of the President of \nthe Assembly to focus attention at this general debate \non setting up a global partnership for development. \nThat goal is a fundamental step towards the eradication \nof poverty and the achievement of the other \nMillennium Goals. To do so, however, cooperation at \nall levels is essential and San Marino is ready to make \nits own concrete contribution. \n The development goals are also the key points of \nthe programme that San Marino will present when it \nassumes the chairmanship of the Committee of \nMinisters of the Council of Europe in mid-November. \nDuring its chairmanship, which is extremely important \nto the Republic, San Marino will also address other \nglobal issues, such as intercultural and interreligious \ndialogue. \n The Republic of San Marino, in line with its \ncenturies-old history of peace, democracy and freedom, \nis particularly sensitive to the need, in today\u2019s \ninternational context characterized by growing tensions \nand violent contrasts, to promote dialogue among \ncultures and religions based on respect for diversity \nand universally recognized human rights. \n In that regard, I wish to reiterate the \ndetermination of the Government and institutions of \nSan Marino to guarantee all possible support to the \ninternational community for the achievement of those \nobjectives. It is in that spirit that my country has \nconsistently demonstrated its solidarity with the most \ndisadvantaged people and circumstances and has \nacceded to legal instruments particularly important to \nthe promotion and achievement of international \ncooperation in the search for dialogue and the \naffirmation of the principles of tolerance and \nunderstanding. Thus, intercultural and interreligious \ndialogue constitutes the basis of any peace process and \nthe most powerful tool to reject all forms of extremism, \nwhich unfortunately, as we know, often turns into \nterrorism. \n During our chairmanship of the Committee of \nMinisters, to begin in November, I will seek to \norganize a meeting with the Assembly on that \nimportant subject. \n In that context, we cannot but think of the Middle \nEast, in particular the situation in Lebanon, where the \nUnited Nations is committed to a new difficult peace \nmission, which we sincerely hope will have a \nsuccessful outcome. Only a year ago, San Marino \nexpressed from this rostrum its confidence and hope in \nthe peace process and in the good will of the parties \ninvolved in the protracted conflict. After a series of \nviolent attacks, mostly against civilians and innocent \npeople, as always, the only achievement so far has \nbeen an unstable ceasefire. To help alleviate that \nsuffering, San Marino has decided, in line with its \ncenturies-old tradition of solidarity, to offer a special \ncontribution for humanitarian aid in Lebanon. \n San Marino has welcomed with great satisfaction \nthe establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission as \nthe ideal institutional response to post-conflict \nsituations. The history of my country is deeply rooted \nin the values of peaceful coexistence among all \npeoples, and the newly elected Government has \ndecided to include in its programme, for the first time, \na specific mandate for peace. The objective is to \npromote, also in collaboration with volunteer \nassociations and by supporting international \ncooperation, any useful initiative to affirm and \nsafeguard that important objective. \n Therefore, the institutions of San Marino, in \nresponse to the United Nations appeal, decided to \ncelebrate the International Day of Peace on \n21 September. That occasion was also marked by the \nopening of a public subscription to raise funds for the \nvictims of conflicts to be devolved to the Office of the \nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. \n My country will guarantee its active support for \nthe Pan-European Campaign on Violence against \nWomen, in particular domestic violence, which will be \nlaunched during San Marino\u2019s chairmanship of the \n \n \n17 06-53341 \n \nCommittee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, in \nparallel with the celebration of the International Day \nfor the Elimination of Violence against Women. \nMoreover, it will strongly support the development of \nthe Council of Europe programme \u201cBuilding a Europe \nfor and with Children\u201d. \n Another particularly important occasion will be \nthe participation of San Marino in the United Nations \nGlobal Youth Leadership Summit, which will examine \nthe contribution of young people to the achievement of \nthe Millennium Development Goals, with particular \nreference to sport, development and peace, and will \nprovide the youth organizations with the necessary \nguidelines for future action. \n San Marino greatly appreciates the successful \noutcome of the work of the group established to draft \nan international convention on the protection of \npersons with disabilities. Indeed, my country is \nbecoming increasingly aware of and attentive to the \nproblems and rights of disabled people. In this regard, \nonly two weeks ago, the San Marino Parliament \napproved an agenda inviting the Government to sign \nand ratify the Convention as soon as possible and to \ntake measures in support of the principles contained \ntherein. \n Let me underscore how, despite all the difficulties \nand divisions, the United Nations still demonstrates its \nability to put in place all initiatives and activities \nwhich are at the core of its very existence. It is, \ntherefore, a duty for all States to keep alive the flame \nof ideals and the determination that constitute the \nfoundations of the Organization\u2019s identity and, at the \nsame time, the crucial point of reference for all of our \nactions, both at the national level and also in terms of \ninternational cooperation. \n Prompted by this conviction, and strongly \ncommitted to guaranteeing a constant and constructive \ncontribution, we would like to express our best wishes \nto the President, to the Secretary-General \u2014 to whom \nwe reiterate our most sincere appreciation and highest \nesteem for his dedicated commitment during these \nyears at the helm of the United Nations \u2014 and to all \ncolleagues and representatives who share the same \nconviction.

        "file_text": "At the \noutset, Sir, I would ask you to kindly convey to \nSheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa my warm and \nheartfelt congratulations upon her election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \nsession. My congratulations go also to all the other \nmembers of the Bureau who, I am certain, will help her \nto successfully accomplish her illustrious and sensitive \ndelicate tasks as President. I also take the opportunity \nto pay due tribute to her predecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixtieth \nsession, for the high quality of his work during a term \nof office that took place in a difficult international \nenvironment. \n I cannot continue without expressing my \ngratitude, and that of the entire Congolese people, to \nMr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General, whose mandate \nwill come to an end this year on a positive note for all. \nThanks to the remarkable leadership of that worthy son \nof Africa, the States Members of our Organization have \nenjoyed a decade of intense and active diplomacy \nwhich has made it possible to solve a large number of \nconflicts throughout the world. Here, I should mention \nespecially the situation of the countries of the Great \nLakes region, in particular that of the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo.  \n As the sixty-first session of the General Assembly \nis taking place, my country, the Democratic Republic \nof the Congo, is passing through a special period of its \npolitical history. The transition period that began in \n1990 will soon draw to a close, with the establishment \nof the country\u2019s new institutions.  \n On 30 July, we held countrywide, in a climate of \npeace and transparency, the first truly democratic \npluralistic elections in 40 years. The success of that \nundertaking constitutes a great joint effort by the \nCongolese people and by the bilateral and multilateral \npartners of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I \nwould like to take this opportunity to thank all of those \npartners. \n With regard to the unfortunate events in Kinshasa \nfrom 20 to 22 August 2006 following the \nannouncement of the provisional results of the first \nround of the presidential elections by the Independent \nElectoral Commission, all necessary steps have been \ntaken in order to prevent such incidents from \nhappening again. The electoral process will continue in \na climate of national peace and harmony. \n The progress achieved daily, sometimes at the \ncost of much sacrifice, is the outcome of a difficult \npolitical process that was launched, as members know, \nafter a long internal and external armed conflict. The \nhumanitarian consequences of that conflict are one of \nthe worst tragedies ever experienced by mankind. \n  \n \n06-52885 30 \n \nProblems remain in many sectors, and the next \nGovernment will have to confront them, taking account \nof the urgent and legitimate expectations of the \nCongolese people. \n The new Government must continue integrating \nand reforming the army, in order to guarantee peace \nand security for our people. It must work to improve \nthe living conditions of the population. In other words, \nit must do its utmost to meet their fundamental needs, \nin particular health care, education, food security, basic \ninfrastructures, electricity and drinking water for all \u2014 \nwithout forgetting, of course, the fight against malaria \nand HIV/AIDS and the fight against poverty.  \n In order to succeed, the new Government must, \ninter alia, strengthen good governance by fighting \ncorruption and guaranteeing legal and judiciary \nsecurity in the framework of ongoing judicial reform. It \nwill be possible to achieve that vision only by \nmobilizing the energy of our entire nation through \nactive and inclusive participation by all of the sons and \ndaughters of our country, whatever their political, \nideological or religious convictions may be. \n In that regard, we welcome the configuration of \nour future parliament, which already reflects the wealth \nand political diversity of our people, and which has an \noversight role that will be fundamental to the \nfunctioning of the State. For that reason, I reaffirm my \nfaith in the concept of peacebuilding and make an \nurgent appeal to the international community to \ncontinue its partnerships with the Democratic Republic \nof the Congo after the establishment of the new \ninstitutions. \n As we observe the international scene, we see \nrecurring scourges, including continuing tensions and \narmed conflicts in several regions of the world, the \nworsening the living conditions in developing \ncountries, especially in Africa; the rise in clandestine \nimmigration; the destruction caused by different \npandemics; the increase in crime and acts of terrorism; \nand the harm to the conservation and protection of the \nenvironment. In view of these threats, the Assembly at \nits previous session had organized, as part of its work, \nthe World Summit of heads of State and Government, \ndedicated to an assessment of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and other commitments \nresulting from the major international conferences and \nmeetings.  \n Following that assessment several decisions were \ntaken, including the creation of the Peacebuilding \nCommission and the Human Rights Council \u2014 two \nbasic structures whose effective establishment we can \nonly welcome. Achieving the MDGs is a priority for a \ngood number of countries, especially the most \ndisadvantaged. That is why the momentum in the \nimplementation of the relevant recommendations of the \nMillennium Summit should not weaken. We would like \nto see our discussions here include those issues.  \n In addition to the above-mentioned scourges, \nother matters are a source of concern for our country, \nincluding the reform of the Security Council, the \ncomplete cancellation of the debt of developing \ncountries, an increase in official development \nassistance, the adoption of a comprehensive convention \non international terrorism and the global strategy to \nfight that phenomenon, armed conflicts, collective \nsecurity, and the adoption of an international treaty on \nforced disappearances. All those issues challenge the \nharmonious progress of the community of nations and \nthe very future of coming generations.  \n To meet those challenges effectively, all countries \nof the world must show solidarity with each other, in a \nspirit of sincere cooperation and humanist justice. With \nregard to crises in the world \u2014 in the Middle East, in \nAfrica or elsewhere \u2014 the Democratic Republic of the \nCongo recommends, more than ever, their peaceful \nsolution under the Charter of the United Nations and \nthe relevant resolutions of the Security Council.  \n I hope this Assembly shares my belief in the \nrebirth of the Democratic Republic of the Congo with \nthe advent of new institutions seeking to usher in a new \nera of peace, stability and development, not only in my \ncountry, but also in Central Africa and the entire region \nof the Great Lakes. Despite the challenges our \nOrganization faces day after day, it is on a note of \nhope, of solidarity among nations and of synergy in \ntheir actions for a brighter future for present and future \ngenerations that I conclude my statement. I hope for \nmuch success in our work.  "

        "file_text": "Let me begin by \ncongratulating you, Madam President, on your election \nto the presidency of the General Assembly at this \nsession. I am especially pleased to see a woman in this \nimportant position after a break of nearly 30 years. I \njoin those who have expressed thanks to the Secretary-\nGeneral for his leadership and commitment in recent \nyears in addressing the very serious challenges facing \nthe international community.  \n  \n \n06-53609 14 \n \n Allow me also to take this opportunity to \ncongratulate the Republic of Montenegro on its \naccession to membership of the United Nations. \n The commitment to global partnership for \ndevelopment is a timely, yet sobering, theme in light of \nthe long road we have still to travel and the setbacks \nalready encountered. A major setback has been the \ncrisis in global trade talks. Trade can be the single most \nimportant vehicle for global development, and we \nshould not let the opportunity presented to us by the \nDoha Development Agenda slip from our grasp. We \nmust ensure that gains from trade liberalization benefit \nthe poor and are fairly distributed. Iceland remains \nstrongly committed to the Agenda. \n Many developing countries, particularly in sub-\nSaharan Africa, have little chance of achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals by the target date, \nunless significant additional resources are made \navailable. We welcome and support international \nefforts for debt relief to the poorest countries. We also \napplaud those countries that have committed to \nincreasing official development assistance. Iceland is \nalso shouldering its responsibility. Over the next three \nyears Iceland\u2019s development assistance will have \nalmost tripled in size, and we are determined to do \neven more. Beyond 2009 our assistance should \nincrease even further, with the ambition of reaching the \nUnited Nations target of 0.7 per cent of gross national \nincome. \n The global partnership rests on the principles of \ntransparency, accountability, good governance, equity \nand commitment to poverty reduction. Iceland also \nattaches special importance to the rights of women and \nchildren. As the Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner, \nShirin Ebadi, so rightly pointed out in her Nobel Peace \nPrize Lecture on 10 December 2003, \n \u201cTo disregard women and bar them from active \nparticipation in political, social, economic and \ncultural life would in fact be tantamount to \ndepriving the entire population of every society \nof half its capability.\u201d  \n We want to see more determined efforts by \ndevelopment partners and United Nations agencies to \npursue gender equality. The work of the United Nations \nDevelopment Fund for Women (UNIFEM) must be \ngiven more weight within the United Nations. Iceland \nhas increased its support for the work of UNIFEM \nmore than tenfold over the past two years, and we will \nincrease our support even further.  \n The mission statement of the United Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) correctly insists that the \nsurvival, protection and development of children are \ncentral to human progress. Nobody questions this \nstatement, yet more than 10 million children die from \npreventable causes every year. Iceland will further \nincrease its contributions to the vital work of UNICEF. \nI am proud to say that the people of Iceland have been \nparticularly active and make the highest contribution \nper capita of national societies to UNICEF. \n At least half of the eight Millennium \nDevelopment Goals relate to resource use and \nenvironmental conservation, that is, to sustainable \ndevelopment. We will not be able to eradicate extreme \npoverty or hunger if we cannot safeguard the \nenvironment, the basis of food security around the \nworld. We cannot hope to reduce child mortality unless \nwe deal with the contamination of fresh water. There is \na close relationship between the health of the earth\u2019s \necosystem and human welfare, security and peace. \nIcelanders base their livelihood on the living resources \nof the sea and abundant renewable energy. Iceland rose \nfrom relatively recent poverty to affluence through the \napplication of technological innovations and by \ndrawing on international cooperation. We are \nconvinced that our success could be replicated in many \nother parts of the world, given the right incentives and \nan enabling environment. \n In this connection, I should like to refer in \nparticular to two areas of sustainable development: \nocean issues and energy issues.  \n Ocean issues have far-reaching development \nimplications. Ninety-five per cent of those who make \ntheir living from fisheries are in the developing world. \nA billion people depend on fisheries for their main \nintake of protein. At the same time, we are seeing a \nrapid increase in pollution of the ocean and depletion \nof its living resources. That is why Iceland has \nprioritized this area in its development cooperation and \nin the work of the fisheries department of the United \nNations University in Iceland.  \n Energy issues also loom large. While Icelanders \nenjoy the good fortune of having clean, renewable \nenergy for 70 per cent of our total energy use, energy \nissues are increasingly becoming one of the main \ndrivers of the sustainable development agenda within \n \n \n15 06-53609 \n \nthe United Nations. Two billion people lack access to \nelectricity. All eight Millennium Development Goals \nwill require greater energy consumption.  \n Unfortunately, more energy consumption in most \ncases means greater greenhouse gas emissions. One of \nour greatest challenges today is to square the \ndevelopment circle, to meet our development needs \nwhile safeguarding the environment. One way certainly \nis to increase substantially the share of renewables in \nworld energy demand. That is why Iceland is taking an \nactive part in promoting renewables and new \ntechnologies through its development cooperation and \nthe work of the geothermal department of the United \nNations University. Another example of our \ncommitment in this area is the international seminar on \nhydrogen use for the developing world, to be held in \nReykjavik later this week. It will be co-hosted by \nIceland and the United Nations Department of \nEconomic and Social Affairs. \n Much has been achieved over the past 12 months \nin implementing the outcome of the World Summit. In \nthis connection, I join others in expressing appreciation \nfor the outstanding work done by Jan Eliasson as \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixtieth \nsession. We now have a Peacebuilding Commission. \nThe new Human Rights Council has also been \nestablished. It is the duty of all of us to make sure that \nwe strengthen its credibility and turn it into a powerful \ndefender and reinforcer of basic human rights. Its \ncredibility will depend to a large extent on its even-\nhandedness.  \n Useful work has already been done on internal \nreform of the United Nations. The success of these \nreforms \u2014 I think in particular of the mandate \nreview \u2014 will affect the long-term credibility of the \nUnited Nations. It is with great interest and high hopes \nthat we await the outcome of the work of the High-\nlevel Panel on System-wide Coherence. \n Peace and security is fundamental to \nimplementing a global partnership for development. In \nthe face of the crippling effects of terrorism, we \nwelcome the agreement on the Global Counter-\nTerrorism Strategy. In the fight against terrorism, \nhuman rights must not be compromised; otherwise, we \nundermine the values that we seek to defend. Torture \ncannot be justified. As we have seen recently, years of \ncareful development can be reversed almost overnight \nby war. Conflict prevention, restraint by the parties \ninvolved and a commitment by other actors to urge \nrestraint, rather than encourage conflict, are also \nfundamental to the partnership. \n Sixty years ago, on 19 November 1946, Iceland \nbecame a Member of the United Nations. Iceland has \nsince then strongly supported the principles of the \nUnited Nations as written in the Charter. With the full \nsupport of the other Nordic countries \u2014 Denmark, \nFinland, Norway and Sweden \u2014 Iceland decided in \n1998 to present for the first time its candidature for a \nseat on the Security Council for the period 2009-2010, \nwith elections to be held in 2008. This candidature, \nwhich was declared within the Western European and \nOthers Group in April 2000, is based on our readiness \nto shoulder the responsibility of serving on the United \nNations body charged with maintaining and \nstrengthening peace and security. As one of the almost \n100 smaller States of the United Nations, Iceland \nmakes every endeavour to cultivate mutually beneficial \nrelations with all Members of the Organization and \nbelieves itself to be favourably positioned to exercise \nwith fairness and firmness the role of a Security \nCouncil member. \n The task of building a global partnership for \ndevelopment is not easy. But it is the only way in \nwhich we can realistically address the challenges \nfacing us, whether they be challenges of poverty, \nsecurity, the environment or health. As Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan has put it, \u201cthe cause of larger \nfreedom can only be advanced by broad, deep and \nsustained global cooperation among States\u201d. "

        "file_text": "I first congratulate Her \nExcellency Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her \nelection as the third female President of the General \nAssembly. I firmly believe that the involvement of \nwomen in the decision-making processes at the \nnational and international levels can contribute to the \nbetter management of today\u2019s global problems. In \nfulfilling her challenging tasks during the sixty-first \nsession, the President may rest assured of the support \nand cooperation of the representatives of the Republic \nof Hungary. I also wish to salute her predecessor, \nAmbassador Jan Eliasson, who served us with \ndistinction, dedication, an innovative spirit and a good \nsense of humour. He made great efforts and \nachievements to advance the reform of the United \nNations. \n During the 2005 World Summit, our heads of \nState or Government agreed to proposals with the \npotential to adapt the world Organization to the \nrealities of our contemporary world. While we have \naccomplished only modest reforms so far, we should \nremind ourselves that United Nations reform is more a \nprocess than a single event. \n In order to foster public confidence in the United \nNations, we must agree on substantial management \nreform, with greater accountability and transparency \nand better allocation of resources. The reform process \nshould include all the main bodies of this Organization, \nincluding the General Assembly, which, in our view, \nmust remain the most important deliberative body of \nthe Organization. \n Hungary supports the expansion of the Security \nCouncil in both the permanent and non-permanent \ncategories to better reflect the political realities of \ntoday. However, new approaches need to be identified \nto facilitate the emergence of a compromise. The \nenlargement of the Council should be combined with \nenhanced efficiency and improved working methods. \n Hungary condemns all forms of terrorism, which \ngive rise to fear and distrust in our daily lives. It is our \nfirm conviction that the United Nations should remain \na key player in the international fight against the \nscourge of terror. It is therefore natural that Hungary \nwelcomes the recent adoption of the new United \nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution \n60/288) and looks forward to the elaboration of a \ncomprehensive convention on terrorism by the General \nAssembly. \n The establishment of the Peacebuilding \nCommission was one of our top priorities. We believe \nthat the Commission is well equipped to deal with \nfragile post-conflict situations. \n With the establishment of the Human Rights \nCouncil, the international community has opened a \nwhole new chapter in its joint efforts to protect human \nrights. My Government has wholeheartedly supported \nthis ambitious project from the outset. We sincerely \nhope that with the completion of the Council\u2019s first \nyear of existence, adequate machinery will be put in \nplace to address the challenges of the twenty-first \ncentury. The universal periodic review is one of the \ninitiatives on the Council\u2019s agenda and holds the \npromise of making a real difference. The full and \nunhindered participation of non-governmental \norganizations in the activities of the Council is also of \nvital importance for us. \n Protection of minority rights, including those of \nnational minorities, is a pivotal element of Hungary\u2019s \nhuman rights policies. The turbulent history of our \nregion has all too often demonstrated the potential of \ninter-ethnic tensions to trigger crisis situations. \nConflicts based on ethnicity, both past and present, \nmust remind us all that multi-ethnic societies are in \ndesperate need of a sensitive and careful approach to \nminority issues, sound legal arrangements, generosity \nin practice and firmly embedded institutional \nguarantees, safeguarding the rights of minorities. \n The interdependence of democracy and human \nrights is clearly demonstrated in countries and regions \nwith a deficit of democratic practices. As the late \nSergio Vieira de Mello, former High Commissioner for \nHuman Rights, stated so eloquently, \u201cImperfect as the \nship of democracy may be, no other vessel has proved \n  \n \n06-53329 28 \n \nas seaworthy in bringing us safely to the shores of \nhuman dignity\u201d. \n Driven by the policy objective of promoting \ndemocracy, the Government of Hungary launched the \nInternational Centre for Democratic Transition last \nyear in Budapest. The Centre intends to provide \nguidance regarding transition in a supportive manner \nby collecting experience from past democratic \ntransitions and sharing it with those determined to \nfollow that path. Hungary fully supported the \nSecretary-General\u2019s decision to establish the United \nNations Democracy Fund. Being a member of the \nAdvisory Board and a contributor to the Fund, we are \npleased to recognize that the projects approved by the \nFund properly reflect local, regional and global \ndemands. \n Fifty years have passed since the citizens of \nHungary rose up against a brutal dictatorship, \ndemanding democracy, human rights and dignity. The \ntotalitarian regime crushed the dreams of the \nHungarian revolution and took cruel revenge during its \nreturn to power on top of foreign tanks. \n The spirit of 1956, however, was not to be \ndefeated. Fifty years ago, the Hungarian revolution \nbegan with a peaceful demonstration to show solidarity \nwith the Polish nation. Today, I am proud to confirm \nthat Hungary will show solidarity with every nation \nthat seeks freedom and democracy for its people. \n It is my moral obligation to express our profound \nrespect for the activities of the dedicated politicians \nand diplomats who kept the so-called Hungarian \nquestion on the agenda of the world Organization for \nseveral years. Hungary will never forget the devotion \nof Povl Bang-Jensen, the Danish United Nations \nofficer who served as Secretary of the United Nations \nCommittee entrusted with the examination of the \nHungarian events of 1956. His efforts and sacrifice \nmade for the sake of the Hungarian revolution are \netched on our collective memory forever. \n The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \nand their delivery systems constitutes a major threat to \ninternational peace and security. The most important \nchallenge faced by the international community in this \ncontext is non-compliance with the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). My \nGovernment sincerely hopes that the next NPT review \ncycle will ultimately bring tangible results, and it urges \nall nations to make genuine contributions to that effect. \n Working out lasting solutions for unresolved \nissues relating to the western Balkans is of paramount \nimportance for peace and stability in the European \ncontinent. Hungary is convinced that the success of the \nstatus talks in Kosovo will depend on the ability of the \nparties to build mutually acceptable arrangements, \nwhich, in turn, will require a proper time frame. A \nfunctioning multicultural society in Kosovo is \ninseparable from the sincere implementation of \nstandards, respect for minority rights and effective \ndecentralization, all of which are essential \npreconditions for the successful outcome of the status \ntalks. \n Hungary is fully committed to a just and lasting \npeace in the Middle East. It is essential to revitalize the \npeace process on the basis of the Road Map and other \nagreements accepted by the parties concerned. Israel \nhas the right to live in peace and security, and the \nPalestinians have the right to an independent and \nviable Palestinian State peacefully coexisting with its \nneighbours. \n Peace and stability in Lebanon are vitally \nimportant for the entire Middle East. The international \ncommunity, along with the parties concerned, must \nmake every effort to ensure the swift and full \nimplementation of Security Council resolution 1701 \n(2006). \n The Republic of Hungary is strongly committed \nto building a peaceful and stable Afghanistan. Our \nresolve has been manifested by my Government\u2019s \nrecent decision to take over the leadership of the \nProvincial Reconstruction Team in Baghlan province. \nAlthough major efforts are being undertaken by the \ninternational community to assist in the reconstruction \nprocess in Afghanistan, the primary responsibility for \nthe stabilization and development of the country lies \nwith the Afghan people themselves. \n Hungary remains gravely concerned about the \nprolonged and dramatic security situation in Iraq. We \nwelcome the resolve of the Iraqi Government to engage \nall communities in order to achieve reconciliation and \nstrengthen national cohesion. I would like to reiterate \nHungary\u2019s continued commitment to assisting the \npeople of Iraq in their endeavour to build a free and \nprosperous country. \n The deteriorating situation in Darfur is another \nmatter of grave concern. The Government of the Sudan \nshould agree to the swift deployment of a United \n \n \n29 06-53329 \n \nNations peacekeeping force with a mission to halt the \nunfolding humanitarian catastrophe. In this regard, \nHungary also hopes that at this session the General \nAssembly will make advances in the elaboration of the \nimportant concept of the responsibility to protect. \n Six years ago, the Governments of the world \nmade a solemn pledge to strive to eliminate global \npoverty by signing the Millennium Declaration \n(resolution 55/2). A great deal remains to be done to \nachieve the objectives set out in the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, in developing countries, by the \ndonor community and here at the United Nations. We \nneed to make sure that development, in rich and poor \ncountries alike, is sustainable. As a new EU member, \nHungary is gradually increasing its official \ndevelopment assistance and recognizes the special \ndevelopment needs of the world\u2019s poorest regions. \n In conclusion, I would like to thank and \ncommend the outgoing Secretary-General for his \ntireless efforts during the past 10 years, often under \ndifficult and challenging circumstances, to promote the \nprinciples of the Charter. His devotion, diplomatic \nskills and vision have earned him profound respect all \nover the world. "

        "file_text": "Allow me, Madam, to \nadd my heartiest congratulations to you on being the \nthird woman in the history of the United Nations to be \nelected President of the General Assembly, particularly \nat such a critical moment. Your election is an \ninspiration for women everywhere who are struggling \nto achieve equality and opportunity. You illustrate the \ntruth that, as Plato wrote 2,400 years ago, any society \nthat does not exploit the talents of its women is wasting \nhalf of its resources. I also wish to congratulate and \nthank your predecessor, my friend and colleague Jan \nEliasson, for all he worked so hard to achieve during \nhis term.  \n While we are recognizing service to the United \nNations, we would be remiss if we did not extend our \nappreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan. I want \nto express the appreciation of my Government for all \nhis efforts to maintain and strengthen the prestige and \nmoral authority of the Organization.  \n I would also like to welcome Montenegro to the \nfamily of States. \n(spoke in French) \n Greece fully aligns itself with the statement made \nby the President of Finland on behalf of the European \nUnion (EU). We would also like to express our views \non the major questions that the United Nations will be \ndealing with in the session that is now opening. \n It is just the beginning of the twenty-first century, \nand the future looks threatening: we see poverty, war, \nhumanitarian crises, refugee flows, terrorism, arms \nproliferation, human trafficking, drugs, sectarian \nviolence, environmental degradation and natural \ndisasters. In order to understand the full extent of these \ncalamities, we must identify and understand, and then \ndeal with, their roots, which have been formed over the \ncenturies. We have to unite the force of our ideas and \nresources and mobilize what we have in common \u2014 \nthat is, our humanity. As taught to us by the \nphilosopher Isocrates, the condition for peace is not \nmoney, which buys men, or force, which subjugates \nthem; it is the all-encompassing power of goodwill. \n The United Nations is a unique forum, the place \nwhere, as individuals and as nations, we offer the best \nof ourselves. We need this Organization to be strong \nand productive. We draw from it the strength that frees \nus from mistrust to overcome conflicts, the strength \nthat allows us to move forwards towards greater \nunderstanding and tolerance. \n Terrorism is the scourge of our times. It is a blind \nevil that takes no account of our religion, our race or \nour gender. This danger must be confronted \ncollectively. It is neither possible nor desirable to \nconfront it alone. We will firmly support the efforts \nundertaken by the Security Council\u2019s Counter-\nTerrorism Committee, and we are prepared to provide \nit with all necessary assistance. Finally, we would like \nto support the counter-terrorism policy that the \nSecretary-General will soon be presenting to the \nGeneral Assembly. The best way to confront terrorism \nis to promote peace, tolerance, the acceptance of others \nand, above all, development: no longer to abandon \nanyone by the wayside and to give everyone the \nopportunity to access what is essential for life. \n In the light of what I have said, and bearing in \nmind the General Assembly\u2019s main theme for this \nyear \u2014 to create a global partnership for \ndevelopment \u2014 this is both timely and appropriate. \nTranslating this vision into fact must happen at the \nglobal level, and for this we need significant \nparticipation by all countries in the economic and \nfinancial decision-making process. The International \nMonetary Fund\u2019s recent decision to increase the voting \nrights of countries such as China and India is an \nimportant step in the right direction. \n The news coming from the Doha round, however, \nis not encouraging. The clock is ticking; and each day \nit becomes even more important for all parties to put \ntheir shoulders to the wheel to reach an agreement, \nwith the objective of creating an effective multilateral \n  \n \n06-53323 22 \n \ntrading system. The winners will be the developing \ncountries \u2014 but also the developed countries. \n Equally important is the need to achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals in line with the agenda \nestablished by heads of State or Government at the \nSummits of 2000 and 2005. Among our objectives, \nclearly, is to reach the critical threshold of 0.7 per cent \nof gross national income to be allocated for official \ndevelopment assistance to the countries most seriously \naffected by economic difficulties. That is the keystone \nof a global partnership for development, which we are \ncommitted to forging as soon as possible. \n Developing countries, for their part, need to \nfollow sensible economic policies. They need to \nundertaken reforms that will encourage growth, and \nthey need to finally improve governance by creating \ninstitutions that are accountable and operate with \ncomplete transparency. It is only together, through \ncollective action, that we will be able to correct the \ninequalities that are at the root of many of the conflicts \nin the world. \n Allow me to stress in this respect that Africa must \nbe the highest of our priorities. We must pay heed to \nthe dormant conflicts in West Africa, East Africa and \nCentral Africa if we want to avoid the kinds of crises \nbeing played out in the Sudan and other countries on \nthe continent. The African Union is best placed to put \nan end to these conflicts, and we must help it by \nfinding lasting solutions to the problems that make life \nso cruel in very many of these regions. \n Another urgent need is to act effectively and \nspeedily to put an end to the suffering of the \npopulations of these countries, so that we no longer see \nbabies dying of AIDS when a few dollars\u2019 worth of \nmedicines can save them. \n(spoke in English) \n The tensions in the Middle East demand equal \nattention. The Middle East is the region that will test \nthe mettle of this Organization as a force for peace in \nthe immediate future. If we fail in that test, all of us \nstand to pay a heavy price. During the past several \nmonths, we all witnessed unforgettable images of \nsuffering and destruction in that part of the world. \n The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is at the root of \nmost problems in the region, and it is obvious that it \nshould be at the top of the list of our priorities if peace \nand stability are to return to that area. The Road Map \noffers the strategic plan for a solution based on the \nprinciple of land for peace, especially since basic \nelements of it are well known and generally accepted \nby the international community. The Road Map is in \nessence a performance-driven guide to a settlement \nbased on all relevant Security Council resolutions, \nincluding resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), and \non the conclusions of the Madrid Conference and the \nBeirut Arab Summit. We must all make every effort to \nsee that they are implemented. \n On Lebanon, strict implementation of Security \nCouncil resolution 1701 (2006) provides the blueprint \nfor resolving the basic problems that led to the recent \ncrisis. We understand the difficulties before us, but we \nmust push ahead resolutely, because determination and \ntenacity are essential to tackling long-standing issues \nin volatile regions. \n The continued violence and instability in Iraq are \na cause of great concern for all of us. It is critical that \nevery possible effort be made to bring order and unity \nto that troubled country. Deaths, especially of civilians, \nhave reached terrifying levels, with no end in sight to \nthe slaughter. All who have any influence with the \nwarring factions in Iraq must try to make them see \nwhat pain and suffering they have inflicted on their \nown people and what yet worse horrors they will \nunleash on their land if they continue to drift towards a \ndevastating civil war. \n Our own region, the Balkans, was once known as \nhistory\u2019s cauldron. We endured a century of bitter \nethnic, religious and ideological conflicts, up to very \nrecent times. We are moving rapidly, however, to \ndisown that label for the sake of our own peoples and \nof the new Europe we are building. Some trouble spots \nremain, but we are trying to deal with them in a new \nspirit of cooperation and tolerance. \n Kosovo is one issue that still needs attention. The \nstatus talks are under way, and we hope that they will \nproduce a viable settlement that will strengthen the \nsecurity and stability of the entire region. Right now, \nthis appears difficult. To overcome the impasse will \nrequire patient and careful diplomacy. Our goal in \nreaching a viable long-term solution should not be \ncompromised by setting an artificial deadline. \n I deeply regret the fact that the Cyprus problem \nremains unresolved. For all 32 years of the military \noccupation of one third of the territory of Cyprus by \nwell over 40,000 Turkish troops, Greece has strongly \n \n \n23 06-53323 \n \nsupported every United Nations initiative aimed at the \nachievement of a comprehensive solution. We are \ncommitted to doing everything possible to achieve a \njust and viable solution, on the basis of the pertinent \nSecurity Council resolutions and of EU principles and \nvalues. We strive for a bizonal, bicommunal federation \nthat will bring peace and prosperity to the island. Our \ngoal remains a solution agreed between the two \ncommunities without arbitration and tight timetables, \nto be approved subsequently by referendums. To those \nefforts we are prepared to lend our wholehearted \nsupport. \n Greece\u2019s foreign and security policy is based on \nthe principles enshrined in the Charter, especially those \nrelating to the peaceful settlement of disputes and \ngood-neighbourly relations. This basic framework is \nalso reflected in my country\u2019s continuing efforts to \nfurther improve relations with Turkey and to \nconsolidate mutual understanding and cooperation. For \nour part, we are trying to overcome the remaining \ndifficulties and are continuing to take initiatives to \nwiden and deepen cooperation in all fields so that the \nrelationship with Turkey becomes a win-win situation \nfor both countries. In this context, we are hopeful that \nTurkey will reciprocate so that our countries can \nsolidify good-neighbourly relations. \n European integration is the bright promise on the \nhorizon for the entire region of South-Eastern \nEurope \u2014 a future which will encompass greater \ncooperation and interaction among all the countries in \nthe area and at long last heal the wounds of the past \ncentury. \n We live in a troubled world, and the United \nNations is always enmeshed in the worst of the \ntroubles so that it sometimes seems that it is not \naccomplishing much. We must not forget, however, the \nconflicts it has resolved, the misery it has diminished, \nthe suffering it has relieved and the pain it has eased all \nover the world in its brief lifetime. \n \u201cMan feeds on dreams of hope\u201d, Aeschylus \nwrote. For men, women and children everywhere, the \nUnited Nations remains the best hope there is. "

        "file_text": "At the outset, I \nwould like to congratulate Ms. Haya Rashed \nAl-Khalifa on her election to the presidency of the \nsixty-first session of the General Assembly and wish \nher every success during her tenure. \n I would like also to extend my sincere thanks to \nher predecessor, my good friend Mr. Jan Eliasson, \nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Sweden, for his efforts \nand active work with the delegations throughout the \nlast session. \n The 2005 High-level Plenary Meeting of the \nAssembly became an important milestone in the history \nof the United Nations. It reaffirmed our faith in the \nOrganization and our unwavering interest to make it \nstronger and effective. I am pleased to emphasize the \npositive moves that we have made since last September \non issues such as development, the environment, \nHIV/AIDS, Secretariat reform, establishment of the \nCentral Emergency Response Fund and the \nPeacebuilding Fund.  \n The founding of the Peacebuilding Commission \nand the Human Rights Council are remarkable \nmoments in the history of the United Nations. Yet more \nremains to be done to realize our common vision of \nsolidarity and collective security, which is premised on \nthe shared values and principles of the Charter. \n As we move towards such ambitious goals, it is \nincreasingly apparent that multilateralism with a strong \nUnited Nations at its core remains the only reliable \ninstrument for maintaining international peace and \nsecurity, achieving sustainable development and \npromoting respect for human rights and fundamental \nfreedoms. \n Strengthening the deliberative and decision-\nmaking authority of the General Assembly, which \nrepresents the views of all Member States, is key to the \nsuccessful implementation and effectiveness of the \nreforms. \n Azerbaijan believes that reform of the Security \nCouncil should not be confined to enlargement of its \nmembership. We stand for the rationalization of the \nCouncil\u2019s working methods, greater transparency in \ndecision-making, accountability in performance and \nfull implementation of its resolutions. \n The election of the new Secretary-General is an \nevent of the utmost importance for the Organization. It \nhas already been revealed to suffer from a number of \ndeficiencies and requires greater transparency and \ninclusion of the wider membership. Azerbaijan \nbelieves that the new head of the United Nations \nshould clearly recognize the trends and challenges \nfaced by the international community at the beginning \nof the twenty-first century. \n Azerbaijan regrets that the late response of the \nSecurity Council to the evolving crisis in the Middle \nEast allowed the humanitarian tragedy to unfold. In \nthat regard, implementation of the measures contained \nin Security Council resolution 1701 (2006), including \nthose related to the Lebanese Government\u2019s seven-\npoint peace plan, is very important for bringing durable \npeace to the Middle East. Azerbaijan will continue its \nefforts to contribute to the peaceful resolution of the \nconflict and alleviate the sufferings of civilians in \nLebanon. \n I would like to express profound support for the \nStates that have fallen victim to terrorist attacks. While \nstrongly condemning terrorism in all its forms and \nmanifestations and reaffirming our commitment to \njointly fight that global scourge, we register our serious \nconcern over attempts to link terrorism to the Islamic \nreligion, culture or people. \n There is a dire need to stop and reverse a growing \ntendency towards Islamophobia in the world. \nAzerbaijan, in its capacity as Chairman of the \nMinisterial Council of the Organization of the Islamic \nConference (OIC) calls upon Member States to \nundertake concrete measures to enhance dialogue and \n \n \n21 06-53341 \n \nbroaden understanding among nations, cultures and \nreligions by promoting tolerance and respect for \nfreedom of religion and belief. It is of vital importance \nto raise public awareness about the tenets and values of \nIslam worldwide, including in the Muslim societies. To \nthat end, we plan to host in Baku in 2007, under the \naegis of the OIC, an international conference on the \nrole of the mass media in developing tolerance and \nmutual understanding. \n The situation in the occupied territories of \nAzerbaijan has recently become a subject of urgent \nconsideration by the General Assembly, due to the \nmassive fires occurring in those territories. The \nAssembly adopted without a vote a resolution stressing \nthe necessity to conduct an urgent environmental \noperation with a view to suppressing the fires, \novercoming their detrimental impact and rehabilitating \nthe affected territories. The resolution has a two-fold \npurpose. On the one hand, it envisages a number of \npractical steps, including an assessment of the short- \nand long-term impact of the fires on the environment \nas a step in preparation for the environmental \noperation, counteracting the environmental degradation \nof the region, and the rehabilitation of the fire-affected \npart of the occupied territories of Azerbaijan. On the \nother, it serves as an unprecedented example of \nengaging the parties to the conflict, particularly \nArmenia and Azerbaijan, in a joint environmental \noperation to be carried out directly in the fire-affected \nzone. The implementation of the resolution will \ncontribute to establishing an atmosphere of trust and \nconfidence and will give positive impetus to the \nnegotiation process. \n Sadly, that is the only positive development so far \nand cannot be attributed to the overall situation \nconcerning the settlement process. Although no \nsubstantial progress has been registered so far, the \nparties and mediators have accepted the stage-by-stage \napproach in the settlement process as the only possible \noption. Basically, there are two main issues on which \nthe parties disagree \u2014 the definition of the status of \nself-rule for the population of the occupied Nagorny \nKarabakh region and the withdrawal of Armenian \nforces from all the occupied territories of Azerbaijan. \n There is a common understanding that the status \ncannot be defined today. It should be elaborated \nthrough a peaceful, democratic and legal process with \nthe direct participation and consent of both Azerbaijani \nand Armenian communities of the Nagorny Karabakh \nregion. To that end, the Armenian occupying forces \nhave to withdraw from the occupied territories and the \nnecessary conditions have to be in place to allow the \nsecure and dignified return of the indigenous \nAzerbaijani displaced persons to the Nagorny \nKarabakh region and the surrounding territories of \nAzerbaijan. \n Such a logical chain of events will establish the \nnecessary conditions for the next stage of the \nsettlement, which is normalizing life in the conflict-\naffected area, restoring intercommunal relations, \nlaunching socio-economic development and \nconsidering appropriate models of self-rule for the \nentire population of the region within Azerbaijan. \n Our position is based on relevant resolutions of \nthe Security Council and decisions of the Organization \nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe, which \nunequivocally demand the unconditional withdrawal of \nthe occupying forces from all occupied territories of \nthe Republic of Azerbaijan, the restoration of its \nsovereignty and territorial integrity, the creation of \nfavourable conditions for the safe return of the civilian \npopulation, the restoration of intercommunal relations, \nand the elaboration of the status of self-government \nwithin a democratic and legal process, based on the \nagreement of both communities of the region. \n It is difficult to hope for a breakthrough in the \nnegotiations when Armenia rejects face-to-face \nmeetings and refuses to take a constructive approach to \nsolving existing problems. What is more worrisome is \nthat Armenia is attempting to support by all available \nmeans the separatist regime established under its \ncontrol in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan and to \nspread myths and legends about the historical past and \nthe alleged democratic and economic achievements of \nthe regime. As a matter of fact, the reality on the \nground proves the opposite. The Armenian community, \nwhich is the only remaining part of the entire \npopulation of the Nagorny Karabakh region of \nAzerbaijan, is increasingly inclined to leave the \nunrecognized quasi-entity due to worsening living \nconditions and the lack of any prospect of economic \nand social development. \n The dynamics of development of the entire region \nare strikingly evident, and in five or 10 years the \neconomic growth of the region vis-\u00e0-vis Armenia will \nbe much more impressive. It could be given a chance \nto join ongoing regional and transnational projects, but \n  \n \n06-53341 22 \n \nprior to that Yerevan has to take a number of steps to \nestablish normal relations with its neighbours. \n The first plenary meetings of the Assembly under \nthe presidency of Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa \nwere marked by an extremely difficult debate over an \nissue that was procedural in nature, but had a \nsubstantial political bearing. I join my colleagues from \nthe States members of the Georgia, Ukraine, \nAzerbaijan, Moldova Organization for Democracy and \nEconomic Development (GUAM) in commending her \nwisdom and efforts aimed at ensuring that the rules of \nthis house serve the interests of all Member States. \nProcedural disadvantages should not constrain the \nMember States from bringing critical issues affecting \ntheir security to the attention of the Assembly. \n The GUAM heads of State, in their Joint \nDeclaration on the issue of conflict settlement, called \nupon States and international organizations to further \nfacilitate, within their competence, conflict settlement \nprocesses in the GUAM area. Therefore, the inclusion \nof the new item on conflicts in the GUAM area in the \nagenda of the General Assembly is an attempt to raise \nthe awareness of the Assembly of dangerous \ndevelopments emerging from those unresolved \nconflicts. \n The pledges we have made to promote better \nstandards of living in larger freedom nourish the faith \nof people around the world in future positive change \nand development. Hence, there is no greater imperative \nthan to fulfil the development agenda and to strengthen \nglobal partnership for development. \n Azerbaijan is convinced that national \ndevelopment strategies should be a principal \nframework of development cooperation and support. \nEfficiency in the implementation process cannot be \nachieved unless it employs measures targeted at \nincreasing the self-sufficiency of countries in the long \nrun, inter alia, through knowledge, capacity-building, \ninfrastructure development and market access and, \nultimately, by reducing their dependence on foreign \naid. A favourable global economic situation remains a \nprerequisite for the success of national development \nstrategies, macroeconomic policies and, eventually, the \neconomic and financial stability and growth of \ncountries. \n Azerbaijan believes that international \norganizations should support the efforts of countries to \nimprove and sustain their economic performance. We \nlook forward to the contribution of the United Nations \nwith a stronger and more effective Economic and \nSocial Council capable of effectively discharging its \nnewly assigned functions. \n Let me now describe the economic outlook for \nAzerbaijan and its experience in enhancing growth, \ndevelopment and social well-being. In the light of \ntrends in 2005, gross domestic product is expected to \nincrease by 30.5 per cent in 2006, driven by oil and gas \nproduction and exports. In 2006, State spending has \nbeen increased by up to 65 per cent, a large proportion \nbeing spent on the public sector and infrastructure. The \nkey challenge facing the Government is to create a \nfavourable environment for investment in the non-oil \nsector and to diversify exports. To achieve this \nobjective, it must keep domestic reforms on track and \nstrive to strengthen the business environment. \n The year 2006 marked a historic moment for the \nregion and beyond, with the official inauguration of the \nBaku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline. We are \nlooking forward to completion of the Baku-Tbilisi-\nErzerum natural gas pipeline this fall and remain \ncommitted to contributing to global energy security. At \nthe same time, we are actively developing \ntransregional infrastructure projects, in particular the \nBaku-Tbilisi-Kars railroad, which has been recognized \nas an important addition to the East-West and North-\nSouth transportation corridors. \n Last but not least, the establishment of the \nHuman Rights Council marked a critical step towards \nenhancing the universal system for promoting and \nprotecting human rights worldwide. The Council has \nbeen endowed with the necessary mandate to give \nhuman rights the central role foreseen by the Charter, \nand its status is that of a subsidiary body of the General \nAssembly. We have to build effective mechanisms, \nsuch as universal periodic review, special procedures \nand a complaints procedure within the Council. As a \nnewly elected member of the Human Rights Council, \nAzerbaijan reiterates its readiness to cooperate with \nother Member States in order to ensure that the new \nCouncil becomes an effective body guided by the \nprinciples of universality, objectivity and non-\nselectivity and that it bases its activity on constructive \nand transparent dialogue and cooperation.

        "file_text": "While acknowledging the unique and irreplaceable role \nplayed by the United Nations in international affairs, \none still has to recognize the need to reform this \ninstitution according to present-day realities. Let me \nbriefly dwell upon our vision of these reforms. \n It is necessary to significantly increase the \nefficiency of the United Nations management, which \nmust set itself realistic and feasible objectives and \nrapidly respond to challenges and threats. The reform \nof the Organization must reflect the principles of \nsovereign equality and non-interference in internal \naffairs and strengthen the equal cooperation between \nStates. It must be based upon the principles of broad \ninternational consensus. \n The General Assembly needs to concentrate on \ndesigning constructive ways of addressing the \nproblems of regional and global security, which affect \nthe interests of the majority of the Member States. \nMuch attention should be given to questions of post-\nconflict rehabilitation and combating terrorism. The \nUnited Nations should assume a coordinating role in \nthese spheres using the support of all Member States. \nSuch an approach will contribute to strengthening the \nOrganization\u2019s ability to meet contemporary \nchallenges. \n Security Council reform must ensure the fair \ngeographical and regional representation of both \ndeveloped and developing States whose authority has \nbeen acknowledged by the international community \nand who play an important role in addressing the main \ntasks facing the Organization today. \n The international community is about to make a \ndecision on an important issue \u2014 the election of the \nnew Secretary-General. Considering the principle of \nrotation and the increasing political weight and \neconomic significance of the Asian countries, the \nRepublic of Uzbekistan fully supports the view that a \nrepresentative from the Asian group should assume that \npost. We support the candidature of the Minister \nforForeign Affairs and Trade of South Korea, Mr. Ban \nKi-moon.  \n The international community places its hopes on \nthe newly established Human Rights Council, which is \ncalled upon to improve the work of the United Nations \nin the field of human rights. It is important not to allow \nthe Council to be used as a tool for promoting the \ninterests of certain countries to the detriment of others. \nOnly by stopping the practice of double standards, \npoliticization and confrontation can we turn that body \ninto the forum for equal and open dialogue, enjoying \nthe trust of all Member States. The work of that United \nNations body must be guided by objective and \nunbiased assessment of human rights issues. It must \nassist in elaborating constructive solutions to all \nproblems that arise, instead of being used for political \npurposes. \n The fundamental changes in today\u2019s world are \naccompanied by the emergence of new challenges and \nthreats. At present, terrorism, extremism and drug \naggression pose a great danger to the sustainable \ndevelopment of States and peoples of the world. \n The principal approaches of the Republic of \nUzbekistan towards addressing these and other \nproblems of security include the following points. \n Uzbekistan firmly supports the United Nations \nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288), \n \n \n15 06-53341 \n \nadopted by the General Assembly on 8 September \n2006. Terrorism is not acceptable in any of its forms \nand manifestations. The fight against terrorism can be \neffective and efficient only by eliminating its causes, \nthe first of which is the ideological and extremist \ncentres that finance and direct the forces of \ninternational terrorism. We must also design common \napproaches to assessing this, the most dangerous \nphenomenon of today\u2019s world. \n A universal convention on international terrorism \ncould become an effective basis for joint counteraction \nagainst the threat of terrorism. This instrument must be \nof a non-discriminatory nature, exclude the policy of \ndouble standards and call upon States for concerted \naction in countering the ideologies of extremism. \n Maintenance of regional and global security is \nnot possible without establishing comprehensive peace \nand stability in Afghanistan. One way to resolve the \nAfghan problem and restore a peaceful and neutral \nAfghanistan is effective and real progress in \nimplementing concrete projects, funded by the \ninternational community, in the social, economic and \nhumanitarian spheres \u2014 those spheres that can affect \nattitudes among the long-suffering people of \nAfghanistan. \n A fundamental strategy review and more efficient \ncoordination are required in combating one of the most \ndangerous problems: drug production and drug \ntrafficking. \n Uzbekistan, as an initiator of a nuclear-weapon-\nfree zone in the region, together with its neighbours, is \ndoing everything possible to strengthen the global \nnuclear non-proliferation regime. On 8 September 2006 \nin Semipalatinsk, the Central Asia Nuclear-Weapon-\nFree Zone Treat was signed. That initiative, put \nforward by the President of the Republic of \nUzbekistan, Islam Karimov, is a concrete contribution \nof the States in the region to strengthening the global \nnon-proliferation process and also to creating a solid \nsystem of regional security. Uzbekistan calls upon \nnuclear powers to accede to the protocol on security \nguarantees annexed to the Central Asia Nuclear-\nWeapon-Free Zone Treaty as soon as possible. I wish \nto take this opportunity to express gratitude to the \nUnited Nations for its assistance in realizing this \ninitiative. \n Mr. Sow (Guinea), Vice-President, took the Chair. \n In closing, I express my sincere hope that the \nresults of the work of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-first session will contribute to the successful \nrealization of the joint efforts of the Member States in \nthe struggle against threats and challenges to global \nsecurity and to furthering the peaceful development of \npeoples.

        "file_text": "Madam \nPresident, let me first of all express my happiness at \nseeing you preside over the General Assembly. Your \nelection sends a clear signal concerning the ever-\nstronger participation of women in decision-making \nprocesses worldwide. We value your impressive track \nrecord on women\u2019s rights in particular, and we will \nassist you in every possible way in the fulfilment of \nyour difficult task. \n We can take pride in the many accomplishments \nachieved during the past session, most prominently the \nestablishment of the Human Rights Council and of the \nPeacebuilding Commission. These are important \ninstitutional advances which offer us a real opportunity \nto do things differently and to do them better. They do \nnot, however, automatically guarantee the results that \nwe had in mind when we made the decision that new \ninstitutions were needed. No structural change, \nhowever skilfully crafted, can bring about substantive \nchange in and of itself. In the area of human rights in \nparticular, we must increase our efforts in order to \ncreate the truly new international discourse that is \nneeded, based on cooperation and the even-handed \nimplementation of international standards. Only a new \npartnership in the field of human rights, with the full \nparticipation of all stakeholders, including civil society \nand the private sector, can ensure that people \nworldwide enjoy all the human rights to which they are \nentitled. It is only through such a new partnership that \nwe will be able to make the quantum leap towards an \nera of implementation. \n One of the major issues that we did not resolve \nfollowing the World Summit in September 2005 is \nSecurity Council reform. Here again, we are of the \nview that structural change is needed but that it is not \nsufficient in itself. On the one hand, the Council must \nbe given a new structure and a different composition in \norder to maintain its credibility worldwide. It must \nbetter reflect the geopolitical realities of the twenty-\nfirst century, which are fundamentally different from \nthose that prevailed at the time of the creation of the \nOrganization. But we must also address the equally \nurgent necessity to improve the way in which the \nCouncil goes about its daily business. \n Time and again we have witnessed occasions on \nwhich the Council did not live up to its mandate, as \nenshrined in the Charter, to act on behalf of the \nmembership as a whole. A better representation of the \nviews of the general membership is therefore essential \nfor its effectiveness and credibility, in particular \nthrough a stronger involvement on the part of non-\nmembers of the Council that have a particular interest \nin, or expertise on, a given subject. We are satisfied to \nsee that the Council has taken a step in the right \ndirection in that regard, and we will remain committed \nto helping to improve its working methods. \n Working methods and enlargement are clearly \ncomplementary elements of Security Council reform. It \nwould appear that, after a pause of more than a year, it \nis time to try our hand again at expanding the Council, \npreferably through a sober approach that takes into \naccount the experiences gained in 2005. \n Like many before me, I would like to applaud \nSecretary-General Kofi Annan for his outstanding \ntenure at the helm of the Organization. One key \nelement of his legacy is the high priority he has \nattached to the rule of law. We agree that the core \nstrength of the United Nations is its solid grounding in \ninternational law, its proud track record in promoting \ninternational law, and the unique legitimacy it can \nprovide in making decisions. In our globalized world, \n  \n \n06-53317 32 \n \nin which non-State actors play an ever-increasing role, \nclear rules are needed which are applied equally to \neveryone, in a transparent manner. \n However, we have yet to witness the advent of an \nera of the rule of law, as called for by the Secretary-\nGeneral. On the contrary, we have witnessed a \ndangerous erosion of international law, in particular \ninternational humanitarian law, and we must urgently \nfind ways to place the issue of the rule of law high on \nthe agenda of the Organization. We will work with \nothers to ensure that the General Assembly makes \nconcrete progress on this matter during this session. \n While there are negative trends in the area of \nrespect for international law, we have made some \nsignificant advances, in particular in the area of \ninternational justice. It is now commonly understood \nthat there can be no impunity for international crimes \nand that no one who has committed them is immune. \nThis is a historic development which has found its \nmost powerful expression in the establishment of the \nInternational Criminal Court. The Court is now seized \nof three situations, one of which was referred to it by \nthe Security Council, and more than 100 States have \nbecome parties to the Rome Statute. This very strong \nmomentum can be maintained only if States and, \nindeed, the Organization lend their active support to a \njudicial institution which fully relies on such \ncooperation in gathering evidence and arresting \nindictees. Most importantly, we must realize that peace \nand justice are, in the long run, complementary \nconcepts, and we must uphold the principle that there \ncan be no amnesty for the worst crimes under \ninternational law. \n The international fight against terrorism poses a \nparticularly complex challenge in the area of the rule \nof law. First, we must complement the existing \ninternational legal framework by adopting a \ncomprehensive convention against terrorism. We have \nput forward our ideas in this respect and hope that they \ncan help in reaching an agreement, which is long \noverdue. Secondly, it must be clear that the fight \nagainst terrorism and the observance of human rights \nand international humanitarian law are complementary \nand mutually reinforcing. Human rights are at the core \nof the value system of the international community, as \nwe all recognized at the Summit last year. Curtailing \nthem in the name of the fight against terrorism would \ntherefore play into the hands of terrorists, who fight \n \nthis very system with fanatic zeal. Last but not least, \nthe United Nations, and the Security Council in \nparticular, must lead by example in upholding due \nprocess and the rights of individuals. \n When I spoke in this Hall last year, I presented a \nmixed assessment of the outcome of the World \nSummit. On the one hand, I expressed disappointment \nat the vagueness or even complete absence of some \naspects of United Nations reform, but I also warmly \nwelcomed some real advances. The recognition of the \nresponsibility to protect constituted such an advance; \nindeed, it was a real milestone in the Outcome \nDocument. Today, we must acknowledge that the \ninternational community has not followed up the \ncommitment it made at the World Summit with \nconcrete action. \n The situation in Darfur, irrespective of the \ndefinition of the crime in question, clearly falls within \nthe scope of the responsibility to protect, but we have \nyet to see the action necessary in accordance with our \ncommon commitment to protect civilian populations. \n The United Nations, in spite of its shortcomings, \nremains the only such Organization of global reach and \nis uniquely placed to address the complex challenges \nthe world is facing today. However, it will be capable \nof living up to this role only if we re-establish the \ninstitutional balance within the system. In particular, \nthe General Assembly must reassert its role as a central \npolicymaking body and work on a par with the Security \nCouncil. \n The most prominent topics for the Organization \nin the coming weeks are clear: the situation in Darfur, \nthe Middle East, the nuclear programme of Iran and the \nappointment of a new Secretary-General. All these \ntopics are dealt with in the Security Council, while the \nGeneral Assembly plays at best a secondary role. The \nAssembly must, therefore, address in parallel, and \nmake progress on, the development agenda in all its \naspects, system-wide coherence, disarmament, Security \nCouncil reform and other priority areas of the work of \nthe organization. A better division of work between the \ntwo most important organs will make the Organization \nas a whole more effective and more efficient. It is, \ntherefore, in the common interest of all States to make \nthe General Assembly the central policymaking body it \nwas designed to be by the founding fathers. "

        "file_text": "First \nI very respectfully invite all those who have not done \nso to read the book that I am holding, one of the most \nrecent by Noam Chomsky, who is among the most \nprestigious American and world intellectuals. The \nbook, \u201cHegemony or Survival: America\u2019s Quest for \nGlobal Dominance\u201d, is an excellent work to help us \nunderstand what happened in the world of the twentieth \ncentury and what is happening now, which is the \ngreatest threat looming over our planet: the \nhegemonistic claims of American imperialism, which \nthreaten the very survival of the human species. We \ncontinue to warn about this danger and to appeal to the \npeople of the United States and the world to halt this \nthreat, which is like the sword of Damocles hanging \nover our heads. \n I had considered reading a chapter from the book, \nbut to save time I shall confine myself to a \nrecommendation. The book is very good, an easy read. \nI am sure, Madam President, that you are familiar with \nit. It is published in English, German, Russian and \nArabic. The first people who should read it are our \nbrothers and sisters in the United States, because the \nthreat is in their own house. The Devil is there; the \nDevil himself is in the house. \n The Devil came here yesterday, right here. It still \nsmells of sulphur today. Yesterday on this rostrum the \nPresident of the United States, whom I refer to as the \nDevil, talked as if he owned the world. It would be \nappropriate to have a psychiatrist analyse yesterday\u2019s \naddress by the President of the United States. As the \nspokesman of imperialism he came to share his \nprescriptions for preserving the current pattern of \ndomination, exploitation and pillage of the peoples of \nthe world. It was like an Alfred Hitchcock movie. I \nwould even propose a title: \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Recipe\u201d. \n As Chomsky says here clearly and in depth, \nAmerican imperialism is doing all it can to consolidate \nits hegemonistic system of domination. We cannot \nallow it to do that. We cannot allow the establishment \nand consolidation of world dictatorship. The address of \nthe world tyrant, cynical and full of hypocrisy, shows \nthe imperialists\u2019 intention to control everything. They \nsay that they want to impose a democratic model, but it \nis the democratic model of their own conception: the \nfalse democracy of elites, and furthermore an original \ndemocratic model imposed by bombs, bombardments \nand invasions. What a strange democracy! It would be \nnecessary to revise the ideas of Aristotle and the other \nGreek pioneers of democracy in the face of this model, \nimposed by marines, invasions, aggression and bombs. \n The President of the United States told us \nyesterday in this Hall, \u201ceverywhere you turn you hear \nextremists who tell you that you can escape your \nmisery and retain your dignity through violence and \nterror and martyrdom.\u201d (see ). Wherever he \nlooks he sees extremists, and when he looks at your \ncolour, my brother, he thinks \u201cYou are an extremist\u201d. \nMr. Evo Morales Aima, the worthy President of \nBolivia, looks like an extremist to him. The \nimperialists see extremists everywhere. \n No, it is not that we are extremists. What is \nhappening is that the world is waking up and people \neverywhere are rising up. I tell the world dictator \u201cI \nhave a feeling that the rest of your days will be a living \nnightmare, because everywhere you will see us rising \nup against American imperialism, demanding freedom, \nequality of peoples and respect for the sovereignty of \nnations.\u201d Yes, we may be described as extremists, but \nwe are rising against the empire, against the model of \ndomination. \n \n \n11 06-52879 \n \n The President also said, \u201cI would like to speak \ndirectly to the people across the \u2026 Middle East: my \ncountry desires peace.\u201d That is true. If we walk through \nthe streets of the Bronx, New York, Washington, San \nDiego, California, San Antonio and San Francisco \u2014 \nanywhere in the United States \u2014 and speak to \nindividual citizens, we shall find that the country does \nwant peace. The difference is that the Government of \nthe United States does not. It wants to impose its \nsystem of exploitation and pillage and its hegemony \nthrough war. If it wants peace, what is happening in \nIraq? What happened in Lebanon and Palestine? What \nhas happened over the past hundred years in Latin \nAmerica and in world? Now there are new threats \nagainst Venezuela and Iran. \n The President spoke to the people of Lebanon, \nsaying \u201cMany of you have seen your homes and \ncommunities caught in crossfire.\u201d What cynicism! \nWhat a capacity to lie shamelessly! Was it crossfire \nwhen bombs were dropped on Beirut with millimetric \nprecision? He was thinking of a Western, where men \nshoot from the hip and somebody gets caught in the \ncrossfire. This was imperialist fire, fascist fire, the fire \nof an assassin, the genocidal firing of the empire and \nIsrael on the innocent people of Palestine and Lebanon. \nThat is the truth. \n Now it is said that we are suffering because we \nsee homes destroyed. Early this morning I was looking \nat some statements in preparing my remarks, and I \nhave brought with me a document in which I note that \nthe President of the United States came to talk to the \npeoples. He said \u201cTo the people of Afghanistan\u201d, \u201cTo \nthe people of Lebanon\u201d, \u201cTo the people of Iran\u201d. He \naddressed them all directly. One wonders what those \npeoples would tell him if they were given the \nopportunity. What would they have to say? I know \nwhat is in the soul of the peoples of the south, the \noppressed peoples. They would say \u201cYankee \nimperialist, go home!\u201d That would be the cry of the \npeoples of the world if they could speak with one voice \nto the American imperialists. \n That is why last year when I came to this Hall, as \nI have been doing for the past eight years, I said \nsomething that has now been fully confirmed. Hardly \nanybody here can defend the United Nations system. \nLet us be honest and accept that the system born after \nthe Second World War has collapsed. It is worthless. It \nis true that it serves to bring us together once a year to \nmeet, make statements, prepare long documents, reflect \nand listen to good speeches like those yesterday by \nPresident Evo and President Lula and the ones we have \njust heard from the President of Sri Lanka and the \nPresident of Chile. But the Assembly has been turned \ninto a merely deliberative organ, with no power to \nmake any impact on the terrible situation in the world. \n That is why Venezuela once again proposes here \ntoday, 20 September, that we re-establish the United \nNations. Last year we made four modest proposals that \nwe felt were crucially important for discussion by \nheads of State and Government, ambassadors and \nrepresentatives. \n The first \u2014 President Lula said this yesterday \u2014 \nis the expansion of both the permanent and non-\npermanent membership of the Security Council, with \ndeveloped and under-developed countries of the third \nworld as new permanent members. That is the first \nstep. \n Secondly, there must be effective methods to \naddress and resolve world conflicts, with transparent \ndebate and decision-making. \n Thirdly, it is essential that, as everyone demands, \nthere be an immediate end to the anti-democratic \nmechanism of the veto that is exercised when decisions \nare made in the Security Council. Let me give a recent \nexample. The immoral veto of the United States, \nblocking a resolution, allowed the Israeli forces to \ndestroy Lebanon with impunity before our very eyes. \n Fourthly, as we have always said, the role and \npowers of the Secretary-General must be strengthened. \nYesterday the Secretary-General practically gave us his \nfarewell speech. He recognized that in the past 10 \nyears serious world problems such as hunger, poverty, \nviolence and human rights violations had worsened and \nbecome more complicated. That is a terrible \nconsequence of the collapse of the United Nations \nsystem and American hegemonistic pretensions. \n A few years ago Venezuela decided to wage this \nbattle within the United Nations, recognizing the \nUnited Nations, as Members, and lending it our voice \nand our thinking. Our voice is an independent one \nrepresenting dignity, the search for truth and the \nreformulation of the international system, with \ndenunciation of persecution and of the aggression of \nhegemonistic forces against peoples of the planet. \n That is how Venezuela, the homeland of Bolivar, \ncame to put itself forward for a non-permanent seat on \n  \n \n06-52879 12 \n \nthe Security Council. The United States Government \nlaunched open, immoral aggression throughout the \nworld to try to prevent Venezuela being freely elected \nto a seat on the Security Council. The empire is afraid \nof the truth, of independent voices. It calls us \nextremists, but it is the extremist. \n I should like to thank all those countries that have \nannounced their support for Venezuela even though the \nballot is secret and there is no need to make an \nannouncement. I believe that the open attack by the \nUnited States empire has increased the support of many \ncountries, and that support strengthens the morale of \nVenezuela, our people and Government. Our brothers \nin the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR), \nfor example, have expressed their support as a bloc. \nWith Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, as well \nas many other Latin American countries, such as \nBolivia, Venezuela is now a full member of \nMERCOSUR. The Caribbean Community has \nexpressed its support for Venezuela, as has the Arab \nLeague. I am immensely grateful to our Arab and \nCaribbean brothers. The African Union, almost all of \nAfrica, has expressed support for Venezuela, as have \ncountries such as Russia, China and many others. \n On behalf of Venezuela and its people, and of the \ntruth, I thank them all most warmly. With a seat on the \nSecurity Council, Venezuela will make not only its \nvoice but that of the third world and all peoples heard \nthroughout the world. We will defend dignity and truth. \n Over and above all this, there are reasons to be \noptimistic \u2014 a poet would say \u201chopelessly optimistic\u201d. \nBeyond the threats, the bombs, the wars, aggression, \npreventive war and the destruction of entire peoples, \nwe can see that a new era is dawning. As Silvio \nRodriguez sings, \u201cthe era is giving birth to a heart\u201d. \nNew trends are developing, alternative ways of \nthinking, alternative movements. Young people think \ndifferently. As has been shown in scarcely a decade, \nthe idea of the end of history has been shown to be \ntotally false, as has that of the Pax Americana and the \nestablishment of the capitalist neo-liberal model, which \ncreates poverty and is rejected. \n Now we must define the future of the world. The \ndawn is breaking all over: Latin America, Africa, \nEurope and Oceania. I want to emphasize that \noptimistic vision, so that we may strengthen our will \nand our readiness to fight to save the world and build a \nnew and better world. \n Venezuela joins that struggle, and that is why we \nare threatened. The United States has already planned, \nfinanced and set in motion a coup in Venezuela, and it \ncontinues to support coup attempts and terrorism there. \nPresident Michelle Bachelet Jeria reminded us a short \ntime ago of the horrendous assassination of the former \nChilean Foreign Minister, Orlando Letelier. I would \nsimply add that those who perpetrated that crime, in \nwhich an American citizen also died, are free. And they \nare Americans themselves, CIA terrorists. \n We should also recall that in a few days there will \nbe another anniversary: 30 years will have passed since \nanother horrendous terrorist act, the destruction of an \nairliner of Cubana de Aviaci\u00f3n in which 73 innocent \npeople died. Where is the biggest terrorist of this \ncontinent, who masterminded the blowing up of the \nplane? He spent a few years in prison in Venezuela, but \nthanks to the CIA and Venezuelan Government \nofficials at the time he was able to escape. Now he \nlives in the United States, protected by the \nGovernment. He confessed and was convicted of his \ncrime, but the United States Government has double \nstandards and protects terrorism when it wants to. I say \nthis to make the point that Venezuela is fully \ncommitted to combating terrorism and violence, and \njoins those peoples that are fighting for peace and a \nworld of equals. \n I have just spoken of the Cuban airliner. Luis \nPosada Carriles is the name of the terrorist concerned. \nHe is protected here, as are very corrupt people who \nhave fled Venezuela. A group of terrorists bombed \nvarious embassies and assassinated people. During the \nattempted coup they kidnapped me and were going to \nshoot me. But God intervened, as did a group of loyal \nsoldiers and the people, who took to the streets. So by \na miracle I am here today. The leaders of that \nattempted coup and those terrorist acts are living in this \ncountry today, protected by the United States \nGovernment. I accuse the American Government of \nprotecting terrorists and of holding a completely \ncynical discourse. \n I mentioned Cuba. I was very recently in Havana \nfor a few days, and I left it feeling happy because the \nbirth of a new era could be seen. The Non-Aligned \nMovement summit adopted a historic final document. \nDo not worry; I shall not read it out. It contains a set of \nresolutions adopted after open and transparent debate. \nMore than 50 heads of State attended, and Havana was \nthe capital of the south for a week. \n \n \n13 06-52879 \n \n We have now relaunched the Non-Aligned \nMovement. If there is anything I could ask of all those \nhere, my partners and brothers and sisters, it is that \nthey lend their good will to strengthen the Non-\nAligned Movement, which is important for the birth of \nthe new era and the prevention of hegemony and \nimperialism. The Assembly will know that we elected \nPresident Fidel Castro Chairman of the Non-Aligned \nMovement for the next three years, and we can trust \nhim to lead us very efficiently. Those who hoped that \nFidel would die were disappointed, and they will \ncontinue to be disappointed, because he is back in his \nolive-green fatigues and is now not only President of \nCuba but Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement. A \nvery strong movement has been born: that of the South. \nWe are men and women of the South. \n With these documents, ideas, criticisms and \nreflections, I am now closing my file and taking the \nbook with me. Do not forget that I recommend it very \nwarmly and very humbly to all those present. I have \ntried to put forward ideas to save our planet, to save it \nfrom the imperialist threat. I hope that in this century, \nin the not too distant future, we shall see our children \nand grandchildren living better, in a world of peace \nbased on the fundamental principles of the United \nNations \u2014 a renewed and relocated United Nations. I \nbelieve that it must move to another country, to a city \nof the South. That is what we in Venezuela have \nproposed. The Assembly knows that my personal \ndoctor and chief of security had to stay on a locked \nplane. Neither was allowed to come to the United \nNations. This abuse we regard as a personal insult by \nthe Devil. It smells of sulphur here, but God is with us, \nand I embrace you all. May God bless us all. "

        "file_text": "At the outset, allow \nme to congratulate you, Madam President, and the \nKingdom of Bahrain on your assumption of the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \nsession. As a woman, I welcome your election with \ngreat pride and wish to assure you of my delegation\u2019s \nfull support in every possible way. \n I also wish to express my delegation\u2019s profound \nappreciation to President Jan Eliasson, your \npredecessor, for his hard work and dedication in \nadvancing the United Nations reform agenda over the \npast year. \n Also, I take this opportunity to welcome the \nRepublic of Montenegro as a new member of the \nUnited Nations. \n As I speak, Thailand is going through a critical \nperiod \u2014 a transition, following the military \nintervention, to a needed reform process that will \nstrengthen our democracy in both its form and content. \nAs a peace-loving country, we are grateful that the \npolitical change in Thailand has taken place peacefully. \nThe situation in the country returned to normal within \nhours. On behalf of the Thai people, I wish to thank \nour friends for their understanding and support. \n \n \n25 06-53952 \n \n With the resilience of Thai society, the General \nAssembly can be assured that Thailand will emerge as \na stronger and more vibrant democracy. We will ensure \na swift return to democracy within a definite timeline. \nAn interim constitution will be promulgated in the \ncoming days, with the military once again being placed \nunder the constitution. This interim constitution will \nprovide full guarantees for civil liberties and rights \nunder the supervision of our National Human Rights \nCommission. Under the interim constitution, a new \ncivilian Government will again be put in place within \nthe coming days, and we can well expect that one of \nthe first tasks of the new Government will be to abolish \nmartial law. \n Constitutional reform will lead to a new \nconstitution and general elections within one year, if \nnot sooner. It is the hope of the Thai people that, as a \nresult of this reform, independent organizations to be \nre-established under the new constitution will become \nmore effective in carrying out their tasks to check and \nmonitor the work of the executive branch of \nGovernment. This is the challenge and the promise. \n I wish to assure the General Assembly that \nThailand\u2019s foreign policy will remain unchanged. The \nconduct of our foreign policy will continue to be \nguided by the spirit and principles enshrined in the \nUnited Nations Charter, and we remain firm in our \ncommitment to our obligations under international \ntreaties and agreements to which we are party. \n Our thriving partnership with other countries \nshall continue to be fostered and enhanced. Thailand\u2019s \ninternational economic policy, including multilateral \ntrade negotiations and free trade agreements, will be \ncontinued. We will monitor our active role in the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and \nin the Asia Cooperation Dialogue. We will also \ncontinue to promote the Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-\nMekong Economic Cooperation Strategy, a subregional \nand self-reliant collective effort aimed at speeding up \nregional integration, and BIMSTEC (Bangladesh-India-\nMyanmar-Sri Lanka-Thailand Economic Cooperation), an \norganization devoted to economic and social cooperation, \nbridging the two sub-continents of South Asia and \nSouth-East Asia. Members of the General Assembly \ncan, therefore, be assured of continuity in our foreign \npolicy at all levels \u2014 bilateral, regional and \nmultilateral. \n The world today is weakened by \nmisunderstanding and fear. We judge one another based \non our perceptions, which often times are not accurate. \nOut of fear, we go to war to seek peace. \n Instead of waging war, we should cultivate peace. \nWe should learn to respect one another, starting from \nwithin one\u2019s own family, community and workplace, \nand extending it to other societies, peoples of different \nraces, religions and beliefs. Starting with ourselves, we \nshould expand our circle of friendship and peace and \ndo everything possible to spread the message of peace \nwithin our nations and around the world. \n In this regard, Thailand commends various \ninitiatives to bridge differences among peoples across \ncultures and civilizations. We welcome and support the \nAlliance of Civilizations and the Interfaith Dialogue \nand Cooperation towards Peace in the Twenty-First \nCentury. We encourage the strengthening and \npromotion of such initiatives in order to foster peace \nand lessen the possibility of armed conflict. \n Each year, the United Nations spends more than \n70 per cent of its $10 billion annual budget on \npeacekeeping and other field operations. This trend can \nbe reversed only if the United Nations works harder to \ncreate a culture of prevention. Prevention is, in the \nlong run, less costly than peacekeeping operations. In \nthis regard, it is particularly encouraging that two \nimportant new bodies have been established to \ncontribute to strengthening the United Nations role in \nconflict prevention. \n The Peacebuilding Commission is expected to \nenable countries to recover after emerging from \nconflict and to sustain durable peace. The Human \nRights Council holds out the hope of promoting a \nculture of human rights for all. It should play a role in \nhelping to prevent situations of human rights violations \nfrom deteriorating and developing into armed conflicts. \nThe Council\u2019s success will be measured not by the \nnumber of resolutions it adopts, but by its real impact \non the ground. \n One of the most effective measures for \nprevention of armed conflict is development. Thailand \nis encouraged that the theme of the general debate this \nyear, \u201cImplementing a global partnership for \ndevelopment\u201d, responds to the immediate need to \nensure that development goals are achieved on the firm \nbasis of a global partnership. Developed countries need \nto honour their commitments, particularly in their \n  \n \n06-53952 26 \n \nofficial development assistance to developing countries \nand least developed countries. \n Sustainable development is, however, not about \naid, it is about trade and opportunity. Developing \ncountries must not be denied the opportunity to trade \nthemselves out of poverty. The suspension of the Doha \nRound dealt a serious setback to hopes for a true \npartnership between the developed and developing \nworlds. A global partnership for development must \nensure win-win conditions for rich and poor alike. We \nmust redouble our efforts to ensure that development \ndoes not become a casualty of domestic interests. \n Global partnership is also not limited to \nrelationships among States. The work of the United \nNations can never be at its best if it does not reflect the \nvoices of peoples at the grass-roots level. The \nOrganization must ensure a global partnership for \ndevelopment and engage partners at all levels. In this \nregard, Thailand commends the work of the United \nNations Fund for International Partnerships and \nencourages it to carry out additional good work to \nassist developing countries, especially those in Africa, \nin attaining sustainable development. We also thank \nSecretary-General Kofi Annan for having explored the \npossibility of engaging civil society and the private \nsector in the work of the United Nations. My \ndelegation looks forward to more work being \nundertaken in this regard during the current session of \nthe General Assembly. \n As the Secretary-General pointed out in his report \nto the General Assembly this year, the United Nations \nis a network of capacities and a source of operational \ncapacity. In order to maximize this potential, there is \nan urgent need to reform the United Nations \nSecretariat. Discussion on Secretariat and management \nreform has been occupying a large part of our time \nsince the World Summit. I encourage Member States to \ncooperate closely to achieve the common goal of \nensuring that this Organization works to serve peoples \nin all corners of the world, in a transparent and most \neffective manner. \n To enable the United Nations to deliver its best \npotential as a network of capacities, we also need to \nensure that the work of the United Nations at \nHeadquarters and in the field is coherent and well \ncoordinated. In this regard, Thailand looks forward \nenthusiastically to studying the report and \nrecommendations of the High-Level Panel on UN \nSystem-wide Coherence. We need to ensure that efforts \nat the national, regional and international levels are \ncoordinated and that they respond to needs on the \nground. The work of regional commissions and \norganizations should feed into the work of the United \nNations at Headquarters in such a way as to maximize \ntheir synergies. \n The year 2005 was one of vision and \ncommitments. Our leaders met at the World Summit \nand laid out their visions for a better world, \nunderpinned by effective multilateralism and a more \neffective United Nations. We have spent most of 2006 \nmapping out details of the commitments laid out by our \nleaders. In addition to the Peacebuilding Commission \nand the Human Rights Council, another welcome effort \nundertaken by the General Assembly this year was the \nrecent adoption of the United Nations Global Counter-\nTerrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288), which provides \na good example of political will at work. Thailand \nwishes to encourage Member States to exert even \ngreater political will in order to permit the speedy \nconclusion of a comprehensive anti-terrorism \nconvention.  \n Moreover, the importance of prevention in the \nfight against terrorism can never be overstressed. The \ncauses of marginalization and extremism \u2014 including, \nin particular, a lack of development \u2014 definitely \nrequire the world\u2019s priority attention and must be \nproperly addressed. \n In June, the General Assembly adopted a strong \nPolitical Declaration (resolution 60/262) \u2014 as a \nfollow-up to the 2001 Declaration of Commitment on \nHIV/AIDS \u2014 aimed at significantly scaling up our \nefforts to achieve universal access to comprehensive \nprevention programmes, care, treatment and support \nfor all those who need them by the year 2010. Because \nAIDS has killed more than 25 million people and \norphaned 15 million children since the first cases of \nAIDS were reported 25 years ago, and because close to \n40 million people worldwide are living with \nHIV/AIDS, Member States must take those \ncommitments seriously and translate them into \nconcrete actions at the national level. \n Although much has been accomplished since the \nWorld Summit, that is only the beginning; much more \nneeds to be done. The year 2007 must be a year for \naction and implementation. When the United Nations \nwas founded 60 years ago, it was our forefathers\u2019 \n \n \n27 06-53952 \n \naspiration that the peoples of the world would live free \nfrom want and fear and in dignity. Today, the United \nNations continues to strive to achieve that noble goal. \nMaintaining peace and security, promoting \ndevelopment and promoting and protecting the human \nrights of peoples throughout the world are not the \nresponsibility of any single nation; they are our shared \nresponsibility. Each and every one of us must serve as \nan agent for change. We must serve as instruments for \npeace. \n Finally, I would be remiss to end this statement \nwithout paying tribute to Secretary-General Kofi \nAnnan for his decade of hard work and dedication \nserving in the most impossible job in the world, and for \nhis entire career in the service of humanity. The \nSecretary-General\u2019s shoes will be extremely hard to \nfill. Anyone who is elected to serve in that post will \nhave a full agenda on his hands: ensuring that \nmultilateralism works effectively and that the United \nNations remains relevant. \n The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, \ncomprising Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, \nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, \nMyanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and \nViet Nam, has endorsed and supported the candidature \nof Mr. Surakiart Sathirathai of Thailand to carry on the \nwork of Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Mr. Surakiart\u2019s \nvast background in Government, business and the \nacademic world would enrich the work of the \nOrganization. As someone from a developing country, \nMr. Surakiart could serve as a bridge-builder, linking \nthe North with the South, and could be a voice of \nmoderation for the world community. In addition to the \nfact that he is an Asian candidate, Mr. Surakiart \npossesses outstanding personal qualifications. If he is \nelected, his experiences could be of great use to the \nwork of the United Nations in the challenging times \nahead. "

        "file_text": "Madam President, may I tell you how happy Paraguay \nis to see you presiding over the sixty-first session of \nthe General Assembly. Your personal and professional \nqualities ensure the success of this session. \n I wish to reiterate what I said at the earlier \nsummit meeting. For Paraguay, peace and security, \ndevelopment with social justice, democracy and human \nrights are the fundamental pillars on which the world \nmust be based, because they are interconnected \nprinciples that mutually strengthen each other. We \ncannot consider ourselves to be in an airtight \ncompartment, because if pride of place is given to one \nover another, this Assembly will not be a pluralistic, \nrepresentative body. Rather, the single-voiced will of \nPowers will continue to be imposed on others. \n My delegation thanks the Secretary-General, \nMr. Kofi Annan, for his detailed annual report on the \nwork of the Organization (A/61/1). Ideally, the \n \n \n41 06-52737 \n \nSecretary-General would not travel only to those places \nwhere barbaric warfare is destroying cities and killing \ninnocent, defenceless people. Perhaps something would \nchange if he were also to go to see the vast universe of \npoverty and social exclusion resulting from worldwide, \nprofoundly unjust disorder, and then propose solutions. \nWe urgently need to build a global partnership of \nsolidarity to supplement the efforts made by our \ncountries. Only in this way will we be able to deal with \nthe problems of poverty, hunger and the lack of access \nto education and health care. Clearly, every country is \nresponsible for achieving its own economic and social \ndevelopment by applying the proper policies to \nmobilize domestic resources. But those national efforts \nshould be supplemented by explicit commitments by \nthe developed countries to promote and facilitate \naccess to international markets and more balance in \neconomic relations and in the price of products. \n The experience of developed countries \nthemselves shows that, without external cooperation, \nthey would have had difficulty in prospering or in \nrestructuring their economies. \n The reciprocal increase in production and trade is \na driving force for development. However, the trend \ntowards more concentrated productive expansion and \ninsufficient participation in the benefits of world trade \ncondemn the majority of countries to marginalization \nfrom development. For this reason, Paraguay calls once \nagain for the right of all nations to more even-handed, \nequitable treatment, including the right to build a new \nform of solidarity among States which are capable of \npromoting progress on a global scale. \n Agricultural subsidies, protectionism, the lack of \ntechnology transfers and the distortions in international \ntrade, together with ethnocentric control of \ninformation, knowledge and science, postpone \ndevelopment and punish countries on the periphery \nwith a pre-modern and wasted life. Because of those \nrecurrent circumstances, we are convinced that the \ntariffs and non-tariff barriers that are applied not only \nby developed countries but also by our own regional \npartners must be removed. Only in that way can we \nquickly overcome asymmetries and unjust \ndiscrimination. \n Society expects more of democracy and of \npoliticians. It expects the system that guarantees liberty \nand equality before the law also to be a system which \npromotes and ensures the well-being of all and puts an \nend to exclusion. Unfortunately, this basic conception \nof politics is not reflected in the behaviour of many \nactors. In practice, petty interests, selfishness and party \nfaction are considered more important and have greater \npriority than the interests of the nation. Democracy as \ngovernment in the service of the common good is being \nbastardized. That gives rise to the lack of prestige and \ndevaluation of politics and democracy, particularly in \nLatin America. \n This erratic direction that politics is taking must \nbe corrected in countries which do not have a \ndemocratic tradition: we have only just built low-\nquality democracy, a pseudo-democracy laced with \nconspiracies against good governance and the exercise \nof power based on legitimacy and the will of the \nmajority of the people. \n In any event, in Paraguay, we are making a great \neffort. School attendance is showing exponential \ngrowth. Educational reform, now extended to higher \neducation, has practically universalized basic \neducation. The secondary school population is \nfollowing the same trend, while university enrolment \nhas doubled through the institutionalization of equal \nopportunities and conditions. According to the United \nNations itself, Paraguay is in a position to achieve, for \nexample, the Millennium Development Goal related to \neducation. One of our key objectives here is to gain \ncertification of zero illiteracy for our country by 2008. \n Together with improving and significantly \nexpanding public and private health-care services, our \nenvironmental policy is recovering the great ecological \nsustainability which characterized Paraguay. This is \ntaking place in the midst of silent agrarian reform. In \naddition to the massive purchase of land for orphan \npeasants \u2014 which is still insufficient to alleviate the \nunfair distribution of land in Paraguay \u2014 we are \nimplementing a policy aimed at rural settlement and \nincreased production and productivity as a way of \ngiving fresh significance to peasant life, its \nsustainability and its dignity. \n Positive action is also taking place with a view to \nmodernizing the State through simplification, \ntransparency and making its services effective. We are \nseeking to improve public safety, combat corruption \nand eradicate piracy, drug trafficking and smuggling. If \none looks at the crime index, Paraguay has one of the \nlowest rates. Nevertheless, we are obliged to improve \nlegal security, and to do that we must implement a \n  \n \n06-52737 42 \n \npolicy of professional qualification and establish ethics \nin the judicial system. \n Development financing continues to be limited in \nterms of fulfilling national development plans and \nprogrammes, both those which are the result of \ninternational mobilization and those which result from \nthe domestic mobilization of financial resources. This \nsituation reflects the viability of various projects which \nare directed towards expanding productive \nemployment, improving basic social services, \neducation and adapting productive infrastructure and \nother areas of action which are essential for \ndevelopment. \n We are aware that the main task begins within our \ncountries. It is we who bear the main responsibility. \nHowever, with the increase in domestic savings, good \nmacroeconomic policies and a predictable country, we \nin Paraguay are reducing poverty and are moving \ntowards development. Therefore, our country continues \nto focus on rationalizing public expenditure and on \nsocial and productive investment. This fiscal discipline \nmakes us worthy of increased support from \ninternational financial institutions. But what we need in \nLatin America, as the President of our sister Republic \nof Bolivia said earlier today, are markets and partners, \nnot bosses or others who would continue to seize the \nwealth and natural resources of the peoples of our \nregion. \n On the subject of human rights, we welcome the \nfact that, through a process of focused consultations, \nthe General Assembly, in March, adopted resolution \n60/251, which established the Human Rights Council. \nThat Council will have a mechanism for the periodic \nand universal review of States\u2019 compliance with their \nobligations in this important area, a review based on \ndialogue and cooperation. What we want is that the \ncriteria for assessing human rights be applied in the \nsame way and using the same principles both to \ndeveloping countries and to developed countries. The \nassessment of human rights would thus not affect only \ndeveloping countries and countries with emerging \neconomies, which are making great efforts at \ninstitution-building and at consolidating democracy \nand freedom. \n The fight against terrorism should unite people \nwho love liberty and seek respect for human rights and \nthe rule of law. While it is true that fundamentalism of \nall kinds is anachronistic and dangerous, terrorism \nshould not be the only item on the international \nagenda, excluding or relegating to the back burner the \nequally crucial debate on poverty and development in \ncountries with peripheral capitalism and those with \nemerging economies. Civilization means respect for \ndiversity and differences. Combating terrorism thus \nrequires that any repressive action be carried out within \nthe jurisdiction of international law and not through \nmere administrative procedures. \n With regard to the question of the representation \nin the United Nations of the 23 million inhabitants of \nTaiwan, Paraguay, consistent with the position it has \nlong held, confirms its support in favour of their \nadmission to the United Nations. Their inclusion is \nconsistent with the principle of universality embodied \nin our Charter, as well as with the norms of \ninternational law. \n To address the problems and conflicts now facing \nthe international community, it is necessary to create a \nmultipolar world and to make it function. The \nequilibrium of our twenty-first-century universe replete \nwith uncertainty, depends on multipolarity. For that \nreason, my country and the Common Market of the \nSouth (MERCOSUR) place their hopes on that \napproach, and in particular on the reform of the \nSecurity Council. It is shameful that what occurs in the \nCouncil should be seen as more important than the \nUnited Nations as an Organization which promotes a \nculture of peace, global development and the \nuniversalization of science and technology. \n In Latin America, as was said by my friend the \nPresident of our sister Republic of Bolivia, we have a \nculture of peace and brotherhood. We seek harmony \nwith our fellow human beings and with nature. \nUnfortunately, at other times in our history, we have \nexperienced warfare \u2014 not because our peoples \nwanted it, but because of manipulation by imperialists \nthirsting to destroy our wealth and fragment our \npeoples. We have put that history behind us. Today we \nlook to the future to see how we in our region can pool \nour efforts to deal with poverty and recover our \npeoples\u2019 political, economic and cultural sovereignty. \n In addition, the hierarchy and institutional \nstructure of the United Nations depend on a world \nwhere equilibrium prevails, ensuring fairness in \ndecisions and action. We do not need sermons about \neducation for peace and the megamillions spent on the \narms build-up. We are not na\u00efve and were offended to \n \n \n43 06-52737 \n \nsee that in 2004 alone, the super-Powers spent sums of \nmoney on rearming that could have put an end to \npoverty and ignorance in the world. \n Certainly military belligerence, which is so \ndestructive and so threatening, is not unrelated to the \nscandalous rise in the price of oil today, which is \ncausing insecurity, economic slowdown and stagnation \nin the developing countries. Inequality for our peoples \nshould not mean that we must take bread out of the \nmouths of the poor in order to waste millions of dollars \non fratricidal weapons. \n Over and above the events that threaten world \npeace are the daily lives of people. In our region, life is \ngood only for the minority and miserable for the \nmajority. \n Therefore, we urgently need a United Nations \nthat makes a contribution to the development, well-\nbeing and freedom of all peoples. Likewise, it is our \nduty to build an entirely prosperous, fair and united \nsociety so that the countenances of our citizens reflect \ntheir happy lives. May God illuminate our path, so that \nthere can be brotherhood among all nations and \nindividuals, and so that our history can truly embark on \nthe path of peace. "

        "file_text": "At the outset, allow me to \njoin other delegations in congratulating the President \nof the General Assembly on her election and to express \nmy deep conviction that, under her skilful leadership, \nthis session will achieve remarkable results. \n Allow me also to extend my country\u2019s sentiments \nof deepest appreciation to Secretary-General Kofi \nAnnan. His relentless work for a better world has been \nmost remarkable. Leading the United Nations for 10 \nyears in very sensitive times, his achievements, \nhumanism, vision and initiatives have crucially \ncontributed to the Organization. That has been \nrecognized worldwide. I wish him all the best in his \nfuture engagements and thank him. \n We live in a fragile world \u2014 a world disturbed \nand unsettled, a world that is marked by conflicts, \ncontroversies and confrontations of an entirely new \nnature. The architecture and mindsets of yesterday\u2019s \nworld are giving way to a web of new challenges. \nYesterday, it was all about blocs, ideologies, the cold \nwar and appeasement. Today, it is all about ethnicity, \nconflicts, burning regions, colliding religions, mass \ndestruction, terror and poverty. \n Today, international order is marked by three \nextremely demanding and global challenges: global \ntensions, global imbalances and global constraints. In \nthat triangle, we need to strive to deliver sustainable \nsolutions. Our responsibility is enormous \u2014 indeed, \neven as we seek to ensure global opportunities, \nfreedom and shared values, this new world in the \nmaking is in danger of lapsing into mistrust, \ndisagreements and divisions. \n We live in a world of extraordinary inequalities in \nopportunity, but our world is also a global and \ninterdependent one, where a broad sharing of economic \nand political opportunities could serve as an effective \ninstrument for economic growth and development. In \nso doing, we can start turning the internationally \nagreed development goals, including the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, into action. \n My country is aware that a greater mobilization \nof domestic resources in developing countries is a \nnecessity. Croatia has made significant progress in \ncreating an enabling environment for partnership and \ninnovation. Tremendous changes have taken place in \nthe development of a market economy, changing \nownership structures, creating a business environment, \nand reforms in the public and private sector. Above all, \nCroatia has progressed in ensuring domestic \ndemocratic stability and a prosperous international \nposition as a framework for long-term development. \n Croatia supports the commitments to the goals \nand targets deriving from the United Nations summits \nin Monterrey and Johannesburg, and the related \nprocesses, such as the Doha Development Agenda and \nthe Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. We also \nsupport the emphasis on achieving the targets in \ndeveloped countries for official development assistance \nbased on actual needs \u2014 rising from today\u2019s 0.33 per \ncent of gross national income to at least 0.51 per cent \nby 2010 and 0.7 per cent by 2015 \u2014 to meet the \nMillennium Development Goals and each country\u2019s \nabsorption capacity. We recognize that mobilizing \nfinancial resources for development and the effective \nuse of those resources in developing countries are \ncentral to a global partnership for development. \n Still, simply raising the level of official \ndevelopment assistance is not enough to enable the \ninternational community to fulfil its obligations \ntowards the countries in need. It is also necessary to \ncontribute to a more equitable distribution of aid that, \nunfortunately, quite often remains outside the regular \neconomic and financial flows. Croatia also welcomes \ninitiatives to enhance the quality of aid and to increase \nits impact, bearing in mind the fact that progress both \nfor donors and for partner countries can be facilitated \nby the harmonization efforts at the international and \nregional levels. Therefore, we stress the need for an \nintegrated approach among international institutions. \n  \n \n06-52885 38 \n \n Croatia recognizes the needs of Africa, especially \nsub-Saharan Africa and the least developed and \nlandlocked developing States, as well as the special \nvulnerabilities of small island developing States. We \nare therefore pleased that those groups of countries \nreceived specific reference in the Outcome Document \nof 2005, thus emphasizing their particular needs and \ncircumstances. The less fortunate must not be left \nbehind. Special attention should be given to countries \nemerging from wars and undergoing a costly, complex \nand highly demanding post-conflict management \nprocess. \n Croatia strongly supports yesterday\u2019s official \nlaunching of the International Drug Purchase Facility \ninitiative. We see it as a significant step forward and \nexpress our hopes that all countries will render their \ncontribution. \n As a contributor to various United Nations \nprogrammes and funds, my country confirms its \ncapacity to support the activities of the United Nations \nin numerous fields. We will increasingly continue to do \nso. During the past few years, Croatia has started to \ncontribute voluntarily to a number of United Nations \nactivities, programmes and bodies: the United Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund, the United Nations Trust Fund for \nAfrican Development and the Office of the High \nCommissioner for Human Rights, to mention but a few. \nBeing a small country, Croatia has limited financial \nand human resources, but that will not hinder us from \nsharing, helping and assisting. \n Global economic and human development must \nremain in our focus, but as we meet today, the focus is \nvery much on global tensions and instability. Today, \nmany ongoing regional crises continue to cause great \nhumanitarian tragedies around the world, seriously \ndestabilizing regional and global security. Those arcs \nof instability are creating a network of fear and anger \nacross many parts of the world. Terrorism is taking on \nnew dimensions and forms. Weapons of mass \ndestruction are yet another cause of grave concern. \nEconomic imbalances and social impediments are \nbecoming new sources of instability across the world. \nReligious divisions and misunderstandings add a new \nand dangerous dimension to insecurity in the world. \n The significant growth of international terrorism \nhas caused an unhealthy atmosphere of mistrust, \nreligious and cultural intolerance, and grave \ninfringements of human rights. Those consequences \nhave in time developed into their own separate and \nextremely dangerous problems that exponentially \nthreaten already fragile international relations. \n The Republic of Croatia, as a member of the \nglobal anti-terrorist coalition, strongly condemns \ninternational terrorism in all its forms and \nmanifestations and, bearing in mind the ever-evolving \nthreat of terrorism \u2014 especially weapons of mass \ndestruction and cyber-terrorism \u2014 calls for even \nstronger global cooperation in the suppression of that \nmodern-day scourge. \n We must prove to our nations that we will stay \nfirm and united against terrorism. In that light, a strong \ncommitment to achieving a global consensus on a \ndefinition of terrorism and a final adoption of the \ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism \nare very much needed and would reaffirm the central \nrole of the United Nations in the suppression of \nterrorism. It that respect, we welcome the United \nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, launched \nyesterday, and express our hope that all countries will \nimplement it. \n The Republic of Croatia has established very \ngood cooperation with the United Nations, especially \nthe Security Council\u2019s Counter-Terrorism Committee \nand its Executive Directorate. Additionally, on 15 and \n16 May, a Monitoring Team for the implementation of \nSecurity Council resolution 1267 (1999) visited \nCroatia and met with representatives of all relevant \nGovernment bodies involved in the suppression of \nterrorism. \n Year by year, we continue our great cooperation \nwith the Terrorism Prevention Branch of the United \nNations Office on Drugs and Crime in Vienna, which \nhas resulted in a recently held national expert \nworkshop on international cooperation in criminal \nmatters related to terrorism, organized through our \njoint cooperation in June this year in Valbandon, \nCroatia. \n Weapons of mass destruction and a common \napproach to non-proliferation must remain our focus. \nResponsibility for world peace and security must \ncontinue to be the key guideline in dealing with that \ngrave challenge. The rules and standards must be \nglobally accepted and the United Nations and its \nspecialized institutions and agencies must continue to \nplay a pivotal role. \n \n \n39 06-52885 \n \n My country won its liberty only a decade ago. \nAggression and crises in our part of Europe presented \nthe entire international community with a new \nchallenge at that time. Regional conflicts emerged as \nthe new and disturbing roots of new dangers to \ninternational peace, and they remain a challenge in \nmany parts of the world. In that light, stability and \npeace in South-East Europe and post-conflict \nmanagement and cooperation must be viewed as a \nsuccess for the international community and the \ncountries involved. \n My country played and continues to play a \nprominent and leading role in providing for long-term \nstability, cooperation and democratic development for \nall of South-East Europe, based on the commonly \nshared vision of a new, united and secure Europe. \nAlready negotiating future full membership in the \nEuropean Union, and based on the progress of reforms \nin the military and the security sector \u2014 as well as \nstanding at the threshold of NATO membership \u2014 \nCroatia is today an anchor of stability, security and \ncooperation. Croatia is therefore an indispensable \npartner in the historical transformation of that often-\ntroubled and critically important region for European \nand world peace, transforming it into a zone of modern \nsociety and democratic standards and values. \n Croatia\u2019s specific position as a Central European, \nDanubian and Mediterranean country provides added \nvalue in bilateral and multilateral contacts and \nexperience, stemming from its participation in \nnumerous global, European and regional organizations \nand initiatives in the fields of security, democratic \ndevelopment and economic cooperation, including \nCroatia\u2019s current presidency of the South-East \nEuropean Cooperation Process. \n Stability, democratic development and \ncooperation, as well as the resolution of remaining \nopen issues and completing the security architecture of \nthat part of Europe, will also have to be closely linked \nto the indispensability of the protection and promotion \nof universal values, the rule of law, human rights and \ndemocracy, as well as their interrelationship with \nsecurity and development. \n Croatia supports efforts to accelerate democracy\u2019s \nmovement around the world, particularly through such \nintergovernmental organizations as the Community of \nDemocracies. Last year, as a signatory of the Warsaw \nDeclaration of the Community of Democracies, the \nRepublic of Croatia contributed to the founding of the \nUnited Nations Democracy Fund to reaffirm its \ncommitment to encouraging other countries on their \npath to democratization. \n Croatia welcomes the fact that the International \nCriminal Court (ICC) has begun work on its first cases. \nWe attach great importance to the continuation of the \nICC\u2019s successful work. Croatia also welcomes the fact \nthat the number of States parties to the Rome Statute \nhas reached and surpassed 100, and we hope that the \nnumber will continue to rise. The Republic of Croatia \nalso supports the work of the International Criminal \nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in pursuing \nits completion strategy. Croatia continues to fully \ncooperate with the ICTY as part of our own \nadvancement towards the rule of law, and also as an \nindicator and impetus for the region, with the aim of \novercoming the legacy of the recent past in South-East \nEurope. \n The Republic of Croatia has been a member of \nnumerous United Nations bodies and very active in \norganizing and hosting conferences and other \nmultilateral activities. My country is now ready to take \nthe next step in strengthening our responsibility as a \nMember of the United Nations. For that reason, the \nRepublic of Croatia has presented its candidature for a \nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council for the \nterm 2008-2009 at the elections to be held in 2007. \n Croatia recognizes the importance of global \nmultilateralism, as well as the growing significance of \nregional organizations in tackling the challenges of \ntoday\u2019s world. The role of the United Nations in the \npromotion of international cooperation for \ndevelopment and the achievement of the development \ngoals agreed by the international community must \nremain fundamental, pivotal and re-energized. We also \nwelcome the strengthening of coordination within the \nUnited Nations system, in close cooperation with all \nother multilateral financial, trade and development \ninstitutions, in order to support sustained economic \ngrowth and sustainable development. \n Allow me to refer to one of the messages of the \nOutcome Document of last year\u2019s Summit \u2014 namely, \nthe notion that there will be no development without \nsecurity and no security without development. We \nacknowledge that peace and security, development and \nhuman rights are the pillars of the United Nations \nsystem and the basis of our collective security and \n  \n \n06-52885 40 \n \nwell-being. We recognize that development, peace, \nsecurity and human rights are interdependent and \nmutually reinforcing. In facing that challenge, the \nUnited Nations system is called on to play an enhanced \ndevelopment role. \n Croatia welcomes the inauguration of the Human \nRights Council and considers it to be a milestone for \nthe global promotion of human rights. My country also \nwelcomes the establishment of the Peacebuilding \nCommission, which arose from the need for a \ncoordinated and integrated approach to post-conflict \npeacebuilding. \n My country is pleased to have been elected to the \nPeacebuilding Commission in May, and I would like to \nuse this opportunity to thank all the States that voted \nfor us and placed their confidence in Croatia. Our wish \nis to contribute actively to the United Nations system \nof collective security in an effective and transparent \nway, as embodied in the Charter and aligned with the \nMillennium Declaration. \n Croatia welcomes another visible result of the \nefforts to reform the United Nations \u2014 the \nestablishment of the Human Rights Council as the \nmain standing body of the United Nations on human \nrights. \n Now, allow me to share some remarks on one of \nthe most important tasks we need to address. \n In this fragile world, the need for an efficient and \ndemocratic world body is ever increasing. The Summit \nof heads of State and Government held in 2005 \nprovided us with a platform for further action toward \nthe reform of our Organization. There has been noted \nprogress on several important reform issues, but we \ncannot be satisfied with the pace of the process. My \ncountry believes that the reform of the Organization \nand of the Security Council must justly take account of \nthe interests of all. Croatia advocates the enlargement \nof the Security Council in both the permanent and non-\npermanent categories of membership, based on \nappropriate regional representation in which the \nEastern European Group would have two non-\npermanent seats. It is of the utmost importance in a \nnew, enlarged Council to have an appropriate number \nof representatives of the developing countries of the \nSouth and better representation of small and medium-\nsized countries. \n Additionally, the reform of the Council should \nextend to its working methods and its interaction with \nother principal bodies of the Organization, first and \nmost importantly the Economic and Social Council. \nThat would strengthen the United Nations in a wide \nrange of areas, including peace and security, \ndevelopment and human rights. There is also a need to \nimprove United Nations management practices and \nworking methods to raise the whole system to a higher \nlevel of transparency and accountability.  \n Mindful that peace and security are prerequisites \nfor economic and social prosperity, Croatia would like \nto remain engaged in and responsive to current \nconcerns on reforming the United Nations system in \norder to make it a stronger and more effective \nOrganization for times to come. That is our common \nresponsibility. We need to act today in order to prepare \nourselves in a timely manner for the challenges of \ntomorrow. \n Although one third of the entire Millennium \nDevelopment Goals period is already behind us, the \ntargets set are, regrettably, not being met at the desired \npace. That must be changed as a matter of urgency, as \nit is undoubtedly an issue affecting the future security \nand stability of the world. We must move forward in \nassisting developing countries and other countries in \nneed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. \n As I mentioned at the outset of my address, \nCroatia has presented its candidature for a non-\npermanent seat on the Security Council for the term \n2008-2009, the elections for which are to be held in \n2007. I feel the need to stress that Croatia\u2019s candidacy \nis, above all, a measure of Croatia\u2019s responsibility. \n I have mentioned the fragility of today\u2019s world. I \nhave not mentioned the fragility, uncertainties and \nchallenges that Croatia experienced in the recent past. \nThey are well known, but at the same time they are the \nsource of our understanding of and responsiveness to \nthe needs of a fragile world. We believe that we can \ncontribute to building a new cooperative world in \nresponding to our new challenges and to enhancing our \nOrganization. Croatian membership in the Security \nCouncil would also serve as a telling demonstration of \nthe success of the peace process in South-East Europe. \n My country went through a successful transition \nfrom being a country receiving peacekeeping forces to \none that is now a contributor to 11 of the 18 United \nNations peacekeeping operations in various regions \n \n \n41 06-52885 \n \nthroughout the world. Croatia also provides training \nand hosts international courses in the field of \npeacebuilding. We are therefore well aware of the \nadded value that countries that have rebuilt their \nnational capacities bring to the credibility of such an \nimportant body for the cause of international peace, \nsecurity and development. Croatia stands determined to \ncontinue to support peace efforts and a strengthened \nUnited Nations role on a regional and global level. "

        "file_text": "Madam \nPresident, I should like at the outset sincerely to \ncongratulate you on your well-deserved election to \npreside over the General Assembly at its sixty-first \nsession. Your election represents not only a mark of \nconsiderable recognition for the Kingdom of Bahrain, \nwhich has tirelessly worked to promote the purposes \nand principles of the United Nations, but also, in \npersonal terms, the culmination of your long legal and \ndiplomatic career. \n Above and beyond the usual courtesies, I should \nlike to encourage you, Madam, and to assure you of \nour full readiness to cooperate to ensure the success of \nyour lofty mission. \n I should like also to pay tribute to Mr. Jan \nEliasson for the talent, dedication and perseverance \nwith which he guided our work throughout the sixtieth \nsession. I should like in particular to acknowledge him \nfor his determination in leading the negotiations that \nachieved considerable progress in implementation of \nthe decisions and recommendations of the 2005 World \nSummit. \n Lastly, I should like to convey to the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, our deep admiration for the \nwisdom and courage he has consistently shown in \ndischarging his difficult mandate, and in particular for \nthe ambitious measures he initiated throughout his two \nterms of office to adapt the United Nations to current \nrealities. \n At a time when his tenure as Secretary-General is \ncoming to an end and many observers will be \nreviewing and assessing his accomplishments, I should \nlike, for may part, to pay a well-deserved tribute to him \nfor having provided us with a clear vision of the work \nof the United Nations in terms of the three pillars of \ninternational peace and security, development and the \npromotion of human rights worldwide. \n The consensus adoption of the 2005 World \nSummit Outcome Document (resolution 60/1) was an \nunequivocal recognition by our leaders of the General \nAssembly\u2019s central role as the chief deliberative, \npolicymaking and representative organ of the United \nNations. I welcome the fact that since the Summit, \nmost of the important recommendations of the \nOutcome Document have already been implemented as \npart of the United Nations reform process. \n Indeed, following the difficult negotiations, the \nsixtieth session of the General Assembly established \ntwo important bodies \u2014 the Peacebuilding \nCommission and the Human Rights Council \u2014 both of \nwhich, as we know, have been operational since June. \nIn addition, the Central Emergency Response Fund was \nestablished, and a number of major resolutions were \nadopted. I am thinking in particular about resolution \n \n \n9 06-53329 \n \n60/42, on the Optional Protocol to the Convention on \nthe Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel; \nthe resolution on development; and, most recently, \nresolution 60/288, on the United Nations Global \nCounter-Terrorism Strategy. \n During the present session, bolstered by that \nmajor progress, we must continue our efforts to \ncomplete the reform process. For example, we must \nintensify our efforts to conclude the negotiations aimed \nat adopting a comprehensive convention against \ninternational terrorism and at reforming the Secretariat, \nthe Economic and Social Council and the Security \nCouncil. \n The theme you proposed for this year\u2019s general \ndebate, Madam President, \u201cImplementing a global \npartnership for development\u201d, is very timely. That \ntheme, which echoes Goal 8 of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, will undoubtedly make it possible \nto follow up and implement the decisions emanating \nfrom the Monterrey Consensus and reaffirmed at the \nSeptember 2005 World Summit.  \n It is extremely urgent that all development \npartners honour all their commitments. Our appeal to \nthem takes fully into account the primary responsibility \nof all States to plan and carry out their own \ndevelopment. It also addresses the many constraints \nhampering the developing countries, in particular the \nimpact of HIV/AIDS, malaria and other infectious \ndiseases on their populations and economies.  \n Therefore, I cannot fail to welcome the fact that, \nin the Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS (resolution \n60/262), adopted on 2 June 2006 at the end of the \nHigh-level Meeting devoted to follow-up on the \nimplementation of the Declaration of Commitment on \nHIV/AIDS, the international community stressed the \nspecial situation of sub-Saharan Africa and recognized \nthe efforts made by African Governments to fight the \npandemic. \n Gabon, for its part, has undertaken ambitious \ninitiatives ranging from awareness raising to the \nimplementation of action plans such as the \nmultisectoral strategic plan to fight AIDS. The \nGabonese head of State and his spouse, Ms. Edith \nLucie Bongo Ondimba, are personally involved in that \ninitiative. \n Aware of the threat that the pandemic poses to \nhuman development and security, we should advocate \nmore courageous measures aimed in particular at \nincreasing the contributions to the Global Fund to \nFight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, strengthening \nprevention methods and improving access to treatment \nfor infected persons. \n However, the many challenges facing African \nStates are not inevitable. That is the strong conviction \nthat led African heads of State or Government to \nlaunch the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development \n(NEPAD), a comprehensive vision in which African \ncountries have pledged, through good economic and \npolitical governance, to take control of the social, \neconomic and political destiny of their respective \nnations. While NEPAD\u2019s main goal is development, we \nare fully aware that there can be no development \nwithout a framework that fosters peace, security and \nrespect for human dignity.  \n Our world continues to be characterized by \ntension and deep crises that aggravate the prevailing \ninstability and insecurity. Old and new conflicts \ncontinue to threaten the peace and security of a number \nof nations, and their effects have strong repercussions \nat the regional and international levels.  \n The violent conflict that has once again shaken \nthe Middle East \u2014 a conflict that has claimed hundreds \nof innocent human lives and caused enormous material \ndamage \u2014 has shown how essential it is to do \neverything possible to establish a lasting peace in that \npart of the world. With specific regard to the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict, only collective and sustained \nefforts based on the principle of two States, Israel and \nPalestine, living side by side in peace and security can \nmake it possible to achieve a just, lasting and equitable \nsettlement of that conflict. Gabon, for its part, endorses \nthe idea of urgently holding an international conference \non the Middle East. \n In Africa, many hot spots of tension also remain \nworrisome. While we should welcome the Darfur \nPeace Agreement, signed at Abuja in May 2006, we \nmust acknowledge that the overall situation remains \nfragile. The persistent divisions between certain parties \nto the conflict even threaten to jeopardize the \nAgreement, which was reached at considerable effort. \nHere, I should like to pay a well-deserved tribute to the \ninternational community, and in particular the African \nUnion, for their tireless efforts to achieve a peaceful \nsettlement of the Darfur crisis. \n  \n \n06-53329 10 \n \n The situation in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire also continues to \nbe a source of concern for Africa and the rest of the \ninternational community. In the Democratic Republic \nof the Congo, a historic and crucial phase has begun \nwith the holding of general elections in that brotherly \ncountry. Here, I wish to pay tribute to the international \ncommunity, particularly the European Union \u2014 whose \nEUFOR peacekeeping troops are stationed in Gabon \u2014 \nand to the United Nations. Its support, together with \nthat of EUFOR, has thus far made it possible to hold \nsmooth general elections in that country, particularly \nthe first round of the presidential election, which took \nplace on 30 July 2006.  \n It is now essential that all Congolese political \nactors continue, in a spirit of patriotic fervour, to \nconsolidate the gains of the democratic transition \nprocess in an atmosphere of peace and harmony. In \norder to do that, they will also need the active support \nand sustained commitment of the international \ncommunity to ensure that the enormous sacrifices made \nby all do not come to naught for lack of follow-up. \n In that regard, the establishment of the \nPeacebuilding Commission is an appropriate \ninstitutional response to the many needs of countries \nemerging from conflict. I take this opportunity to \ncongratulate Ambassador Ismael Gaspar Martins of \nAngola on his election as Chairman of the \nCommission\u2019s Organizational Committee. I welcome \nthe fact that two African countries, Burundi and Sierra \nLeone \u2014 which have experienced many years of \nwar \u2014 have been chosen as the first countries to \nbenefit from the Commission\u2019s attention. \n However, if our efforts to strengthen international \npeace and security are to be effective, they must also \nfocus in particular on the area of conflict prevention. \nThe excellent report of the Secretary-General on the \nprevention of armed conflict (A/60/891) offers us a \ngood foundation for our work as we consider this \nimportant issue. \n We achieved a major breakthrough in 2001 with \nthe adoption of the Programme of Action to Prevent, \nCombat and Eliminate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms \nand Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. We regret, \nhowever, that the June and July 2006 review \nconference for the Programme of Action ended in \nfailure. Despite this, we need to pursue the \nimplementation of the Programme, as well as the \nadoption of an international instrument on the marking \nand tracing of these weapons. We also need to move \nforward with consultations in order to begin \nnegotiations leading to the adoption of an instrument \non brokering. Similarly, we have the moral duty and \nshared responsibility to renew disarmament \nnegotiations, particularly in the nuclear sphere.  \n One of the major trials facing our Organization is \nthe continuation and completion of negotiations on \nSecurity Council reform, in accordance with the \nrecommendation made by heads of State or \nGovernment at the September 2005 World Summit. We \nalso need to implement the resolutions regarding the \nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly, the \nmost recent of which was adopted on 8 September \n2006 as resolution 60/286. At the same time, major \nnegotiations in the Assembly over the past two sessions \nhave demonstrated, if such demonstration were needed, \nhow crucial a vitalized Assembly is for our \nOrganization. We also need to take the appropriate \nmeasures to ensure greater transparency and \nconsistency in the functioning of the United Nations \nsystem, ensuring improved implementation of its \nmissions.  \n As you are aware, Madam President, we have a \nparticularly heavy programme of work. I am certain \nthat, under your able guidance, the General Assembly \nwill make progress in the various areas of its agenda. \nWe will therefore need to continue to work with a \nheightened sense of our collective interest. The very \ncredibility of our Organization depends on it.  "

        "file_text": "Few \nwomen before you, Madam, have been elected to the \npresidency of the General Assembly, despite the fact \nthat, as the Chinese proverb states, women hold up half \nthe sky. We are delighted by your election and \ncongratulate you and your country, Bahrain. Our \ncongratulations go also to the Group of Asian States, \nwhich, happily, put your name forward. You can rest \nassured that our delegation will always be ready to \nsupport you as you carry out you lofty and challenging \ntask. \n We would also like to congratulate your \npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson, on \nhaving so successfully guided the work of the General \nAssembly during the previous session, as well as for \nhis understanding of the capacity of Member States to \novercome their differences. Because of his \nperseverance, the majority of the reforms resulting \nfrom the commitments entered into at the 2005 World \nSummit have been implemented. \n At the beginning of this debate we heard Mr. Kofi \nAnnan present his report on the work of the \nOrganization (A/61/1) for the last time. He clearly set \nout for us his beliefs and accomplishments and his \nrecommendations for strengthening the United Nations. \nMy delegation associates itself with the numerous \ntributes paid to the Secretary-General. We also wish to \nconvey to him our profound gratitude for his \ncourageous efforts over the past 10 years. Thanks to \nthe extensive experience he acquired at the \nOrganization, he was able to move the United Nations \nforward \u2014 in an environment fraught with threats and \nnew challenges \u2014 to meet the expectations aroused as \na result of the upheavals caused by globalization. His \nclear vision made it possible to establish the existence \nof the nexus between peace, development and human \nrights \u2014 Charter principles that have repeatedly \nunderpinned our common efforts.  \n Guided by the watchful motivation of His Serene \nHighness Prince Albert II, the Government of Monaco \nhas worked to increase its contribution to development \nand international cooperation through a significant \nincrease in official development assistance (ODA). In \nthat connection, cooperation credits have increased by \n30 per cent in 2006. The Principality will continue its \nefforts to expeditiously reach the goals set and \nreaffirmed last year at this very rostrum by His Serene \nHighness the Sovereign Prince.  \n The advancement of women, improving child and \nmaternal health and the alleviation of poverty are \namong the Principality\u2019s priorities on the international \nsphere. The Sovereign Prince and his sisters, Princess \nCaroline of Hanover and Princess St\u00e9phanie of \n  \n \n06-53958 2 \n \nMonaco, are greatly involved in development efforts \nintended to help the most destitute. In her capacity as a \ngoodwill ambassador for the United Nations \nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, Her \nRoyal Highness the Princess of Hanover is helping to \npromote programmes to educate girls and women. Part \nof that effort includes a project undertaken by Monaco, \nAndorra, Cyprus, Luxembourg and San Marino on the \ntheme of human rights and education in combating \npoverty and promoting the independence of girls and \nwomen. \n As President of the World Association of \nChildren\u2019s Friends, the Princess has long led an \nongoing struggle to protect children. On the recent \noccasion of being honoured by UNICEF-USA, the \nPrincess of Hanover stated that \u201ctoday we are at war \nagainst terror, especially against the terror in the eyes, \nhearts and spirits of millions of children around the \nworld\u201d. \n This session will provide impetus to the effort to \npromote and protect the rights of children with next \nOctober\u2019s publication of a study by the independent \nexpert Paulo Pinheiro, to which the Principality is \nproud to have contributed. Let us not forget that, as \nJean-Paul Sartre wrote, violence, regardless of what \nform it takes, constitutes a failure.  \n We hope that, following the Security Council\u2019s \ndebates on the protection of children in armed conflict, \nthe effective implementation of Council resolution \n1620 (2005) will lead to progress in this area of such \nconcern. It is unacceptable in human terms for the \nperpetrators of such crimes to go unpunished.  \n During her presence here last June to attend the \nHigh-level Meeting on HIV/AIDS, Princess St\u00e9phanie \nof Monaco expressed her solidarity with all those \nfighting the disease or otherwise affected. Through her \nFight AIDS Monaco association, the Princess is \nworking to promote prevention, research and assistance \nto those affected by the virus \u2014 especially sero-\npositive people, who are often victims of \ndiscrimination. In that regard, the Princess has \nexpressed the wish that the dignity of every sero-\npositive person be respected. Her association will \nsupport the establishment of an entity to provide \npsychological support for those ill with the disease in \nan African country where many non-governmental \norganizations from Monaco have already carried out \ndevelopment efforts.  \n The upcoming appointment of Princess St\u00e9phanie \nas a special representative of the Joint United Nations \nProgramme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) will further \nstrengthen her commitment to the fight against this \nterrible pandemic, which is increasingly affecting more \nand more women. To address that situation, the \nGovernment of Monaco has decided that, in addition to \nthe support it provides to UNAIDS, it will begin this \nyear to finance a United Nations Population Fund \nproject in Africa focusing mainly on sero-positive \nwomen suffering from extreme poverty and \npsychological distress and providing them with \nmedical, psychological and social assistance.  \n Our heads of State or Government resolved to \ntake action when they accepted the responsibility to \nprotect. It is of course up to individual States to protect \ntheir populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic \ncleansing and crimes against humanity. But when such \ntragic events cannot be prevented, it falls to the \ninternational community, working through the United \nNations, to be prepared to immediately provide \nassistance to victims of such acts.  \n Whether a catastrophe is natural or man-made, it \nis crucial that we be able to meet the most pressing \nneeds of civilian populations. In that regard, we would \nlike to commend the Under-Secretary-General for \nHumanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief \nCoordinator and his Office for their ongoing efforts, \nespecially as regards the restructuring of the Central \nEmergency Response Fund. Monaco is a contributor to \nthe Fund and intends to continue its efforts to provide \nfinancing for humanitarian assistance during the years \nto come.  \n Before the end of this year, His Serene Highness \nPrince Albert II will once again visit the fishing village \nof Sirombu on Nias Island, Indonesia, which has twice \nbeen struck by natural disaster: first by a tidal wave in \nDecember 2004 and, a few months later, by an \nearthquake. The village has been rebuilt thanks to the \neffective and generous action of the Monaco-Asia \nAssociation.  \n As the Sovereign Prince announced that it would \nduring the 2005 World Summit (see A/60/PV./6), \nMonaco ratified the Kyoto Protocol last February.  \n Our head of State has a personal and ongoing \ncommitment to protecting the environment. That \ncommitment was recently evidenced in the polar \nexpedition he undertook 100 years after the one made \n \n \n3 06-53958 \n \nby his great-great grandfather, Prince Albert I, a \npioneer of modern oceanography. Having reached the \nNorth Pole with his team on 16 April 2006, following \nfour days on an arduous course on dog sleds from the \nRussian base of Barneo, Prince Albert II launched an \nurgent appeal regarding the dangers of global warming, \nunfortunately in evidence in the Arctic in the \nsignificant shrinking of the ice shelf. Back in Monaco, \nHis Serene Highness established a foundation devoted \nto environmental preservation and sustainable \ndevelopment that will serve as a permanent source of \ndynamic and innovative efforts in the areas of climate \nchange, biodiversity loss and water resources.  The \nPrincipality is also pleased to have been elected to the \nUnited Nations Commission on Sustainable \nDevelopment. We hope to contribute to improving the \nUnited Nations environmental machinery. \n The Principality of Monaco believes that there is \na need to establish and strengthen dialogue among \ncivilizations in order to prevent conflict. We support all \nefforts aimed at actively promoting a culture of peace \nand mutual respect among the world\u2019s various creeds, \ncultures and languages. As Secretary-General Kofi \nAnnan stated in 1999, \u201cThe greater the appreciation of \ndiversity, the deeper the sense of identity and the \nsounder the enlargement of the common denominator \nof values\u201d (A/54/546, para. 13). \n It is in that spirit that Monaco, aware of the \nuniversal value of sport as one of the best tools to \nestablish inter-cultural dialogue, fully supports the \nUnited Nations Action Plan on Sport for Development \nand Peace.

        "file_text": "I \nam pleased to express my sincerest congratulations to \nyou, Madam President, upon your election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \nsession. It reflects the international community\u2019s trust \nin your diplomatic abilities, which will help ensure the \nsuccess of this important session.  \n I want to take this opportunity to extend my \ndeepest appreciation to all the countries that endorsed \nthe nomination of Shaikha Haya Bint Rashed \nAl-Khalifa. The election of Shaikha Haya as President \nof the Assembly is an honour for the Kingdom of \nBahrain, she being the third woman in the history of \nthis Organization, as well as the first Arab and Muslim \nwoman, to hold this prominent position. This election \nconfirms the significant achievements and progress of \nwomen in the Kingdom of Bahrain.  \n I take this opportunity to commend her \npredecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson of Sweden, for his \ntireless efforts during the Assembly\u2019s sixtieth session, \none that will be remembered for efforts to reform the \nOrganization. \n I would also like to pay tribute to Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan for his devotion in promoting the \nUnited Nations and strengthening its leading role in \nupholding peace and security throughout the world, \nparticularly in our Arab region during his recent trip to \nthe Middle East. \n In addition, I wish to congratulate the Republic of \nMontenegro upon its admission to the United Nations \nas the l92nd Member State. Allow me to express the \nhope that its joining this Organization will enhance \npeace and stability in the world. \n The central force behind progress in developing \ncountries and among their peoples lies in the inching of \npolitical reforms, economic liberalization and social \nmodernization. This is the platform that the Kingdom \nof Bahrain has implemented in its reform process, led \nfor several years by His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa \nAl-Khalifa, to strengthen democracy, human rights and \neconomic growth. National gains have multiplied and \npopular participation in the political, economic and \nsocial fields has increased. This is reflected in many \nareas.  \n Democratic practices have been enhanced \nthrough municipal and parliamentary elections, with \nmen and women participating as voters and candidates, \nand by the establishment of the Institute for Political \nDevelopment to enhance democratic practices and a \nculture of dialogue in the Kingdom. The Arab Charter \non Human Rights has been ratified and a counter-\nterrorism law has been passed. We have acceeded to \nthe United Nations International Covenant on Civil and \nPolitical Rights. The Kingdom of Bahrain has been \nelected to membership of the United Nations Human \nRights Council. We are working closely with other \nmembers to promote and protect human rights in all \nareas. We have enhanced the role of women in society \nto assume leadership positions in the Kingdom, \nincluding the judiciary. In addition, a programme to \nempower women, overseen by the Supreme Council for \nWomen, has been approved.  \n We are forging a partnership with \nnon-governmental organizations (NGOs), as was \nevident in the Forum for the Future hosted by the \nKingdom of Bahrain last November. At that Forum, \nNGOs worked side by side with Governments in \ndiscussing human rights, the fight against corruption, \nthe rule of law and the empowerment of women. \nIndeed, Bahrain takes pride in having the largest \nnumber of NGOs in proportion to its population, with \napproximately 300 registered NGOs.  \n We are addressing negative phenomena in the \nnational economy, such as unemployment, by initiating \na national project to provide jobs for the unemployed. \nMoreover, the Kingdom of Bahrain has consolidated its \npioneering economic role in the Gulf region through \nlaws to attract investment under the supervision of the \nEconomic Development Board.  \n A high committee to reform education has been \nformed to develop and modernize the education \nsystem. Its recommendations were adopted in June \n2006. The Kingdom of Bahrain has continued to rank \nhigh in human development, as confirmed in the latest \nUnited Nations Human Development Report. Positive \nintegrated development on the political, social, cultural \nand economic levels was further evidenced by the \nrecommendations of the National Conference for \nSocial Policies in the Kingdom of Bahrain, held in the \n  \n \n06-53323 14 \n \nspring of this year under the auspices of the United \nNations, which aimed to promote integration and \ncohesion of all aspects and components of \ndevelopment. \n We in the Kingdom of Bahrain still view the \nphenomenon of terrorism and terrorist acts in many \nparts of the world as the most dangerous threat to \ninternational peace and security. There must be greater \neffort by the international community and more \ncoordination on all levels to confront and contain this \nscourge. The Kingdom commends United Nations \nefforts to fight terrorism. The Secretary-General\u2019s \nreport issued last April entitled \u201cUniting against \nterrorism: recommendations for a global counter-\nterrorism strategy\u201d (A/60/825) contains many \nconstructive elements that we embrace, along with \nother points that need further examination and \ndiscussion. It is important that any counter-terrorism \nstrategy not infringe on human rights or fundamental \nfreedoms, while complying with international law. One \nof the positive aspects of that report is its call to \naddress issues that are exploited by terrorists and to \nstudy the motives behind terrorism. \n The Kingdom of Bahrain has continued its \ntireless efforts in this field. In fact, it has already \nsigned 11 of the 12 international agreements on \nterrorism and hosts the Middle East and North Africa \nFinancial Action Task Force established in November \n2004 to combat money-laundering and terrorist \nfinancing. In addition, Bahrain continuously \ncoordinates efforts with its brotherly neighbours of the \nArab Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), pursuant to the \nGCC Counter-Terrorism Agreement adopted in May \n2004. Implementation of the strategy proposed in the \nSecretary-General\u2019s report is just a beginning, as the \nreport states. What is more important is its full \nimplementation. \n The events in the Middle East in recent months, \nespecially in Gaza, the occupied Palestinian territories \nin the West Bank and then during the past few weeks in \nLebanon, have driven the entire region to the edge of \nan abyss that could become even more dangerous. We \nmust all work more diligently to address the root \ncauses and repercussions of this struggle, which \nfrustrates hopes for peace and disappoints the \naspirations of the peoples of the region for peace, \nstability and security. \n Resolution of this catastrophic situation, with its \ndire consequences, must not be delayed. The \ninternational community has special and multiple \nresponsibilities in this regard. Therefore the Council of \nArab Foreign Ministers called upon the Security \nCouncil to meet at the ministerial level. That meeting \nwas held yesterday to discuss all tracks in accordance \nwith the terms of reference of the peace process, \nrelevant Security Council resolutions, the principle of \nland for peace and the Arab Peace Initiative, which was \npresented by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques \nand adopted by the Arab summits. A settlement should \nbe pursued through a new and developed mechanism to \nresume direct negotiations among the parties under the \nCouncil\u2019s supervision, within a specified time limit and \nwith international guarantees. \n We wish to express our deep concern at the \nbloody events and huge destruction that took place in \nbrotherly Lebanon this year caused by Israeli military \noperations. On the basis of our concern for the \nsovereignty and independence of Lebanon, we support \nresolution 1701 (2006) and the need for all parties to \ncomply with it. We also affirm the importance of the \ninternational community\u2019s support for the seven points \nset out by His Excellency Mr. Fouad Siniora, Prime \nMinister of Lebanon, to complement that resolution. \nWe reaffirm that the Kingdom of Bahrain stands with \nthe Republic of Lebanon against anything that \nendangers its sovereignty and territorial integrity and \nsupport it with a view to preventing any act outside \nLebanese State authority that endangers its stability. \nWe also express our appreciation for the efforts of the \nArab Tripartite Committee on Lebanon, the State of \nQatar \u2014 the Arab member of the Security Council \u2014 \nand all other States that have supported the Arab \nposition. \n The Kingdom of Bahrain realizes that Lebanon, \ntoday, faces great challenges that require concerted \ninternational efforts by the United Nations, the \nEuropean Union and all influential Powers. Such \nefforts must be aimed not solely at keeping the peace \nbut also at rebuilding and reviving the economy with \nthe help of the Lebanese Government and people, so \nthat Lebanon can participate once again, as it has done \nthrough the centuries, in the cultural and economic \ndevelopment of the Middle East and the world at large. \nIn this regard, the recent Stockholm Conference was a \nstep in the right direction. \n \n \n15 06-53323 \n \n We reiterate our position that a just, lasting and \ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East necessitates, \nfirst and foremost, that Israel withdraw fully from all \nArab territories occupied since 1967, including the \nSyrian Golan Heights and the remaining occupied \nLebanese territories. It also requires the return of \nPalestinian refugees and the establishment of a \nPalestinian State on all occupied Palestinian lands, \nwith Jerusalem as its capital. \n The Kingdom of Bahrain welcomes the recent \npositive developments in Iraq, including the election of \na national assembly and the formation of a permanent \nIraqi Government. The Kingdom of Bahrain also \nwelcomes the Iraqi Government\u2019s steps to promote \ngenuine national reconciliation and accord and to \nconsolidate peace, stability, and dialogue among all \nsegments of society. Bahrain hopes that the \nGovernment\u2019s national reconciliation measures will put \nan end to violence and the killing of innocent civilians, \nrestore stability and preserve Iraq\u2019s unity and cohesion. \nWe also hope that these measures will lead to \nrenunciation of violence and to addressing the waves \nof killing, sectarianism and extremism, so that a new \nsafe and unified Iraq can emerge and enjoy democracy \nand the rule of law, an Iraq with close relations with its \nArab and Islamic brothers and one that adheres to its \ninternational commitments and responsibilities. There \nis no doubt that the Iraqi Government\u2019s efforts in this \ndirection are supported by the pivotal role that Iraq\u2019s \nneighbouring countries have played in reinforcing their \ngood-neighbourly policies, through respect for Iraq\u2019s \nsovereignty, cooperation in controlling the borders and \nnon-interference in Iraq\u2019s internal affairs. \n The Kingdom of Bahrain, together with the other \nmembers of the Gulf Cooperation Council, calls for a \npeaceful settlement of the dispute between the United \nArab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran \nconcerning the three islands of Greater Tunb, Lesser \nTunb and Abu Musa, which belong to brotherly United \nArab Emirates. This dispute should be settled either \nthrough negotiations or by referring it to the \nInternational Court of Justice for adjudication. \n Within the framework of maintaining regional \nsecurity in the Gulf region, we confirm that friendly \nrelations among Gulf countries should be based on \nrespect for the principles of sovereignty, independence, \nterritorial integrity, good-neighbourliness, non-interference \nin internal affairs and peaceful settlement of disputes. \nThis would create a positive atmosphere that would \nhelp address issues in a spirit of conciliation and in \naccordance with international law, particularly on the \nissue of the use of nuclear energy for peaceful \npurposes, in order not to threaten the security, \neconomic and environmental concerns of the countries \nof the region and help them avoid the dangers of \nconfrontation and tension. To support the creation of \nsuch a positive environment, we should work together \nto make the Middle East, including the Gulf region, a \nzone free of weapons of mass destruction. At the same \ntime, we affirm the right of States to use nuclear \nenergy for peaceful purposes, in accordance with the \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \nand under the International Atomic Energy Agency \nsafeguards regime. \n Today, all of us need to join in efforts to achieve \nthe objective of a collective security system through \nmultilateral diplomacy, for which the United Nations is \nthe main arena. Through your presidency, Madam, we \nhope that our efforts will yield new measures to reform \nthe Organization. In his report on the work of the \nOrganization (A/61/1), the Secretary-General states \nthat no reform of the United Nations will be complete \nwithout the reform of the Security Council, which \nshould be more representative of today\u2019s geopolitical \nrealities. This would make it more efficient and \ntransparent. Furthermore, we hail the establishment \nthis year of the Peacebuilding Commission and the \nHuman Rights Council. \n The gap between developed and developing \ncountries remains wide in the areas of economic, \nhuman, scientific and technological development. \nDeveloping countries must redouble their efforts to \nbridge this gap and mitigate its negative impact. They \nneed to promote good governance, uphold human \nrights, expand democratic participation, enhance \ntransparency, empower women and enhance their role \non the international stage. However, they cannot \nachieve this by themselves: developed countries must \ncontinue their commitment to offer support and \nassistance by cancelling debts and supplying \ndeveloping countries with the knowledge, up-to-date \ntechnology and expertise they need to achieve \nsustainable development. \n The Millennium Development Goals are the best \nroad map towards sustainable development. Those \nGoals can be reached only through an international \nstrategic partnership between developed and \ndeveloping countries, along with international \n  \n \n06-53323 16 \n \norganizations and agencies, in particular the United \nNations, and with the participation of civil society \ninstitutions and the private sector, in view of the vital \nnational and international role they play. \n It is true to say that changes in the world situation \nand great progress achieved by the international \ncommunity have brought human civilization to wider \nhorizons in which there is no excuse for excluding or \nmarginalizing others. We believe that there is plenty of \nroom for dialogue and positive diversity. This is \nbecause we, as nations, are linked in a single \ninternational civilization, one that is rich in religions \nand cultures and within which we can explore \neverything that can bring peace and stability to the \nwhole world. \n In conclusion, Madam, we hope that, under your \npresidency, this session will be marked by the spirit of \nreform that has pervaded the United Nations. We \nconfirm the need to unify our efforts and exercise \npatience and flexibility in order to achieve reform and \ndevelopment. The Kingdom of Bahrain is committed to \nachieving those goals and will support efforts to \nstrengthen the United Nations and its position in the \nworld. "

        "file_text": "A decade ago, it was \nsaid that with the end of the cold war we had reached \nthe \u201cend of history.\u201d Over the years, this view has been \nlargely discredited.  \n Much of the world, especially the West, paid \nscant attention to the sense of injustice shared by many \npeoples and communities around the world. What we \nhave witnessed, with a mixture of horror, sympathy and \nunease over the last 10 years, has been the return of \nhistory. The fall of the Twin Towers, the wars in \nAfghanistan, Iraq and Lebanon and the terrorist attacks \nin London and Madrid have shaken the foundations of \nthe secular State. These events have been said to \nrepresent a \u201cclash of civilizations,\u201d but I reject the \nreductive, indeed, misleading division between North \nand South, East and West, and Christians and Muslims.  \n The greatest achievements in the West were the \nresult of a complex process of cultural exchange \nbetween East and West. The free trade of ideas fostered \ninnovation and advances in understanding. We must \ntherefore reject this notion of a mentality that \nconceives an essential clash between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d. \nI believe that we are living through a turbulent and \nbloody struggle between, on the one hand, the forces of \nextremism, present in both the East and the West, and, \non the other hand, secular tolerance, also fortunately \nmanifested everywhere on Earth. \n Andorra is an old country whose borders have \nremained unchanged since 1278. Our history is one of \nsurvival. We were in existence when the Cathars fled \nthe might of the first Crusade to seek refuge in our \nmountain pastures. We survived the French Revolution, \nthe Spanish Civil War and the Second World War. \nHistory has taught us that power demands restraint. \nAnd our own experiences have taught us \u2014 and the \npast few weeks have reinforced this costly lesson \u2014 \nthat displays of military might, intended to shock and \nawe, cannot, by themselves, bring about the desired \nresult. \n Is it not paradoxical that at this moment, when \nthe need for civilized discussion between people is \ngreater than ever, this venerable institution is deemed \ninconsequential? We need, of course, to continue the \nprocess of its reform. As an idea, however, this place \nembodies all of our hopes. As a humanitarian agency \nwith a host of vital social programmes, the United \nNations does inestimable work. As a forum for rational \ndiscourse committed to reaching global understanding, \nits work is absolutely necessary. This should be the \nforum in which we try to understand and correctly \ninterpret the crossroads at which we find ourselves. \nThe United Nations signifies the world\u2019s moral \nconscience \u2014 the principle of equality and solidarity \nand the protection of human rights and human dignity. \nIt marks the path to development. \n Violence and the rise of religious extremism have \nroiled the globe. We all are prey to the unease felt over \nthe future of the secular State. In one sense, however, \nthe very idea of the nation-State lies at the heart of \nmany of our problems. It encourages us to believe in \nthe rhetoric of \u201cus\u201d against \u201cthem\u201d, in exclusive \nidentities and in outdated ethnocentric discourse. It \nobfuscates the growing division between rich and poor \nthat transcends countries, nations, and continents. It \nneglects the fact that most people on this planet seek \nonly that which will permit them to live in a dignified \nmanner and be happy in their lives. \n Indeed, many States, especially those whose \nboundaries reflect a legacy of colonialism, are \nconstituted without regard to the religious or ethnic \nbackgrounds of their inhabitants. The civil wars that \nare currently tearing apart some countries are but one \nexample of the enormous difficulties presented by the \nartificial construction of such States. \n We must not forget that, historically, the West has \nnever been a good example in terms of religious \ntolerance. On the contrary, one might cite the twelfth-\ncentury expulsion of the Jews from England or recall \n  \n \n06-53005 10 \n \nthe forced conversion of Muslims after the fall of \nGranada in 1492, the Inquisition, or the persecution of \nthe Protestant Huguenots who fled France during the \nsixteenth century. Yet in the East \u2014 in Jerusalem or \nTehran, for example \u2014 Muslims, Jews and Christians \ncoexisted into the early twentieth century. Those great \ncosmopolitan centres flourished in an atmosphere of \ngenuine religious tolerance. \n The original meaning of the term secular \ndescribed those religious orders that looked outwards \nto the world at large. In the sixteenth century a new \nnotion of tolerance signified a willingness to accept \ndifferent Protestant sects in towns and cities in \nNorthern Europe. But our modern-day understanding \nof tolerance, in which people of all religions can live \ntogether, required centuries. Curiously, this version of \nhistory has been forgotten by those who see secularism \nas being opposed to belief. The notion of secularism \nhas never been oppositional to religion but rather \ndenotes a mentality willing to contemplate uncertainty \nand imperfect knowledge. It does not confuse questions \nof faith with scientific questions or seek to disarm the \nindividual\u2019s liberty of conscience. \n Secularism, therefore, recognizes the shared \nfallibility of the human race. Religious faith can be \ntaught, but it cannot be imposed. It cannot lead to \nviolence and has to coexist with the secular state. Our \ncommon humanity requires us to respect each other \nthrough our diversity. \n The genius of tolerance lies in the ability to \nlisten \u2014 to truly listen and attempt to understand. To \nlisten and learn is not an act of weakness. Indeed, it is \nthe extremist\u2019s display of strength or desire for revenge \nthat represents a fatal weakness. Again and again, in \nthe course of history, we see that a mighty spirit \nprecedes a fall. Recently we have stood by and \nwitnessed in dismay the catastrophic results that ensue \nfrom the deployment of military might against \ndetermined guerrilla warfare. \n Most of today\u2019s ills have their roots in old and \nunresolved problems, but the rhetoric of violence \nwhich surrounds us polarizes us even further, \nundermines the possibility of finding a lasting solution \nand widens the lines of fracture. We have to think of \nourselves as a single global community where we are \nall interdependent.  \n In the Middle East, we recognize the need for \nIsrael\u2019s security, as we recognize the need for Palestine \nto become a viable State. \n Andorra is located in a part of the world which \nhas always been a place where different cultures have \nmet and lived in shared prosperity: the Mediterranean. \nToday, this has become a new frontier full of tension. \nAs Europeans, we must seek to revitalize the area, \nrecalling its ancient history as a home to many \ncivilizations and their corresponding values \u2014 from \nRome to Byzantium and from Athens to Tangiers. \n Andorra, like many small countries, long relied \non its isolation for its survival. But in our global world, \nmountains can no longer protect us. International \nconcerns press upon us. Today\u2019s world is \nheterogeneous, imperfect and lacking in a common \nvision; there are no easy solutions, and questions \ncannot be viewed in monochrome. The Millennium \ngoals that we debated here with such hope are in \ndanger of receding into distant memory. Is this the fault \nof the United Nations? Let us not turn our backs on the \nmasses, who are tired of suffering, and who see the \nUnited Nations as being their only hope. We must \nallow their voices to be heard and welcome them into \nthe global community. The time has come for us to act \non our promises. \n We must recognize that collectively we are the \nUnited Nations. We represent humanity as a whole. We \nare betraying it if we do not seek to make the United \nNations a more robust and efficient machine. If we \ncontinue blindly, caring only for our national self-\ninterest, we betray its trust. Multilateralism, which we \nas a group embody in this Hall, is the path that will \nlead to many of the solutions. The plight of the \nunfortunate should not fall on deaf ears. We should join \ntogether to solidify democratic institutions and \nprocesses, and in so doing fight against poverty, war, \ndisease, illiteracy and corruption. That should be our \ncommon cause. It is only through this joint effort that \nwe will be able to raise our approach to a collectively \nethical and morally correct level. \n When people do not have enough to eat and when \nthey are deprived of essential freedoms and justice, \nthere is only one option left open to them: to seek a \nbetter life by whatever means they can, leaving behind \ntheir native lands. We are currently witnessing mass \nmigration from the poorest parts of the world to the \nricher; all too often, the journey is tragically cut short \n \n \n11 06-53005 \n \non the high seas. This weighs heavily on our \nconscience. Erecting barriers to prevent this process \nwill never work: their desperation is too great. Millions \nof human beings are orphaned from their homelands \u2014 \nwe should have solutions to offer them. There is no \nplace where this issue is more pressing than sub-\nSaharan Africa. The high risk of death does not impede \npeople from attempting to reach the shores of Europe, \nsimply because their lives at home have become \nunbearable. \n We require a concerted and global plan for \nmigration. This can be achieved only if we act together \nthrough the United Nations to provide the human and \nmaterial resources necessary to step-up to the \nchallenge. In so doing we will better the lives of \nmillions of people who, quite justifiably, feel cruelly \ndisenfranchised from the human family. As the writer \nJuan Goytisolo put it, \u201cThe world provides a home for \nthose who are homeless\u201d. The United Nations should \ncertainly be their refuge. \n In line with this, Andorra stands ready to \nunderline its commitment to the United Nations system \nand to development as a whole. Two days ago here in \nNew York, we signed an agreement with UNICEF to \nprovide \u20ac1 million in financing over a five-year period \nto help children suffering from HIV/AIDS in \nCameroon. Civil society in our small country is also \nplaying its part; the Andorran National Committee for \nUNICEF will contribute \u20ac500,000 to this project over \nthe same period. \n It is true that our world today is a dangerous \nplace. But there is still immense hope, and this spurs us \non. There is no definitive answer to the problems that \nour societies face, and it has been said that our lives as \nhuman beings cannot be perfected. We have a duty, \nhowever, to continually ask questions and to have the \ncourage to overcome the problems of our age.  \n Our ideas are the greatest advantage that we \nhave; they are the motors of progress. For us, this \nmeans democracy, shared prosperity, tolerance, the rule \nof law, respect for human rights and the pursuit of \nfreedom through the defence of fundamental human \nliberties. Those are the best weapons we have to fight \nabsolutism and inequality. It is here at the United \nNations that our voices should be heard and here that \nwe should be able to defend those principles. \n Finally, I should like to express our gratitude to \nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his great \nwork over the past 10 long and complicated years. We \nsalute and congratulate him for all that he has done to \nmaintain and apply the principles enshrined in the \nCharter. I speak for all Andorrans in expressing my \nesteem for him and his great efforts. "

        "file_text": "It gives me great \npleasure to congratulate you, Madam, on your election \nas President of the General Assembly. The Romanian \ndelegation looks forward to a presidency which brings \nto the world Organization excellent diplomatic skills, \nwhile increasing our confidence in the prospects for \nmore balanced gender representation at the top. I \nwould also like to pay tribute to Ambassador Jan \nEliasson, President of the General Assembly at its \nsixtieth session, for his outstanding performance and \nfor his commitment to the reform of the United \nNations. \n Romania subscribes to the statement made by the \nPresident of Finland on behalf of the European Union, \nand fully shares the views expressed therein. I would \nlike, in addition, to give a frank account of my \ncountry\u2019s keen and active interest in a strong and \neffective United Nations. \n Let me say, in all modesty, that we strive hard to \npractice what we preach. Romania has had to make up \nfor 16 years of lost time \u2014 decades of ideological \npandemics, economic mismanagement, lack of respect \nfor human rights and lack of democracy. I would like \nto express the gratitude of my Government for the \ncontinuing support that the United Nations has \nextended during our transition in many helpful ways, \nincluding the valuable work of its country team in \nRomania. \n We have come a long way to now be in a position \nto join the European Union, which is profoundly rooted \nin the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for \nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule \nof law. We have worked hard, that is true, and we have \nhad very good friends all along to help us prevail. I am \ntherefore proud to say that the United Nations has \nbeen, and still is, foremost among those friends. \n Let me quote a recent statement by the Secretary-\nGeneral: \n \u201cOur success in advancing the agenda will \ndepend on great part on forging coalitions for \nchange involving Government representative, \ncivil society, the private sector, philanthropic \nfoundations, academic institutions and all others \nwith contributions to make. I know that Romania \nis strongly committed to this path of partnership \nand has been working actively to cement \nconstructive ties with the United Nations and \nwith its neighbours throughout Europe as the \ncountry moves towards formal accession to the \nEuropean Union.\u201d \n I myself could not have put it better if I had \nwished to characterize in a nutshell our genuine \ncommitment to effective multilateralism and to better \nmanagement of the rapid and multifaceted changes \nbrought about by the globalization process. That is why \nRomania understands, and wishes to be an active \nparticipant in, the current reform process, pursuant to \nthe guidelines we accepted as set out in the Millennium \nSummit Outcome. \n We have made significant steps ahead as far as \ninstitutional reform is concerned. We agreed to change \nthe Human Rights Commission, a body whose \nhistorical mission had been accomplished. We created a \nnew Human Rights Council to help the United Nations \nmake a fresh start in the implementation of the \nimpressive corpus of international human rights \ninstruments built since the Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights. But let us not indulge in complacency. \nIf we do not fill this new box with the expected \ncontents, our intention to reform will remain \nunfulfilled. \n The Human Rights Council should spare no effort \nin order to do what it is meant to do: uphold, in the \ndaily work of Governments across all continents and \nlegal systems, the priority goal of ensuring that human \nrights are widely and deeply known and observed. We \nshould not see the primary duty of the international \ncommunity to monitor the implementation of human \nrights law, be it by a universal peer review or by the \nexpert work of the special procedures of the Human \nRights Council, as unfriendly gestures towards our \nGovernments.  \n We are deeply honoured by the exceptional \nopportunity we have as members of the first Human \nRights Council to contribute to the reform of the \nUnited Nations human rights machinery. We have \nalready come up with a number of proposals aimed at \nstreamlining the work of the new Council and at \nupholding its authority. We need to make greater \nefforts to make human rights a fundamental pillar of \nthe United Nations, on an equal footing with security \nand development, by will of its Charter. \n  \n \n06-53323 36 \n \n There is a similar need with respect to the \nPeacebuilding Commission. The history of the United \nNations involves the continuing trend of creating new \nbodies to address new problems. That can be a virtue if \nsuch bodies have a strong mandate and sufficient \nresources to meet expectations. But it can also be a sin \nif all we do is generate additional meetings and \ndocuments without consequence. The Peacebuilding \nCommission is a remarkable institutional and legal \ninnovation. Let us introduce new thinking and \nresources, rather than old habits, into this framework.  \n Considerable efforts have been deployed since \n1993 to reform the Security Council. Romania is ready \nto embark on a meaningful and pragmatic \nconsideration of the question of increasing the \nmembership of the Security Council while preserving \nits effectiveness and credibility. We are aware of the \ndifficulties inherent in further Council expansion. \nRecent debates have shown that all Member States \nshould benefit to a certain extent from the reform of \nthe most powerful body in the United Nations system. \nAn obvious case in point is the Eastern European \nGroup, which expects to receive its fair share in the \neventual outcome of negotiations on this matter. \n The issue of the revitalization of the General \nAssembly is also on our agenda. The intensive efforts \nmade to expand the Security Council should not \nobscure the need to genuinely reform the most \nrepresentative organ of the United Nations \u2014 namely \nthe General Assembly. There are many ways to do \nmuch more within existing structures and available \nresources in terms of time and money. We can make \nsimple reforms. We may choose to streamline the \nagenda by confining it to essential and topical issues, \navoiding the annual repetition of texts which bring no \ntrue added value, and using less rhetoric and more \npragmatism as the main thread of our decisions.  \n The General Assembly can also do more in its \nrole of supporting democratization processes in various \ncountries. We know how shy the drafters of the Charter \nwere about the use of the idea of democracy. During \nthe cold war, the concept of democracy was merely \ntotemic at the United Nations. However, times have \nchanged for the better. I genuinely believe that the \nUnited Nations has made considerable, if not truly \nspectacular, progress in that area. \n My country is proud to have been an active \nplayer in two international movements whose \nfundamental task is to promote democracy: the New or \nRestored Democracies process and the Community of \nDemocracies. We have taken dedicated action under \nthe auspices of both. Romania initiated a series of five \nresolutions on different aspects of democracy-building \nthat have been adopted since the year 2000 by both the \nCommission on Human Rights and the General \nAssembly.  \n There is no reason why the United Nations would \nslow down this process. On the contrary, we take this \nopportunity to encourage both the sixth International \nConference of New or Restored Democracies, to be \nheld in Qatar, and the third Ministerial Conference of \nthe Community of Democracies, to be held in Mali, to \ndare to do more. The time has come for us to adopt a \nuniversal declaration on democracy, a code of \ndemocratic conduct or even an international covenant \non the right to democracy. Democracy works, despite \ndifficulties and temporary setbacks.  \n Let me add that, if we have doubts about our \nduty, we should ask our nations if they want to have a \nchoice, in a multiparty system, and to make full use of \nfair elections, as opposed to not participating or having \nto accede violently to power? Do they want to be \ngoverned by dictators who work for themselves or by \nGovernments that work for the governed? We all may \nfind the answer to these queries quite obvious. \n In our deliberations about reform, one of the \nquestions that arose was how to undertake \nconstitutional reform and bring the Charter more in \nline with the new challenges of our time. There is \nmuch to be done here, in spite of our understandable \nreluctance to reopen the sacred book. At the same time, \nwe could adequately make the most out of the existing \nlegal framework. \n We believe that Chapter VIII of the Charter is a \ngenerous framework for increased and more efficient \ncooperation between the United Nations and regional \norganizations. During its tenure as a non-permanent \nmember of the Security Council, my country, Romania, \ninitiated a rewarding debate on this topic, which led to \nthe adoption of resolution 1631 (2005). We welcome \nthe report of the Secretary-General entitled \u201cA \nregional-global security partnership: challenges and \nopportunities\u201d. The report is a very valuable \ncontribution to the clarification of the possible \ndistribution of roles based on the competitive \nadvantages of regional organizations. I therefore \n \n \n37 06-53323 \n \nsupport the recommendations made by the Secretary-\nGeneral aimed at passing from an \u201cadhocracy\u201d to the \ngradual institutionalization of the operational \nmechanisms of an enhanced cooperation. \n In this field, Romania practices what it preaches. \nThe proof lies in its determination to pursue regional \ncooperation processes in Central and South-Eastern \nEurope, in various fields: the South-Eastern European \nCooperation Process, the Central European Initiative, \nthe Stability Pact for South-eastern Europe, the Black \nSea Economic Cooperation and so on. The stability and \nprosperity in the Black Sea region is the main priority \nof our foreign policy at the regional level. We are \npursuing a new cooperation paradigm that is expected \nto produce deliverable results. Romania is satisfied at \nhaving promoted, during its chairmanship of the Black \nSea Economic Cooperation, two very important \ninitiatives: a Black Sea Euro-region, under the auspices \nof the Council of Europe, and a Forum for Dialogue \nand Partnership. \n We are a conscientious and responsible member \nof the international community and ready to assume \nour duties. The constant and robust economic growth \nof recent years has now enabled my country to \nconsider acting as a donor, helping developing \ncountries in their long-standing pursuit of economic \nprosperity. My Government has already taken measures \nto define a legal framework for the financing of official \ndevelopment assistance.  \n Europe has peace on its borders. But that is only \nhalf true if we take into consideration the continued \nexistence of frozen conflicts that seem to escape the \nactive attention of the United Nations. We are shirking \nour duty if we turn a deaf ear to the unresolved \nconflicts whose roots date back to the Soviet era. \nThose conflicts affect small States that are working \nhard to consolidate their independence, their \ninstitutions and their economies. They need the \nassistance of the United Nations and protection under \ninternational law. \n One of the most striking examples is the situation \nin Transdniestria, a separatist area of our neighbouring \ncountry the Republic of Moldova. The lawless regime \nthere must not be allowed to become permanent. \nSupported by heavily armed troops, that regime is \ninvolved in smuggling and illegal trafficking and is \ndisrespectful of human rights; it is also ready to seize \nschools manu militari. Relying on its weapons and \nammunition, the regime threatens its neighbours and \nthe legitimate Government of the Republic of Moldova \nand cynically mocks democracy through unlawful \nreferendums.  \n The United Nations must apply the provisions of \nthe Charter to put an end to the dark ages in \nTransdniestria. What is needed is genuine will on the \npart of all relevant actors \u2014 be they international \norganizations or neighbouring countries. We also \nbelieve that it is our duty to assist the courageous \nefforts of Georgia to build a democratic society and to \nregain full territorial integrity. There is hope. The \nrecent adoption by the General Assembly of a decision \nto include on its agenda a new item on protracted \nconflicts \u2014 which Romania has fully supported \u2014 \naugurs well for a new attitude. \n Seven years after the United Nations took \nresponsibility for the future of Kosovo, that province \nsymbolizes the difficult legacy that the Western \nBalkans is struggling to overcome. We support the \nefforts of Martti Ahtisaari, Special Envoy for the future \nstatus process for Kosovo, and of the Contact Group. \nBoth sides directly concerned should show greater \nflexibility in order to find a lasting and mutually \naccepted solution. In that regard, the United Nations \nrole remains extremely important until the future status \nof the province is decided. \n Our interest in achieving peace, stability and \nprosperity is not confined to our own region. Romania \nis trying hard to make significant contributions to the \nmaintenance of peace throughout the world. Romanian \nmilitary, police and civilian personnel are present in \nthe United Nations peacekeeping operations deployed \nin Afghanistan, Kosovo, the Democratic Republic of \nthe Congo, Liberia, Ethiopia and Eritrea, Haiti and the \nSudan. Together with other peace-loving nations, we \nalso contribute troops to other major peace operations, \nincluding those in Afghanistan, Iraq and Bosnia. \nNearly 1,500 Romanian troops, civilian police, military \nobservers, staff officers and support personnel are \ndeployed in those areas.  \n At the same time, we believe that more efforts are \nneeded to find lasting political solutions to existing \nconflicts and tensions. Afghanistan has come a long \nway towards becoming a stable State, free from \nterrorism and the Taliban. However, many challenges \nstill lie ahead. Winning the peace in Afghanistan \nrequires even more enhanced and coordinated efforts \n  \n \n06-53323 38 \n \nby the international community \u2014 especially to fight \ninsurgents, to train the Afghan army and police and to \naccelerate quick-impact reconstruction projects. \n Romania firmly supports the Government of Iraq \nin its efforts to create an efficient and responsible \nadministration. Strong international support is needed \nif the Iraqi people are to succeed in achieving lasting \nstability and in going back to work for the country\u2019s \nprosperity. Technical and financial support is also \nbadly needed. It is essential not to weaken the \ninternational presence in Iraq, without which the \nprogress made thus far would be put at risk. \n We take note with satisfaction of the latest \ndevelopments in Lebanon, particularly the progress \nmade in deploying an expanded United Nations force \nin the area. We believe that we are witnessing a historic \nbreakthrough in a long-standing conflict. We are \nconfident that the full implementation of Security \nCouncil resolution 1701 (2006) and of the future \nmandate of the United Nations Interim Force in \nLebanon will build hope and trust for a lasting political \nsolution to the Middle East conflict.  \n The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \nhas emerged as a major threat to global security and \ninternational stability. We should never underestimate \nthe chances that such weapons will be used in terrorist \nactivities. We support new international efforts to \nstrengthen the existing international regimes, to ensure \nthe full and unconditional implementation of \nobligations undertaken by the States parties and to \npromote the universalization of multilateral treaties and \nagreements in the field of disarmament and non-\nproliferation. \n At the same time, we must continue to fight \nterrorism, individually and collectively, in order to \neliminate it as a threat to the lives of innocent people \nand to the daily life of our societies. If it is to succeed, \nthe international community must correctly identify \nand overcome the factors that contribute to terrorism. \nRomania is firmly engaged in the fight against terrorist \nthreats through its participation in the efforts of the \ninternational community and in those undertaken by \nregional and subregional organizations. \n(spoke in French) \n Romania will soon have the honour to host the \neleventh summit of la Francophonie. This conference \nof heads of State and Government of countries using \nFrench as a common language will take place on 28 \nand 29 September 2006 in Bucharest. La Francophonie \ndefinitely does more than promote multilingualism. At \nthe previous summit, la Francophonie acted as a \nfaithful partner by adopting a strategic framework \naligned with the Millennium Goals and the objectives \nof the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on \nSustainable Development, held at Johannesburg. That \nframework is fully in keeping with the fight against \npoverty and the efforts to promote sustainable \ndevelopment. It is based on a consensus that \nemphasizes human rights, good governance and \ndemocracy, as well as conflict prevention and \npeacebuilding. This year, the summit will have the \ntheme \u201cInformation technologies in education\u201d. That is \nanother complementary area on which la Francophonie \nintends to focus in order to contribute to the objectives \nagreed at the World Summit on the Information \nSociety. I hope that during the present session of the \nGeneral Assembly, Romania will be able to report \nfurther actions taken by la Francophonie in keeping \nwith United Nations objectives. "

        "file_text": "As I have just been re-\nelected, this is my first opportunity to speak to this \nforum at the beginning of my second term. It is \ntherefore with great pleasure that I am here today for \nthis sixty-first session of the General Assembly. \n Please allow me to congratulate Mrs. Haya \nRashed Al-Khalifa on her election as the new President \nof the General Assembly. We are fortunate to have as \nour President a diplomat with such magnificent \ncredentials. In addition, this is a milestone for the \nUnited Nations which makes us all proud. My country, \nSao Tome and Principe, is a firm believer in gender \nequality. I am proud to say that we have a very high \npercentage of girls in our schools. A woman has held \nthe presidency of our National Assembly, and the \ncurrent head of our Supreme Court is a woman. We \nhave had two female Prime Ministers, and today \nwomen head half of our Government ministries. We are \ntherefore delighted by her election and wish her every \nsuccess. \n I thank also the outgoing President, Mr. Jan \nEliasson, for his remarkable work, especially in the \narea of advancing reform of the United Nations. Words \nare insufficient to pay tribute to outgoing Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan. A very special son of Africa, he \nhas been an extraordinary leader of our Organization. \nHe has worked unceasingly, showing enormous vision \nand great courage. No challenge has been too large or \ntoo dangerous. My country and I owe a special debt of \ngratitude to the Secretary-General, whose intervention \n \n \n27 06-52885 \n \nduring a 2003 coup attempt helped preserve democracy \nin Sao Tome and Principe. My people and I thank him. \nWe can only hope that his successor will prove as \npraiseworthy as he. \n We are meeting here today at a time of growing \ninternational tension and of increased terrorist attacks \non innocent civilians on every continent. We see \nunending conflicts, even genocide. Never have we \nneeded the United Nations more than at this time, when \nlife as we know it on our planet is threatened by \nclimate change. It is tragic that in the face of all these \nchallenges, the United Nations is often unable to act, \nbecause internal politics and a lack of resources \nconstantly hamper its ability to respond as needed. \n No country can live in a vacuum in today\u2019s world. \nFor better or for worse, we are together in deciding the \nfate of our planet. We can no longer be only citizens of \nour town, our region or our country. We also cannot \nblindly think that our religion is the only religion, \nwhen God created so many, all believing in a Supreme \nBeing but worshiping in different fashions. God also \npainted us in a rainbow of colours and did not leave \ninstructions for one colour to be in charge of all the \nothers. Nor did He choose a special region or language \nto rule over everyone else. We must pull together so \nthat no one is left behind. There is enough for \neverybody, if only we would share. We all could live in \nfreedom and in peace, with work, health, education and \ndignity, if only we would work together. \n While we must work together for certain common \ngoals, we must also respect our cultural differences. \nOne size does not fit all. The practice of democracy in \nLatin America may not be the same as democracy in \nAsia. What worked to create economic growth in \nEurope may not work in Africa. Each country, each \npeople, each region, each town must have the freedom \nto decide what is best for it, while also respecting the \nrights of all and everyone\u2019s responsibility as a world \ncitizen. \n The HIV/AIDS pandemic is still out of control. In \nmy own tiny, isolated island country, we were long \nimmune from it. Despite desperate efforts at education \nand prevention, our tiny population is being laid waste \nby a shocking increase in the number of HIV/AIDS \ncases. We have only one hospital and a handful of \ndoctors. We are helpless in the face of this crisis, as we \ncannot afford the antiretrovirals we need for all our \nsick people, nor do we have the ability to police our \nmaritime borders to keep out the main source of \ninfection. Our women and children are among the \nmillions of other faceless victims around the world, \nand, without help, we could one day face extinction. \n Climate change is already sabotaging many of the \nefforts being made to achieve sustainable development \ngoals, augmenting poverty in developing countries, \nespecially in the least developed countries and the \nsmall island developing States. There is new and strong \nevidence that most of the warming observed is \nattributable to human activities. As the polar ice caps \nmelt, my low-lying island country faces a second kind \nof extinction, that of disappearing beneath the waves of \nthe ocean. \n I cannot continue without again asking the \nAssembly why a country of 23 million people is not \nrepresented at the United Nations, where every country \nis supposed to have one vote. I refer here to Taiwan, an \nestablished democracy whose people live in freedom \nand in peace. Their dynamic and technologically \nadvanced economy is a model for creating wealth in \ntoday\u2019s global economy. Taiwan is also an excellent \nworld citizen, generous in humanitarian and \ndevelopment aid. \n For centuries, the people of Sao Tome and \nPrincipe were debilitated by endemic malaria, and \nthousands died. Countless attempts to control the \nmosquitoes carrying that disease failed, until Taiwan \nbrought the necessary know-how and resources to bear. \nToday cases of malaria have been reduced by 60 per \ncent. Our doctors and nurses say that there have never \nbeen so few cases of malaria in living memory. Thanks \nto Taiwan and also to the Global Fund to Fight \nHIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, we are well on \nour way to finally bringing this scourge under control. \n In addition to humanitarian and development aid, \nTaiwan also maintains productive commercial ties with \nmany United Nations Member countries and is a \nmember of the World Trade Organization, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank and the Asia Pacific Economic \nGroup. The principle of universality is consecrated in \nthe United Nations Charter. Permanent members of the \nSecurity Council should not continue to ignore the case \nof Taiwan. \n Another issue that continues to require the urgent \nattention of all of us is the embargo on Cuba. This is a \nrelic of the cold war that should be lifted immediately. \n  \n \n06-52885 28 \n \n While mentioning the Security Council, I must \nsay that my country supports the calls that have \nreverberated through these halls for more than a \ndecade. We must reform the Security Council. Its \nmembership and institutional structures reflect \noutdated geopolitical realities and political thinking \nthat was shaped by the world of 1945. Giving only five \npermanent members the veto power and special \nprivileges puts the Security Council out of touch with \nthe world. Africa, for example, does not have a single \npermanent member. This is not acceptable. \n I will close by talking about poverty, or rather \nwhat we are all seeking, which is the end of poverty. \nThe Millennium Development Goals are a noble \nproject. Sao Tome and Principe is grateful to Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan and the Goals\u2019 Director Jeffrey \nSachs for their tireless efforts to pull poor countries out \nof what Professor Sachs so rightly calls the poverty \ntrap. \n But how did so many countries get into the \npoverty trap? We are unlikely to get out, or stay out, \nunless we know how we got there in the first place. I \nthink it is time we all faced some of the unspoken \ntruths about poverty. Why are we poor? Economists \ntraditionally told us that economic wealth comes from \na combination of man-made resources, such as roads, \nfactories, machines, telephone systems; human \nresources, hard work and education; and technological \nresources, technical know-how and technological \nmachinery. But if this were true, then poor countries \ncould simply build some schools, pave roads and buy \nsome computers, and we would quickly catch up with \nrich countries. \n But there is something wrong here. While \nTaiwan, South Korea and China have all been doubling \ntheir incomes every decade, many poor countries \nmaking these changes are not growing faster than rich \ncountries. In fact, they are growing more slowly, or \neven getting poorer. So there is a new theory that says \nthe more you have, the faster you grow. This could \nexplain why rich countries stay rich, and poor countries \nfall farther behind \u2014 except that it does not explain \nhow Chile, India, Singapore, Mauritius and Botswana \nare catching up. These dynamic countries \u2014 not Japan, \nnot Switzerland, not the United States \u2014 are the \nfastest-growing economies on the planet. Fifty years \nago they were trapped in poverty. That is no longer the \ncase. \n Why have so many other countries been left \nbehind? The newest theories tell us that the answer is \nsimple. With or without natural resources, with or \nwithout human resources, with or without technology, \nbadly governed countries are poor countries. Bad \ngovernment causes poverty. When States do not protect \nproperty and people; when national revenues benefit \nself-interested political insiders who oppose any \nactions that would lead to more equal distribution of \nincome and resources; when Government officials \nwaste funds; when people are hired on the basis of \nbeing from the right family or region or political \ngrouping; when nobody monitors Government \nspending; when corruption is noted but never punished; \nand when illegal activities are not restrained by law, \nthe press or democratic opposition, then miserable \nresults follow. \n We have all heard of the \u201cnatural resource curse\u201d, \nwhich shows that large amounts of oil or diamonds, for \nexample, tend to make democracy and good \ngovernment less likely. But recent studies have also \nfound that there is also an \u201caid curse\u201d. Without \nmeaning to do so, multilateral and bilateral donors can \nactually make Governments worse. And just as badly \ngoverned countries tend to be poor, so badly governed \naid projects, without transparency or accountability, \nalso tend to fail. \n Humanitarian aid has proven far more successful \nthan long-term development aid, because it is given in \nhighly targeted bursts. It is also usually given as \nmedicine, food, clothing or tents and taken directly to \nthe location of the tragedy, with doctors and nurses on \nthe ground rather than consultants. \n Of course, there have been some beautiful \nsuccesses in aid programmes, mostly in health care, \nwith victories over smallpox, drug-resistant \ntuberculosis and river blindness. Adult literacy has \nrisen, as had life expectancy until the AIDS pandemic \nwiped out that improvement. \n Aid gives hope to millions of people around the \nworld. We simply need to mend it, not end it. My own \ncountry has certainly suffered from its own share of \nbad governance \u2014 for the most part unwittingly, \nbecause of our own inexperience. But we are learning \nquickly in our short history, and we now have one of \nthe most stable and robust democracies in all of Africa. \n We have the prospect of oil in our waters and in \nwaters shared with our neighbour, Nigeria. We have \n \n \n29 06-52885 \n \nalready taken steps to ensure that any potential \npetroleum resources are not wasted but are protected \nfor the benefit of all our citizens with an oil revenue \nmanagement law that was passed unanimously in our \nparliament in 2004. \n We cannot let the past bury the future. We can lift \nbillions out of poverty. When I was first elected \nPresident of my country five years ago, I lit a candle of \nhope for the long-suffering people of Sao Tome and \nPrincipe. We are not there yet, but the light is getting \nbrighter. \n If development were easy, everyone would \nalready be developed! We cannot sit in supine \nindifference. Let us renew our efforts and work \ntogether with respect, dignity and dedication for the \nbenefit of all the peoples of the world and for the fate \nof our beautiful planet. "

        "file_text": "I am taking \npart personally in this session of the General Assembly \nin order to reiterate Benin\u2019s commitment to the noble \npurposes and principles of the United Nations, and to \nexpress the readiness of the Beninese delegation to \ncooperate and contribute, as best it can, to the success \nof these deliberations.  \n But first, allow me, to once again warmly \ncongratulate Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her \nunanimous election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-first session, and to express our \nappreciation for the remarkable way in which she \nguided the work of the High-level Meeting on the \nmidterm comprehensive global review of the \nimplementation of the Programme of Action for the \nLeast Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010.  \n I also wish to pay tribute to the remarkable \nefforts of her predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Jan \nEliasson, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom \nof Sweden, who had the weighty task of leading the \nsixtieth session of the General Assembly, which was \nfocused, essentially, on the implementation of the \nmajor decisions taken at the 2005 World Summit.  \n Allow me to pay a resounding tribute to my \nfriend Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who over the \npast 10 years has wisely and skilfully led our \nOrganization at a time of new challenges and threats \ncreated by changes unprecedented in the history of \nhumanity.  \n My country, Benin, believes that the future \nSecretary-General should come from the continent of \nAsia. We hope that the new Secretary-General will be \nable to take the measures necessary to lead the \nOrganization towards the achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs).  \n I am pleased to note that the Assembly is already \nprogressing in the preparation of this great endeavour: \nthe promotion of development is the key issue for the \ngeneral debate at the sixty-first session, focusing in \naccordance with Ms. Al-Khalifa\u2019s proposal, on the \nestablishment of a global partnership for development. \nMy country, the Republic of Benin, joins in this debate \nwith the conviction that we will make significant \nprogress in finding pragmatic ways of fulfilling the \ncommitments that have been adopted on many \noccasions, for the promotion of economic and social \ndevelopment throughout the world.  \n The question of development is at the heart of the \nmission of the United Nations. In the Charter, Members \nproclaimed their belief in the equal rights of men and \nwomen and of nations large and small. They made the \ncommitment to use international institutions in order to \nencourage economic and social progress for all people.  \n Hence, reform of the United Nations, if it is to be \nviable and effective, must also help ensure that our \nOrganization can do better as a framework and an \ninstrument for development through the promotion of \nthe well-being of the poorest of our planet, ensuring \nthe economic growth of the most vulnerable members \nof the community of nations, in particular the least \ndeveloped countries.  \n Financing for development is a factor on which \ngenuine partnership needs to be built between donor \ncountries and developing countries. In this context, the \nMonterrey Consensus, as members know, continues to \nbe relevant. It is good to note that some donor \ncountries have achieved the objective of allocating \n0.7 per cent of their gross national income to official \ndevelopment assistance (ODA) for developing \ncountries, with 0.2 per cent earmarked for least \ndeveloped countries. It is also important to encourage \nthose who have already established a specific timetable \nfor achieving those objectives. Given the inadequacy \nof official development assistance, it is important to \nexamine new sources of financing for development \nactivities, and some are already doing so. I would like \nto take this opportunity to welcome the proposals that \nhave been made by some countries, such as the French \nRepublic and President Jacques Chirac. \n Identifying new sources of financing thus \ndeserves special attention. We are pleased that \nmobilizing the remittances of migrant workers can in \nsome respects also contribute to development action. \nNonetheless, it is important to facilitate those transfers \nso that they can effectively contribute to improving the \nliving conditions of the beneficiary populations and \ntheir impact on poverty reduction can be maximized. \nBut it should be stressed that the resources that come \nfrom remittances by migrant workers cannot be \n  \n \n06-52885 14 \n \nconsidered part of ODA and should not be included in \nODA calculations. \n We must also mobilize resources through \nmicrocredits for the poorest sectors. The support of the \ninternational community should contribute to \nstrengthening microcredit systems, which could be \nextremely useful in the context of efforts to counteract \nunemployment among young people and to promote \nthe empowerment of women in order to improve their \nliving conditions and enhance their contribution to the \nnational income of the countries concerned. \n We must ensure the full insertion of developing \ncountries, particularly the least advanced, into \ninternational trade so that they can be sure that, \nthrough that mechanism appropriate resources for \nfinancing their development are mobilized. Here we \nexpress our disappointment at the failure of the \nmultilateral trade negotiations in the framework of the \nDoha Round. Among other reasons, they floundered \nbecause of the crucial question of agricultural \nsubsidies, which are stifling the producers in \ndeveloping countries. My country, Benin, will continue \nto work with other affected countries to ensure the \nabolition of those subsidies. or at least to get \ncompensations equal to the harm we suffer. \n In order to promote development, our countries \nare seeking to implement democratic reforms. \nHowever, as I said at the opening session of the \nmeeting of the least developed countries, any \ndemocracy that does not go hand in hand with \ndevelopment is doomed to fail. Also, our efforts to \npromote development will not bear fruit if we do not \nsucceed in maintaining peace in our own countries and \nthroughout the world. \n That is why in 2005 Benin, while it was on the \nSecurity Council, sought to contribute to the efforts to \nenhance the effectiveness of that body in preventing \narmed conflicts. We welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s \nprompt action through the inspired and wise \nrecommendations he recently submitted on questions \nrelated to the prevention of conflicts. Resolving \nvarious conflicts enables the affected developing \ncountries to resolutely get themselves back on the track \nof reconstruction and national development. \n From this rostrum, my country pays tribute to the \ndecisive action being taken by the United Nations in \nthe area of peacekeeping, and we repeat that we are \nwilling to contribute actively to it. The Government of \nBenin is ready to continue participating in \npeacekeeping operations in order to allow peoples \naffected by armed conflicts to overcome them and to \ncreate the conditions for stability that are necessary to \nensure the reconstruction of their countries and their \neconomic and social development. \n For us in Benin, another word for peace is \ndevelopment. This is the message that I wished to \nbring, on behalf of the people of Benin and of the least \ndeveloped countries, during this general debate. "

        "file_text": "At the outset permit \nme to congratulate you, Madam President, on your \nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-first session, and to express Saint Lucia\u2019s \nappreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson of \nSweden, for the excellent manner in which he \nspearheaded the work of the sixtieth session. We wish \nalso to express our profound respect and gratitude to \nSecretary-General Kofi Annan for his great vision, \ncommitted leadership and tireless efforts in promoting \nthe noble ideals and values of our United Nations \nunder the most difficult circumstances. We wish him \nand his family well in their future endeavours. \n When in September 2000 we took the \nunprecedented step of pledging to meet eight \nMillennium Development Goals by 2015, it \nrepresented a belated admission that the development \nof every nation is a collective responsibility. \n At that Summit we recognized that it was an \naffront to our basic humanity that so many people on \nour planet continued to live in conditions of abject \npoverty and deprivation; that so many continued to \nsuffer the ravages of disease and war; and that basic \nnecessities of life, taken for granted by most of us, \nremained unattainable by so many. We also recognized \nthat unless we developed appropriate partnerships to \ndeal with these problems they would persist, to our \ncollective shame.  \n At this, our sixty-first session, we reaffirm our \ncommitment to this notion of partnership as a \nsignificant modality for the attainment of our common \ngoals. Saint Lucia is satisfied that the idea of \npartnership accommodates the spirit of multilateralism, \nwhich is the defining principle of our relationship \nwithin the United Nations. This multilateralist spirit \nmust constantly be safeguarded and fortified, and that \ncan only be accomplished by a strong and confident \nUnited Nations.  \n Saint Lucia takes this opportunity to once again \nexpress its determined support for the programmes of \nreform of the United Nations, designed as these are to \ncreate the capacity and conditions for the exercise of a \nstrong central role by the United Nations within the \ninternational community. We salute the achievements \nto date, namely, the replacement of the moribund \nHuman Rights Commission with the new Human \nRights Council and the establishment of the \nPeacebuilding Commission. We recognize that these \nbodies are far from perfect and will require continued \nattention by Member States. However, they reflect our \ndetermination to translate talk into action. Saint Lucia \nlooks forward to continuing the discussions on the \nremaining items on our reform agenda \u2014 in particular, \nSecurity Council reform, strengthening and refocusing \n  \n \n06-53609 12 \n \nthe General Assembly, the empowerment of the \nEconomic and Social Council and management reform. \n Saint Lucia continues to believe in the wisdom of \nthe words of our Secretary-General, who, in his March \n2005 report \u201cIn Larger Freedom\u201d, opined: \n \u201cwe will not enjoy development without security, \nwe will not enjoy security without development, \nand we will not enjoy either without respect for \nhuman rights. Unless all these causes are \nadvanced, none will succeed.\u201d (A/59/2005, \npara. 17)  \n As we seek to develop partnerships for \ndevelopment, utilizing the Millennium Development \nGoals as the benchmark, Saint Lucia has been moving \nsteadily towards the attainment of some of the goals. \nUniversal primary education has been largely attained, \nand we have gone further to introduce a programme of \nuniversal access to free secondary education for our \nyoung citizens. Saint Lucia is in the process of \nestablishing a universal programme of free health care, \nand it has made significant progress in the area of \nmaternal and child health. We are also working \nsteadfastly in the battle against HIV/AIDS through \neducation, early detection and treatment programmes, \nand also through the provision of free or subsidized \nantiretroviral drugs. \n All these efforts have been bolstered in a \npractical demonstration of South-South cooperation \nthrough generous support and assistance from a \nnumber of developing countries in the areas of human \nresource development in the health sector and the \nconstruction of new health facilities. South-South \npartnerships are workable. We need to continue to \ndevelop and widen them for the betterment of \ndeveloping countries. \n Saint Lucia applauds the return of Haiti to \ndemocratic governance. This long-awaited \ndevelopment has led to the readmission of that country \nto the councils of the Caribbean Community. We \nrecognize that the road to normalcy in Haiti will be a \nlong and tortuous one, requiring a sustained political \nfocus by the international community. Saint Lucia calls \nfor the speedy release of development resources \npromised to that country in order that its Government \nand people may tackle in a meaningful way the \nnumerous obstacles standing in its development path. \n Saint Lucia also welcomes the Final Document of \nthe Fourteenth Summit Conference of Heads of State \nor Government of the Non-Aligned Movement, held in \nHavana. This historic meeting addressed a wide range \nof regional and international issues, including the \nsanctity of international law, the promotion and \npreservation of multilateralism, the peaceful settlement \nof disputes, the right to self-determination and \ndecolonization. The Final Document provides the \ninternational community with a workable road map for \nthe development agenda far into this new century, with \nachievable solutions to many of the issues facing us \ntoday. \n Saint Lucia notes and welcomes the report of the \nSecretary-General on the follow-up to and \nimplementation of the outcome of the 2005 \nInternational Conference on Financing for \nDevelopment (A/61/253). We call upon the developed \ncountries represented at that forum to honour the \ncommitments made there and at previous United \nNations summits and conferences on trade, debt and \nfinance, especially their promise to fulfil the goal of \n0.7 per cent of gross domestic product going to official \ndevelopment assistance. We believe it is imperative \nthat the international community increase its efforts to \naddress the indebtedness of poor developing countries. \nIt is also important that these countries address the \nsystemic deficiencies in the global economic and \nfinancial system. These deficiencies all constitute \nserious threats to the survival of developing countries \nlike Saint Lucia. \n Small island developing States, such as those in \nthe Caribbean, the Pacific and Indian oceans and the \nMediterranean, are extremely vulnerable to the impact \nof climate change. We have already reached a \ndangerous level of greenhouse gas concentrations in \nthe atmosphere, and urgent action is required to reverse \nthis situation.  \n In this connection, the international community, \nin particular our developed partners, needs to take \nmore aggressive action to promote the development \nand distribution of renewable energy and energy \nefficiency technologies in developed and developing \ncountries alike. To assist developing countries to play \ntheir part in this connection there is a need to establish \na global renewable energy and energy efficiency fund. \nSaint Lucia joins with its colleague members of the \nAlliance of Small Island States, and with other affected \nStates, in calling for the international community to \n \n \n13 06-53609 \n \naddress the issues of sea-level rise and climate change \nas a matter of urgency. \n The international community must honour its \nresponsibility for, and commitment to, the full \nimplementation of the Mauritius Strategy for the \nFurther Implementation of the Programme of Action \nfor the Sustainable Development of Small Island \nDeveloping States. We insist on the urgent and proper \nmainstreaming of the Strategy into the respective work \nprogrammes of the United Nations agencies and other \nbodies. Those who are the largest producers of \ngreenhouse gases must bear responsibility for the \ndamage they are causing to the global environment. \nFrom our own regional perspective, Saint Lucia \nwelcomes the adoption of measures for the promotion \nof an integrated management approach to the \nCaribbean Sea area in the context of sustainable \ndevelopment. We welcome initiatives taken to this end \nby the Association of Caribbean States and the \nCaribbean Community. \n Half a decade into the twenty-first century there \nare still some 16 Non-Self-Governing Territories under \nthe review of the General Assembly. Most are small \nisland territories in the Caribbean and Pacific regions. \nTheir decolonization through a genuine process of self-\ndetermination is the unfinished agenda of the United \nNations. In this connection, Article 73b of the Charter, \non the necessity of promoting genuine self-\ngovernment, should be respected. We call on the \nadministering Powers to increase their level of \ncooperation with the Special Committee on \nDecolonization, and call on the relevant bodies of the \nUnited Nations system to assist the Non-Self-\nGoverning Territories in the development of their \ncapacity for self-government and in furtherance of their \nprocess of self-determination. \n The year 2007 will mark the 200th anniversary of \nthe abolition of the transatlantic slave trade, which \nbegan the process of the abolition of slavery in the \nBritish Empire. A number of international events are \nplanned throughout the globe to honour the memory of \nthe millions who died during the middle passage, and \nthose who subsequently perished under the horrors of \nchattel slavery in the Caribbean and the Americas. \nSaint Lucia joins with the countries of the African \ndiaspora in the Caribbean, and with other like-minded \ncountries, in supporting a United Nations \ncommemoration in 2007 of the abolition of the \ntransatlantic slave trade. \n I could not end without referring to the serious \nimpact of the rulings of the World Trade Organization \n(WTO) in respect of banana exports to our preferential \nmarkets in Europe. Few in the developed world can \nappreciate the mass social dislocation that this decision \nhas caused, with thousands of independent farmers, \nemployers in their own right, left without a livelihood \nthrough no fault of their own.  \n Consider that for every banana farmer in Saint \nLucia who has lost his or her livelihood at least six \npersons have also been excised from direct \nparticipation in the economic system. The WTO has \nbecome synonymous with pain and suffering for \nfarmers in Saint Lucia. In many instances the \nimplementation of some of the obligations has created \nmore hardship and poverty than previously existed. \nAccordingly, while economic and trade policy reform \nin principle holds much promise for small developing \ncountries, the international community must come to \ngrips with the fact that the one-size-fits-all approach is \ninappropriate and impractical. In this connection, a set \nof trading rules flexible enough to take into account the \nconcerns of small States must be enacted. The principle \nof special and differential treatment must infuse all \naspects of the new trade rules that we seek to create. \n There is much unfinished business ahead of us. It \nis our expectation that the members of the Assembly \nwill focus even more intently on the development of \nappropriate strategies for its resolution. We are \nconfident that under your guidance and leadership, \nMadam President, the development agenda of the \nOrganization will be advanced further. For its part, \nSaint Lucia remains committed to the ideals of \nmultilateralism, and reaffirms its view that the United \nNations offers the best opportunity for the achievement \nof peace, security and sustainable development for all."

        "file_text": "I take this opportunity, \nMadam President, to warmly congratulate you on your \nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-first session. My delegation welcomes your \nleadership and assures you of our unwavering support \nas you carry out your duties. We are confident that \nunder your able leadership the reform programmes of \nthe United Nations will be advanced. \n I also take this opportunity to thank your \npredecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, for the leadership he \nprovided in steering the affairs of the sixtieth session. \nMy delegation noted with satisfaction the service he \nrendered, and also noted that under his presidency \npositive advances were made towards the reform of the \nUnited Nations. \n Malawi welcomes the admission of the Republic \nof Montenegro as the 192nd Member of the United \nNations. Malawi wishes President Filip Vujanovic and \nthe people of the Republic of Montenegro continued \npeace and prosperity as they chart the way forward and \ntake their place in the United Nations. \n At the end of this year we bid farewell to \nMr. Kofi Annan, who has served as Secretary-General \nfor two consecutive terms. I am happy to join previous \nspeakers in paying tribute to Mr. Annan for the \ndynamic leadership he has provided to the United \nNations during his tenure of office. \n Mr. Annan had many achievements, but perhaps \none of the greatest was his ability to remain calm and \nwell focused under great pressure. During his tenure of \noffice the United Nations faced daunting challenges, \nincluding the fight against famine, hunger and natural \ndisasters in many parts of the world; civil wars in \nAfrica and conflicts in the Middle East and the Gulf \nregion; international terrorism; and the fight against \nHIV/AIDS. It is therefore with great pleasure that, on \nbehalf of the people of Malawi, and on my own behalf, \nI honour and pay tribute to Mr. Kofi Annan for his \nsterling service to the United Nations. I trust that he \n  \n \n06-52988 2 \n \nwill continue to be of service to humanity in other \ncapacities. \n The theme of this year\u2019s session, \u201cImplementing \na global partnership for development,\u201d is very \npertinent, because during the 2005 session we renewed \nthe mandate of the United Nations to meet the \nchallenges of the millennium, such as eradicating \nglobal poverty and injustice, and the promotion of \ndemocracy, human rights, peace, security and stability \nin Member nations. We asserted that these are essential \ningredients for sustainable economic and social \ndevelopment and that they are interlinked and mutually \nreinforcing in the quest for the betterment and well-\nbeing of humanity as a whole. \n I believe that in the search for global partnership \nfor development the greatest challenge that the United \nNations faces is to eradicate the poverty that engulfs \nthe majority of humanity. \n I believe that global peace, security and stability \ncannot be assured if the greater section of humanity \nlives in abject poverty. It is our hope that those who \nhave will learn to share with those who do not have. \n In order to present to the Assembly the need for a \nglobal partnership framework as a way to achieve a \nfaster and sustainable rate of economic growth, let me \nuse my own country as an example. In Malawi we have \ndetermined priorities to fast track socio-economic \ngrowth for the people. We are cognizant that in a poor \nnation like ours everything becomes a priority, but we \nhave agreed on a set of \u201cpriorities within priorities\u201d \nthat we want to implement in the next five years. These \nare agriculture and food security, irrigation and water \ndevelopment, transport and communications \ninfrastructure, energy, integrated rural development \nand the prevention and management of HIV/AIDS. We \nbelieve that, when fully implemented, these sectors \nwill, together, pull our people out of poverty. \n We have given the highest priority to agriculture \nand food security because this sector is a mainstay of \nour economy and we intend to make Malawi a hunger-\nfree nation. We are assisting smallholder and peasant \nfarmers to increase their productivity in food and cash \ncrops by providing cheap fertilizers and high-quality \nfarm inputs. This will provide food security as well as \nexpand agro-processing industries, and it will mean \nadding value to our products. We seek international \nsupport in this area. \n Secondly, we need international partnership in \nirrigation and water development. This would reduce \nour country\u2019s dependence on rain-fed agriculture. We \naim at having small-, medium- and large-scale \nirrigation schemes and the construction of multi-\npurpose dams throughout the country. This will enable \nMalawi to produce enough food even when rains fail. \n Thirdly, we consider transport and \ncommunications infrastructure to be essential for \ngrowth and development and, indeed, a good candidate \nfor international partnership. We are convinced that \nthrough well developed road networks we will not only \nimprove movement of goods and services from rural \nareas to the urban centres, but also enhance domestic \nand international trade. \n More importantly, Malawi seeks global \npartnership in opening up access to the Indian Ocean \nthrough the existing Shire-Zambezi waterway, which is \nnavigable all the way from an inland port in Malawi to \nthe port of Chinde, in Mozambique, on the Indian \nOcean, only 238 kilometres away. This waterway \nwould benefit Malawi and other southern African \ncountries, especially Mozambique, Zambia, Rwanda, \nBurundi and Zimbabwe. \n Fourthly, Malawi has selected energy as another \narea of international partnership. We believe that it is \nimperative for our country to develop adequate and \nreliable energy for agriculture, irrigation, transport, \nindustry and all other areas of economic \ntransformation. \n Fifthly, Malawi would welcome international \npartnership in promoting integrated rural development \naimed at eradicating poverty among the rural \ncommunities. We have recognized that the economic \nstratification of our country is such that the greater \npercentage of the people live in rural areas in squalid \nconditions. We seek donor support to boldly take \ndevelopment to rural areas through promoting rural \ngrowth centres. \n Lastly, Malawi seeks international partnership in \nHIV/AIDS prevention and management. We recognize \nthat our country on its own, without the full support of \nthe international community, cannot successfully wage \nthe battle against HIV/AIDS. I am happy to say that \nduring the past two years Malawi has made tremendous \nprogress in AIDS awareness campaigns, the supply of \nanti-retroviral drugs and voluntary testing. \n \n \n3 06-52988 \n \n This is Malawi\u2019s agenda for implementing a \nglobal partnership for development. I am submitting \nthis agenda to the United Nations for support. \n Before I end my statement, I need to mention two \nimportant issues. \n First, through a global partnership, Malawi has \nreached the completion point of the Heavily Indebted \nPoor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. I and the people of \nMalawi are truly grateful that our multilateral debts \nhave been cancelled by the International Monetary \nFund and the World Bank. We thank the [G-8 countries \nfor spearheading the Initiative and for their \ncommitment to it. We believe that this is a true \nexample of global partnership in development. \n The second issue that is germane to global \npartnership is for me to reiterate my plea for the \nreadmission of the Republic of China \u2013 Taiwan \u2014 as a \nMember of the United Nations. Many of those present \nwill agree that since the end of the cold war, and with \nthe advent of globalization, Taiwan has quietly \ncontributed to the work of the United Nations and its \nspecialized agencies in various areas, including \ntechnology, medicine, research, industry and \ninternational trade. That contribution becomes \nincreasingly important, especially within the principle \nof universality, equity and justice. \n Let me conclude by drawing attention to the \nreport entitled \u201cIn larger freedom: towards \ndevelopment, security and human rights for all\u201d, by \nMr. Kofi Annan, who stated: \n \u201cThe right to choose how they are ruled, and who \nrules them, must be the birthright of all people, \nand its universal achievement must be a central \nobjective of an Organization devoted to the cause \nof larger freedom.\u201d (A/59/2005, para. 148) \n To me, such larger freedom means the freedom of \nevery nation to belong to the United Nations, the \nfreedom from oppression of one nation by another, and \nfreedom for every nation to contribute to the global \npartnership for development. These are the freedoms of \nthe United Nations that should be cherished and \nupheld. \n I therefore appeal to the Security Council to \nreconsider the fact that Taiwan should be granted \nobserver status in the United Nations and its \nspecialized agencies, pending a full review of its \nmembership. I am convinced that continued denial of \nTaiwan\u2019s participation in the community of nations \nposes a moral and legal challenge to the United \nNations. "

Let me assure \nher of Grenada\u2019s support as she guides these important \ndeliberations towards the implementation of a global \npartnership for development. \n My delegation would also like to pay tribute to \nMr. Jan Eliasson, Foreign Minister of Sweden, who \nlaboured tirelessly during his presidency of the sixtieth \nsession, and for his efforts in guiding the follow-up \nprocess to the Summit Outcome. \n My delegation welcomes the Secretary-General\u2019s \ntenth and final report, which gives a comprehensive \nreview of the Organization\u2019s achievements, challenges \nand preparation for the future. It is fitting at this \njuncture to convey to the Secretary-General the \nappreciation of the Government and people of Grenada \nfor his sterling contribution to world peace and security \nduring his tenure at the helm of this Organization. The \nroad was not always smooth, but with his calm \ndisposition, unmistakable eloquence and astute and \ndedicated leadership, the Organization was able to \novercome the rough patches. We heartily commend his \nefforts to strengthen the United Nations through the \nreform process, and wish him well in his future \nendeavours. \n We meet in very difficult times. The effects of \nrapid technological changes, new geopolitical and \neconomic alliances, evolving rules in international \ntrade, and in particular security concerns, continue to \ngrip ordinary citizens in our small countries and \nregions, worsening the notion of an uncertain future. \n My delegation believes that this year\u2019s theme of \nimplementing a global partnership for development is \ntimely and one which, if we work together, will \nenhance our economies in all of their aspects. \n It is for that reason that, within our region, we \nhave taken the necessary steps in response to the \nchallenges we face by deepening our integration \narrangements with the creation of the Caribbean \nCommunity Single Market and Economy. Recognizing \nthe changing trends related to the movement of skills, \nGrenada has placed great emphasis on the economic \n  \n \n06-53615 12 \n \nempowerment of its young people, as well as on the \ncreation of a more diverse and non-traditional job \nsector. Having lost much of our traditional agriculture \nthrough natural disasters and the changing global \nenvironment, we have been forced to create \nalternatives through global partnerships. \n Since the adoption of the Millennium \nDeclaration, we have encountered untold challenges in \nattempting to achieve the prescribed goals. As this \nbody is well aware, Grenada, as one of the small States \nwhich hold membership in this Organization, has on \nmany occasions relied not only on our immediate \nregional partners, but also on the wider membership \nand respective United Nations agencies during some \nvery difficult and trying times. Our most recent past is \nnot yet overcome, since we are still rebuilding our \nshattered economy following the devastation of two \nhurricanes in 2004 and 2005.  \n However, despite those challenges, we pledge to \ncontinue to work towards the achievement of some of \nthe Millennium Development Goals. We have made \nsignificant strides in our efforts to contain the spread of \nHIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases. along with \nimprovements in education, poverty eradication and \nenvironmental sustainability. \n Grenada has over the years worked closely and \nsuccessfully with the United Nations agencies in our \nregion. Therefore, we are hopeful that, during this \nsession, no effort will be spared to ensure the \nsustainability of those agencies. \n My delegation has on numerous occasions made \nreference to the unfortunate reality that special and \ndifferential treatment for small and vulnerable \neconomies is fast becoming a thing of the past. We \nhave seen decreases in financial and technical support \nfrom traditional partners, and a reduction in the market \nfor trade in goods and services. \n In that vein, the suspension of the Doha Round of \nmultilateral trade negotiations in July 2006 was a \nmajor setback for my country. International trade and \nreduction in poverty are inextricably linked to \ndevelopment. Greater market access for products from \ndeveloping countries can lead to economic growth and \nhigher standards of living. Grenada therefore looks \nforward to the resumption of those negotiations. \n In the past few months, the United Nations has \nbeen encumbered with the task of maintaining peace \nand security in many parts of the world. My delegation \ncommends the efforts made in that respect and \nwelcomes the creation of the Peacebuilding \nCommission, which will assist States in the post-\nconflict era. We extend condolences to the families of \nthose brave men and women who lost their lives in the \nservice of the organization. Grenada is proud to be a \npolice-contributing country with the United Nations \nStabilization Mission in Haiti and looks forward to \ncontinuing its involvement in that area. \n My delegation is well aware that this \nOrganization will have to increase its efforts in \ncombating terrorism, and welcomes the recently agreed \nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy as a positive step in \nthat regard. \n Grenada makes it clear that it uncompromisingly \ncondemns terrorism and all acts of violence, and \npledges its full cooperation in combating that \nphenomenon. Though my delegation is supportive of \nthose measures, as a small island developing State we \nare faced with serious financial and technical \nconstraints in maintaining continued peace and security \nwithin our region. The measures we have implemented \nin that respect will be tested as we host the 2007 \nCricket World Cup in the Caribbean. \n My delegation, in applauding the creation of the \nHuman Rights Council, is hopeful that the new body \nwill be able through its work to ensure that democracy \nand good governance are observed in all their aspects. \nWe fully support the Secretary- General\u2019s sentiments \nthat mainstreaming all human rights, including the \nright to development, is necessary, and support to \nMember States in their efforts to build stronger \nnational systems for the promotion and protection of \nhuman rights is of extreme importance. \n Grenada was indeed honoured to participate at \nthe highest level in the launching of the new Central \nEmergency Response Fund earlier this year and to lend \nits support to the growth of the Fund. We commend the \nwork of the Organization in that regard and are well \naware of the importance of maintaining and supporting \nthe Fund, especially since, globally, there has been an \nincrease in natural and humanitarian disasters. We are \npleased with the decision to expand the relationship \noutside of the membership to include the private, \nindividual and non-governmental sectors. \n We call on the international community to honour \nits responsibility and commitment to the full \n \n \n13 06-53615 \n \nimplementation of the Mauritius Strategy and to \nsupport programmes in our region related to early \nwarning systems, the Catastrophe Risk Insurance \nFacility, and vulnerability reduction, while at the same \ntime building resilience. \n My delegation has taken note of the resolution on \ndevelopment. However, we are disappointed that this \naspect of the Summit Outcome has not progressed with \nthe kind of vigour we would have welcomed. That is of \nspecial importance to countries like my own, since \nsupport for development objectives is paramount to our \neconomic sustainability. We cannot fail to reiterate our \nvulnerability and call for swift action at this session in \norder to ensure the stability of our small societies. \n My delegation salutes the Secretary-General\u2019s \nefforts to strengthen the Organization through its \nengagement with civil society and other non-State \nactors, and agrees that they are important to the \nlegitimacy of democratic ideals.  Grenada has \nincreased its efforts to strengthen the relationship \nbetween Government and the private sector through \npartnerships in trade, education, health, tourism and \ninvestment activities, and has already seen positive \nresults from this type of engagement, especially in the \naftermath of the recent hurricanes. \n 2007 will mark the bicentenary of the passage of \nthe act abolishing the trans-Atlantic slave trade in the \nBritish empire, and it is anticipated that the General \nAssembly will hold a commemorative event to mark \nthat historic occasion. The members of the Caribbean \nCommunity will submit a draft resolution to the \nGeneral Assembly, and we expect the full support of all \nMember States in that regard. \n We, along with other members of the Caribbean \nCommunity, feel compelled on a regular basis to make \nthe plea for special attention to be paid to the threat \nfacing the Caribbean Sea. Grenada therefore takes this \nopportunity to reiterate its concerns over the \ntransshipment of nuclear waste and other hazardous \nmaterial through the marine environment of the \nCaribbean. The Caribbean Sea provides for us a \nlifeline, the potential loss of which could be enormous \nto our people\u2019s livelihood. As we are well aware, loss \nof economic opportunities brings with it poverty and \nsocial unrest and ultimately threatens democracy \u2014 a \nsolid tradition on which the Caribbean Community \ncontinues to pride itself. We therefore urge \nunderstanding and solidarity with our cause. \n My delegation applauds the Organization for its \nwork in the areas of reform and looks forward to the \ncontinuation of that process, especially in the areas of \ndevelopment, Economic and Social Council reform, \nSecretariat and management reform, Security Council \nreform, system-wide coherence, disarmament and non-\nproliferation, and other areas that have received only \npartial attention. Let us pursue with vigour our work in \nensuring that this body finds ways not only to sustain, \nbut to continue to build on the successes of its past \nachievements. \n The many challenges that we all now face make it \nnecessary that we work together to make the planet a \nbetter place for future generations. Let us, then, \ncommit ourselves to cooperating with and supporting \neach other in the journey towards genuine \ndevelopment. \n Finally, my delegation, having listened to the \ndebate over the past few days, is heartened by the \npledges of support and is convinced that, together, we \ncan make it work to our collective benefit. Grenada is \npleased to join in that pledge and looks forward to \nworking with the Organization and its partners in \nattaining that goal. "

        "file_text": "At the outset, Madam, I would \nlike to congratulate you warmly on your election as \nPresident of the General Assembly at this session and \nto assure you of my delegation\u2019s full cooperation in \ndischarging the responsibilities entrusted to you. I am \nfully confident that we will be able to bring the \nbusiness of this session to a successful conclusion \nunder your leadership. \n His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson, the outgoing \nPresident, deserves our sincere appreciation for a job \nwell done. \n I join previous speakers in heartily welcoming the \nRepublic of Montenegro as a fellow Member of this \nworld body. The continued expansion of the \nmembership underlines the importance of the United \nNations as an Organization of truly global character, \ncentrality and indispensability in global affairs. \n This is, indeed, a great opportunity for me to \nrepresent the voice of the democratic Government and \nthe sovereign people of Nepal in this Assembly. I have \nbrought with me greetings and best wishes from the \nGovernment and the people of Nepal for the success of \nthis session. \n I wish to inform the Assembly that Nepal is \nundergoing a fundamental transformation following the \nrestoration of democracy through the peaceful people\u2019s \nmovement in April 2006. The people of Nepal has \nbecome, for the first time in history, the real source of \nsovereignty and State authority. The historic \nparliamentary proclamation of 18 May 2006, and the \nsubsequent decisions of the parliament, have made real \ncontributions to safeguarding and consolidating the \n \n \n5 06-53329 \n \ngains of the people\u2019s movement. We are currently \nengaged in institutionalizing an edifice of a democratic \nand inclusive Nepali State through the reinstated \nparliament. \n The people and the Government of Nepal are \nthankful to the international community for its strong \nsupport during our struggle for democracy. We are \nhopeful of even greater support and solidarity in our \ntransition towards full-fledged democracy and lasting \npeace. \n This momentous change in Nepal has also led to \nthe conversion of a protracted conflict into a peace \nprocess, and we are confident that it will be brought to \na successful conclusion. I take this opportunity to \nsincerely express my appreciation to the Secretary-\nGeneral for his assistance to the peace process, \nincluding in the monitoring of human rights, assistance \nin ceasefire monitoring, arms management and the \nobservation of elections to the Constituent Assembly, \nat our request. The successful resolution of our internal \nconflict will set a worthwhile example to the rest of the \nworld that democracy is indispensable and brightens \nthe prospects for resolution of conflicts of all kinds. \n Now, we have pressing post-conflict \nreintegration, rehabilitation and reconstruction needs. \nMeeting these challenges requires an enhanced level of \ninternational support and assistance. Peace, security, \nstability, democracy and development constitute global \npublic goods. It is critically important that newly \nemerged democracies are safeguarded and protected, \nthus allowing them to develop further and flourish. \nWith this vision in mind, we strongly support the \nnewly established United Nations Democracy Fund. \n The United Nations today is confronted with \nnumerous challenges, such as international terrorism \nand transnational crime, the threat of use of weapons of \nmass destruction, narcotic drugs and human trafficking, \nmoney-laundering and other financial crimes, regional \nconflicts and low-intensity wars, extreme poverty and \nhunger, human rights abuses, successive natural \ndisasters and the threats posed by pandemics such as \nHIV/AIDS and avian flu. \n These challenges call for new wisdom founded on \nthe principles of collective security, well-being and \nprosperity. The United Nations is uniquely placed to \nmuster the much-needed philosophical underpinning \nbecause of its standing as a global body armed with \nlegitimacy. New wisdom alone will not be enough to \ndeal with these problems if new strategies, new tools \nand new resources do not match it. Nepal firmly \nbelieves that multilateral solutions are required to \naddress problems and challenges of a global nature. \nMultilateralism is the key to promoting global \nparticipation in problem-solving and to ensuring \ncollective ownership of outcomes. \n Today, old and new threats to peace and security \nexist side by side. While military threats to security are \ndiminishing gradually, new sources of threat have \nemerged and are likely to disturb international peace \nand security in more than one way. \n The growing menace of international terrorism \ncharacterizes the security scenario in our post-cold-war \nworld. It has been the consistent policy of Nepal to \nunequivocally condemn terrorism in all its forms and \nmanifestations. It is disheartening to note that no \ninternational consensus has yet emerged paving the \nway for the early conclusion of a comprehensive \ninternational convention against terrorism. In this \ncontext, we welcome the adoption of the United \nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution \n60/288).  \n We are concerned about the dismal progress on \ndisarmament. After failing to agree on non-\nproliferation last year, we were unable to produce an \nagreement during the review of the regime to control \nsmall arms and light weapons. We are also constantly \nreminded of the deadlock in efforts to resolve nuclear \nissues by peaceful means. Nepal stands for general and \ncomplete disarmament of all weapons of mass \ndestruction, including biological, chemical, nuclear and \nradiological weapons, in a time-bound manner. The \ndemand of our time is that we compete for peace, not \nwar, and for development, not armaments. \n We have offered to host, in Kathmandu, the \nUnited Nations Regional Centre for Peace and \nDisarmament for Asia and the Pacific. Despite our \nlong-standing commitment and sincere efforts, the \nCentre has yet to be relocated. I wish to reiterate that \nthe Government of Nepal is ready to sign the host \ncountry agreement, pursuant to the Assembly \nresolution, as soon as the Secretariat provides it with a \ndraft. We urge the Secretariat to conclude the necessary \nprocedures for the relocation of the Centre to Nepal \nwithout further delay. \n The recent upsurge of violence in Lebanon has \nleft unbearable human tragedy in its wake and has \n  \n \n06-53329 6 \n \nresulted in the large-scale destruction of material \nproperty. We welcome the ongoing ceasefire and \nexpress our support for Security Council resolution \n1701 (2006) on strengthening the United Nations \nInterim Force in Lebanon. We are committed to \ncontributing a battalion of troops for the cause of peace \nthere. \n Nepal\u2019s profound interest and continued \nparticipation in United Nations peacekeeping missions \nunderscores its contribution to the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security. Even when it had its \nown internal conflict, Nepal never stopped sending \ntroops to United Nations peacekeeping missions. \nNepalese Blue Helmets have served in various \nmissions, including in many trouble spots, in an \nexemplary manner, earning international repute for \nthem and their country. Currently, Nepal has over \n3,500 troops in various United Nations missions. Many \nof them have sacrificed their precious lives in the \nservice of peace and humanity. Nepal will continue to \nuphold this noble cause and participate in future \nmissions when asked to do so. \n Nepal\u2019s commitment to human rights is total and \nunflinching. Nepal firmly believes that all human \nrights are universal, indivisible, interrelated, \ninterdependent and mutually reinforcing. We welcomed \nthe establishment of the Human Rights Council in the \nbelief that that body will prove effective in protecting \nand promoting human rights around the globe based on \nthe salient principles of universality, objectivity and \nnon-selectivity. \n The current Government of Nepal has accorded \ntop priority to the protection and promotion of human \nrights with a view to translating Nepal\u2019s international \nhuman rights commitments and obligations into reality. \nWe have been working closely with the United Nations \nhuman rights bodies, including the United Nations \nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in \nNepal, to create an environment in which full \nenjoyment of human rights by all is guaranteed. The \nreturn of democracy and the start of the peace process \nhave led to a significant improvement in the protection \nof human rights in Nepal. We greatly appreciate the \nrole played by the Office of the High Commissioner for \nHuman Rights in Nepal in improving the human rights \nsituation in the country. \n We are determined to bring to an end the culture \nof impunity which was so pervasive during the \nautocratic regime. Our belief is that no one is above the \nlaw and that those who violate and abuse human rights \nmust be brought to justice. We are fully committed to \nprotecting human rights in all situations and creating a \nframework to bring to justice those who have violated \nhuman rights in the past. \n Opportunities arising out of globalization, such as \nthose associated with global migration, have been \nstifled by unfriendly policy regimes around the world. \nThe rights of migrant workers must be protected in all \nsituations in accordance with international norms. \nNepal\u2019s experience shows that the benefit of \nremittances generated by migrant workers counts a \ngreat deal for developing countries. But that cannot in \nany way be a substitute for development assistance, \ndebt relief or trade concessions. \n The benefits of trade liberalization are not \ndistributed equitably. The multilateral trading regime \nmust be made responsive to the needs and requirements \nof the developing and least developed countries. \nEnhanced trading opportunities, coupled with \nproductive capacities, are critically important for the \nachievement of sustained economic growth and poverty \nreduction in the least developed countries (LDCs). The \nagreed commitments for duty-free and quota-free \naccess for the products of the least developed countries \nneed to be complemented with favourable rules on \norigin.  \n We are concerned about the suspension of World \nTrade Organization (WTO) talks on the development \nround, and urge the immediate revival of the talks to \ncomplete the Doha Development Agenda. \n Our development agenda has been advancing \nrather slowly. We realize that, given the current pace, \nmany countries will not be able to achieve the \ninternationally agreed development goals, including \nthe Millennium Development Goals. It reminds us that \nwe must urgently and sincerely implement all the \ncommitments agreed to in the various global compacts \nof recent years, including the Monterrey Consensus, \nthe Millennium Declaration, the Johannesburg Plan of \nImplementation and the Brussels Programme of Action \nfor the Least Developed Countries. \n This year\u2019s midterm review of the Programme of \nAction for the Least Developed Countries showed that \nmost of the least developed countries will not be able \nto achieve the agreed targets within the previously \n \n \n7 06-53329 \n \ndefined time frame unless we accelerate the pace of \nimplementation. \n The least developed countries need better policies \non aid, trade, investment, debt relief and \ncapacity-building, as well as timely reforms in the \ninternational financial institutions. We call on the \ninternational community to take a holistic approach, \ncombining policies to support the LDC development \nagenda. The least developed countries need a \nsubstantial flow of external aid and investment if they \nare to meet those goals. Investment in poorer countries \nis not just a moral responsibility; it is investment in the \ncollective security of the world. \n Many least developed countries are handicapped \nas a result of being landlocked, which significantly \nreduces their competitive edge in regional and \nmultilateral trading regimes. This state of affairs \ncontinues to frustrate their development efforts. We \nurge the international community to pay greater \nattention to the plight of those countries and to make \nserious efforts to implement internationally agreed \ncommitments. \n It is a scar on our conscience that hundreds of \nmillions of people are living as refugees in various \nparts of the globe. The international community must \ntake it as its bounden duty to address their concerns in \na non-selective manner. \n I regret to inform the Assembly that more than \n100,000 refugees from southern Bhutan have been in \ncamps in Nepal for over a decade and half \u2014 a painful \nexperience \u2014 despite the bilateral agreements reached \nbetween Nepal and Bhutan. With no early and lasting \nsolution on the horizon, the refugees are showing \nincreasing signs of frustration and desperation. In \nessence, this is a problem between the Government of \nBhutan and its citizens. Nepal has entered the picture \nsimply because it has provided shelter to fleeing \nrefuges on humanitarian grounds. The issue cannot be \nresolved in the absence of a genuine willingness on the \npart of the Government of Bhutan to solve this \nproblem.  \n The international community must exert a \npositive influence so as to break the impasse. We stress \nthat the Bhutanese refuges must be given the right to \nreturn to their home country in conditions of dignity \nand respect and that any solution must be acceptable to \nthem. Nepal also supports the democratic aspirations of \nthe people of Bhutan and urges Bhutan to \naccommodate the plight of the refugees in their \npolitical dispensation. \n Our Organization has made great strides, \nespecially in the adoption of the reform measures \nendorsed by world leaders here last year. The \nGovernment of Nepal remains committed to supporting \nall reform initiatives aimed at addressing the concerns \nand aspirations of all Member States. \n The strength of the United Nations lies in its \ndemocratic decision-making and in its impartiality, \nneutrality and efficiency. The General Assembly \u2014 the \nonly global body in which the voices of the peoples of \nthe world can be heard \u2014 must be placed at the \nforefront of all decision-making processes within the \nUnited Nations. The organs dealing with socio-\neconomic issues must be strengthened and enabled to \ntake a lead role in the fulfilment of international \ndevelopment objectives. \n Contemporary realities dictate that the United \nNations must undergo a fundamental transformation \nwithout undermining its founding principles and \nobjectives. Any reform of the United Nations will be \nincomplete without a commensurate reform of its \nprincipal organ responsible for the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security. The Security Council \nmust be democratized so as to provide it with greater \nlegitimacy and credibility. There is a genuine need to \nincrease Council membership, in both the permanent \nand non-permanent categories, so as to make the \nCouncil more representative. Such an increase should \ninclude two permanent seats each for the Asian and \nAfrican regions, one for Latin America and one for \nWestern Europe. We also need to improve the \nCouncil\u2019s working methods. \n This year, Member States will elect the next \nSecretary-General of our Organization. In accordance \nwith the principle of equitable geographical \nrepresentation and that of rotation, Nepal reiterates that \nthe next Secretary-General should come from Asia. We \nalso believe that a greater role should be played by the \nAssembly in the appointment of the Secretary-General. \nI commend the role played by the outgoing Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, during his term of office. He \nled important reforms at the United Nations and made \ngenuine efforts to establish the central role of our \nOrganization in resolving global problems and \ndebating international issues. \n  \n \n06-53329 8 \n \n Nepal has submitted its candidature for non-\npermanent membership of the Security Council for the \nperiod 2007-2008. We think that we rightly deserve it, \nas nearly two decades have elapsed since we last \nserved on the Council, in 1988-1989. This world body \nis fully aware that Nepal has for a long time been \nmaking substantial contributions to the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security by regularly providing \ntroops to various peacekeeping missions. Moreover, we \nbelieve that Nepal\u2019s election to the Council this time \naround would represent a significant recognition of its \ndemocratic credentials in a changed context. The \npeople of Nepal deserve due recognition from the \ninternational community for their unprecedented \ncourage and for the determination with which they \nhave defeated autocracy and restored democracy. I \nmake a sincere appeal to fellow Members to extend \ntheir valuable support to Nepal\u2019s candidature and allow \nit to serve on the Council with renewed confidence in \nthe fulfilment of its fundamental responsibilities. \n The purposes and principles of the United \nNations contained in its Charter, including the \nsovereign equality of nations, the peaceful resolution \nof all disputes, non-interference in the internal affairs \nof States, and the principle of refraining from the threat \nor use of force are sacrosanct to Nepal. I solemnly \nreiterate Nepal\u2019s profound commitment to the founding \nobjectives and principles of the United Nations, as \nenshrined in its Charter. \n The United Nations today suffers from a lack of \ncredibility, an inability to arrive at important decisions, \nweak implementation of its own declarations and \ndecisions, and slowness in responding to challenges \nthat require its most pressing attention. We need to \nchange this situation. Together, we can better equip our \nOrganization to respond to those challenges. "

        "file_text": "I should like, on behalf of my delegation, to \nsay how delighted we are to see you, Madam, the \nrepresentative of the Kingdom of Bahrain, a friendly \ncountry, presiding over the General Assembly at its \nsixty-first session. I would like to assure you of our \nsincere wishes for your success. You can rest assured \nthat my delegation will fully cooperate with you. \n I would also like to pay tribute to the Kingdom of \nSweden, a friendly country whose Minister for Foreign \nAffairs, Mr. Jan Eliasson, presided over the General \nAssembly at its sixtieth session in such an outstanding \nmanner. Major progress was made during that session. \n Finally, I should like to extend to Montenegro a \nwarm welcome to the family of the peoples of the \nUnited Nations. \n This session of the General Assembly is taking \nplace at a time when the world is once again facing \nmajor challenges. I am thinking in particular of the \nupsurge of terrorism, which threatens the security of \nStates and our collective security. I am also thinking of \nthe persistence of underdevelopment and the almost \nendemic poverty in the countries of the South. I am \nthinking, too, of pandemics of all kinds, including \nHIV/AIDS. Finally, I am thinking of cross-border \norganized crime. \n Our world and our Organization need more \ngenerosity, more solidarity, more ethical behaviour and \nmore tolerance, but also more courage and more \nimagination to tackle these challenges, which require a \nglobal approach in the multilateral context in which the \nUnited Nations is the forum par excellence. \n  \n \n06-53958 18 \n \n Opinions are being expressed in various quarters \ndeploring the inability of the Organization to respond \nadequately to the fundamental aspirations of the \nworld\u2019s people, while some also believe that the \nOrganization has become obsolete. Cameroon would \nlike to reaffirm that it believes that, despite the \ninevitable shortcomings inherent in an organization of \nsuch size, the United Nations is today, more than ever \nbefore, the only institution that can bring about \nconsensus in an effort to ease tension and find \nsolutions. Very simply put, there is no substitute for the \nUnited Nations in managing in a coherent manner the \nproblems to which I have referred. \n In that regard, I would like to pay special tribute \nto the work of Secretary-General Kofi Annan. I also \nwish to convey to him the gratitude of my country and \nmy personal regard and appreciation for his efforts. \nFollowing in the footsteps of his predecessors, he has \nreinvigorated multilateralism in an especially difficult \ninternational environment. Cameroon is proud to have \ncontributed to the election of this noble son of Africa \nfollowing its assumption of the chairmanship of the \nOrganization of Africa Unity. Today, while peace to \nmany seems to be but a myth, Africa is truly honoured \nthat Mr. Kofi Annan has taken his place among the \nworld\u2019s great peacemakers. In that regard, the Noble \nPeace Prize awarded to him was richly deserved. \n In an international environment characterized by \ndifficulties in ensuring that the rule of law prevails \nover the use of force, the Secretary-General was \ncourageously able to promote the voice of reason. In an \nenvironment of heated passions, he succeeded in \ndelivering a message of peace and brotherhood. Allow \nme, by way example in that regard, to refer to his \nunequivocal commitment to Cameroon and Nigeria \u2014 \ntwo brotherly countries linked by history and \ngeography \u2014 in the peaceful and consensual \nimplementation of the International Court of Justice \n(ICJ) ruling of 10 October 2002 finally resolving the \nborder dispute between our two countries. \n The Greentree Agreement of 12 June 2006, \nimplemented following the withdrawal of all Nigerian \ntroops on 14 August 2006, is a credit both to the United \nNations and the personal commitment of the Secretary-\nGeneral. I would like to take this opportunity to thank \nfriendly countries, including the Federal Republic of \nGermany, the United States of America, France and the \nUnited Kingdom. Along with the United Nations, those \ncountries agreed to provide their moral and political \nsupport to the Greentree Agreement, which defined the \nmodalities for the implementation of the ICJ ruling of \n10 October 2002 on the Bakassi Peninsula. More \nimportantly, they agreed to help us to implement it.  \n I would also like to reaffirm here and now \nCameroon\u2019s solemn commitment to continue to fulfil in \ngood faith all its obligations emanating from the \nInternational Court of Justice decision and the \nGreentree Agreement. In particular, I would like to \naffirm that Nigerian nationals living in Bakassi \ndesiring to remain there will be treated in the same way \nas the 4.5 million Nigerians living in Cameroon, who \nare able to live their lives in peace and harmony with \nCameroonians. \n That process has taught us that true lasting peace \ncan never be imposed; it can only be established \nthrough patience and a spirit of compromise. In short, \nreal lasting peace can only come from genuine joint \npolitical will. \n Allow me to highlight some of the many \ninitiatives undertaken by the United Nations that \nreflect the geopolitical developments under way and \nthe aspirations of people around the world. In that \nregard, I would specifically like to refer to the \nMillennium Declaration, which is a genuine charter of \ninternational solidarity binding on all of us as an urgent \nobligation. In addition, the Organization\u2019s ongoing \nattention to Africa is prominently reflected in the \nSecretary-General\u2019s report on sustainable development \nand the causes of conflict in Africa, a document that \nwill be an ongoing source of encouragement to our \ncountries.  \n I also wish to recall that the Secretary-General \nlaid the foundations for the reform of the Organization, \nwhich was made necessary in the light of the changes \nthat have taken place in the world\u2019s balance of power \nsince the founding of United Nations. I should \ntherefore now like to say a few words about what has \ncome to be known as United Nations reform. \n The Organization stands no chance of \nmaintaining its place in world affairs unless it \nsafeguards its legitimacy. In other words, it must \nensure that its representative character is beyond \nreproach. The reform we seek should therefore take \ninto account the development of the international \nsystem in the course of recent decades. Likewise, it \nwill no doubt be necessary to modify the role played \nby some organs of the United Nations system. In that \n \n \n19 06-53958 \n \nconnection, I am thinking in particular of the role of \nthe International Court of Justice. It is in everyone\u2019s \ninterest that the reform be properly carried out while \ntaking into account today\u2019s realities. But however \nreform is carried out, I believe that Africa should have \npermanent representation in the Security Council. That \nis not just a matter of justice, but also one of common \nsense.  \n In order to retain its credibility, the Organization \nshould resolutely continue to pursue its efforts with \nregard to major issues related to peace and \ndevelopment in the developing world. On the political \nlevel, special attention should be paid to the Middle \nEast, Darfur and the issue of nuclear proliferation. \nWith regard to development, the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals should be attained within a \nreasonable time frame.  \n In order to avert doubts as to the positive aspects \nof trade globalization, the United Nations likewise has \na responsibility to maintain a balance between the \ncountries of the North and the South in such major \ntrade negotiations as the now-suspended Doha Round. \nFailure in that regard would have disastrous \nconsequences for Africa.  \n Finally, our Organization must continue to \nsafeguard the cultural identity of the various peoples of \nthe world and to promote a dialogue among cultures \nand religions. The sharing of experiences and the \nknowledge gained through such an honest and \nrespectful dialogue will be the best antidote to the \nclash of civilizations that some predict as well as a sure \nalternative to terrorism and violence. \n Over the years, the United Nations has become a \ncrucial stakeholder in the international arena. I believe \nwe should all welcome that development because, first \nof all, this parliament of nations is the only forum in \nwhich virtually all peoples are represented and where a \nblueprint for international democracy is gradually \nbeing drafted. We should welcome it also because \u2014 \nand this is an important point \u2014 the systematic \nconsideration by our Organization of crises or tensions \ngives negotiation a chance and makes the use of force \nless likely. True, it has not just been success stories, \nbut I think that, broadly speaking, the balance sheet is \nquite positive. This should prompt us not to begrudge \nthe United Nations our trust and to give it means \ncommensurate with its ambitions, its responsibilities \nand the expectations we have of it.  \n For its part, Cameroon will continue to support \nall the initiatives of our Organization aimed at \nmaintaining peace and solidarity among peoples. I need \nhardly say that the human person must remain \nparamount among our concerns. This, inter alia, will be \nthe task facing the new Human Rights Council, of \nwhich my country is honoured to be a member. \n Our Organization cannot remain indifferent to the \ntragedy of the massive migration flows that we have \nbeen witnessing for some time. Clearly this situation \nposes a challenge not only to our States but also to the \nentire international community, and we must all work \ntogether to strengthen cooperation in this area between \nthe countries of the North and the countries of the \nSouth. \n I believe that, appearances to the contrary \u2014 and \nalthough many hotbeds of tension and threat still \nremain \u2014 the international community seems to be \nmoving towards greater stability. Credit, to a large \nextent, goes to the work done by the United Nations, \nits various organs and its staff, who are carrying out \ntheir responsibilities in conditions that are often \ndifficult, even dangerous. \n That is the substance of the message of Mr. Paul \nBiya, President of the Republic of Cameroon, to the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-first session.

        "file_text": "It is a great honour \nfor me to address the General Assembly at its sixty-\nfirst session on behalf of the people of Liberia, not just \nin my capacity as a leader, but as the first \ndemocratically elected woman President in Liberia and \nin Africa. \n Let me congratulate you, Madam, on your \nelection as President of the General Assembly at this \nsession. We are proud of you, as the first Arab Muslim \nwoman and the third woman to occupy this noble \nposition. One of your women predecessors, Angie \nBrooks, hailed from Liberia. I was pleased to honour \nher last Friday in a moving ceremony here in New York \nfor her dedicated services to our country. \n Let me also seize this opportunity to pay a well-\ndeserved tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson \nof Sweden, for his insightful knowledge and \nenlightened leadership in steering the affairs of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixtieth session. \n I wish also to welcome and congratulate the \nRepublic of Montenegro for its admission as the one \nhundred ninety-second Member of the Organization \nand to assure its delegation of Liberia\u2019s friendship, \nsolidarity and support. \n Let me now pay special tribute to Mr. Kofi \nAnnan, the outgoing Secretary-General. I had the \nprivilege of working with him as a former senior staff \nmember of the United Nations Development \nProgramme (UNDP), and I am personally aware of his \ndedication and commitment to the Organization, \nparticularly the reform of the United Nations and the \nstrengthening of its institutions. As I said to him during \nan honouring ceremony in Monrovia in July, we are \nproud of his record of enhancing the responsibility of \nthe United Nations: the responsibility to protect the \npoor from the rich; the weak from the strong; and the \nhumble from the arrogant. The Liberian people, and \nindeed all the people of Africa, are proud of him and \nhis accomplishments. \n Sixty-one years ago, when countries gathered in \nSan Francisco to address issues related to the scourge \nof, and the scars left by, the Second World War, and the \nneed for peace in a post-conflict world, Liberia was \nthere and was a signatory to the Charter of the United \nNations. The purposes and principles of the Charter \nhave proved to be of durable value over the years. \n Times have changed, and the world, too, has \nchanged, beyond what we could have imagined when \nthe Organization was established. Today we are truly a \nglobal village, interconnected physically and \nelectronically, increasingly bound by a shared \ncommitment to confront and overcome the challenges \nthat threaten global peace, stability and the well-being \nof our human family. \n Yet the original aims and objectives of the United \nNations remain today as relevant as they were when \nthe Charter of the Organization was signed 61 years \nago. The need to maintain international peace and \nsecurity, to cultivate friendly relations among nations, \nto achieve international cooperation in solving global \neconomic, cultural, social and humanitarian problems, \nand to promote respect for human rights and \nfundamental freedoms constitute, and still remain, the \ncardinal objectives of the Organization. \n Thus the main focus of this year\u2019s \ndeliberations \u2014 the implementation of a global \npartnership for development \u2014 serves to remind us \nthat at this session the General Assembly must \nvigorously consider how to bring equity to the present \ninternational financial, trade and development \nstructures; how to do more to create the conditions that \nwill improve the standard of living of humankind \neverywhere; how to be sensitive to the needs of \ndeveloping countries and assure them the dividends of \nglobalization. \n \n \n7 06-52737 \n \n In the new millennium, the United Nations should \nnot operate on the basis of structures designed 61 years \nago. We must therefore review the issue of the \ninequitable representation of the world\u2019s peoples, as \nreflected by the present structure of the Security \nCouncil. It is in that regard that reform of the United \nNations is urgent, especially with respect to the \ndecision-making process in a Security Council which is \nundemocratic and hegemonic. The apparent continued \nviolations of the United Nations Charter by some \nMember States on account of national interests \nrepresent a disguised threat to world peace and \nsecurity. \n Hence we must now find an acceptable solution \nunder which nations large and small will receive equal \ntreatment, in consonance with the Charter. The United \nNations was conceived to promote world peace, \ndemocracy and equity for all. \n I strongly support women and gender equality, \nand I look forward with interest to the report of the \nHigh-level Panel on System-wide Coherence, \nappointed by the Secretary-General earlier this year. It \nis expected to submit its final recommendations on \nUnited Nations reform. It is my hope that the \nestablishment of a new, independent United Nations \nfund or programme for the empowerment of women \nand gender equality will be fully supported by Member \nStates, and that such a fund will have sufficient \nresources to support targeted programmes for the \nempowerment of women. \n Three years ago, representatives of contending \nwarring factions, political parties and civil society in \nLiberia gathered in Accra under the auspices of \ninternational partners and signed the Comprehensive \nPeace Agreement. Under provisions of that Agreement, \na National Transitional Government was installed in \nOctober, 2003, with a mandate to disarm combatants \nand prepare our country for elections. In October and \nNovember, 2005, legislative and presidential elections \nwere held, leading to our historic and landmark \nelection by the Liberian people. The United Nations \nplayed a pivotal role in that national transformation. \nFor and on behalf of the Liberian people, I wish to \nthank the United Nations and other international \npartners for the mammoth role they played in securing \npeace and bringing sanity to Liberia. \n I wish also to express the deep appreciation and \ngratitude of the people of Liberia and their friends \neverywhere to the men and women of the United \nNations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) for their active \nrole in securing and enhancing peace and security in \nour country. I am proud to say that the leadership, \ncommanders, men and women of the various \ncontingents of UNMIL have largely comported \nthemselves well and performed their mission with \ndiligence and dedication. They have sacrificed greatly \nand persevered in a very challenging peacekeeping \nenvironment. The Special Representative of the \nSecretary-General deserves particular commendation \nfor his foresight and support of our country\u2019s \nreconstruction efforts. I thank them all sincerely on \nbehalf of the Liberian people. \n There are others to whom we owe a huge debt of \ngratitude. The Economic Community of West African \nStates (ECOWAS), the African Union, the United \nStates of America, the European Union and the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China have been selfless and \ngenerous in their material, financial and moral support \nof our cause. I would be remiss if I did not single out \nthe sacrifices made by our West African brothers and \nsisters to bring peace and sensibility to a suffering \npeople. We thank them. \n While we are enjoying a semblance of peace, we \nare particularly concerned about conflicts in other parts \nof the world. Of notable concern is the protracted crisis \nin the Middle East, which continues to create a state of \nrestlessness and threatens world peace and security. \nFrom our experience, we have learned that no matter \nhow protracted a conflict, the parties must sit around \nthe table to iron out their differences and make peace. \nBoth the Israeli and the Palestinian authorities owe \ntheir respective peoples, and the rest of us in the world, \nan obligation to break out of their cocoon of pride to \nresolve their differences harmoniously. We call for the \nactive engagement of the United Nations in the \npeaceful and amicable resolution of the Middle East \ncrisis. \n Elsewhere in Africa, and especially in \nneighbouring C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, the standoff in the peace \nprocess is troubling. We call on the parties in C\u00f4te \nd\u2019Ivoire to save their people from further punishment \nby resolving their differences. We call upon the United \nNations to continue strong and decisive intervention to \nprevent it from becoming a wider subregional and \nregional crisis. \n  \n \n06-52737 8 \n \n The situation in Darfur and the slow pace with \nwhich it is being addressed require urgent attention. \nThe continued stalemate over whether an African \nUnion or a United Nations force should be deployed or \nmaintained in the region exposes weaknesses in \ninternational cooperation and collaboration and \ndemonstrates a lack of international will to address the \nsufferings and yearnings of the citizens and residents \nof Darfur, who plead everyday for international \nintervention. Darfur represents a potential \nhumanitarian catastrophe. The world must not allow a \nsecond Rwanda to happen. In the new millennium, \ncivilized nations must not be indifferent to any \nconflict, internal or external, regardless of the factors \nthat fuel it. \n The United Nations obligation to protect the \nhelpless and innocent must remain paramount in that \nregard. My Government therefore calls on this General \nAssembly and the Security Council to exercise \nChapter VII authority to restore peace, security and \nstability to Darfur. \n On the other hand, my delegation is pleased with \nthe successful holding of peaceful democratic elections \nin the Democratic Republic of Congo for the first time \nin 40 years. We look forward to seeing a peaceful \nconclusion of the final stage of that process and the \nushering-in of a Government elected by the people of \nthat country. It is our hope that the democratic gains \nmade in the Democratic Republic of the Congo will be \nsustained to enable the new Government to employ the \nvast national resources of that country for the benefit \nand welfare of its people. \n Globalization has significantly altered the world \nand economic transactions among States. Africa will \nremain on the periphery of the global village unless \nwe, as leaders, awaken to the imperatives of the ever-\nchanging requirements. The first step towards that \nprocess of awakening is the promotion of democracy, \nfree enterprise, good governance, human rights and \nsocial justice in our countries and across our continent. \n There is increasing evidence that shows a direct \ncorrelation between the material and moral well-being \nof a people and their country, and the quality of their \ndemocratic environment. My Government is keenly \naware of that reality. We have therefore promulgated \npolicies that support openness, transparency, \naccountability and the equitable distribution of our \nmeagre resources, while endeavouring to address the \ndevelopment and reconstruction challenges of the \ncountry. \n Five years ago on 11 September, 2001, a few \nmiles from this very Hall, terror of unimaginable \nproportions struck, shocked the world and claimed \nclose to 3,000 precious and innocent lives. As the \npeople of the United States and the families of the \ninnocent dead remember their tragic and irreparable \nloss this month, the people of Liberia join me in \naffirming our identification with their loss. We \nmourned with them then and we mourn with them now. \nWe also resolve, as all civilized nations should, to join \nthe global effort to fight terrorism anywhere in the \nworld, recognizing that it is today the most signal \nchallenge to world peace and collective freedom. \n The world has witnessed a significant \nachievement in science and technology, leading to \nrapid industrialization and the improvement of the \nstandards of living of humankind. Although the gains \nhave led to the development of new medicines and \nother scientific knowledge, they also pose a threat to \nthe environment and human survival. \n Rapid industrialization and scientific discoveries \ncan have a damaging impact on the environment. \nUnless there is a modification in our activities, the \npleasure derived from successes in scientific \nachievement could, sadly, lead to tragedy and doom. \n Thus, in the race for modernization and \ndevelopment, we cannot ignore the potency of the \nthreats posed to our survival by environmental \ndegradation. Saving the planet is required for the \ncontinued existence of its more than 5 billion \ninhabitants. \n It is in that regard that my delegation supports the \nefforts of the Commission on Sustainable \nDevelopment, the Kyoto Protocol and the decision \nreached on Agenda 21 during the 1992 United Nations \nConference on Environment and Development, \nintended to raise international awareness about the \ndegradation of the environment and the need to reverse \nthe negative trend. We trust that environmental issues \nwill remain a priority on the global agenda. \n Among the many impediments to social and \neconomic development in Africa are poverty, poor \nhealth delivery systems, intraregional wars and civil \nconflicts. The devastating impact of HIV/AIDS, \nmalaria and other diseases has contributed significantly \n \n \n9 06-52737 \n \nto the slowing of progress on the African continent. \nWhile countries in the developed world are leaping \nahead in science and technology, we are still groping to \nfind the means to combat curable diseases and to join \nin the search to address incurable ones. \n The twenty-fifth anniversary of the emergence of \nHIV/AIDS brought into focus the recognition that that \ndeadly virus has eluded the sophistication of science \nand technology, thereby posing one of the greatest \nchallenges to our development effort. The political will \nof Africa is challenged to act speedily to eradicate the \nvirus and combat this health crisis. \n The Government of Liberia welcomes the partial \nlifting of the arms embargo and the ban on timber \nimposed by Security Council resolution 1521 (2003). \nWe also look forward to the lifting of the ban on \ndiamonds as we seek to meet the requirements of \nCouncil resolution 1343 (2001). My Government \npledges its fullest cooperation in the attainment of the \nobjectives set out in those resolutions. We remain \ngrateful to the international community for the \ncontinuous assistance and support provided to our \ncountry in its search for peace, security and post-war \nreconstruction and development. \n Today, I stand here in testimony to the rebirth of \nmy country \u2014 to our re-emergence to assume once \nmore our enviable and critical role as one of the first \nindependent African republics. We are aware that we \nface awesome challenges: the challenge of rebuilding \nour infrastructure, including education, health and \nother institutions; the challenge of addressing \ngenerations of gender imbalance, especially as it \nrelates to the education of the girl child; and the \nchallenge of promoting democracy, participation and \nfundamental freedoms and rights in an environment of \nequal opportunity. \n We have made important beginnings, and we \nremain encouraged by the bilateral support provided by \nour bilateral and multilateral international partners. \nThe recent visit of the Secretary-General and other \nsimilarly important visits by leaders of our continent \nand of international financial institutions clearly \nunderscore the commitment of the United Nations and \nthe rest of the international community to working with \nour Government to nurture and strengthen peace and to \nfoster development. \n In closing, let me say that today, as in the past, \nLiberia wishes to reaffirm its commitment to the \nUnited Nations, this timeworn but irreplaceable \nmachinery and indispensable framework for \ninternational peace and international relations. We \nmust all join our steadfast forces to make this \ninstitution work for the good of humankind. "

        "file_text": "Not so long ago, \nit appeared that our world was growing at a pace \nbeyond our control into a single global village. Today\u2019s \nreality, by contrast, appears more and more fractured. \nOur efforts to overcome divisions and to harmonize \ndifferences have been hesitant. As the recent struggle \nbetween Israel and Hizbollah has tragically \ndemonstrated, it is not so much the lack of \npeacemaking and peacekeeping experience and \nresources that leaves non-combatants to suffer and die. \nThe more fundamental problem is the difficulty in \nmoulding consistent political will on the part of the \ninternational community. \n In the story of the Tower of Babel, the ancient \nworld gives us an image of our current divided state. \nThe confusion of tongues at Babel is the symbol of the \ndivisions, misunderstandings and hostilities spawned, \nnot by nature, but by human pride. Today, that same \nnegative fundamental attitude has given rise to a new \nbarbarism that is threatening world peace. Terrorists \nand their various organizations are the contemporary \nversion of it, rejecting the best achievements our \ncivilization has gained. In an order of quite a different \nnature, it cannot be denied that super-Powers, regional \nPowers, aspiring Powers and oppressed peoples, too, \nsometimes yield to the temptation to believe, despite \nhistorical evidence, that it is only force that can bring \nabout a just ordering of affairs among peoples and \nnations. \n The ideology of power can go so far as to regard \nthe possession of nuclear weapons as an element of \nnational pride, and it does not exclude the outrageous \npossibility of employing nuclear weapons against its \nadversaries. Meanwhile, the implementation of the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty appears to be stalled, \nand the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty still \nneeds to be ratified by some countries to enter into \nforce. \n This Organization was founded on a very \ndifferent understanding of human affairs. Peace can \nonly be achieved by shared labours aimed at securing a \ndecent and dignified life for all. Due to the East-West \nstruggle, the United Nations was able in the past to \nachieve only an impoverished sort of peace. \n Recently, the Secretary-General\u2019s proposals put \nthis Organization on the path to reform; its lofty goals, \nhowever, will be reached only by overcoming the \nnarrow confines imposed by the dominance of national \ninterests, so that we may open ourselves to the vision \nof a world both reconciled and based on solidarity. In \nthis spirit, the Holy See continues to be an advocate of \nthe United Nations and favours its ongoing reform in \nthe fields of peacebuilding, development and human \nrights. In the same spirit, the Holy See commends the \ndecision to create the Peacebuilding Commission. \n Too often, international bodies act, if at all, only \nafter war is under way or when innocent populations \nhave long been under assault. When the rights of whole \ngroups of people are violated \u2014 grievous examples \ncould be mentioned in Europe, Asia and Africa \u2014 or \nwhen they go unprotected by their own Governments, \n  \n \n06-53952 32 \n \nit is entirely right and just that this Organization should \nintervene in a timely manner by suitable means to \nrestore justice. The need to improve the system for \neffective humanitarian intervention in catastrophes \nbrought on by war, civil conflict and ethnic strife will \nbe an important test of the United Nations reform \nagenda. \n Strengthening the capacity of this Organization to \nforesee conflicts, to resolve them through negotiation \nor to transform them non-violently before there is \nresort to force is, therefore, a goal of primary \nimportance in the renewal of the Organization. In this \nregard, I regret to say that Security Council resolution \n1701 (2006) of 11 August 2006, which was a very good \nresolution, could have been adopted with the same \nwording one month earlier. If repeated pleas for \nimmediate cessation of the violence, made by many, \nincluding Pope Benedict XVI, had been acted upon, the \nkilling of thousands of civilians and numerous young \nsoldiers, the flight of peoples and the enormous \nindiscriminate devastation need not have occurred. \nMeanwhile, none of the outcomes that some \nGovernments put forward as a reason for the \ncontinuation of hostilities in Lebanon have, in fact, \nbeen achieved. \n As history has shown, for lack of sufficient \ncapacity for intervention and common will, millions \nhave died in needless conflicts \u2014 inutili stragi \u2014 that \nis, \u201cpointless massacres\u201d, to repeat a famous phrase \nused by Benedict XV, who was Pope during the First \nWorld War. The appeal by the late Pope Paul VI, \nuttered in this Hall on 4 October 1965 \u2014 \u201cJamais plus \nla guerre\u201d, meaning \u201cNever again war\u201d \u2014 today rings \nlike an accusation in the heart of the collective \nconscience of humanity. \n The surest way to prevent war is to address its \ncauses. It must not be forgotten that at the root of war \nthere are usually real and serious grievances: injustices \nsuffered; denial of human rights and absence of the \nrule of law; legitimate aspirations frustrated, and the \nexploitation of multitudes of desperate people who see \nno real possibility of improving their lot by peaceful \nmeans. How can we not be disturbed by the images of \ncountless exiles and refugees living in camps and \nenduring subhuman conditions, or by those desperate \ngroups which, intent upon seeking a less wretched \nfuture for themselves and their children, are driven to \nface the risks of illegal emigration? And what of the \nmillions of people oppressed by misery and hunger and \nexposed to lethal epidemics, who continue to cry out to \nour sense of humanity? These, too, are challenges to \nour desire for peace. \n The fulfilment of the Millennium Development \nGoals and the resumption of the latest World Trade \nOrganization (WTO) trade round promise economic \nprogress, the alleviation of poverty, a reduction in \nterrorism and increased social harmony. Building peace \nfor tomorrow requires that justice be done today. \n Like development, the protection of human rights \nis an essential pillar in the edifice of world peace, for \npeace consists in people\u2019s unimpeded enjoyment of \ntheir God-given rights. The Holy See hopes that the \nnewly formed Human Rights Council will enhance the \nenjoyment of those rights by all peoples and by the \ncitizens of every nation. Diversity among cultures \nallows for differences in the emphasis and \nimplementation of human rights, but human nature, \nwhich is their foundation and is common to the whole \nof human society, permits no basic human right to be \neclipsed or subordinated for the sake of other rights.  \n Every Government must clearly understand that \nviolations of the fundamental rights of the person \ncannot be exempt from scrutiny by the international \ncommunity under the pretext of the inviolability of a \nState\u2019s internal affairs. \n With respect to fundamental human rights, I \nwould like to draw attention to three primary rights. \n I turn first to the right to life. The increasing \nrecognition of the sacredness of life, witnessed also by \nthe growing rejection of the death penalty, needs to be \nmatched by a thorough protection of human life \nprecisely when it is at its weakest, that is, at its very \nbeginning and at its natural end. Secondly, respect for \nreligious freedom means respect for the intimate \nrelationship of the believing person with God, in both \nits individual and social aspects. Indeed, there is \nnothing more sacred. Thirdly, there is the right to \nfreedom of thought and expression, including freedom \nto hold opinions without interference and to exchange \nideas and information and the consequent freedom of \nthe press. The observance of this right is necessary for \nthe fulfilment of each person, for the respect of \ncultures and for the progress of science. We must \nacknowledge, however, that not all fundamental \nrights \u2014 and in particular the three which I have \nmentioned \u2014 are adequately protected in every nation, \nand, in more than a few, they are openly denied, even \namong States sitting on the Human Rights Council. \n \n \n33 06-53952 \n \n Although in some cases religion continues to be \ncynically exploited for political ends, it is my \ndelegation\u2019s firm belief that, at its best, truest and most \nauthentic, religion is a vital force for harmony and peace \namong peoples. It appeals to the noblest aspects of human \nnature. It binds up the wounds of war, both physical and \npsychological. It provides sanctuary to refugees and \nhospitality to migrants. It weaves bonds of solidarity that \novercome every form of mistrust, and through \nforgiveness it lends stability to once-divided societies. \n Twenty years ago, the late Pope John Paul II \nbrought together the leaders of the world\u2019s religions to \npray and to bear witness to peace. That collective \nwitness was renewed in 1993 during the Bosnian war \nand in 2002 following the barbarous 11 September \nterrorist attacks on New York and Washington. More \nrecently, on 23 July of this year, faced with the \nspreading war in Lebanon, Pope Benedict XVI invited \nChristians and all believers to join him in a day of \nprayer and penitence, imploring God for the gift of \npeace for the Holy Land and the Middle East. \n In this past generation, leaders and adherents of \nthe world\u2019s religions have shown themselves time and \nagain to be willing to dialogue and to promote \nharmony among peoples. \n On Wednesday 20 September last, Pope Benedict \nXVI repeated his unequivocal support for inter-\nreligious and intercultural dialogue and expressed the \nhope that what he had said at the University of \nRegensburg might be a boost and an encouragement for \npositive and even self-critical dialogue, both between \nreligions and between modern reason and the faith of \nChristians. The Pope, as is well known, expressed \nsadness that some passages of his academic address \ncould have lent themselves to misinterpretation. His \nreal intention was to explain that it is not religion and \nviolence, but religion and reason that go together, in \nthe context of a critical vision of a society which seeks \nto exclude God from public life. Two days ago, while \nreceiving the ambassadors of the countries of the \nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) \naccredited to the Holy See, he added:  \n \u201cThe lessons of the past must \u2026 help us to \nseek paths of reconciliation, in order to live with \nrespect for the identity and freedom of each \nindividual, with a view to fruitful cooperation in \nthe service of all humanity \u2026 respect and \ndialogue require reciprocity in all spheres, \nespecially in that which concerns basic freedoms, \nmore particularly religious freedom\u201d. \n If, on the one hand, religious motivation for \nviolence, whatever its source, must be clearly and \nradically rejected, on the other it must be emphasized \nthat in political life one cannot disregard the \ncontribution of the religious vision of the world and of \nhumanity. In fact, as the Pope affirmed, were reason to \nturn a deaf ear to the divine and relegate religion to the \nambit of subcultures, it would automatically provoke \nviolent reactions, and violent reactions are always a \nfalsification of true religion.  \n It falls to all interested parties \u2014 to civil society \nas well as to States \u2014 to promote religious freedom \nand a sane social tolerance that will disarm extremists \neven before they can begin to corrupt others with their \nhatred of life and liberty. That will be a significant \ncontribution to peace among peoples, because peace \ncan be born only in the hearts of human beings. \n Together with this heartfelt wish, it is my honour \nto conclude by conveying to you, Madam President, \nand to the peoples here represented the cordial \ngreetings of His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI. Upon \nthe deliberations of this General Assembly, he invokes \nan abundance of Almighty God\u2019s blessings. "

        "file_text": "First of all, I would like \nto congratulate our President on her election to this \nhigh post and to assure her of the full support of \nUkraine throughout her mandate. I would also like to \nexpress our deep appreciation of her predecessor and \nmy good friend, Mr. Jan Eliasson, for his outstanding \ncontribution to progress in implementing the decisions \nof the 2005 World Summit. \n I would also like to pay special tribute to the \nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who is about to \nrelinquish his important and noble mission. I praise Mr. \nAnnan for his valuable personal contributions and \ndevoted efforts to further all aspects of United Nations \nactivities and wish him the best in his further \nendeavours. \n We are convinced that the next Secretary-General \nmust be a person truly deserving of the post and who \nwill discharge this responsible duty with honour. I \nwould like to again emphasize the justified position of \nthe Eastern European States regarding the priority right \nfor a representative of this region to be appointed to \nthe top post at the United Nations. Eastern Europe \nremains the only region that has never had a \nrepresentative serve as Secretary-General. In this \nrespect, we welcome the nomination of Ms. Vaira Vike-\nFreiberga, President of the Republic of Latvia. \n Our achievements in implementing last year\u2019s \nSummit decisions are quite impressive. The Human \nRights Council, of which Ukraine is an active member, \nhas started its work. The Peacebuilding Commission, \nthe Central Emergency Response Fund and the United \nNations Democracy Fund are all functioning and \nmaking important contributions towards overcoming \ndisasters and injustice. All of these are notable \nmilestones in the process of reforming the United \nNations. \n Still, we are far from ensuring the adaptation of \nour Organization to today\u2019s realities, let alone \npreparing it for addressing tomorrow\u2019s threats and \nchallenges. The reform of the Security Council, the \nstrengthening of the Economic and Social Council, the \npromotion of the 2005 World Summit agenda for \ndevelopment and improvement in the management of \nthe Secretariat have yet to be tackled. \n It is well known that without the modernization \nof the Security Council, an indispensable pillar of the \ncollective security system, reform of the United \nNations would be incomplete. From standpoint of the \nMember States of the Eastern European Group, this \nthesis could be paraphrased as follows: no enlargement \nof the Security Council would be complete without \nensuring the enhanced representation of Eastern \nEurope. The doubling of the Group\u2019s membership since \n1991, with, most recently, the Republic of Montenegro \njoining the United Nations as its one hundred ninety-\nsecond Member, supports our argument. At this point, I \nwould like to welcome the friendly Republic of \nMontenegro to the United Nations family. \n We need to unite our efforts so that the United \nNations \u2014 that is, all of us together \u2014 can adequately \nrespond to the broad spectrum of existing and future \nchallenges in the areas of security, development and \nhuman rights. \n Recent commemoration of the fifth anniversary \nof the barbaric terrorist attack on this city, as well as \nthe growing number of terrorist acts in many parts of \nthe world, should leave no doubt that terrorism \ncontinues to remain one of the most dangerous threats \nof the present day. \n Ukraine welcomes the recent adoption by the \nGeneral Assembly of the Global Counter-Terrorism \nStrategy and is ready to make important contributions \ntowards its effective realization. This important \ndecision has become another strong signal that \nterrorism will not be tolerated. The Strategy also \ntestifies to the readiness of the international \ncommunity to strengthen coordination and increase the \neffectiveness of measures to combat this hideous \nphenomenon, within the framework of a concrete \n  \n \n06-53329 20 \n \naction plan. On its part, Ukraine recently ratified the \nCouncil of Europe Convention on the Prevention of \nTerrorism. We call upon Member States to make \nadditional efforts during the current session of the \nGeneral Assembly to elaborate on and adopt the \ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism. \n Ukraine is deeply concerned with the situation in \nthe Middle East. Recent events in Lebanon and the \ncontinuing Israeli-Palestinian crisis have shown the \nneed for more decisive international efforts aimed at \nreturning peace and stability to this region. Violence \nand hatred cannot become the alternatives to the \nrestoration of dialogue and negotiations aimed at \nachieving a comprehensive and lasting settlement of \nthe Arab-Israeli conflict on all of its tracks. \n Ukraine therefore welcomes the adoption of \nSecurity Council resolution 1701 (2006) on Lebanon. \nSupport of the resolution by all parties in the region \nallows for hope that it will be fully implemented. As a \nlongstanding contributor to the United Nations \nPeacekeeping efforts, including in the Middle East, \nUkraine made its concrete proposals on contributing to \nthe enhanced United Nations Interim Force in \nLebanon. \n The inability to agree on a set of commitments \nregarding disarmament and non-proliferation was one \nof the major setbacks of the 2005 World Summit. More \nthan a decade ago Ukraine made a historic contribution \nin this area when it unilaterally renounced the world\u2019s \nthird largest nuclear weapons arsenal. Therefore, we \ncall upon Member States to strive for progress in the \nareas of disarmament and non-proliferation in the \nUnited Nations and other forums, for the sake of future \ngenerations. \n Lately, the international community has been \nconcerned with the nuclear programme of Iran. \nUkraine supports the efforts of those countries that \nseek to gain Teheran\u2019s return to full and close \ncooperation with the International Atomic Energy \nAgency (IAEA). Appropriate levels of transparency \nand cooperation with Iran on this issue would help to \nease the concerns of the international community. \nUkraine stands for the right of all nations to use \nnuclear energy for peaceful purposes; however, in \nrealizing this right, nations must fully adhere to \ncommitments in the field of non-proliferation. \n One of the most important tests of the ability of \nthe United Nations to deal effectively with inter-ethnic \nconflict will be how the future status of Kosovo is \nhandled. \n Taking into account the fragile situation in and \naround Kosovo, the political process of determining its \nfuture status should be handled with maximum \nresponsibility by all the parties involved. Any imposed \ndecision leading to a unilateral change of borders of \nthat internationally recognized democratic State will \ninevitably destabilize the situation in the Balkan region \nand set dangerous precedents in Europe and the entire \nworld. Unfortunately, we are already witnessing the \nunfolding of an undesirable scenario created by \nattempts to use the Kosovo settlement as a precedent \nfor claiming independence for several self-proclaimed \nregimes within the boundaries of the former Soviet \nUnion. I refer to so-called referendums on \nindependence recently held in Transdniestria, Moldova, \nand scheduled for the near future in South Ossetia, \nGeorgia. Ukraine and the international community do \nnot recognize these referendums, considering them \nillegitimate and without legal consequences. \n Ukraine supports the need for negotiations \nbetween Belgrade and Pristina aimed at finding a \nmutually acceptable solution based on Security Council \ndecisions, including resolution 1244 (1999). It is \nextremely important to ensure that the decision of the \nSecurity Council on the final status of Kosovo does not \nimpose a solution, which can be taken only with the \nclearly expressed consent of both parties concerned.  \n As representative of Ukraine and Chair of the \nGUAM \u2014 Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Moldova \nGroup \u2014 Organization for Democracy and Economic \nDevelopment, I would like to thank the countries that \nsupported placing on the agenda of the sixty-first \nsession of the General Assembly item 27 on protracted \nconflicts in the GUAM area and their implications for \ninternational peace, security and development. It is an \nimportant step that will help to draw attention to the \nneed for more active and effective steps by the \ninternational community to achieve progress in settling \nconflicts on the territory of Azerbaijan, Georgia and \nMoldova. We call for implementing the initiative \nproposed by the President of Ukraine on Transdniestria \nentitled \u201cTo settlement through democracy\u201d, the plan \nfor a peace settlement in South Ossetia presented by \nthe President of Georgia, and for implementing the \nSecurity Council resolutions and OSCE decisions on \nthe conflicts in Nagorny Karabakh and Abkhazia. \nThese conflicts are among the main obstacles to the \n \n \n21 06-53329 \n \nfull-scale democratic transformation of the region, \nwhich is among the core elements of Ukraine\u2019s \nregional policy. \n Having gained a new level of integration during \nthe Kyiv Summit last May, GUAM member States set \nas their main goals the strengthening of democratic \nvalues, the rule of law, and human rights and \nfundamental freedoms, the deepening of European \nintegration, and the achievement of sustainable \ndevelopment and the greater well-being of their \npeoples. \n The Black Sea Economic Cooperation \nOrganization (BSEC) is another promising model of \nmultilateral political and economic cooperation. \nDuring the 14 years of its dynamic existence, that \norganization has proved its value as a framework for \nregional cooperation. Because issues of energy security \nare very important for Europe today, the Black Sea and \nCaspian Sea regions take on special significance for \nthe secure, stable extraction and transportation of \nenergy resources. Ukraine is ready to take an active \npart in promoting energy projects within the BSEC \nframework. We are convinced that the BSEC can \neffectively support the efforts of the world community \nto combat terrorism, resolve the so-called frozen \nconflicts in the region and combat trans-border crime. \nIt is necessary to coordinate BSEC activity with \ncorresponding programmes supported by the United \nNations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation \nin Europe, the European Union and NATO. \n The Forum of the Community of Democratic \nChoice (CDC), held in Kyiv in December 2005, is \nanother example of cooperation aimed at strengthening \nEuropean democratic values in Eastern Europe. The \nCDC is a forum in which the States of the Baltic Sea-\nBlack Sea-Caspian Sea area with the Balkans discuss \ntheir aspirations for the higher democratic standards \nrequired for full-scale European integration. GUAM, \nBSEC and the CDC are valuable contributions to the \ncreation of an Eastern Europe area akin to the \nEuropean Union area of democracy, stability and \nprosperity. \n Democracy, the rule of law and respect for human \nrights and fundamental freedoms are essential elements \nof Ukraine\u2019s domestic and foreign policies. That is why \nwe are proud to have been elected to the Human Rights \nCouncil. As a member of that body, Ukraine is ready to \nwork with other States to bring about real change \nthrough the promotion of human rights worldwide. \n The international community is responsible for \nprotecting people threatened with genocide or other \nviolations of fundamental human rights. In two years, \nwe will mark the sixtieth anniversary of the United \nNations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment \nof the Crime of Genocide. One and a half decades \nbefore the adoption of the Convention, and even before \nthe tragedy of the Holocaust, the Ukrainian people was \na victim of genocide. Deliberately organized by the \nCommunist totalitarian regime for the purpose of \ndestroying the vital core of the freedom-loving \nUkrainian people \u2014 its peasantry \u2014 the Holodomor in \nUkraine of 1932 and 1933 killed 7 million to 10 \nmillion innocent men, women and children, about \n25 per cent of Ukraine\u2019s population at that time. The \nCommunist regime tried to conceal the scale and tragic \nconsequences of that inhuman crime from the world \ncommunity, and they succeeded for a long time.  \n After Ukraine regained its independence, many \nnew appalling and horrifying facts were revealed. The \nparliaments of a number of countries have recognized \nthe Holodomor of 1932 and 1933 as an act of genocide. \nUkraine calls on the United Nations, as the collective \nvoice of the international community, to contribute to \nthe commemoration of the sixtieth anniversary of the \nConvention by recognizing the Holodomor as an act of \ngenocide against the Ukrainian people. That step would \ncontribute towards making genocide and mass abuse of \nhuman rights impossible in the future. \n With the same aim, a number of events will take \nplace in Kyiv tomorrow to commemorate the sixty-fifth \nanniversary of the Babyn Yar tragedy. The mass \nexecutions by the Nazis there were among the first sad \npages of the evolving tragedy of the Holocaust. Etched \nin the memory of the Ukrainian people, it also saw the \ndeath of tens of thousands of Soviet prisoners of war of \nvarious nationalities. This event will be yet another \nimportant reminder of the lessons of history and the \nneed to prevent all manifestations of anti-Semitism, \nxenophobia and intolerance. \n Needless to say, we should focus on \nimplementing the Millennium Development Goals and \nnew commitments on the global development agenda \nmade at the 2005 World Summit. There has been mixed \nprogress in this area, and the commitments and \npromises made have not yet been translated into action \n  \n \n06-53329 22 \n \nwith direct impact on the lives of peoples in need. The \nresponse to global threats should be effective and \ntimely. It took the international community nearly 20 \nyears since the first recorded cases of AIDS to \nrecognize that this disease could threaten the very \nexistence of humanity. The twenty-sixth special session \nof the Assembly initiated by Ukraine together with \nother States, and held in 2001, was a turning point in \ncombating HIV/AIDS. I want to confirm Ukraine\u2019s \ncommitment to implementing the Declaration of \nCommitment on HIV/AIDS (resolution S-26/2) and to \nexpress hope for continuing close cooperation in this \nfield with the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis \nand Malaria, with the World Bank and with United \nNations specialized agencies. \n Lately, we have witnessed the emergence of a \nnew disease that potentially poses no less a challenge \nto humanity than HIV/AIDS. Avian influenza threatens \nthe entire world and knows no borders. It is our joint \nresponsibility to ensure that all countries are protected \nagainst this threat. Combating the spread of avian \ninfluenza and preparations for a possible pandemic of \nhuman influenza demand concerted action at the \nnational, regional and global levels. Should we repeat \nthe mistakes of the past or should we learn the lessons \nand thus meet the challenge prepared? We believe that \nthe General Assembly should consider the problem and \nprovide the answer. \n In the more than 60 years since its creation, the \nUnited Nations has grown both in numbers \u2014 from 51 \nStates to 192 \u2014 and in quality. Our Organization has \ngained invaluable experience in changing the world so \nthat every person can enjoy more security, justice and \ndignity. However, much remains yet to be achieved. I \nbelieve that it is within our power and in our interest to \ndo all we can to ensure that the world is united not only \nby a common past but by a common future as well. "

        "file_text": "Allow me, Madam, to congratulate you \nupon your election as President of the sixty-first \nsession of the General Assembly. I also wish to take \nthis opportunity to convey our high appreciation to \nSecretary-General Kofi Annan for his commendable \nachievements throughout his two consecutive terms of \noffice, in the maintenance of peace and the promotion \nof socio-economic development the world over.  \n Despite the fact that today\u2019s global trend is \ntowards peace and development cooperation, the \ninternational situation continues to undergo rapid and \ncomplex changes. Numerous events during the past \nyear demonstrate that world peace, justice and security \nare far from being secured, due to the use of force in \nthe settlement of international problems and violations \nof the sovereignty of Member States. All of this creates \nmajor impediments to peace and development \ncooperation among States and peoples. \n Globalization offers new opportunities for \neconomic development, yet its benefits are unevenly \nshared. Developing countries, in particular the most \nvulnerable groups, namely the least developed \ncountries, landlocked developing countries and small \nisland developing States, have taken important steps to \nlaunch trade liberalization and further integrate \nthemselves into the world economy. Nevertheless, \nthose countries continue to face many problems, \nprimarily the lack of basic infrastructure, access to \nmarkets, capital, new technology, financing and \ninvestment. In order to solve those problems, the \ninternational community must create an enabling \nenvironment conducive to development, whereby the \ninterests of developing countries can be tangibly \npromoted.  \n To enable the United Nations to meet the \nchallenges ahead, it should be reformed in a \ncomprehensive, inclusive and balanced manner. This \nwould enhance the important role of the Organization \nin maintaining international peace and security and \npromoting the peaceful settlement of disputes and \ninternational cooperation for development. In addition, \nthe United Nations reform process should include the \nrevitalization of the General Assembly, the \nstrengthening of the Economic and Social Council and \nreform of the Security Council in order to render it \nmore legitimate, democratic and effective.  \n Despite the failure of the recent United Nations \nConference to Review Progress Made in the \nImplementation of the Programme of Action to \nPrevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in \nSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, the \n  \n \n06-53329 2 \n \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic considers that the \nProgramme of Action is a living document and remains \na framework for cooperation that empowers States to \nwork towards its full and effective implementation. \n The historic first meeting of heads of State or \nGovernment of the Group of Landlocked Developing \nCountries, held on 14 September 2006 in Havana, \nCuba, adopted a declaration reaffirming the right of \naccess to and from the sea of landlocked countries, in \naccordance with international law, and underscored the \nimportance of a midterm review to assess the \nimplementation of the Almaty Programme of Action. In \nmy capacity as Chairman of the Group of Landlocked \nDeveloping Countries, I appeal to the international \ncommunity to further address the special needs and \nproblems of that vulnerable group and to lend us \nsupport and assistance in our efforts to bring the \nmidterm review process to a successful conclusion. \n The country supports General Assembly \nresolutions that call upon the Government of the \nUnited States of America to put an end to the \neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \non the Republic of Cuba.  \n In the Middle East, there is an urgent need to \nimplement Security Council resolution 1701 (2006), \nwhich would bring normalcy to the situation in \nLebanon and pave the way for a comprehensive \nsolution to the Palestinian problem, in conformity with \nthe relevant United Nations resolutions. \n The situation in the Korean peninsula requires \nthat problems should be resolved by peaceful means. In \nthat regard, we call for the resumption of the Six-Party \nTalks based on the principles and commitments set out \nin the Joint Statement of 19 September 2005, in order \nto promote peace and security in the region. \n The international community is deeply concerned \nto see the people of Iraq continue daily to endure \nsignificant losses in human lives and property. My \ncountry expresses the hope that peace, security and \nnational unity will be restored as soon as possible. \n In the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, \nfollowing the election of members of the National \nAssembly of the sixth legislature, held in early 2006, a \nnew Government has been formed with the main tasks \nof consistently pursuing the policy of overall \nrestructuring and ensuring the effective implementation \nof our five-year socio-economic development plan. \nThat achievement would contribute to strengthening \nthe nation\u2019s political stability and social security and to \nconsolidating solidarity throughout society.  \n Over the past five years, the national economy \nhas grown at an annual average rate of 6.3 per cent, the \nincidence of poverty has declined from 48 per cent of \nthe population in 1990 to 28.7 per cent in 2006, and \nopium cultivation has been completely eradicated. \nPublic investment was concentrated in areas such as \ninfrastructure and social development, particularly \nhuman resource development which focuses on \neducation, health and culture. Moreover, foreign direct \ninvestment has swiftly increased. \n For the coming years, the Government will \nconcentrate all its efforts and actively mobilize all of \nthe country\u2019s forces and potential, in conjunction with \nfavourable conditions and opportunities provided by \nthe international community, for the purpose of \nensuring the successful implementation of our national \nsocio-economic development plan for the period 2006-\n2010, with a view to achieving steady economic \ngrowth at an annual rate of 7.5 per cent.  \n It is expected that by 2010, the slash and burn \nmethod of cultivation will definitely be terminated and \nthat the problem of poor households will be basically \nsolved. In addition, policies of support for small and \nmedium enterprises will be implemented concurrently \nwith the promotion and gradual expansion of \nindustrialization, with a view to further improving the \nliving conditions of our people and raising them to a \nhigher level.  \n Similarly, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \nwill further expand its relations and cooperation with \nthe international community and will contribute \nactively to the regional integration process, particularly \nthe integration of countries members of the Association \nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), with the aim of \nenhancing the role of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic as an efficient partner of the countries in \nSouth-East Asia and other regions of the world. \n In closing, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \nreiterates its determination to work in unison with the \ninternational community to create an environment \nconducive to promoting the well-being of all countries \nand peoples the world over.

        "file_text": "Allow me first to welcome your election, Madam, to \nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\n \n \n19 06-52879 \n \nfirst session, confident that it will result in important \ndecisions in the common interest. \n It is with particular pride and emotion that I wish \nto recall the sixtieth session, during which many \ndecisions, important for the Organization, were made. \nIn Montenegro it will be remembered as historic since \nit was at that session that our nation was admitted as a \nfully fledged Member of this unique world \norganization. I wish therefore to thank the Secretary-\nGeneral and the President of the sixtieth session,  \nMr. Eliasson, and the other representatives of nations \nin this forum for having contributed to making the \nceremony of Montenegro\u2019s admission as the 192nd \nMember State of the United Nations so uplifting. \n It is a great honour and pleasure at this session to \nrepresent Montenegro which for the first time now \nparticipates in the debate as a fully-fledged Member. \nAs the President of Montenegro, Filip Vujanovic, has \nalready stressed from this rostrum, we see this as a \nhuge chance, as well as a huge responsibility. \nMontenegro is a young European nation that has \nexisted on its own on the international scene for only a \nfew months, but it is firmly determined to continue \nwith even more strength to contribute to peace, \nstability and prosperity, by respecting and promoting \nthe underlying ideas, principles and goals of the United \nNations and its documents. I am strongly convinced \nthat in the time in which we live the importance of a \nState, big or small, primarily depends on its \ncontribution to the respect for and implementation of \nthese fundamental international values and standards. \nThis is relevant in both a regional and a broader \ncontext. \n It is in the nature of small States to be more \nsensitive to the need for tolerance and dialogue, for \nopenness, and international relations based on mutual \ntrust, equality and solidarity, and also to the value of \nunity in diversity, which is the axiom of this time, and \nof global integration, the basis on which today\u2019s \nMontenegro is developing. In this sense I would add \nthat small nations are destined to be elitist. I hope that \nit is not presumptuous to say that Montenegro \npromoted these principles best in the recent referendum \nthat we organized in full partnership with the European \nUnion, the Organization for Security and Cooperation \nin Europe, and the Council of Europe, proving that \neven in south-eastern Europe the most difficult and \nmost sensitive issues \u2014 such as the status issue \u2014 can \nbe tackled in a democratic fashion and in accordance \nwith the highest international standards. We are \ntherefore proud to stress that the democratic process \nand outcome of the Montenegrin referendum is also a \nEuropean policy victory in our region, and are \nconfident that through this example we can contribute \nto stability and good-neighbourly relations in our \nregion. \n Indeed, regional cooperation is inseparable from \nEuropean and global integration, which are essentially \nabout issues of peace, stability, security and prosperity, \nthe more so as the globalization that is gaining \nmomentum confronts us with new challenges and new \nthreats of a political, environmental and socio-\neconomic nature. The issues of today, such as \ninternational terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction, illegal migration and trafficking, \npoverty, threats to the environment, and so forth, \nhighlight the need for common action. \n This vision of the future is exemplified in the \nMillennium Declaration, which projects the principles \nand goals of the Charter to the world in a new age, \nhighlighting common responsibility and solidarity in \norder to accomplish a vision of a more secure, \nprosperous and just world. Without stability there is no \ndemocracy, just as without democracy there is no \nstability or sustainable economic development. These \nare interdependent processes that must take place \nsimultaneously, and that highlights the importance of \naccomplishing the Millennium Goals. All this brings to \nthe fore the importance of efficient multilateralism \nthrough action by the United Nations, which needs to \nbe reformed in order to adequately cope with today\u2019s \nchallenges, as well as other international and regional \norganizations and all nations. \n With full awareness and responsibility we will \ncontinue to build in Montenegro stable institutions that \nguarantee the rule of law, freedoms, equality and non-\ndiscrimination, human and minority rights as well as \nsolidarity and a market economy. We will also continue \nto promote multi-ethnic harmony and tolerance, \nconvinced that religious and cultural diversity is \nenriching and conducive to greater stability and \ngrowth. It is also conducive to striking a balance \nbetween the State and the individual, fully in \naccordance with the principles of sustainable \ndevelopment. \n In this context I wish to express my gratitude to \nthe specialized United Nations agencies for their \n  \n \n06-52879 20 \n \nefforts and support. I believe it is important to stress \nfrom this rostrum that in partnership with the United \nNations Development Programme and our European \npartners we will build the first eco-building designed to \nhouse United Nations agencies operating in \nMontenegro. \n We are very proud that at the very outset of life \non its own Montenegro was admitted to the United \nNations, the institution that is the meeting point for a \nmultitude of cultures and identities, which it merges \ninto one address that each and every one of us \nidentifies with, an institution in which all peoples and \nStates enjoy full equality. We see this as historic proof \nof acknowledgement of respect for the fundamental \nvalues and goals of the United Nations, still equally \nvalid today. I am confident that Montenegro will \ndistinguish itself even more as a trustworthy and \nconstructive partner and that our cooperation within the \nUnited Nations will take on a new quality and will \nremain a key component of the political action of \nMontenegro. Today\u2019s Montenegro has a clear vision of \ndevelopment and of its European perspective, and is \nready to fully contribute to a united Europe and the \nUnited Nations. "

        "file_text": "It is \na great honour and a pleasure to address the General \nAssembly at its sixty-first session on behalf of Bosnia \nand Herzegovina. \n First of all, I would like to congratulate \nMs. Al-Khalifa on her election to her important post, \nand also to thank the former President for his \ncontribution to the United Nations reform process. \n Bosnia and Herzegovina aligns itself with the \nstatement made by the representative of the European \nUnion (EU), which provides a framework for the \ndiscussion of issues such as peace, stability, \ndevelopment, human rights, the rule of law and the \nneed to further strengthen and reform the United \nNations. \n We endorse the EU statement, but we would also \nlike to share with the Assembly Bosnia and \nHerzegovina\u2019s experience in peacebuilding, the \nimplementation of human rights and the rule of law \nand economic development in a post-conflict \nenvironment. We believe that in that way we can \ncontribute to the future success of the international \ncommunity elsewhere in the world. \n Bosnia and Herzegovina is, beyond any doubt, an \nexample of successful intervention by the international \ncommunity, despite a few negative experiences. I \nwould like to make it absolutely clear that the job in \nBosnia and Herzegovina is not yet done. There are still \n  \n \n06-52885 34 \n \nsome bridges that we have to cross before we will have \nfinished the 15-year-long marathon task of stopping the \nfighting, promoting reconciliation and building a stable \nBosnia and Herzegovina with a view to becoming an \nEU member in the near future. \n Bosnia and Herzegovina belongs to Europe; it is \npart of the European continent. Medical students \u2014 \nfuture doctors \u2014 all take the Hippocratic oath. They \nswear to apply the highest ethical norms. Law students \nget their basic training from the standards of Roman \nlaw. The European heritage and European practices are \nfirmly rooted in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We must \nnow embrace all European Union standards and norms. \nWe do not feel discouraged when we hear people talk \nof \u201cenlargement fatigue\u201d. Through the enlargement \nprocess, Europe is spreading democracy itself. It would \nbe completely contrary to EU and United Nations \nprinciples to grow tired of the spread of democracy. \n Recent events in the Middle East have shown us \nhow important it is to achieve a just and lasting peace \nthere. But just as we sympathize with people living in \ncrisis areas today, so too those living in such areas can \nobserve the process of peacebuilding in Bosnia. One \nshould pay attention not just to the stabilization of one \nState in the Balkans but also to the capacity that the EU \nand the rest of the international community have to \ninitiate swift and efficient intervention. \n We in Bosnia and Herzegovina have been assisted \nby the United Nations, NATO, the EU, the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, \nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference and the \nCouncil of Europe. We have also benefited from other, \nunique assistance mechanisms, such as the recently \nestablished Office of the High Representative and the \nPeace Implementation Council, which include \nEuropean Union members, Japan, Russia, the United \nStates of America, Canada, Turkey and others.  \n The war has been stopped, the refugees have \nreturned and today we are negotiating a Stabilization \nand Association Agreement with the EU. However, \nnone of us should allow the current flaws in Bosnia \nand Herzegovina to develop into something more \nserious, leading to instability. \n As magnificent as it was in terms of stopping the \nwar, the Dayton Peace Agreement did not tackle some \nessential issues, such as providing for every citizen to \nenjoy equal rights throughout the country, or for the \nState to be able to exercise its powers as a modern, \nmulti-ethnic State. \n Many visitors to my country are especially \nimpressed by the number of churches, mosques and \nsynagogues that there are, and the way in which they \ncoexist in close proximity to one another, serving their \npurpose in Bosnia and Herzegovina. That is the spirit \nof Bosnia that we inherited from our ancestors, but the \nDayton Agreements have not enabled us to maintain \nthat traditional aspect of the country. \n On the other hand, Bosnia and Herzegovina has \nbeen able to achieve economic and political \ndevelopment, which strengthens its prospects for \njoining Euro-Atlantic integration processes. The \nnumber of foreign military troops on our soil has been \nreduced tenfold and the mandate of the EU-led \npeacekeeping force has shifted from stabilization to \nintegration. We have established a single economic \nspace and a single judiciary system, and the various \nintelligence services are now united and are for the \nfirst time under strict and democratic parliamentary \nsupervision. We have formed a single State-level \nMinistry of Defence, and thereby qualified for \naccession to the NATO Partnership for Peace \nprogramme. \n Bosnia and Herzegovina, as it is today, was not \nshaped by conventional political means. Its structure \nwas defined by the Dayton Peace Agreement as a way \nto prevent war. The sustainability of the Bosnia and \nHerzegovina of Dayton has been strengthened by the \nlaunching of the Stabilization and Association \nAgreement negotiations with the European Union, \nwhich began on the tenth anniversary of the signing of \nthe Dayton Agreement. \n The Office of the High Representative is \nscheduled to be abolished in the middle of next year. \nThat Office will be transformed into the Office of the \nSpecial Representative of the EU for Bosnia and \nHerzegovina. That should be linked to our signing of \nthe SAA with the European Union. So far, negotiations \nhave gone well, and Bosnia has demonstrated sufficient \nawareness and technical ability to enable it to embark \non the Euro-integration project. We are preparing for \nelections in October, but, unfortunately, the ongoing \ncampaigns have delayed our efforts to fulfil the vital \npolitical criteria. \n Next week, by voting, the citizens of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina will have an opportunity to participate in \n \n \n35 06-52885 \n \nthe shaping of their future. They deserve election \ncampaigns that look not at the past, but towards the \nfuture. They do not deserve campaigns such as the one \nthat was characterized last week by the EU Council of \nMinisters as a cause for concern and prompted it to \nstress the EU\u2019s commitment to the territorial integrity \nof Bosnia and Herzegovina. \n Bosnia and Herzegovina participates actively in \nregional cooperation, and we participate in all regional \ninitiatives, including the Stability Pact for South \nEastern Europe, the South-East European Cooperation \nProcess, the Adriatic and Ionian Initiative and many \nother programmes and projects. On that basis, a huge \nnumber of bilateral and multilateral agreements were \nsigned, creating an international legal framework for \ncooperation on and the harmonization of a number of \nissues. \n That is especially interesting in the light of the \nKosovo issue. Bosnia and Herzegovina keeps a close \neye on the negotiations. We believe that any solution \nmust be the result of negotiations if both sides are to \naccept it. Any future solution should accommodate a \ncommon future within the Euro-Atlantic environment. \nThe consequences of the final solution, once it is \nfound, must under no circumstances jeopardize the \nstability of the region or that of the neighbouring \nStates. \n I am pleased to inform the Assembly that the \nCouncil of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina is on \nthe path to successfully achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. Those priorities are \ncomplementary with the criteria for European Union \nmembership. In cooperation with the International \nAtomic Energy Agency, Bosnia and Herzegovina is \ndeveloping capacities for the detection and prevention \nof illegal trading in and the proliferation of radioactive \nmaterials throughout our territory. \n As a mine-affected country, Bosnia and \nHerzegovina is quite active in the implementation of \nthe Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, \nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel \nMines and on Their Destruction. It is well known that \nthere is still a significant number of landmines in our \ncountry as a consequence of war. I should like to thank \nall the countries that have contributed to the demining \nprocess in Bosnia and Herzegovina. \n We are also playing an active role in United \nNations programmes that address the issue of \nHIV/AIDS. We have established a State-level \ncommission to fight AIDS. Its current activities focus \non preventing the disease from spreading, establishing \nan early warning system, and informing the public of \nthe dangers of the disease. \n As a young democracy and a country with special \nexperience, Bosnia and Herzegovina supported the \nforming of the Human Rights Council and the \nstrengthening of the role of the Office of the High \nCommissioner for Human Rights. We believe that their \nwork is gaining in importance every day. We strongly \nand decisively support the international system for \nuniversal human rights protection. \n In my country, human rights have been violated \nnot only by war and crises, but also by certain \ndecisions of the international community. One example \nis the problem of decertified police officers. The \ndecisions of the United Nations-led international police \ncaused them to lose their work permits. They were \noffered no opportunity to file complaints or take their \ncases to any type of court review. Our Ministry for \nHuman Rights has prepared, in close cooperation with \nthe Office of the High Representative for the \nImplementation of the Peace Agreement on Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, a possible model for a review process, to \nbe led by the European Union Police Mission in Bosnia \nand Herzegovina, the current representative of the \ninternational police presence in the country. The absurd \nand flagrant violation of human rights committed by \nthe United Nations itself is a mistake that must be \nacknowledged. It can thereby be corrected and the \ncredibility of the United Nations as an institution \npreserved. \n One of the most important international \nobligations of Bosnia and Herzegovina is cooperation \nwith The Hague Tribunal for war crimes. That is \nindeed a precondition for long-term stability. That is \nwhy it was offered to the entire region as a condition of \nfurther progress in Euro-Atlantic terms. According to \nthe data gathered by both domestic and foreign \nintelligence, most wanted war criminals are not hiding \non the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Our \ninstitutions are focused on cutting off the financial \nsupport networks. It is a sad and pitiful fact that \nRadovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic have not yet been \narrested, but it is even worse for Bosnia and \nHerzegovina and its citizens to be punished because of \nthe two of them. We are penalizing the victims instead \nof punishing the criminals. Bosnia and Herzegovina \n  \n \n06-52885 36 \n \nmust be allowed to pursue progress on its road to \ndemocratization and the European Union, because \nimprovement in that regard will create an even stronger \nmechanism for destroying the war criminals\u2019 support \nnetwork. \n The horrible terrorist attacks on New York, the \nanniversary of which we recently marked, changed the \nworld\u2019s entire security paradigm. The attacks made us \nthink in ever more serious terms. Terrorism is one of \nthe greatest challenges faced by the modern world, and \nit is virtually impossible for countries to respond to \nsuch a challenge individually. Member States may \nindividually strengthen their capacities, but a global \nand complete response can be achieved only by the \nUnited Nations. \n Having established the Ministry of Security, an \nintelligence agency and an investigations and \nprotection agency at the State level, and by \ncoordinating their work through the Counter-Terrorism \nTask Force, we have undertaken a series of very \nimportant steps not just in terms of internal reforms, \nbut also in terms of our contribution to the global anti-\nterrorist campaign. We have adopted an anti-terrorism \nstrategy for the period 2006-2009 that will guide us \nthrough the implementation of European standards in \nthat field. We are in the final stages of adopting a new \nlaw on the fight against terrorism and financial support \nfor terrorism. \n Bosnia and Herzegovina wholeheartedly \nsupported the establishment of the Peacebuilding \nCommission, and we genuinely hoped to contribute \nactively to its work. The experience of peacebuilding \nin Bosnia is vast and relevant, and we are eager to \nshare it with other Member States. \n Although our country was not elected, we wish to \nthank all those who supported us through the process. \nAt the very least, we sent yet another signal to the \nworld that we are no longer simply the receivers of \ninternational aid. The support we gained has \nencouraged us to continue to insist on a more balanced \nand more proactive participation in United Nations \nprojects worldwide. In that context, I stress Bosnia and \nHerzegovina\u2019s aspirations as a candidate for non-\npermanent membership of the Security Council for the \nterm 2010-2011, and I would welcome the Assembly\u2019s \nsupport in that regard. \n Despite our limited capacities, we try to \nparticipate in international peace efforts. We have sent \nour military observers and police officers to the Congo, \nEthiopia, Liberia, Haiti, the Sudan, Eritrea and Cyprus. \nAs a sign of our support for the Iraqi people, we have \ndeployed a demining squadron to assist, to the extent \nof its capacities, in building a sustainable and stable \nIraq.  \n The escalation of conflict in the Middle East \nmarked this summer and claimed many victims, \nnumerous civilians among them. We support Security \nCouncil resolution 1701 (2006) calling for a full \ncessation of hostilities. We particularly appreciate the \ndiplomatic efforts of Security Council members, \nincluding the United States and France, that led to the \nfinal harmonization of the resolution. We hope that this \npositive breakthrough will constitute a sound basis for \ndiplomatic efforts in the Middle East and that lasting \npeace will finally be achieved in that region. \n I would also like to call attention to the \nhumanitarian issues that are generally discussed at \nevery session of the General Assembly. In order to \ncontribute to the work of the humanitarian agencies \nand United Nations efforts in general regarding that \nvery important field, Bosnia and Herzegovina has \nsubmitted to the membership a draft declaration \nrelating to basic tenets of humanitarian action in \nemergency situations, contained in document A/60/627. \nThe Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina seeks to \ncontribute to progress in world preparedness for \nemergency situations on the basis of our own lessons \nlearnt. I invite Member States to consider the adoption \nof the draft declaration and to continue to contribute to \nprogress in such important activities globally. \n In conclusion, I thank all members for the \nassistance and support that we received from the \ninternational community in years gone by and to \nexpress my hope that they will use their voices to \nsupport Bosnia and Herzegovina as a candidate for \nnon-permanent Security Council membership. In so \ndoing, they will contribute to Bosnia\u2019s assumption of \nits place in international relations. Furthermore, I wish \nto thank Mr. Kofi Annan, on behalf of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, for his contribution and commitment to \nstability and prosperity in my country. He has \nconfirmed his commitment by visiting us twice. "

        "file_text": "I am pleased to \nconvey to Sheikha Haya Rashed Al Khalifa, on behalf \nof the State of Kuwait, its Government and people, our \nmost sincere congratulations to her personally and to \nher brotherly country, the Kingdom of Bahrain, on her \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-first session. We assure her of our readiness to \ncooperate with her seriously and constructively as she \nassumes her heavy responsibilities. \n I cannot fail to mention here, with great \nappreciation and admiration, the prominent role of the \nSecretary-General in his ongoing efforts at the helm of \nthis Organization to enhance and energize the work of \nits various bodies and to make them more democratic, \ntransparent and capable of meeting the challenges of \nthis century, and more effective in carrying out the \nduties assigned to them in the fields of peace, security \nand development. \n In that context, Kuwait welcomes the Republic of \nMontenegro as a new Member of the United Nations. \n In the Outcome Document of the 2005 World \nSummit, our leaders expressed their firm belief and \nconviction in the important role of this Organization as \nan umbrella for multilateral work. They drew a road \nmap for us to follow as we seek solutions to the major \ninternational threats and challenges that threaten \ninternational peace and security, such as terrorism, the \ndeterioration of the environment, human rights \nviolations, poverty, hunger and the spread of such \ndangerous and infectious diseases as AIDS and \nmalaria. \n Of great concern is the emergence of new \nchallenges to international peace and security that are \nno less dangerous than those aforementioned, such as \nthe incitement of hatred, xenophobia, insults to \nreligions, including Islamophobia, together with all \nkinds of racial, ethnic and religious discrimination. \n A year after the adoption of the Outcome \nDocument, and despite the extensive efforts made to \nfollow-up the implementation of the Summit\u2019s \nresolutions, there is still an urgent need to redouble the \nefforts to achieve our objectives in the fields of \ndisarmament, non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, \ncounter-terrorism, setting a balance between developed \nand developing countries in international trade, and \nreform of the Security Council to enhance its authority \nand efficiency and give greater transparency and \nfairness to its decisions by according due consideration \nto the representation of the small States that make up \nmore than half the membership of the United Nations. \n The State of Kuwait hopes that efforts will be \nenhanced to promote dialogue and advance \ninternational coordination and cooperation to overcome \nthe problems that impede the achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals in various regions of \nthe world. Kuwait will maintain its course in adhering \nto the provisions, principles and purposes of \ninternational agreements and conventions. \n While we take pride in the social, economic and \npolitical development that has been achieved in \nKuwait, as reflected in the annual international reports \nissued by the specialized agencies of the United \nNations, we will not be distracted from pursuing our \nefforts to further improve the social and economic \nconditions that favour the Kuwaiti citizen\u2019s standard of \nliving and prosperity. In that context, Kuwait will \ncontinue to support, within its means, the efforts of \nmany developing countries to achieve their \ndevelopment goals. It will continue to do so through \nthe Kuwaiti Fund for Economic Development, which \nfinances infrastructure projects by granting soft loans, \nwhich to date amount to $12 billion and have benefited \nmore than 100 countries around the world.  \n Kuwait also contributes to the funding of \ndevelopment projects in developing countries through \n  \n \n06-52885 42 \n \nUnited Nations programmes and specialized agencies, \nand regional organizations and associations. Within the \nframework of supporting international efforts to \neradicate poverty, Kuwait announced last month that it \nwill provide $300 million to the Islamic Development \nBank to combat poverty in Africa. \n Kuwait follows with grave concern the difficult \nsecurity conditions in brotherly Iraq resulting from \nongoing terrorist acts that target the Iraqi people, State \ninstitutions and economic and social facilities. Despite \nprogress in the political process that has led to the \nformation of a constitutionally elected Government, the \ndifficult security conditions impede similar progress in \nrebuilding what the previous regime destroyed as a \nresult of its hostile policies towards its own people and \nits neighbours. \n Kuwait reiterates its commitment to all relevant \nSecurity Council resolutions and vows to continue \nsupporting the efforts of the Iraqi Government to \npromote democracy and respect for human rights, to \nrebuild, confront security problems and achieve \nnational harmony between the various segments of the \nIraqi people. We hope that the international community \nwill also redouble its efforts in support of the efforts of \nthe Iraqi Government and the League of Arab States to \nachieve security and stability in Iraq, which in turn will \ncontribute to consolidating peace and security in the \nregion. There is no doubt that a democratic, secure, \nstable and economically prosperous Iraq that respects \nhuman rights, is a master over its own decisions, \nwithout any interference in its internal affairs, and lives \nin peace with its neighbours will be in the interest of \nall the States of the region without exception. That is \nwhat Kuwait hopes for and seeks to achieve. \n At the regional level, with regard to the issue of \nthe three disputed Emirati islands, Kuwait supports the \nposition of the Arab Gulf Cooperation Council and \nhopes that negotiations will resume and intensify at all \nlevels between the brotherly United Arab Emirates and \nthe friendly Islamic Republic of Iran to find a solution \nto that conflict in conformity with the principles and \nrules of international law and good-neighbourly \nrelations, which would enhance the security and \nstability of the region. \n Concerning the Iranian nuclear issue, Kuwait \ncalls on all the concerned parties to spare the region \nany crisis that could undermine the security and \nstability of that vital region, which for the past two \ndecades has been the theatre of conflicts and wars that \nhave squandered the fortunes and resources of its \ncountries and delayed their development. We therefore \nhope that action will be taken to resolve the crisis by \ndiplomatic means. We urge the Islamic Republic of \nIran to continue its cooperation with the International \nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the international \ncommunity in order to dispel any fears or doubts \nsurrounding the nature and aims of its nuclear \nprogramme. \n In that context, we affirm our position on the \nneed to make the Middle East, including the Gulf \nregion, an area free from all weapons of mass \ndestruction. That zone must include Israel, which must \naccede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons and subject all its nuclear facilities to \nthe safeguards regime of the IAEA. \n In recent weeks, the brotherly Republic of \nLebanon was subject to a vicious Israeli aggression \nthat killed hundreds of innocent civilians, injured \nthousands of others, and made more than 1 million \npeople refugees. Kuwait immediately and very strongly \ncondemned those shameful and inhumane crimes \nagainst the brotherly people of Lebanon. Proceeding \nfrom its sense of duty and responsibility, and driven by \nclose brotherly relations, the Government and people \nof Kuwait organized emergency relief operations to \nalleviate the suffering of the Lebanese people through \nthe Kuwaiti Red Crescent society, other associations \nand the private sector. Kuwait also announced the \ndonation of $324 million to the efforts to rebuild \nLebanon. \n While Kuwait welcomes the measures taken by \nthe international community to implement Security \nCouncil resolution 1701 (2006), it calls on Israel to \ncease its repeated aggressions against Lebanon and to \nrespect its sovereignty, independence and territorial \nintegrity. Kuwait also calls on the international \ncommunity to assist the Lebanese Government to \nextend its control over all Lebanese territory and to \nsupport its endeavours to recover all of its rights, \nincluding compensation for its losses as a result of the \nIsraeli aggression. \n The core of the Middle East crisis is the \nPalestinian question. That issue, regrettably, remains \nstalled. International endeavours and efforts to move it \nforward are met with Israel\u2019s intransigence and refusal \nto implement international resolutions, as well as its \n \n \n43 06-52885 \n \ndisregard for international conventions and the \nagreements it has signed with the concerned parties \nwithin the framework of the peace process. \n The continued Israeli occupation of Arab \nterritories will always be a source of tension and \ninstability in the Middle East. Israel\u2019s repeated military \nincursions in the occupied territories, oppressive \npractices against the Palestinian people, and \nundermining of the Palestinian Authority will not \nbenefit the Israeli Government, nor will its continued \naggression and deliberate destruction of Palestinian \ninfrastructure and national Palestinian institutions \nsecure its so-called security. The solution lies in \nresolving the root causes of the problem and by \nrestoring usurped rights so that all the peoples of the \nregion can enjoy peace and stability. \n In that context, we renew our full support for the \nstruggle of the Palestinian people to recover its lawful \npolitical rights and establish its own independent State \nover its own land with Jerusalem as its capital. We \ndemand that the Israeli Government withdraw from all \nthe Arab lands it occupies, including the Syrian Golan \nHeights, in implementation of relevant Security \nCouncil resolutions and the principle of land for peace. \nIn that respect, we reiterate the importance of the Arab \npeace initiative adopted in Beirut in 2002 as the only \nstrategic option for achieving a permanent, just and \ncomprehensive peace in the region. \n Since its founding, the United Nations has \nregistered numerous accomplishments and \ndemonstrated its efficacy in establishing peace and \nsecurity in various parts of the world. It has helped \nprevent many problems from deteriorating and it has \nthereby become an indispensable tool of the \ninternational community in confronting global issues \nand challenges. It is our hope that the United Nations \nrecord of accomplishment in achieving peace and \nsecurity will soon include Iraq, the Middle East, the \nSudan, Somalia, Afghanistan and other countries that \nare still experiencing conflicts and wars that have \nkilled countless numbers of their citizens, depleted \ntheir resources, destroyed their capacities and delayed \ntheir march towards development and progress.

        "file_text": "I should like at the outset to \ncongratulate Ms. Al-Khalifa on her well-deserved \nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \nits sixty first session. I am confident that, given her \nwisdom and experience, she will steer the proceedings \nof the Assembly successfully. I also express our \nprofound appreciation to her predecessor, His \nExcellency Mr. Jan Eliasson of Sweden, for his \nexcellent work during the sixtieth session. \n In the same vein, we salute the Secretary-\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, for his \ndedication and commitment to the work of the United \nNations. My delegation would like to pay him special \ntribute for his distinguished leadership and remarkable \ncontribution to the United Nations, taking into \nconsideration his imminent departure at the end of a \nlong, dedicated and brilliant career in the service of our \nOrganization. Under his leadership, the United Nations \nhas recorded significant achievements. He ably laid the \nfoundation for Member States to make further \nprogress, especially with regard to the reform of the \nUnited Nations. We will carry on with this task, \nbearing in mind his vision of sustained global \ncooperation among States. Allow me to wish him the \nvery best in his future engagements. \n We are gathered here to reaffirm our faith in the \nUnited Nations and to recommit ourselves to the \npurposes and principles of the Charter. Today, the \nworld needs a stronger United Nations and effective \nmultilateralism that reflects current realities. Only thus \nwill humanity be able to respond in a timely manner \nand without hesitation to the global challenges that we \nface. \n We fully support the comprehensive reform of the \nUnited Nations as proposed by the Secretary-General. \nThe reforms should aim at strengthening the \nOrganization and making it more efficient, effective \nand responsive to the needs of all its Members. We \nfurther attach great importance to strengthening the \nrole and authority of the General Assembly as the main \ndeliberative and policy-making body, whose \nrelationship with other principal organs should be \nplaced in a fitting context so as to ensure cooperation \nand respect for their roles as provided for in the \nCharter. \n My Government believes that the reform of the \nSecurity Council, including its expansion, is essential. \nThe African continent deserves to be fairly and \nequitably represented in the Council. That is not too \nmuch to ask. \n During the World Summit in September last year, \nwe reaffirmed our commitment to the Millennium \nDeclaration (resolution 55/2), adopted more than six \nyears ago. The Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1) \nreiterated our commitments to the implementation of \nthe decisions made during previous conferences and \nsummits. My Government appreciates the work done \nunder the guidance and able leadership of former \nPresident Eliasson in the realization of the Summit \ndecisions. \n  \n \n06-52885 18 \n \n The fruits of those efforts are visible to us all, as \nthey culminated in the inauguration of the \nPeacebuilding Commission, the creation of the Human \nRights Council, the creation of the Central Emergency \nResponse Fund and the establishment of the Ethics \nOffice. We also welcome the accomplishments in the \narea of management reform. People around the world \nhave high hopes that these newly created instruments \nwill achieve the specific mandates set for them. We \ntherefore encourage all Member States to continue, in \nan open and transparent manner, to finalize the review \nof the process. \n Namibia attaches importance to the global \ndevelopment agenda. Thus we are concerned about the \nslow pace at which this essential matter is being \nhandled and about the lack of adherence to the \ncommitments in line with the Millennium Declaration. \nIn this regard, I urge all fellow leaders to stand \ntogether in finding effective solutions to push back the \never-encroaching frontiers of poverty, hunger, disease \nand ignorance. \n The African people know that they must take a \nlead in resolving problems and challenges on the \ncontinent. In those endeavours, they need to form \neffective partnerships with the international \ncommunity. I therefore welcome the commitments \nmade by the Group and Eight last year in Scotland to \nconsider increasing development aid to Africa, to \ncancel the debt owed by the poorest countries and to \npromote universal access to antiretroviral drugs for \nHIV/AIDS by the year 2010. \n We reiterate our call for cooperation among the \nUnited Nations, its specialized agencies and the \nAfrican Union and its subregional organizations \ndealing with economic and social development on the \ncontinent. We continue to emphasize the importance of \nthe Economic and Social Council as a central \nintergovernmental body for promoting a more \nintegrated approach to global peace and development. \n Namibia welcomes the presidential and \nparliamentary elections recently held in the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo, which, most international \nobservers agree, were conducted in a peaceful and \ntransparent atmosphere. We urge the United Nations \nand the international community at large to continue to \nsupport the people of the Democratic Republic during \nthis crucial democratic transition. \n The situation in the Darfur region of the Sudan is \ncause for serious concern. The African Union, through \nthe African Union Mission in Sudan and with the \nassistance of the international community, has made \nefforts to bring peace to that region under \nexceptionally hard conditions. We commend the \nAfrican Union Special Envoy, Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim, \nfor his tireless efforts in bringing the parties to an \nagreement. We urge all the parties to respect their \ncommitments.  \n We welcome the visit to the Sudan by the United \nNations Security Council team in June this year and the \nrecommendations they made. Namibia looks forward to \nan urgent and smooth transition from the African \nUnion Mission to a United Nations peacekeeping \nmission in Darfur in accordance with Security Council \nresolution 1706 (2006). We urge the Government of the \nSudan and other parties concerned to accept this \ntransition, which we believe will be in the best interest \nof the people of the Sudan in general and those of the \nDarfur region in particular. \n I would like to join other countries around the \nworld in expressing our concern about the illicit trade \nin small arms and light weapons, which remains a \nmenace to humanity. The proliferation of such weapons \ncompromises peace and security. They also pose \nserious challenges to law enforcement agencies around \nthe world. \n We are concerned that the question of Western \nSahara remains unresolved. The inalienable rights of \nthe people of Western Sahara to self-determination and \nindependence must be upheld and respected, as \nstipulated in the relevant United Nations resolutions. \nWe therefore call for the urgent implementation of all \nrelevant Security Council and General Assembly \nresolutions, with the aim of holding a free and fair \nreferendum in Western Sahara. \n Namibia is also deeply concerned about the \nongoing suffering of the people of Palestine. We wish \nto reaffirm our full and unequivocal support for the \ninalienable rights of the Palestinian people to self-\ndetermination and national independence. In this \ncontext, we appeal to the United Nations to assume its \nfull responsibility by implementing all its resolutions \nand decisions on Palestine, with immediate effect and \nwithout precondition. \n Sadly, the people of Lebanon have once again \nbeen subjected to war and indiscriminate bombing, \n \n \n19 06-52885 \n \nwhich have caused enormous suffering and the deaths \nof innocent people, including children and the elderly, \nas well as severe damage to and destruction of property \nand infrastructure. Against that background, we call for \nthe immediate and unconditional implementation of \nSecurity Council resolution 1701 (2006) and appeal to \nthe international community to provide humanitarian \nassistance to the people of Lebanon in dealing with the \nresulting humanitarian crisis. \n For many years now, the majority of Member \nStates in this Assembly have expressed concern over \nthe continuous economic, commercial and financial \nembargo against Cuba, which continues to cause severe \nhardships for the Cuban people. The Government of \nthe Republic of Namibia upholds the principles of \npeaceful coexistence of nations and fair and open trade \namong nations. Thus, we call on all Member States, in \nconformity with their obligations under the Charter of \nthe United Nations, for an immediate and \nunconditional lifting of the embargo against the \nRepublic of Cuba, as called for in General Assembly \nresolution 60/12 and many previous resolutions. \n In June 2006, the General Assembly convened a \nHigh-level Meeting on the implementation of the \nDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS. That \nMeeting served as an important opportunity for \nMember States to assess progress and further \nstrengthen and expand responses to the HIV/AIDS \npandemic. Before the High-level Meeting, the African \nUnion had adopted an African Common Position at a \nspecial session in Abuja in May 2006. Namibia is fully \ncommitted to the implementation of the Declaration of \nCommitment on HIV/AIDS. We are, equally, grateful \nfor the support for the call to mobilize resources and to \nforge a stronger partnership in confronting the \npandemic. We stress the need for universal and \naffordable access to comprehensive service packages \nfor all those infected. \n In our ongoing efforts to reform and strengthen \nthe United Nations, making it more effective and \nresponsive to today\u2019s challenges \u2014 poverty and \nhunger, the HIV/AIDS pandemic, civil wars and the \nwar on terror \u2014 we should place human lives and \nhuman dignity at the centre of all our efforts. The \nreform we have embarked upon should be seen as a \nprocess and should be undertaken in a spirit of mutual \nunderstanding and with a sense of collective \nownership. Let us strive to re-energize the United \nNations and make it an Organization that we can all be \nproud of, so that we can make planet Earth a common \nhome for all humanity to live in peace, stability and \nprosperity.

        "file_text": "I praise the merciful, \nall-knowing and almighty God for blessing me with \nanother opportunity to address this Assembly on behalf \nof the great nation of Iran and to bring a number of \nissues to the attention of the international community. I \nalso praise the Almighty for the increasing vigilance of \npeoples across the globe, their courageous presence in \ndifferent international settings, and the brave \nexpression of their views and aspirations regarding \nglobal issues. \n Today, humanity passionately craves commitment \nto the truth, devotion to God, the quest for justice and \nrespect for the dignity of human beings. Rejection of \ndomination and aggression, defence of the oppressed, \nand longing for peace constitute the legitimate demand \nof the peoples of the world, particularly the new \ngenerations and the spirited youth who aspire to a \nworld free from decadence, aggression and injustice, \nreplete with love and compassion. The youth have a \nright to seek justice and the truth. They have a right to \nbuild their own future on the foundations of love, \ncompassion and tranquillity. I praise the Almighty for \nthis immense blessing. \n What afflicts humanity today is certainly not \ncompatible with human dignity. The Almighty has not \ncreated human beings so that they could transgress \nagainst others and oppress them. By causing war and \nconflict, some are quickly expanding their domination, \naccumulating greater wealth and usurping all the \nresources, while others endure poverty, suffering and \nmisery as a result. \n Some seek to rule the world relying on weapons \nand threats, while others live in perpetual insecurity \nand danger. Some occupy the homeland of others, \nthousands of kilometres away from their borders, \ninterfere in their affairs and control their oil and other \nresources and strategic routes, while others are \nbombarded daily in their own homes, their children \nmurdered in the streets and alleys of their own country, \nand their homes reduced to rubble. \n Such behaviour is not worthy of human beings \nand runs counter to the truth, to justice and to human \ndignity. The fundamental question is this: under such \nconditions, where should the oppressed seek justice? \nWho, or what organization, defends the rights of the \noppressed and suppresses acts of aggression and \noppression? Where is the seat of global justice? \n A brief glance at a few examples of the most \npressing global issues further illustrates the problem. \nThe first is the unbridled expansion of nuclear, \nchemical and biological weapons. Some Powers have \nproudly announced the production of second- and \nthird-generation nuclear weapons. What do they need \nthose weapons for? Is the development and stockpiling \nof such deadly weapons designed to promote peace and \ndemocracy? Or, are the weapons actually instruments \nof coercion and threat directed against other peoples \nand Governments? \n How long should the people of the world have to \nlive with the nightmare of nuclear, biological and \nchemical weapons? What binds the Powers that \nproduce and possess those weapons? How can they be \nheld accountable by the international community? \nFurthermore, are the inhabitants of those countries \ncontent with wasting their wealth and resources on the \nproduction of such destructive arsenals? Is it not \npossible to rely on justice, ethics and wisdom instead \nof on such instruments of death? Are not wisdom and \njustice more compatible with peace and tranquillity \n \n \n37 06-52737 \n \nthan nuclear, chemical and biological weapons? If \nwisdom, ethics and justice prevail, then oppression and \naggression will be uprooted, threats will wither away \nand no reason will remain for conflict. \n This is a solid proposition, because most global \nconflicts result from injustice and from the fact that the \npowerful are not content with their own rights, but \nwant to deny the rights of others. \n People across the globe embrace justice and are \nwilling to make sacrifices for its sake. Would it not be \neasier for the global Powers to ensure their longevity \nand win hearts and minds through the championing and \nreal promotion of justice, compassion and peace, rather \nthan by continuing the proliferation of nuclear and \nchemical weapons and threatening their use? \n We have experienced the threat and the use of \nnuclear weapons. Has it achieved anything for the \nperpetrators other than the exacerbation of tension, \nhatred and animosity among nations? \n The second issue is the occupation of countries \nand the exacerbation of hostilities. The occupation of \nIraq has continued for the past three years. Not a day \ngoes by without hundreds of people being killed in \ncold blood. The occupiers are incapable of establishing \nsecurity in Iraq. Despite the establishment of a lawful \nGovernment and the National Assembly of Iraq, covert \nand overt efforts are being made to heighten insecurity, \nmagnify and aggravate differences within Iraqi society \nand instigate civil strife. \n There is no sign that the occupiers have the \nnecessary political will to eliminate the sources of \ninstability. Numerous terrorists were apprehended by \nthe Government of Iraq, only to be let loose under \nvarious pretexts by the occupiers. It seems that the \nintensification of hostilities and terrorism serves as a \npretext for the continued presence of foreign forces in \nIraq. \n Where can the people of Iraq seek refuge, and \nfrom whom should the Government of Iraq seek \njustice? Who can ensure Iraq\u2019s security? Insecurity in \nIraq affects the entire region. Can the Security Council \nplay a role in restoring peace and security in Iraq when \nthe occupiers are themselves permanent members of \nthe Council? Is the Security Council capable of making \na fair decision in this regard? \n Let us consider the situation in Palestine. The \nroots of the Palestinian problem go back to the Second \nWorld War. Under the pretext of protecting some of the \nsurvivors of that war, the land of Palestine was \noccupied through war and aggression, resulting in the \ndisplacement of millions of its inhabitants. It was \nplaced under the control of some of the survivors of the \nwar, who brought even larger population groups from \nelsewhere in the world who had not even been affected \nby the Second World War. A Government was \nestablished in the territory of others with a population \ncollected from throughout the world at the cost of \ndriving millions of the rightful inhabitants of the land \ninto diaspora and homelessness. \n That is a great tragedy with hardly any precedent \nin history. Refugees continue to live in temporary \nrefugee camps, and many have died while still hoping \none day to return to their land. Can any logic, law or \nlegal reasoning justify this tragedy? Would any \nMember of the United Nations accept such a tragedy if \nit occurred in its own homeland? \n The pretexts for the creation of the regime \noccupying Al-Quds al-Sharif are so weak that its \nsupporters want to silence any voice that tries merely \nto speak about them, as they are concerned that \nshedding light on the facts would undermine the raison \nd\u2019\u00eatre of the regime \u2014 as, indeed, it has done. The \ntragedy did not end with the establishment of a regime \non the territory of others. Regrettably, from its \ninception, that regime has been a constant source of \nthreat and insecurity in the Middle East region \u2014 \nwaging war, spilling blood and impeding the progress \nof countries in the region. It has also been used by \nsome Powers as an instrument of division, coercion \nand pressure on the people of the region. \n Reference to those historical realities may cause \nsome disquiet among supporters of that regime. But \nthese are simple facts, not myths. History has unfolded \nbefore our eyes. Worse still is the unwarranted blanket \nsupport provided to the regime. We need only watch \nwhat is happening in the Palestinian land. People are \nbeing bombarded in their own homes and their children \nmurdered in their own streets and alleys. But no \nauthority, not even the Security Council, can afford \nthem any support or protection. Why? \n Meanwhile, a Government has been formed \ndemocratically and through the free choice of the \nelectorate in a part of the Palestinian territory. But \ninstead of receiving the support of the so-called \nchampions of democracy, its ministers and members of \n  \n \n06-52737 38 \n \nparliament have been illegally abducted and \nincarcerated in full view of the international \ncommunity. \n What council or international organization is \nstanding up to protect this brutally besieged \nGovernment? Why cannot the Security Council take \nany steps? \n I should like now to address the issue of \nLebanon. For 33 long days, the Lebanese lived under a \nbarrage of fire and bombs, and close to 1.5 million of \nthem were displaced. Meanwhile, some members of the \nSecurity Council practically chose a path that provided \nample opportunity for the aggressor to achieve its \nobjectives militarily. We saw the Security Council \npractically incapacitated by certain Powers so that it \ncould not even call for a ceasefire. The Security \nCouncil sat idly by for many days, witnessing cruel \nscenes of atrocities against the Lebanese, while \ntragedies such as the one that occurred at Qana were \npersistently repeated. Why? \n In all of these cases, the answer is self-evident. \nWhen the Power behind the hostilities is itself a \npermanent member of the Security Council, how can \nthe Council fulfil its responsibilities? \n The third issue is lack of respect for the rights of \nmembers of the international community. \n I now wish to speak about some of the grievances \nof the Iranian people and about the injustices against \nthem. \n The Islamic Republic of Iran is a member of the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and is \ncommitted to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons (NPT). All our nuclear activities are \ntransparent and peaceful and are under the watchful \neyes of IAEA inspectors. Why then are there objections \nto our legally recognized rights? Which Governments \nobject to those rights? Governments that themselves \nbenefit from nuclear energy and the fuel cycle. Some \nof them have abused nuclear technology for non-\npeaceful ends, including the production of nuclear \nbombs, and some even have a bleak record of using \nthem against humanity. \n Which organization or council should address \nthose injustices? Is the Security Council in a position \nto address them? Can it stop violations of the \ninalienable rights of countries? Can it prevent certain \nPowers from impeding the scientific progress of other \ncountries? The abuse of the Security Council, as an \ninstrument of threat and coercion, is indeed a source of \ngrave concern. Some permanent members of the \nSecurity Council, even when they are themselves \nparties to international disputes, conveniently threaten \nothers with the Security Council and, even before any \ndecision by the Council, proclaim the Council\u2019s \ncondemnation of their opponents. \n The question is: what can justify such \nexploitation of the Security Council, and do not such \nacts erode its credibility and effectiveness? Can such \nbehaviour strengthen the ability of the Council to \nmaintain security? \n A review of recent historical realities would lead \nto the regrettable conclusion that justice has become a \nvictim of force and aggression. Many global \narrangements have become unjust, discriminatory and \nirresponsible as a result of undue pressure from some \nof the powerful nations. Threats to use nuclear \nweapons and other instruments of war, by some powers \nhave taken the place of respect for the rights of nations \nand the maintenance and promotion of peace and \ntranquillity. \n For some Powers, claims of promoting human \nrights and democracy can last only as long as the \nclaims can be used as instruments of pressure and \nintimidation against other nations. But when it comes \nto the interests of the claimants, concepts such as \ndemocracy, the right of self-determination of nations, \nrespect for the rights and intelligence of peoples, and \ninternational law and justice have no place or value. \nThat is blatantly manifested in the way in which the \nelected Government of the Palestinian people is \ntreated, as well as in the support extended to the \nZionist regime. It does not matter if people are \nmurdered in Palestine, turned into refugees, captured, \nimprisoned or besieged; that, apparently, does not \nviolate human rights. \n Nations are not equal in exercising their rights as \nrecognized by international law. Enjoying those rights \nis dependent on the whim of certain major Powers. \nApparently, the Security Council can only be used to \nensure the security and the rights of some big Powers. \nBut when the oppressed are being bombarded and \ndecimated, the Security Council must remain aloof and \nnot even call for a ceasefire. Is this not a tragedy of \nhistoric proportions for the Security Council, which is \ncharged with maintaining the security of countries? \n \n \n39 06-52737 \n \n The prevailing order of contemporary global \ninteractions is such that certain Powers equate \nthemselves with the international community and \nconsider that their decisions supersede those of over \n180 other countries. They consider themselves to be \nthe masters and rulers of the entire world and give \nother nations a mere second-class ranking in the world \norder. \n The question needs to be asked: if the \nGovernments of the United States or the United \nKingdom, countries which are permanent members of \nthe Security Council, commit aggression, occupation \nand violation of international law, which of the United \nNations organs can call them to account? Can a \nCouncil in which they are privileged members address \ntheir violations? Has that ever happened? In fact, we \nhave repeatedly seen the reverse. If they have a \ndifference with a nation or State, they bring the matter \nto the Security Council as claimants, then \nsimultaneously arrogate to themselves the roles of \nprosecutor, judge and executioner. Is that a just order? \nCan there be a more vivid case of discrimination and \nmore clear evidence of injustice? \n Regrettably, the persistence of some hegemonic \nPowers in imposing their exclusionist policies on the \ninternational decision-making mechanisms, including \nthe Security Council, has resulted in a growing mistrust \non the part of world public opinion that is undermining \nthe credibility and effectiveness of the most universal \nsystem of collective security. How long can such a \nsituation last in the world? It is evident that the \nbehaviour of some Powers constitutes the greatest \nchallenge before the Security Council, the entire \nOrganization and its affiliated agencies. \n The present structure and working methods of the \nSecurity Council, which are legacies of the Second \nWorld War, are not responsive to the expectations of \nthe current generation and the contemporary needs of \nhumanity. Today, it is undeniable that the Security \nCouncil, most critically and urgently, requires \nlegitimacy and effectiveness. It must be acknowledged \nthat as long as the Council is unable to act on behalf of \nthe entire international community in a transparent, just \nand democratic manner, it will be neither legitimate \nnor effective. Furthermore, the direct relationship \nbetween abuse of the veto power and erosion of the \nlegitimacy and effectiveness of the Council has now \nbeen clearly and undeniably established. We cannot \nand should not expect the eradication, or even the \ncontainment, of injustice, imposition and oppression \nwithout reforming the structure and working methods \nof the Council. \n Is it appropriate to expect this generation to \nsubmit to decisions and arrangements established over \nhalf a century ago? Does not this generation or future \ngenerations have the right to make their own decisions \nabout the world in which they want to live? \n Today, genuine reform in the structure and \nworking methods of the Security Council is more \nnecessary than ever. Justice and democracy dictate that \nthe role of the General Assembly, as the highest organ \nof the United Nations, must be respected. The General \nAssembly can then, through appropriate mechanisms, \ntake on the task of reforming the Organization and, in \nparticular, rescue the Security Council from its current \nstate. In the interim, the Non-Aligned Movement, the \nOrganization of the Islamic Conference and the African \ncontinent should each have permanent-member status \nin the Security Council, with veto privilege. The \nresulting balance would hopefully prevent further \ntrampling of the rights of nations. \n It is essential that spirituality and ethics find their \nrightful place in international relations. Without ethics \nand spirituality, attained in the light of the teachings of \nthe divine prophets, justice, freedom and human rights \ncannot be guaranteed. The resolution of contemporary \nhuman crises lies in observing ethics and spirituality \nand in the governance of righteous people of high \ncompetence and piety. Should respect for the rights of \nhuman beings become the predominant objective, then \ninjustice, ill temper, aggression and war will fade \naway. \n Human beings are all God\u2019s creatures and are all \nendowed with dignity and respect. No one has \nsuperiority over others. No individual or State can \narrogate to themselves special privileges; nor can they \ndisregard the rights of others or position themselves, \nthrough influence and pressure, as the \u201cinternational \ncommunity\u201d. \n Citizens of Asia, Africa, Europe and America are \nall equal. Over six billion inhabitants of the Earth are \nall equal and worthy of respect. Justice and the \nprotection of human dignity are the two pillars in \nmaintaining sustainable peace, security and tranquillity \nin the world. \n  \n \n06-52737 40 \n \n It is for this reason that we state that sustainable \npeace and tranquillity in the world can only be attained \nthrough justice, spirituality, ethics, compassion and \nrespect for human dignity. All nations and States are \nentitled to peace, progress and security. We are all \nmembers of the international community, and we are \nall entitled to insist on the creation of a climate of \ncompassion, love and justice. \n All Members of the United Nations are affected \nby both the bitter and sweet events and developments \nin today\u2019s world. We can adopt firm and logical \ndecisions, thereby improving the prospects for a better \nlife for current and future generations. Together, we \ncan eradicate the roots of bitter maladies and \nafflictions, and instead, through the promotion of \nuniversal and lasting values, such as ethics, spirituality \nand justice, allow our nations to taste the sweetness of \na better future. \n Peoples, driven by their divine nature, \nintrinsically seek good, virtue, perfection and beauty. \nRelying on our peoples, we can take giant steps \ntowards reform and pave the road to human perfection. \nWhether we like it or not, justice, peace and virtue will \nsooner or later prevail in the world with the will of \nAlmighty God. It is imperative, and also desirable, that \nwe, too, contribute to the promotion of justice and \nvirtue. \n The Almighty and Merciful God, who is the \nCreator of the Universe, is also its Lord and Ruler. \nJustice is His command. He commands His creatures to \nsupport one another in good, virtue and piety, and not \nin decadence or corruption. He commands His \ncreatures to enjoin one another to righteousness and \nvirtue and not to sin or transgression. All divine \nprophets, from the Prophet Adam (peace be upon him) \nto the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him), to the \nProphet Jesus Christ (peace be upon him), to the \nProphet Mohammad (peace be upon him), have all \ncalled humanity to monotheism, justice, brotherhood, \nlove and compassion. Is it not possible to build a better \nworld based on monotheism, justice, love and respect \nfor the rights of human beings, and thereby transform \nanimosities into friendship? \n I emphatically declare that today\u2019s world, more \nthan ever before, longs for just and righteous people \nwith love for all humanity; and above all, it longs for \nthe perfect righteous human being and the real saviour \nwho has been promised to all peoples and who will \nestablish justice, peace and brotherhood on the planet. \n O, Almighty God, all men and women are Your \ncreatures, and You have ordained their guidance and \nsalvation. Bestow upon humanity that thirsts for justice \nthe perfect human being promised to all by You, and \nmake us among his followers and among those who \nstrive for his return and his cause. "

        "file_text": "Senegal and \nthe Kingdom of Bahrain have had cordial relations of \nfriendship, which have been enhanced and \nstrengthened by reciprocal confidence and esteem. I am \ntherefore pleased that Ms. Haya Rashed al-Khalifa is \npresiding over the General Assembly at its sixty-first \nsession, during a key time in the history of our \norganization. Her election was an act of faith in the \nideals of the United Nations and a message of hope for \npeoples who dream of a fairer, more equitable and \nmore welcoming world for all. I offer her my warmest \ncongratulations and assure her of the full cooperation \nof the Senegalese delegation as she carries out her high \nresponsibilities in the service of the international \ncommunity.  \n I would also like to convey to the Secretary-\nGeneral a fraternal message of my greatest \nappreciation and gratitude for the ability and \neffectiveness with which he has always acted, enabling \nour Organization to better adapt to the requirements of \nthe new millennium. At a time when he is preparing to \nleave his high post after 10 years of loyal and good \nservice, it is with a sincere sense of pride that I say to \nhim as an African compatriot, \u201cMr. Secretary-General, \nmission accomplished\u201d.  \n Last year, in this very Hall, we renewed our \ncommitment to meet the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) by 2015. To be sure, since that time, \nsome praiseworthy initiatives have occurred along the \nway, especially with measures to erase the multilateral \ndebt of 18 least developed countries (LDCs) and to \nestablish a levy on air tickets as a source of financing \nfor development. I salute the efforts made by President \nJacques Chirac of France and by President Luiz In\u00e1cio \nLula da Silva of Brazil for their promotion of this \ninnovative mechanism to mobilize resources.  \n The problem of debt, however, in particular the \ndebt of our continent, remains a hindrance to our \ndevelopment. In reality, the first question we should be \nasking ourselves, and which we do ask in Africa, \n \n \n5 06-53005 \n \nregards the evaluation of the debt: to take a look at the \noverindebtedness of Africa, to see exactly how much \nwe owe, because it turns out that some countries are \npaying more than they owe. This is why I have long \nbeen advocating an x-ray of African debt to see how \nour countries have ended up in a situation whereby \nthey devote much of their export earnings to paying off \ndebt, contracted sometimes in dubious circumstances, \nto the detriment of their economic and social \ndevelopment programmes. The vicious circle of debt, \ncompounded by unfair imbalances in international \ntrade owing to agricultural subsidies in wealthy \nindustrialized countries, has been particularly harmful \nfor our farmers.  \n The failure of the agriculture negotiations in the \nDoha round, which is still fresh in our memory, shows \nhow far we have yet to go in order to ensure respect by \nall for the rules of the game, so that world trade can be \nequally profitable for the giants of agro-business as for \nthe small-scale cotton growers of Senegal, Benin, \nBurkina Faso and Mali, or for the small-scale coffee \nplanters from Uganda, Ghana and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. We \nsay yes to free trade, but it must be fair and equitable. \n The dizzying increase in the price of oil and its \nby-products since 2003 constitutes a new source of \nconcern for non-producer countries. If the current trend \ncontinues, many countries will see their years of \neconomic and social development efforts wiped out by \nthe cost of oil. It will then be pointless to expound on \nthe Millennium Development Goals on schooling, \nuniversal health care, access to drinking water for all, \nthe fight against unemployment and the eradication of \npoverty.  \n In Africa, we have decided to take up the \nchallenge by gathering together, on the initiative of \nSenegal, in the Association of Non-Oil Producing \nAfrican Countries, in order to promote the \ndevelopment of bio-fuels. This green version of the \nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries \n(OPEC) has already been launched. With its vast \ncultivatable lands and enormous fresh water resources, \nAfrica has, without a doubt, incomparable advantages \nin this sphere, and could even aspire to become the \nworld\u2019s premier bio-fuel producer.  \n I would call upon all interested parties to join \nwith us in this new green energy revolution, especially \nsince it respects our environment and is in perfect \nharmony with the objectives of the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change and its \nKyoto Protocol. Let us be optimistic in thinking that \nour planet will be a healthier place in the interest of all \npeoples, thanks to a civilization based on clean energy.  \n Turning to the situation in Africa, Senegal \nwelcomes the progress made in democracy on the \ncontinent, as well as the significant progress achieved \nin the peaceful settlement of disputes. Such positive \ndevelopments, however, have been thwarted by the \npersistence of some hotbeds of tension. In the Sudan, \nwe hope and work for the expansion of the camp of \npeace, so that those protagonists who have thus far \nbeen left out of the peace process can sign the Abuja \nAgreement for a settlement of the Darfur crisis.  \n Yesterday, here in New York, the Peace and \nSecurity Council of the African Union addressed the \nissue of Darfur and emphasized that Africa must offer \nmore efforts, more sacrifices and more commitment, \nbut that it can find a solution only within the \nframework of close cooperation with the United \nNations, for which it must indicate its readiness.  \n Turning to the Democratic Republic of the \nCongo, Senegal welcomes the holding of elections last \nJuly. We hope that, whatever the outcome of the second \nround of presidential elections on 30 October, a \nreconciled Congolese people will work in the spirit of \nunity to utilize the tremendous potential of their \ncountry for peace, national unity and economic and \nsocial progress.  \n To my Ivorian brothers and sisters I would like to \nsolemnly state that the need for a C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, healed \nof its wounds for good, has become most urgent \u2014 as \nmuch for themselves as for all of us in the subregion. I \nwould thus urge Ivorian leaders of all ideologies to \nshow that they can get beyond their differences to \nfoster a return to lasting peace, more in accordance \nwith the history of that brother country and with its \nproper destiny within the West African family and \nwithin our continent.  \n With regard to the Digital Solidarity Fund, which \nI proposed in December 2003 at the World Summit in \nthe Information Society, as information technology and \ncommunications coordinator of The New Partnership \nfor Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD), I am pleased to \nreport that we have had satisfactory results. Since \nbeing launched in March 2005 with the support of \nnearly all Members of the United Nations, the Fund has \ngained the formal support of the People\u2019s Republic of \n  \n \n06-53005 6 \n \nChina. I would like warmly to thank the Chinese \nauthorities for their support, which surely bolsters the \nFund\u2019s universal nature. I request all States that have \nnot yet done so to formalize their previously voiced \ncommitment to the Fund by sending a letter to the \nExecutive Secretary of the Fund in Geneva. I would \nrecall that cities too can become members. I take this \nopportunity also to recall that the Digital Solidarity \nFund is supported exclusively through voluntary public \nand private contributions, the amount of which is up to \nmember States, cities or local governments.  \n We would suggest that countries commit \nthemselves to the so-called Geneva Principle, which \nconsists of, including in calls for bids in the digital \ntechnology field,  a contribution to the Fund of 1 per \ncent of the value of the goods and services linked to \ninformation and communications technology. Fund \nresources are managed in strict transparency through \nthe Foundation Council with a tripartite membership: \nlocal authorities, private enterprise and civil society.  \n The General Assembly\u2019s recent High-Level \nDialogue on International Migration and Development \nshows the extent to which we must continue our joint \nefforts to address an extremely relevant and complex \nproblem which will be with us for a long time to come. \nInternational migration has always been a part of the \nhistory of peoples. What is new is the current scope \nand form of illegal immigration. For a wide variety of \nreasons, with North-South imbalances not the least of \nthem, illegal migration necessitates an approach of \njoint partnership instead of unilateral solutions.  \n In Senegal, we have already decided to resolutely \ncombat this phenomenon by strengthening the \nsurveillance of our coasts with the support of our \nEuropean partners. We have already signed an \nagreement with Spain, and we shall sign a similar \nagreement with France next week. The purpose of \nthese agreements is to regulate migratory flows to \ndeveloped countries, thereby combating illegal \nmigration. The smugglers, largely responsible for this, \nare constantly being hunted down and punished in \naccordance with the law.  \n Along with the dismantling of clandestine \nnetworks, we have launched our Return to Agriculture \nprogramme, through which we are setting up rural \nfarms in order to enable our young people to engage in \nmodern agriculture and animal husbandry. This will \ngive them reasons to stay at home and avoid tragic \nventures which often end at the bottom of the sea or in \nthe desert. That is how we implement the principle we \nhave adopted in Senegal: zero illegal emigration. \n The year 2006 marks a decisive turning point in \nthe history of the United Nations, with reforms under \nway to adapt to changing world realities. These include \nthe establishment of the Human Rights Council and the \nPeacebuilding Commission, which I hope will allow \nfor enhanced promotion of human rights and more \neffective management of post-conflict periods.  \n As for Security Council reform, Senegal deplores \nthe deadlock in the negotiations, which is to the \ndetriment of regions such as ours. Africa, while it is the \nfocal point of the Council\u2019s agenda, does not have a \nsingle permanent seat. That is a historical injustice \nwhich must be corrected as soon as possible by \ngranting Africa a seat, with the right to veto, apart from \nthe overall reform package.  \n The Palestinian people, too, are victims of \ninjustice, depriving them of a legitimate right to a \nviable, free and independent State. History teaches us \nthat war, despite its long list of innocent victims and \nthe toll it takes on civilian infrastructure \u2014 bitter \nexperiences recently relived by the peoples of Lebanon \nand Palestine \u2014 will never overcome a people\u2019s will if \nit aspires to take its rightful place in the community of \nfree nations.  The right to freedom and \nindependence is part of the destiny of peoples. Its \nattainment can be delayed by historic circumstances, \nbut destiny will always be achieved. It is better to \nunderstand this in time than to regret it too late.  \n As Chairman of the Committee on the Exercise of \nthe Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, \nSenegal will continue to ensure that the Organization \ncontinues its efforts towards a negotiated, just and \nlasting solution to the Middle East conflict so that all \nof the suffering peoples of the region can finally live in \npeaceful coexistence. \n With regard to Iran, the Assembly is aware of my \nposition. There should be dialogue without prior \nconditions, meaning that the protagonists should sit \ndown around a negotiating table.  \n Senegal has always acted in the service of peace \nand continues to do so more than ever before at a time \nwhen we face such major challenges.

        "file_text": "I would like to extend \nmy congratulations to Her Excellency Ms. Haya \nRashed Al-Khalifa and to her country, Bahrain, on her \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-first session. I am confident that she will ably \nbuild upon the legacy left by her predecessor, His \nExcellency Mr. Jan Eliasson of Sweden. Mr. Eliasson \ndeserves special recognition for the competent and \ndedicated manner in which he presided over the \nsixtieth session and facilitated the positive outcomes \nthat we have witnessed so far in the United Nations \nreform agenda. \n Let me also pay tribute to His Excellency \nMr. Kofi Annan for his distinguished career as an \ninternational civil servant, specifically his 10-year stint \nas Secretary-General. His wisdom and his unwavering \ncommitment to multilateralism have contributed \nimmensely to a revitalized United Nations. He will \nmost certainly be remembered for his steadfast \npromotion of human rights, for creating space at the \nUnited Nations for civil society and the private sector \nand for his visionary outlook for the future of the \nUnited Nations in the current global dispensation. We \nwish to thank him for his invaluable service to this \nOrganization and its Member States, and to extend our \nvery best wishes to him in his future endeavours. \n The World Summit last year started us on the path \nof re-engineering the United Nations to make it more \nrelevant and responsive to the many challenges that \nthreaten peace and security in the world at the \nbeginning of this century. The Summit Outcome clearly \nreflected a historic compromise by Member States on a \nnumber of core principles and attendant actions to face \nsquarely the myriad problems confronting the planet. \nMost importantly, we reaffirmed the commitment we \nmade at the beginning of the millennium to confront \nthe scourge of poverty and to improve the living \nconditions of millions of people living in abject \npoverty. Our challenge today is to clarify how the \ninternational community can more effectively \ncontribute towards the global goals of poverty \nalleviation, peace and development for all humanity. \n The dynamics of today\u2019s world, conditioned by \nimmense forces of change, have forced us to accept the \nstark reality that no nation can prosper alone and that \nthe problems we face demand global consensus. \nConsequently, all of us must emphatically reaffirm \ncentral role of the United Nations in the cooperative \nmanagement of the world\u2019s problems. Dominica firmly \nsupports a rejuvenated United Nations and universal \napplication of its ideals, in particular the maintenance \nof international peace and security, the protection of \nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms and the \npromotion of international cooperation in solving \neconomic, social, cultural and humanitarian problems. \n We welcome progress towards realizing some of \nthe commitments made by world leaders last year. \nCreation of the Peacebuilding Commission now \n  \n \n06-53615 26 \n \npresents a great opportunity for ensuring a tangible \nconnection between conflict resolution and \ndevelopment. It is our hope that the new Human Rights \nCouncil will remain focused on its mission and avoid \nbecoming entangled in the politicization that \ncontributed to the eventual demise of its predecessor. \nThe Human Rights Council has made a commendable \nstart with the adoption of the Declaration on the Rights \nof Indigenous Peoples, which in turn gives great \nimpetus to the aspirations of the Second United \nNations Decade of the World\u2019s Indigenous People, \nwhich the Commonwealth of Dominica has steadfastly \nsupported, as one of the few Caribbean countries with \na thriving indigenous Carib population. We, therefore, \ncall on the General Assembly to give full support to the \nadoption of this declaration by consensus. \n The Commonwealth of Dominica, located as we \nare in the hurricane belt, in an earthquake zone and in a \nvolcanic region, particularly welcomes the \nestablishment of the Central Emergency Response \nFund, which we believe will significantly enhance the \ncapacity of the United Nations to respond more \neffectively to the increasing frequency of natural \ndisasters brought about by climate change and global \nwarming. We, the Member States, now have an \nobligation to contribute to the building of the Fund, \nwhile at the same time taking steps to put in place \nmeasures to combat climate change and reduce our \nemission of greenhouse gases. Member States must be \ncommended for the movement in a few important areas \nthat will contribute to a revitalized United Nations. The \nfirst relates to progress in the area of Secretariat and \nmanagement reforms, which we hope will contribute to \ngreater transparency and accountability in United \nNations operations. The second is the finalization on \n26 August 2006 of the new treaty protecting the rights \nof persons with disabilities, and I am pleased to \nannounce that my Government is committed to signing \nand ratifying that treaty. We believe that that \nconvention provides a solid basis for breaking down \nthe discrimination directed towards people with \ndisabilities. \n The next area is the adoption by the General \nAssembly on 8 September 2006 of a United Nations \nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy. Through this \naction, we have in a small way honoured the numerous \nvictims of international terrorism and demonstrated our \nresolve to combat the scourge of terrorism wherever it \nexists. We must continue to work towards a counter-\nterrorism convention. \n My country is continuing to make progress \ntowards realization of the Millennium Development \nGoals, despite the many challenges with which it is \nconfronted. In the aftermath of the devastation wreaked \nupon our economy by the rulings of the World Trade \nOrganization disputes settlement mechanism, which \nresulted in the virtual dismantling of our banana \nindustry, we had to undergo stringent fiscal \nadjustments to deal with unsustainable debt. The great \nsacrifices of the Dominican people resulted in modest \neconomic growth and helped to consolidate our \neconomic recovery. Spiralling oil prices, however, are \nseriously threatening the modest gains we have made. \nNational effort is, therefore, focused on developing \nalternative, renewable energy sources, such as hydro, \nwind and geothermal. \n Recent global events have not been encouraging. \nThe collapse of the Doha Development Round further \nthreatens to marginalize small island developing States \nlike Dominica in the global trading system. Trade is \none central element in the international agenda that can \nfoster sustainable economic growth, reduce our \ndependence on declining aid and contribute to \nrealization of the Millennium Development Goals and \nthe development aspirations of the small vulnerable \neconomies. \n The global trading system must recognize, \nhowever, that there is no such thing as a level playing \nfield, even among developing countries, as there are \nvarying levels of size, vulnerability and development. \nThere are large developing countries, there are small \ndeveloping countries and there are very small \ndeveloping countries. In addition, there are the least \ndeveloped countries, which may be large or small. \nWhere the very small developing countries are islands, \ntheir vulnerability is multiplied several fold. In \naddition to market access, therefore, small island \ndeveloping States require increased development \nfinance for trade and productive capacity enhancement \ncombined with trade rules that are responsive to their \ndevelopment aspirations. In this regard, small \nvulnerable economies and the least developed countries \nurgently need a trading system that acknowledges their \nvulnerability and grants them the necessary special and \ndifferential treatment. This will ensure that they benefit \nfrom their participation in the global system and lead \nto greater equity and fairness in the process. \n \n \n27 06-53615 \n \n Increasingly, South-South cooperation has \nbecome vitally important to countries like the \nCommonwealth of Dominica, as the developed nations \nretreat from fulfilling their commitment to contribute \n0.7 per cent of their GNI for development assistance. \nSouth-South cooperation from China, Cuba, Libya, \nNigeria, Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela is \ncontributing positively to our human resource \ndevelopment, revitalization of our infrastructure and \nimplementation of our public sector investment \nprogramme. We believe that the developed countries \ncan make a greater effort to assist us in realizing the \ncommitments made under the Barbados Programme of \nAction and the 2005 Mauritius Strategy for the Further \nImplementation of the Programme of Action for the \nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing \nStates. We in the Caribbean Community and Common \nMarket (CARICOM) understand the critical \nimportance of deepening regional integration and that \nis why we agreed this year to move towards the \nCARICOM Single Market and Economy. That \ndevelopment, we believe, is an important pillar in \nmaximizing regional trade and development and in \nminimizing the negative impact that is likely to be \ninflicted upon us, as small vulnerable economies, from \nthe forces of globalization. We look forward to the \nsupport of the donor community in this important \nendeavour. \n Good neighbourliness is an important plank in \nour foreign policy, and through this approach we seek \nto continuously build and strengthen relations with all \nthe countries of the greater Caribbean Basin, including \nCuba, the United States of America and Venezuela. We \nbelieve in harmonious and friendly relations with all \nour neighbours. We should not be expected to choose \none over the other, but should be seen more as a bridge \nacross the Caribbean Basin. Maritime and border \ndisputes within our region, and particularly between \nCARICOM Member States and our neighbours in \nCentral and South America, are best resolved in an \natmosphere of friendship and cooperation, using the \ngood offices of the United Nations, the Organization of \nAmerican States and other forums that can bring about \nresolution to such disputes. \n The year 2007 will mark the bicentennial of the \nabolition of the transatlantic slave trade in the former \nBritish Empire. We anticipate a commemorative event \nin the General Assembly to mark this historic occasion. \nThe Caribbean Community and Common Market \n(CARICOM) Group of nations will table a resolution \nin the General Assembly to mark the occasion and \nexpects the support of all Member States of the United \nNations in this regard. \n We welcome the return to constitutional \ngovernment in Haiti, the first country to declare its \nindependence from colonialism and slavery. We \ncommit ourselves to work closely with President Ren\u00e9 \nGarcia Pr\u00e9val and his Government in their \ndevelopment efforts. We also welcome the recent \nannouncement of commitments to Haiti by the \nGovernment of the United States of $492 million over \nthree years, and by the Government of Canada in the \namount of $100 million annually. We appreciate greatly \nthe many pledges of assistance for Haiti\u2019s \nreconstruction from various bilateral and multilateral \ndonors and wish to emphasize the necessity for these \npledges to be disbursed on a timely basis to provide the \nHaitian Government with the capacity to bring about \nimprovements in the physical and social infrastructure \nof the country and the quality of life of the people of \nthis CARICOM member State. \n The situation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon, \nDarfur, and the Middle East continue to occupy our \nattention. Regarding the unfortunate devastation \ncaused by the war between Israel and Hizbollah, we \nbelieve that Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) is \na good basis for a future peaceful relationship between \nIsrael and Lebanon, and we urge both countries and the \nneighbouring States to abide by the provisions of that \nresolution. The Commonwealth of Dominica has stated \nbefore in this forum that the only solution to the \nPalestinian-Israeli conflict is the establishment of a \nsovereign and independent Palestinian State alongside \nthe State of Israel, both with secure and defensible \nborders recognized by the international community. \n The situation in Darfur is very troubling and the \ninternational community must take action now. We \ncommend the African Union for renewing the mandate \nof the African Union Peacekeeping Force, and urge the \nSudanese Government to reconsider its opposition to \nthe deployment of a United Nations peacekeeping force \nto bolster the efforts of the African Union to provide \nprotection and security for the people of Darfur, which \nis a prerequisite for a lasting solution to the underlying \nproblems giving rise to the state of conflict. \n In conclusion, let me express my delegation\u2019s \nwish for a successful sixty-first session under \n  \n \n06-53615 28 \n \nMs. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa\u2019s leadership. It is our \nhope that the development agenda will once again \nassume the highest priority of the General Assembly \nand that we can more effectively promote peace and \nsecurity, eradicate terrorism, and above all promote \npoverty alleviation. We must also focus on moving \nforward with the reform agenda of the United Nations \nsystem, including Security Council and Economic and \nSocial Council reform. We can prevail if we act \nresponsibly and together. Support for multilateralism \nand the ideals of the United Nations must remain our \npriority. "

        "file_text": "I bring you, Madam \nPresident, good tidings from Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, \nPresident and Commander-in-Chief of the Federal \nRepublic of Nigeria, who could not be here in person \nas a result of a national tragedy. He has asked me to \ndeliver his statement to the Assembly and it is now my \nprivilege and honour to read it out. \n  \u201cOn behalf of the people and the \nGovernment of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, I \nwould like to extend my sincere congratulations \nto you, Madam, and your country, the Kingdom \nof Bahrain, on your historic election as President \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. \nYour assumption of that high office is a source of \ninspiration to us all, particularly to women all \n \n \n11 06-53329 \n \nover the world. I assure you of the support and \ncooperation of my delegation. \n  \u201cI would like to extend my profound \nappreciation to your predecessor, His Excellency \nMr. Jan Eliasson, for the commitment and \ndedication with which he presided over the affairs \nof the sixtieth session. This was particularly \nevident during the delicate negotiations that \nresulted in the establishment of the Peacebuilding \nCommission and the creation of the Human \nRights Council. \n  \u201cThe founding fathers of the United Nations \nenvisaged an international organization whose \nprimary strength would rest on the ability of its \nMembers to act collectively and in a spirit of \ncooperation in solving international problems. \n  \u201cThe theme for this year\u2019s general debate, \n\u2018Implementing a global partnership for \ndevelopment\u2019, aptly captures this aspiration and, \nindeed, reaffirms one of the objectives of the \nMillennium Development Goals. Nigeria restates \nits firm commitment to the principle that genuine \nglobal partnership is the key to development. This \nis particularly so in the face of the many \nchallenges confronting us today. \n  \u201cFor Africa, the most urgent challenge \nremains the resolution of conflicts and the \nmaintenance of peace and security as the \nfoundation for socio-economic progress. We \nremain undaunted and have collectively decided \nto take action to address the problem under the \nauspices of the African Union. Our efforts have \nbeen bolstered by the active engagement of the \nSecurity Council and the international \ncommunity, for which we remain grateful. I am \nhappy to note that in Liberia and Sierra Leone, \nwhere hostilities have happily ceased, there are \nsigns of progress everywhere as democracy and \nits benefits take their most important first steps. \n  \u201cWith respect to C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Nigeria \nwelcomes the recent efforts by all parties to \novercome their differences through dialogue. We \nurge them to remain steadfast in their \ncommitment in order to ensure that the peace \nprocess remains on course. However, it is now \ndoubtful that elections can take place in October. \nBut we must not allow the elections in C\u00f4te \nd\u2019Ivoire to be postponed beyond 31 December \n2006. If the proposed extraordinary meeting of \nthe Economic Community of West African States \nin early October fails to achieve this goal, a \nSecurity Council resolution will become \nnecessary to impose heavy sanctions on all \nculprits and their relations. \n  \u201cNigeria is encouraged by the progress \ntowards implementation of the Darfur Peace \nAgreement, which was signed in Abuja last June. \nWe are, however, concerned by the slow pace of \nimplementation regarding key aspects of the plan, \nwhich has exacerbated the humanitarian situation. \nWe share the frustration of the international \ncommunity over the lack of access to vulnerable \ngroups in need of urgent humanitarian assistance. \nWe call on all parties to respect their \ncommitments. \n  \u201cThe situation in Darfur has placed a heavy \nburden on the African Union and continues to \nexert pressure on its meagre resources, as it \nstruggles to maintain a peacekeeping force of \nover 7,000 troops. Africa\u2019s commitment to peace \nin Darfur was reaffirmed by the latest decision of \nthe Peace and Security Council of the African \nUnion, at its meeting in New York on \n20 September 2006, to extend the mandate of the \nAfrican Mission in the Sudan (AMIS) until \n31 December 2006. Nigeria calls on the \ninternational community to urgently assist the \nAfrican Union with the logistical and financial \nsupport to sustain AMIS through that date. \n  \u201cIf the early removal of the obstacles that \nhave thus far prevented the conclusion of the \nnegotiations on the replacement of the African \nUnion force with a United Nations peacekeeping \nforce cannot be achieved, the African Union may \nbe left with no other option but to allow the \ntroops to return to the contributing countries. The \nconsequences of the withdrawal of AMIS without \na United Nations umbrella will be the full \nresponsibility of the Government of the Sudan. \n  \u201cNigeria is concerned by the increasing \nthreat of violence and insecurity in the world \nbrought about by threats or acts of terrorism. \nNigeria strongly condemns all acts of terrorism \nand calls upon the international community to \nredouble its efforts to defeat this heinous crime in \nall its forms and manifestations. \n  \n \n06-53329 12 \n \n  \u201cOn the situation in the Middle East, \nNigeria welcomes Security Council resolution \n1701 (2006) and calls for the implementation of \nthe terms of the ceasefire by both parties. We \nbelieve, however, that a long-lasting solution \nmust come through dialogue and a readiness to \nabandon violence as a means of resolving the \ncrisis. The root causes of the Middle East crisis \nmust also be addressed in a comprehensive \nmanner for lasting peace to be attained. We \nreaffirm our commitment to a two-State \narrangement: Israel and Palestine living in peace \nwithin secure borders, in accordance with \nSecurity Council resolutions. We therefore call on \nthe international community to show greater \ncommitment to the peaceful and early resolution \nof the Israeli-Palestinian crisis. \n  \u201cWest Africa has experienced conflicts for \nmany years as a result of the illicit proliferation \nof small arms and light weapons in the region. \nWe believe that the restoration and maintenance \nof peace are critical for socio-economic \ndevelopment in the subregion. Towards that end, \nin June this year, States member of the Economic \nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) \nadopted a landmark Convention on Small Arms, \nLight Weapons, Their Ammunition and Other \nAssociated Material to reduce violence in the \nsubregion and pave the way for the achievement \nof peace, security, stability, cooperation and \ndevelopment. The Convention bans international \narms transfers, except those for the legitimate \ndefence and security needs of member States. Of \ngreatest significance is the ban on transfers to \nnon-State actors, who have been largely \nresponsible for political instability in the \nsubregion, as elsewhere. \n  \u201cIn this regard, I wish to express Nigeria\u2019s \ndeep disappointment that the first United Nations \nReview Conference on implementation of the \nProgramme of Action on small arms and light \nweapons failed to agree on a final document, \nincluding a similar ban on arms transfers to non-\nState actors. I urge all Member States to be \nguided by the example of ECOWAS on this issue \nwhen and if the Conference reconvenes. \n  \u201cAs a demonstration of Nigeria\u2019s \ncommitment to the fight against illicit small arms, \nwe have deposited the instrument of ratification \nof the Firearms Protocol to the United Nations \nConvention against Transnational Organized \nCrime. We also call for a comprehensive and \nlegally binding global arms trade treaty. \n  \u201cHumankind has made giant strides in the \nfield of nuclear technology since the discovery of \nthe atom. This has opened up vistas of \nopportunities for determined and committed \nsocieties to uplift the standard of living of their \ncitizenry. Indeed, nuclear energy has become a \nveritable source of socio-economic development \nand a reliable source of electricity generation. We \nnote in particular the global trend towards the \nutilization of nuclear technology for the \ngeneration of electricity, agricultural \ndevelopment, human health and environmental \ndevelopment, especially for developing countries. \n  \u201cIn the context of this development and of \nthe enormous energy crisis that confronts us in \nNigeria, my Government decided to inaugurate \nthe Board of the Nigeria Atomic Energy \nCommission. With the inauguration of the Board, \nour quest for energy self-sufficiency has begun. \n  \u201cNigeria remains resolute in its commitment \nto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons (NPT) and the Treaty of Pelindaba on \nthe African nuclear-weapon-free zone. We wish to \nassure the international community of our \ndetermination to restrict the use of nuclear energy \nto purely peaceful purposes. \n  \u201cI take this opportunity to reiterate our deep \nappreciation to this body for the invaluable \nsupport it has given to the New Partnership for \nAfrica\u2019s Development (NEPAD). We are also \nvery appreciative of the interest shown by the \ninternational community and the commitments it \nhas made in support of NEPAD. The NEPAD \ninitiative remains our continent\u2019s most viable \nsocio-economic blueprint; it could bring \nsustained economic growth while strengthening \ngood governance and enhancing the protection of \nthe human rights of our peoples. \n  \u201cTrade is one of the most potent and \ngenuine engines of economic growth and \ndevelopment. We therefore support efforts that \nwould enhance the ability of our countries to \nenjoy the benefits of the successful conclusion of \nagreements on regimes under the auspices of the \n \n \n13 06-53329 \n \nWorld Trade Organization (WTO). In this \nconnection, we regard the recent breakdown of \nthe WTO Doha round of development talks as a \nvery serious setback. The successful conclusion \nof Doha development talks and the \nimplementation of their outcome would provide \nsuccour to the almost 1 billion people currently \nsubsisting on less than one dollar a day. We urge \nall parties to return to the negotiating table and \nresume talks in the spirit of global partnership, \ncooperation and global economic progress. \n  \u201cNigeria remains committed to the fight \nagainst the HIV/AIDS pandemic, malaria, \ntuberculosis and related diseases. We have taken \nbold steps to deal with them. To this end, we \nhosted the Special Summit of the African Union \non HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria in Abuja \nin May this year. At the Summit, African leaders \nreaffirmed their commitment to earlier \ndeclarations and pledged to take immediate action \nto ensure universal access to relevant drugs. We \napplaud the Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS \n(resolution 60/262) which was adopted at the \nUnited Nations High-level Meeting on HIV/AIDS \nlast June and hope that it will be fully \nimplemented. \n  \u201cOn 14 August this year, Nigeria lowered its \nflag for the last time on the Bakassi peninsula and \neffectively withdrew its presence there in \naccordance with the ruling of the International \nCourt of Justice. With this final act, Nigeria has \nfulfilled its obligations under the terms of the \nagreement between my country and Cameroon. I \nuse this opportunity to recognize the positive \ncontributions of Mr. Kofi Annan and members of \nthe international community and to thank them \nfor their assistance and support. Nigeria hopes \nthat our brotherly neighbour will protect and \nrespect the rights and freedoms of Nigerian \nnationals who decide to remain in the area in \naccordance with the mutually agreed terms. \n  \u201cNigeria believes that the reform of the \nUnited Nations system must not lose momentum. \nNational or regional interests should not be \nallowed to obscure our common objectives for a \nreinvigorated United Nations. The reform should \nbe linked to the overall interest of making our \nOrganization stronger, more effective and better \npositioned to meet the challenges facing both the \nweak and the strong. \n  \u201cThe identity, importance and relevance of \nthe different organs of the Organization must be \nmaintained. Above all, nothing should be done to \nweaken one in favour of the other. The General \nAssembly, as the pre-eminent, deliberative, \npolicymaking and representative organ of the \nUnited Nations, deserves the support of all \nMembers. It remains the only organ where States \nbig or small, rich or poor, find equality and voice. \n  \u201cIt is in this context that African countries, \nalong with other Members of the United Nations, \nhave called for the reform of the Security \nCouncil. For us, no reform will be complete \nwithout the reform of that vital organ. The \nSecurity Council, as now constituted, does not \nreflect the realities of our time. We hope that \nprogress will be made on this issue during this \nsession. \n  \u201cI cannot conclude this statement without \npaying a special tribute to my brother, the \ndistinguished statesman Mr. Kofi Annan. Nigeria \nsalutes his dedicated service to our Organization. \nHe has, in the past 10 years, assiduously piloted \nthe United Nations through very important \nmilestones and turbulent waters.  \n \u201cIt is, indeed, impossible to forget the \nreform agenda that you have initiated and set in \nmotion. We are proud of you and your services \nand wish you the best in your future endeavours. \nAs I am attending the General Assembly for the \nlast time in my capacity as President of the \nFederal Republic of Nigeria, I wish to take this \nopportunity to thank all my colleagues and the \nSecretary-General as well as all the staff of our \nOrganization for their support and cooperation \nover the past seven years.\u201d "

        "file_text": "With \nconfidence, Iraq is making qualitative steps in the \ntransition to nationhood. Under extremely difficult \ncircumstances, Iraq is pursuing this goal and the \ninherently complicated task of rebuilding the country. \nIraq continues courageously to reach for the promise of \na democratic, federal and pluralistic State, where \ngenerations of long-oppressed Iraqis will regain their \ndignity and freedom and their right to join the civilized \nand progressive nations of the world. \n As we make our way forward, we are keen to \nestablish a deep-rooted experiment with seeds from \nIraq\u2019s authentically rich and enlightened ancient \nheritage. We will pay attention to the lessons of older \ncivilizations in Iraq and the national diversity that \nembodies the Iraqi vision. \n The new Iraq has passed through crucial \ntransitional stages in an incredibly short period of time. \n  \n \n06-53317 8 \n \nThe political process has been strengthened and \nexpanded through the participation of broader and \nmore effective social, political and civil forces. Last \nyear, the first parliamentary elections were held, \nleading to the formation of a Transitional National \nAssembly; these were followed by a national \nreferendum on a permanent constitution for the first \ntime in the history of modern Iraq. A second round of \nelections was held on 15 December 2005, which \nelected members of a Council of Representatives for a \nfour-year term. The Council convened on 1 February \n2006.  \n These developments, supported by the will of the \nIraqi political forces and with the help of our friends, \nhave galvanized the Iraqi majority with its varied \npolitical, social and intellectual background. They have \ncreated a positive political process, which has \nproduced a Government of National Unity and \nSalvation under the leadership of Prime Minister Nuri \nal-Maliki. \n The region of Iraqi Kurdistan elected a Council \nof Representatives, followed by the formation of a \nunited Kurdistan Regional Government. This \ndemonstrates that political harmony does indeed exist \nin the midst of the country\u2019s broader political process. \nIt demonstrates significant development in our \neconomy, our culture and our social fabric as a whole \nwhere security, stability and economic prosperity \nprevail. A market economy has been successful and \nprosperous for Iraq.  \n What we have achieved so far in the political \narena reflects a united national will to succeed in the \nprocess of building an Iraq that can confront all of its \nchallenges, ranging from defeating the terrorists \u2014 \nwho label others as infidels \u2014 and extremist \nideologies, to achieving security and stability.  \n Terrorist operations and activities of those who \nlabel others as infidels and organized crime groups in \nour country are not merely characterized by the killing \nof innocent people or provoking security chaos; they \nalso aim at destroying the country\u2019s infrastructure and \nhampering our ongoing efforts to rebuild the country \nand place it firmly on the path of peace, security and \ndemocracy. \n We must emphasize that the forces of extremism, \nthose that oppose democracy and human values, are \nintent on making Iraq a stepping stone for reaching \nother goals and for wreaking even more destruction. \nThese forces comprise regional and Arab elements that \nexport their crises beyond their borders in the hope that \nIraq will prove to be fertile ground on which they can \ndeal with those crises by fighting their battles on Iraqi \nsoil and among the people of Iraq. Those groups are \nmainly composed of remnants of the former dictatorial \nregime in league with organized criminal elements, \nthemselves a product of the oppression of the old \nregime and the lapses of security that followed its \ncollapse.  \n The supply line of money and weapons for those \ngroups extends to neighbouring Arab and regional \nStates. They are further supported by individuals who \ninfiltrate the borders, many of them Al-Qaida \noperatives and runaway Saddamists. Such groups \nharbour the illusion that they can suppress the will of \nour people by continuing to kill, terrorize and spread \ndespair among innocent Iraqis.  \n To confront such evil intent, national \ndetermination will flourish, welcoming all the people \nof Iraq to participate in the process of building a \nnational consensus. The Prime Minister has launched a \nnational reconciliation plan in the hope of providing \nthe protection and conditions that are necessary for \npolitical stability, calm and security. This initiative was \nformulated and developed through the contributions of \na number of political parties holding seats in \nparliament and represented on Iraq\u2019s National Security \nCouncil. That is how the first steps towards success \nwere taken. The initiative has received the support of \nseveral political opposition groups, including militant \ngroups that were previously part of the armed \nopposition. \n We continue to make efforts within the tripartite \nPresidential Council \u2014 the President, the Prime \nMinister and the Speaker of the Legislature \u2014 to \nexpand the range of participation for groups that are \ngenuinely interested in the initiative, regardless of their \nintellectual, political or organizational orientation. We \nare encouraging them to join the national effort until \nall forces are mobilized to bring about political \nstability and security in Iraq. As we are working \ntirelessly for a secure and stable Iraq, we are also \nstriving to re-establish an advanced and developed \nState where everybody can enjoy peace and security. \nWe aspire to that not only for Iraq, but also for all \nStates of the Middle East. This reflects Iraq\u2019s concern, \ndespite its preoccupation with its internal situation, \n \n \n9 06-53317 \n \nabout the suffering of its Arab brothers, especially the \nPalestinians. \n Iraq recognizes the implications of the \ndestruction suffered by the brotherly State of Lebanon \nand its proud people as a result of the Israeli military \nonslaught. Therefore, we call for implementation of the \nresolutions of international legitimacy for resolving the \nPalestinian question, which is at the core of this \nchronic conflict. We call for implementation of \nSecurity Council resolution 1701 (2006) concerning \nthe brotherly State of Lebanon, which deserves \nsympathy and genuine support through funding and \ntechnology from all civilized nations, not solely from \nits Arab brethren. \n The ongoing crises and wars in our region impose \nan enormous responsibility on the international \ncommunity and the States of the region themselves to \nreach a just and permanent political settlement that \nwould defuse crises, conflicts and wars. It also makes \nit incumbent upon us to reach a just and lasting peace \nthat rids the area \u2014 and humanity \u2014 of the scourge of \nwar, bloody conflict and terrorism. \n Iraq, through its Minister of Foreign Affairs, has \nendorsed the latest decisions of the League of Arab \nStates. Therefore, I call on the international community \nto accept these fair, logical proposals that are capable \nof ending strife and achieving security and peace for \nthe peoples of the region. \n States with influence at the international level \nhave weightier responsibilities because of the strategic \nimportance of the Middle East with respect to the \npolicies, economies and global objectives of those \ninfluential States. They should, therefore, adopt a \ndecisive approach in endorsing solutions that respect \nthe rights and interests of the States and peoples of the \nregion, as provided for in United Nations resolutions \nand human rights law. The decisive factor in \nestablishing a firm foundation for a regional \nunderstanding, leading to just solutions, to a permanent \npeace based on transparency and the principle of \nrespect for the rights of all parties and to stability in \nthe Middle East, is embodied in collaborative efforts, \nthe will of neighbouring countries and a serious resolve \nto defeat terrorism and eliminate its hotbeds and \ncauses. A global war on terrorism limited only to \nmilitary means will not be sufficient to defeat \nterrorism. We should, therefore, explore and adopt \npolitical, economic and other means and tools to \nstrengthen the elements that will lead to victory in that \nwar. In our view, it is beneficial here to consider \nGeneral Assembly resolution 60/4, which calls on \nGovernments, the United Nations and civil society \norganizations to develop ways and means in that \ndirection and to work to promote a culture of peace and \nto condemn violence. It also calls for the formulation \nof ways and means to expand the circle of dialogue \namong civilizations in its religious, cultural and civil \nsociety dimensions. \n What I have referred to serves to strengthen \nIraq\u2019s vision of making the Middle East a zone free of \nweapons of mass destruction \u2014 especially nuclear \nweapons \u2014 similar to zones in Africa and Latin \nAmerica. Such zones safeguard the right of countries to \ndevelop technical capacity for the scientific and \npeaceful use of nuclear energy in order to achieve the \ngoals of sustainable development. In that regard, I \nwould like to emphasize that, in accordance with its \npermanent constitution and its higher national interests, \nthe new Iraq is committed not to produce such \nweapons. Iraq will also join the Chemical Weapons \nConvention and other international instruments \npertaining to such weapons. \n We would like to take this opportunity to \nemphasize that there are no weapons of mass \ndestruction of any type in the new Iraq, as has been \nconfirmed in the reports of the most recent United \nNations team to visit Iraq. Given that fact, and taking \ninto account the interests of our country, we urge the \nSecurity Council to dissolve the United Nations \nMonitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission \n(UNMOVIC), either by decommissioning it or by \ntransforming it into an international body associated \nwith the United Nations and funded through the \nOrganization\u2019s regular budget. UNMOVIC, which in \nits current form is financed through Iraqi accounts, is a \nwaste of Iraq\u2019s resources. Our people are in desperate \nneed of those funds at this point in our country\u2019s \ndevelopment. \n Major international objectives can only be \nachieved by joining efforts and harnessing the goodwill \nof the international community in the service of all \nhumankind. The United Nations has taken it upon itself \nto play a constructive role in establishing global \nenvironment conducive to international peace and \nsecurity.  \n  \n \n06-53317 10 \n \n Changes on the international stage oblige us to \nkeep abreast of progress in every field, so as to enable \nthe United Nations to carry out its functions. That \nshould be done by better utilizing resources and \ncapabilities to benefit the peoples of the world, as well \nas by strengthening the role of the Organization in the \nmaintenance of international peace and security. There \nis also a need to respect the principle of the equality of \nall countries and their right to participate in the \nformulation and adoption of decisions and policies that \naffect the international community.  \n We also need to establish appropriate democratic \nmechanisms to make possible the participation of \ncountries with the desire and capabilities to support \nefforts and decisions conducive to the implementation \nof programmes and the achievement of our common \ngoals. In that connection, we believe that the reform of \nthe international Organization must take account of the \ninterests of all, and must seek to bring about equality \nand justice by reaching a balance through transparency \nand consensus. \n In the light of those principles, Iraq appreciates \nthe effective role played by the United Nations to \nresolve international problems. We are grateful to \nMr. Ashraf Qazi, the Special Representative of the \nSecretary-General for Iraq for the role he is playing. \nIraq hopes that the specialized agencies and \nprogrammes of the United Nations will return to Iraq to \nresume their part in its development and \nreconstruction. \n In that context, I cannot fail to refer to the \nInternational Compact with Iraq. The Compact is the \nresult of an initiative by the Government of Iraq to \nestablish an international contact group that brings \ntogether countries and organizations willing to help \nIraq and promote its reconstruction efforts. The group \nwill also help establish a sustainable partnership \nbetween Iraq and the international community to \novercome the challenges resulting from our economic \nand political transition. It is our hope that the \ninternational community will fulfil its obligations by \nproviding the resources required to address key \npriorities and achieve a common vision in the \nframework of an economic transformation process and \na sustainable development programme through agreed \nmechanisms. \n \n I express our gratitude to the ministers for foreign \naffairs who took part in the successful meeting on the \nCompact that was held in this building a few days ago. \nThe meeting proved that the new Iraq is no longer \nisolated from the international community. It also \nillustrated the fact that the new Iraq is on its way to \nassuming its proper place in a free and developed \nworld.  \n With regard to reconstruction and the \ncommitments of donor States towards Iraq, we would \nlike to thank those States that are providing assistance \nto effectively contribute to generating optimism vis-\u00e0-\nvis leaving the past behind, launching the reform \nprocess and achieving comprehensive development. \nHowever, we also look forward to further support and \ndetermination in fulfilling those commitments, because \nwe believe that launching reconstruction projects and \nstimulating the economy will be decisive in \nstrengthening the security situation and restoring \nstability to Iraq, the region and the whole world. In that \nconnection, I would like to emphasize that, with our \nfree national will, we are committed to moving forward \nin reconstructing and implementing our national \ndevelopment programmes and plans.  \n We believe that it is our right to seek the \ncancellation of the numerous and exorbitant \nreparations payments and debts of the new democratic \nIraq, which must not be made to pay for the sins of a \ndictatorship that committed many crimes against its \npeople and betrayed the nation. Iraq believes that \nachieving sustainable development goes hand in hand \nwith respecting human rights, providing security, \nachieving justice, ensuring the fair distribution of \nwealth and developing the agricultural, economic and \nservice sectors.  \n In order to rise to the challenge posed by those \ntasks, we must respect women and their rights and \nensure that they play their role in the development \nprocess and in the political arena. That goal has now \nbecome a firm principle in our pursuits, as stipulated in \nthe Iraqi constitution, which confirmed the right of \nwomen to contribute to our country by holding no less \nthan 25 per cent of the seats in the Council of \nRepresentatives. Iraqi women also now head four \nministries in the Iraq Government of National Unity. \n In conclusion, I would like to address anyone and \neveryone who harbours doubts that we are as \ncommitted and determined as we were three years ago \n \n \n11 06-53317 \n \nto achieving national reconciliation. I assure them that \nthe reconciliation process is a promising one. It is \nreceiving all possible support and is moving forward \nwith the backing of all political blocs. Our efforts will \nbe focused on making reconciliation a permanent \nliving reality that reflects the aspirations and hopes of \nthe people of Iraq. That is especially so given that \nimportant steps have been taken that have resulted in \nnational consensus and support from all the influential \npolitical forces in the country. We have also succeeded \nin charting a road map to resolve all remaining key \nissues, including those pertaining to the constitution, \nfederal regions, militias, oil, de-Baathification and the \nnew national flag, emblem and anthem. \n As we underscore our determination, we also \nexpress the hope that Arab and regional parties, \nincluding neighbouring countries in particular, will \nshare our determination and make every effort to halt \nany activities, support for or encouragement of the \nforces of terrorism \u2014 including those who label others \nas infidels and the remnants of dictatorial fascist gangs \nin the country. We also call upon neighbouring States \nto take the necessary measures to seal their borders \nagainst infiltrators. \n We reaffirm our keen desire for security and \nsafety for all our neighbours. We also express our \nadherence to the principle of non-intervention in the \ninternal affairs of other States, so as to prevent our \nterritory from being used as a staging ground to carry \nout acts against our neighbours. However, our people\u2019s \npatience is wearing thin, in particular when we see the \nblood of our innocent sons and daughters being spilled \nand defiled, our infrastructure destroyed, our mosques \nand holy shrines ruined and the rebuilding of our \narmed forces and security services impeded in an \nattempt to delay the achievement of full sovereignty. It \nis difficult for our political leadership to keep quiet \nforever.  \n The ferocity of the terrorist attacks that target our \npeople and country will not dissuade us from working \npersistently and with unwavering determination to \ndefeat the terrorists. In so doing, we shall rely on our \npeople\u2019s vigilance, our political forces and our military \nand security capabilities, which are visibly being \ndeveloped and strengthened in a number of Iraq\u2019s \ngovernorates as the tide of terrorism recedes.  \n \n The building of Iraq\u2019s national armed forces and \nits strengthening to the desired levels continues apace, \nin an effort to ensure that our capabilities reach the \nnecessary level, degree of competency and readiness to \ngradually bring about the departure of Coalition forces \nfrom our country. Those forces are present in Iraq in \naccordance with an international resolution. In the \ncurrent circumstances, their presence is essential as we \ncarry out the task of building up our armed forces that \nwill be capable of putting an end to terrorism and of \nmaintaining stability and security. Once that has been \nachieved, it will then be possible to talk about a \ntimetable for the withdrawal of multinational forces \nfrom Iraq. \n The President returned to the Chair. \n At this point, I would like once again to express \nour gratitude to the forces that participated in liberating \nour country from the worst dictatorship in history. In \nparticular, we would like to thank President George W. \nBush for his leadership in the campaign to liberate Iraq \nfrom tyranny and opening up the way for a new, \ndemocratic, pluralistic and federal Iraq that is at peace \nwith itself and the world. That historic mission has \nwell served the people of Iraq and peace and security \nin the region.  \n In conclusion, allow me, on behalf of the people \nand Government of Iraq to congratulate you, Madam \nPresident Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, on your \nelection to preside over the General Assembly at its \nsixty-first session. We wish you every success in \nachieving the goals set for this session, and we reaffirm \nour determination to cooperate with you fully in that \nnoble undertaking.  \n I also wish to take this opportunity to express our \ngratitude and appreciation to Secretary-General Kofi \nAnnan for his dedicated efforts to re-energize the \nUnited Nations to work towards international peace \nand security and to promote development and respect \nfor human rights throughout the world.

        "file_text": "I would like to congratulate \nMs. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \nsession. I am confident that her efforts will ensure a \nsuccessful outcome of this session. I would also like to \ntake this opportunity to thank the outgoing President, \nHis Excellency Jan Eliasson, with whom the Assembly \nworked over the past 12 months on the successful \nimplementation of many of the major reform tasks \nagreed upon at the Summit last year. \n The theme chosen by the President for this year\u2019s \nsession \u2014 \u201cImplementing a global partnership for \ndevelopment\u201d \u2014 strikes at the heart of the challenges \nfacing mankind today. It also reflects the Summit\u2019s \nemphasis on the interlinked and mutually reinforcing \nnature of development, peace and security and human \nrights. Sustainable development in the economic, \nsocial and environmental sphere constitutes a key \nelement of the overarching framework of United \nNations activities. We support that approach and, \nconvinced of the ripple effect of development policies \nthat benefit all mankind, urge the General Assembly to \nincrease its focus on development issues. \n Poverty eradication and the achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) are the \npriorities for this decade. In this regard, the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals Report 2006 indicates that certain \nregions of the world have made much less progress \nthan others. Extreme poverty remains a daily reality for \nthe more than 1 billion people who subsist on less than \none dollar a day. Whereas Asia leads the way in \nreducing poverty rates, the number of poor people in \nAfrica is rising. In terms of per capita income, 18 of \nthe 20 poorest countries in the world are in Africa. \nSub-Saharan Africa has the highest poverty rate in the \nworld, and the situation of chronic food insecurity has \nnot improved over the past decade. Four fifths of \narmed conflicts occur in Africa and Asia. Clearly, there \ncan be no development without security and no \nsecurity without development. \n The realities of poverty, conflict and insecurity \nare at the root of the phenomenon of mass migration \nfrom Africa to Europe along the major routes \u2014 into \nthe Canary Islands and mainland Spain in the eastern \nMediterranean, and into Malta and Italy in the central \nMediterranean. \n Lack of development, security and good \ngovernance has a direct effect on a country such as \nmine, which, with 1,200 persons per square kilometre, \nis already one of the most densely populated countries \nin the world. In addition, it is a small island State with \na small population of 400,000. \n The burden of underdevelopment and lack of \nsecurity in Africa, in particular sub-Saharan Africa, is \ntherefore inordinately borne by my country, which is \nsuffering real hardship as thousands of illegal migrants \nreach our shores. The 2005 statistics of the Office of \nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \n(UNHCR) rank Malta as the country with the second-\nhighest number of asylum applications, in contrast to a \n15.6 per cent decrease in asylum applications across \nthe rest of the European Union. \n We urge the United Nations and its agencies to \naddress the issue of mass illegal immigration \nholistically and with vigour and urgency. In that \nendeavour, all the countries of world are called upon to \ncombat criminal organizations that, across frontiers, \nare taking advantage of the aspirations of human \nbeings who have nearly lost all hope. The rule of law \n  \n \n06-53329 30 \n \nmust be respected. International obligations undertaken \nby countries in accordance with public international \nlaw must be honoured. Ignoring or insufficiently \naddressing the phenomenon of illegal immigration puts \nat risk the hard-won rights of genuine refugees and \npersons who must be protected with humanitarian \nstatus under international law. \n I therefore call on the General Assembly and the \nUnited Nations as a whole \u2014 but in particular the \nUNHCR \u2014 to lend their full support to those countries \nthat, like Malta, have an inherent fragility arising from \ndensity of population and smallness of territorial size \nin their efforts to combat illegal immigration and \naddress the hardships that they experience as countries \nof destination. \n Malta needs support \u2014 including from the \nUNHCR \u2014 in the resettlement of refugees and persons \nwith humanitarian status. It needs support in \nshouldering the financial burden that it assumes in \nproviding for the basic needs of the illegal immigrants \non its soil. It needs international support in combating \nthe criminal organizations that are benefiting \nfinancially from illegal immigration while putting the \nlives of immigrants at risk. \n No country can tackle such an overwhelming \nphenomenon on its own. Illegal immigration requires a \nholistic international approach that includes combating \ncriminal organizations \u2014 particularly in the countries \nof origin and transit \u2014 and strengthening border \ncontrol; promoting good governance, economic \ndevelopment and the rule of law; resettling refugees \nand persons with humanitarian status; and returning \nillegal immigrants to their countries of origin and \ntransit and reintegrating them into society. As part of \nsuch a holistic approach, we must take into \nconsideration the special characteristics of a number of \nparticularly vulnerable countries on the routes of \nmigration between Africa and Europe, which, as \ncountries of destination, are carrying a burden far \ngreater than they can bear. \n This issue was also examined in detail during the \nHigh-level Dialogue on International Migration and \nDevelopment, which took place last week. Malta, \nwhich took an active part in the Dialogue, looks \nforward to greater engagement on the part of countries \nof origin, transit and destination. In particular, we look \nforward to the high-level conference on migration of \nthe European Union and the African Union, scheduled \nto be held in Tripoli, Libya, before the end of this year. \nSuch engagement, which should have the active \nsupport of international organizations operating in this \nfield, would continue the process of \u201ctrialogue\u201d, which \nwas successfully undertaken at the Rabat Conference \nlast July. It could also serve as effective follow-up to \nthe recent United Nations Dialogue. \n In focusing on development issues, we must \nemphasize that development needs to be sustainable, to \nrespect the environment and to take into account the \nrights of future generations, children, young people and \nthose yet unborn. Development does not mean a free-\nfor-all attitude towards the exploitation of the Earth\u2019s \nbountiful resources. There must be sustainable \ndevelopment that allows our forests to regenerate, our \nair to be pure and our seas to be free of pollution. \n Climate change and global warming are not \nissues that can be relegated to intellectual exercises. \nPositive political action is required to address the \nproblems related to global warming and to prevent an \nexacerbation of the consequences of lack of care for \nthe environment. As a number of dramatic experiences \nhave already shown, the consequences of lack of \nrespect for the planet and its environmental balances \nhave been borne in particular by the world\u2019s poor, \nwhether in developing or developed economies. A \nconcerted effort by all mankind is therefore required in \nthis area. The United Nations is the appropriate forum \nfor addressing these issues, which affect all countries. \nThe fragility of our planet and its ecosystem means that \nall of us have a greater responsibility to act rapidly and \ntogether. \n A global partnership for development needs to be \ncarried out in peace and stability. However, in today\u2019s \nworld, global peace and security are constantly \nthreatened by destructive and violent events. In that \nregard, we must pay particular attention to the \nprolonged impasse that has thwarted the work of the \nConference on Disarmament. That impasse is \nendangering the very multilateral mechanisms that \nwere created to foster peace, security and cooperation. \nStates members of the Conference have a grave \nresponsibility towards all United Nations Member \nStates in helping humanity to address the challenges of \nnon-proliferation, disarmament and arms control. As \nthe Secretary-General stated in his address to the \nConference on Disarmament last June, \u201cWith political \nwill, this Conference can reclaim its former mantle and \ngenerate tangible benefits that could shape the course \n \n \n31 06-53329 \n \nof history\u201d (CD/PV.1028, p. 5). That is a challenge for \nus all. \n Another challenge for us all is to persevere in all \nour efforts to resolve conflicts, even if they seem to \npersist over long periods of time and regardless of the \nnumber of peace initiatives undertaken by the \ninternational community. \n The recent conflict in Lebanon was a tragic \nreminder of how easily a population can slide quickly \nback into a conflict situation. Today, the clouds have \nlifted a little so that new rays of hope can break \nthrough. We wish that country well. We believe that it \ncould serve as a unique laboratory for democratic and \ncultural pluralism within a peaceful society in the \nMiddle East. \n In the same region, a resolution of the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict remains elusive. Fatalism is not an \noption. The international community, through the \nUnited Nations and other mechanisms such as the \nQuartet, must maintain its concerted and determined \nefforts to find a comprehensive, just and lasting \nsolution to this long-festering conflict, which has a \nbearing on all other issues in the Middle East and, \nindeed, in the wider global context. We welcome the \nintense and frank debate that took place last week in \nthe Security Council on this issue (see S/PV.5530). \n The President returned to the Chair. \n Malta respects and supports the aspirations of the \nPalestinian people to nationhood and dignity, and in \nequal measure respects and supports the aspirations of \nthe Israeli people to live in peace within secure \nborders. Those two aspirations are mutually compatible \nand achievable through peaceful and just means. A \nsolution can be achieved only through strict and \nabiding respect for the rules and norms of international \nlaw, including humanitarian law. \n On the ground, the continuing and increasingly \ndeteriorating humanitarian situation of the Palestinian \npeople is an intolerable burden on the international \nconscience. We must acknowledge and applaud the \nsterling work being carried out by the Commissioner-\nGeneral of the United Nations Relief and Works \nAgency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East \n(UNRWA), Ms. Karen AbuZayd, and all of the \nAgency\u2019s dedicated staff to assist the refugee \npopulation in no fewer than 58 refugee camps in Gaza, \nthe West Bank, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan, where one \nthird of Palestinian refugees live. \n The international community needs to continue to \nstrengthen its tools for addressing natural emergencies \nwherever in the world they occur, in a spirit of \nsolidarity with nations and human beings. In that \nregard, the decision taken earlier this year \u2014 as a \nfollow-up to the Summit \u2014 on the revitalization and \nupgrading of the Central Emergency Revolving \nFund \u2014 now the Central Emergency Response Fund \u2014 \nis an important step forward. In that context, the role of \nthe United Nations Office for the Coordination of \nHumanitarian Affairs, under the able leadership of \nUnder-Secretary-General Jan Egeland, continues to be \na crucial mechanism for dealing with the coordination \nneeded to strengthen humanitarian responses to natural \ndisasters and complex emergencies. \n The tragic experience of the December 2004 \nIndian Ocean earthquake and tsunami galvanized \nefforts to plot the outlines of an international early \nwarning system across all oceans. That experience and \nits aftermath, however, show that much still remains to \nbe done to respond more rapidly, efficiently and \neffectively to natural disasters and other humanitarian \nemergencies. \n In this context, I note with great interest the \nvaluable work done to date by the Intergovernmental \nOceanographic Commission\u2019s Intergovernmental \nCoordination Group for the Tsunami Early Warning \nand Mitigation System in the North-Eastern Atlantic, \nthe Mediterranean and Connected Seas. Located at the \ncentre of the Mediterranean and fully aware of the \nhavoc that a tsunami could cause in the basin, Malta \ncalls for speeding up the implementation of a \nMediterranean tsunami early warning and mitigation \nsystem. This goal needs to be achieved as soon as \npossible. We are prepared to play a proactive role \ntogether with other States in the region in establishing \na fully functioning tsunami warning system. \n In such phenomena, not just regional but full \nglobal coverage is essential to the success of the \nsystem. The Assembly should examine what needs to \nbe done to achieve this in the shortest time possible. In \nparticular, recent tsunami phenomena which were \nsmaller but which also claimed lives have shown that \nwhile it is important for countries to have early \nwarning systems that are interlinked, it is equally \ncrucial to transmit the early warning received by a \n  \n \n06-53329 32 \n \ncountry immediately to people on the beaches and in \nthe most vulnerable coastal areas and to have in place \ncrisis management mechanisms that can accelerate \nevacuation to safety. This requires the setting of \ninternational warning-transmission standards across the \nglobe, which, if effectively implemented, can save \nlives. \n Malta believes that this should be a joint task for \nthe international community as a whole and calls on \nthe international community to consider immediately \nthe best means to respond to tsunami experiences with \nappropriate legal and other instruments that address the \nneed for standards of transmission of early warnings to \npopulation in the most vulnerable areas in all the \ncountries of the world. The setting of international \nstandards for preparing for phenomena such as \ntsunamis can provide countries with an appropriate up-\nto-date measuring stick and continuously upgraded \npreparation. \n The international community needs \nmultilateralism. The process of institutional reform is \nanother necessary and important component of efforts \nto enhance effective multilateralism. Over the past \nmonths, some slow progress has been made in \nfollowing up the decisions taken at last year\u2019s World \nSummit in this regard. We are all conscious of the \nefforts that need to continue at this session of the \nGeneral Assembly on various aspects of institutional \nreform, including the most sensitive one, relating to the \nenlargement and reform of the Security Council. That \nmatter has gained in urgency; the impasse should be \nbroken by flexibility and openness to a search for \ncommon ground. \n A new Secretary-General will be taking the reins \nof this Organization in the new year. The person \nelected will need all our encouragement and support to  \n \nfulfil the vital and demanding tasks of that unique \noffice. To the outgoing Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi \nAnnan, we express our immense sense of gratitude and \nadmiration for the way in which he has conducted his \nwork over the past 10 years and for his total dedication \nto the cause of peace and the international rule of law. \n The cause of peace and the international rule of \nlaw are threatened daily by cultural and religious \nincomprehension. An alliance of civilizations, mutual \nrespect and tolerance, acceptance of the other and of \ndiversity, peaceful coexistence and cooperation and \ndialogue and education are the means which the \ninternational community has at its disposal to \ncounteract the ugly phenomena of extremism and \nfanaticism. We cannot ignore this threat to peace and \nstability, a threat that is compounded by poverty and \nmass migration. We must further strengthen \nmultilateralism as a means of world governance. \n In this context, we need to keep in mind the \ngeneral without losing sight of the specific. The United \nNations must remain the focus of the debate on this \nissue and needs to continue to engage with the world \nmedia to spread the message and spirit of fraternity in a \nworld where large or small does not count. Equally, \nexperience has amply illustrated that small countries, \njust as large ones, are essential to global security, \ncultural interchange and respect and tolerance for \ndiversity. \n As a Mediterranean State, as a member of the \nEuropean Union, as current Chair-in-Office of the \nCommonwealth and, generally, as a member of the \ninternational community of States, Malta is determined \nto continue to make a contribution in all those \nforums \u2014 and in this forum \u2014 towards the interests of \npeace, justice and the rule of international law in the \nworld today and in the future.

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure \nto know that a sister from fraternal Bahrain is presiding \nover this important session of the General Assembly. \nMs. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa\u2019s leadership will certainly \ncontribute to promoting dialogue and harmony in the \nmidst of the spread of conflicts throughout the different \ncorners of the world. We are confident that she will \nsuccessfully guide the deliberations of the Assembly. \n Let me also take this opportunity to pay special \ntribute to her predecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, for his \ncommitment and diplomatic skill, which enabled him \nto effectively manage the deliberations of the \nAssembly. We likewise wish to recognize Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan for the immense efforts \nundertaken and the commendable services rendered \nduring his tenure in promoting the maintenance of \npeace and security and international cooperation. \n I wish at the outset to brief this Assembly in some \ndetail on the current situation in Somalia. The \nestablishment of the Transitional Federal Government \nof Somalia was the result of the successful peace and \nreconciliation process held in Nairobi, Kenya in 2004, \nand created a unique opportunity for ending the Somali \npolitical crisis. The Somali people were overjoyed that \na comprehensive settlement of the conflict had finally \nbeen reached. \n The advancement and consolidation of peace and \nstability requires the unwavering commitment of the \ninternational community to reinforce the Transitional \nFederal Government\u2019s national efforts in nation-\nbuilding. Regrettably, owing to circumstances not fully \nunderstood by us, the international community failed to \nact in a timely fashion to support the new Government \nin facing the enormous challenges it confronted. \nConsequently, a window of opportunity has been lost, \nwhich has led to continued violence and conflict. \n Ironically, the international community\u2019s failure \nto act also paved the way for the warlords and other \narmed groups to take advantage of a political vacuum, \nas they asserted and consolidated their power and clan-\nbased authority in the capital city, Mogadishu, and its \nenvirons. \n Although they had the privilege of holding \nimportant ministerial portfolios in the new \nGovernment, the warlords pursued their hidden agenda \nto promote their personal interests and political \nambitions by maintaining the chaotic status quo in \nSomalia. \n It is noteworthy to bear in mind that the warlords \nand the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) had initially \ncombined their forces and political rhetoric as an \nopposition alliance group against the Transitional \nFederal Government. Both groups were encouraged by \nthe reluctance of the international community to come \nquickly to the aid of the new Somali Government and \nby the continuation of the United Nations arms \nembargo against Somalia. However, the ICU soon \nrealized that the warlords were losing popularity \namong mainstream Somalis. \n At this juncture, the Transitional Federal \nGovernment, though sceptical, responded positively to \nthe initiative undertaken by the League of Arab States \nto convene peace talks and settle the differences \nbetween the parties. The first and second rounds of \nthose peace talks have successfully taken place in \nKhartoum, and both sides have agreed on general \nprinciples and some preliminary issues for the next \nround of talks scheduled to be held in Khartoum in \nOctober 2006.  \n However, as the Islamic Courts Union continued \nto rush to consolidate their grip, their concealed \nintentions are fast becoming evident to the Somali \npeople and to the international community. In this \nconnection, it will be recalled that the ICU continued \nwith impunity to expand and attack other districts \noutside Mogadishu including Jowhar, Balad, and other \nadjacent areas. The latest development of the ICU\u2019s \nterritorial expansion was the ill-advised armed attack \nand seizure of the city of Kismayo, in flagrant violation \nof the Khartoum Peace Agreement. \n \n \n29 06-53615 \n \n It should also be noted that the President of the \nTransitional Federal Government of Somalia, Mr. \nAbdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, survived a targeted \nassassination attempt on 18 September 2006. My \nGovernment firmly believes that this heinous crime is \nan act of terrorism aimed at undermining and \nsabotaging the peace process in Somalia and should be \ncondemned in the strongest terms. This heinous attack \nresulted in the death of several people, including the \nbrother of the President. We wish to express our \nappreciation to all those delegations and organizations \nthat expressed their sympathy and condemned this act.  \n These developments are all disquieting and \ndisturbing, and the situation is deteriorating to an \nalarming degree and at a rapid pace. It continues to \npose a serious threat to the peace that has been \nachieved, which has serious implications for the \nsecurity and stability of the region.  \n Despite all these violations of the Peace \nAgreement, the Transitional Federal Government \nremains committed to the path of dialogue and \nnegotiation with the ICU and relevant civil society \norganizations. But this positive attitude will not \ncontinue if the ICU persists in its aggressive policies of \nattacks and territorial expansion. \n As I stated earlier, the absence of law and order, \nthe escalation of violence and the ensuing collapse of \ncentral authority were the major causes for the chaos \nand anarchy in Somalia. The main goal of the \nTransitional Federal Government is therefore to engage \nin an effective, focused plan for the re-establishment of \ninstitutions for peace and good governance in order to \nrestore normalcy and stability in the country. We \ntherefore strongly appeal to the international \ncommunity to demonstrate a political will and a \ncommitment to redouble its efforts to provide political, \nfinancial and technical support to the Transitional \nFederal Government during this challenging \ntransitional period. \n It goes without saying that the absence of \neffective, functioning government institutions capable \nof enforcing law and order has been the underlying \ncause of the Somali conflict for the past 14 years. At \nthis crucial juncture, what Somalia urgently needs is \nimmediate and substantial support for the creation of \nan environment conducive to peace and security which \nin essence is the key requirement for reconstruction \nand economic recovery. \n The economic challenges facing the Transitional \nFederal Government of Somalia are formidable. The \ncollapse of the Somali State in 1991 resulted in \nextensive destruction of governing and management \ninstitutions which are now being re-established by the \nTransitional Federal Government in its post-conflict \nreconstruction programmes. \n It is deeply disturbing to note that over half a \nmillion children under the age of five die each year \nfrom preventable diseases, malaria being the biggest \nkiller. Moreover, over 100,000 women die each year \nfrom complications in pregnancy and childbirth. \nDespite all these hardships, the Transitional Federal \nGovernment\u2019s economic and social recovery \nprogrammes have received virtually no assistance from \ninternational donors and certainly none commensurate \nwith the massive needs of the Somali people. For far \ntoo long, Somalia was allowed to struggle alone and \nthe negative consequences have been monumental.  \n Somalia can aspire to establish the sufficient \nconditions for sustained economic growth by \nleveraging its energetic human and social capital. \nHowever, a successful and sustainable reconstruction \nand development programme requires the international \ncommunity\u2019s support of the Transitional Federal \nGovernment\u2019s determined efforts to wield \nadministrative authority and develop competence at the \nfederal, regional and district levels. This situation calls \nfor a broad-based participatory partnership approach \nfrom the family of nations and for the provision of \ntechnical assistance in the building of efficient \ninstitutions that leverage the resiliency and potential of \nthe Somali people. \n In terms of required relief assistance, it is to be \nnoted that approximately 1.8 million Somalis are still \nin need of urgent humanitarian assistance and \nlivelihood support. In view of the magnitude of this \nchallenge, my delegation appeals to the world body \nand the donor community to respond positively, \ngenerously and, above all, concertedly in order to meet \nSomalia\u2019s humanitarian needs and avert a catastrophe \nof major proportions. \n In an effort to stabilize Somalia and overcome the \nsources of insecurity, the Government has put in place \na well-marshalled National Security and Stabilization \nPlan. Both in concept and execution, the plan takes a \nholistic approach to the nature and scope of insecurity \nin the country. For its implementation, the plan takes \n  \n \n06-53615 30 \n \ninto consideration local, regional and international \ndimensions. Accordingly, it envisions the combined \nand concerted local, regional and international efforts \nin its execution. However, the realization of this plan \nremains elusive insofar as the Government is fragile \nand incapable of enforcing the policies and laws of the \nland pursuant to the Transitional Federal Charter. \n The Transitional Federal Government welcomes \nall efforts now being undertaken by the international \ncommunity in addressing the new problems and \nrealities of Somalia. It is important to note that the \nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) \nand the African Union have now finalized the details \nand salient elements of the IGAD Peace Support \nMission in Somalia. At the international level, it is also \ngratifying that the International Contact Group on \nSomalia, which was recently established, convened its \nsecond meeting in Brussels to find ways and means to \nstreamline the international engagement and support \nfor Somalia. Moreover, on its part, the United Nations \nSecurity Council is in the process of considering \nSomalia\u2019s security problems, in particular the lifting of \nthe United Nations arms embargo and the deployment \nof IGASOM to Somalia. \n All these combined activities at the regional and \ninternational levels demonstrate the heightened interest \nand attention given to Somalia. However, it remains to \nbe seen whether all these initiatives can be properly \ncoordinated and directed towards substantially \nassisting the Transitional Federal Government in its \ndaunting task of stabilizing the country. To be \nmeaningful and effective, the contributions of the \ninternational community must focus, as a matter of \npriority, on the fundamental issue of capacity-building \nfor the Transitional Federal Government institutions, \nparticularly in the security sector.  \n It is imperative that the following specific \nmeasures be taken as a matter of urgency: \n First, the United Nations arms embargo must be \nfavourably reviewed and lifted by the Security \nCouncil. Secondly, the IGAD Peace Support Mission \nshould be deployed as mandated by the African Union \nand IGAD. Thirdly, the National Security Forces must \nbe institutionalized, trained and equipped. Fourthly, the \nDemobilization, Disarmament and Reintegration \nProgramme must be undertaken throughout Somalia. \n It is also of paramount importance that a solid \nbasis for the Somali public administration be \nestablished and that a modest and lean civil service be \nrecruited and trained for the various public sector \norgans of the State. Regional administrations should be \nput in place and federal restructuring drawn and \nimplemented in conformity with the Transitional \nFederal Charter. Finally, immediate efforts should be \nexerted for the drafting of the permanent federal \nconstitution of Somalia so as to pave the way for free \nand fair elections after the completion of the \ntransitional period. \n These proposals are aimed at restoring peace and \nstability in order to assist the Transitional Federal \nGovernment in establishing functioning and effective \ninstitutions capable of providing essential basic \nservices to the people. Failure to do so would once \nagain relegate Somalia to yet another cycle of violence \nand anarchy. \n We share the desire expressed by many \ndelegations in this forum to see the United Nations \nreinvigorate its role and strengthen its capabilities with \na view to becoming more active and effective. It could \nthen guarantee the fulfilment of the objectives and \nprinciples that are enshrined in the Charter, so as to \nensure that peace on earth and international \ncooperation will continue to prevail for the welfare of \nmankind.

        "file_text": "At the \noutset, I would like to congratulate the President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-first session on her \nelection. It is a source of pride for us that an Arab \nwoman from brotherly Bahrain is presiding over the \nsession. I would also like to thank Mr. Jan Eliasson, \nPresident of the Assembly at its sixtieth session, for his \nvaluable and tireless efforts in the conduct of our work \nand for the positive results he has achieved for our \nOrganization, particularly with regard to United \nNations reform. I would also like to warmly welcome \n \n \n51 06-52885 \n \nthe Republic of Montenegro as the 192nd Member of \nour international family. \n I am pleased that this meeting coincides with a \nnew democratic achievement in my country, Yemen. \nToday, 20 September, the second direct presidential \nelection and elections for local councils have taken \nplace competitively in a free and fair atmosphere. This \ndemocratic exercise demonstrates the maturity of the \npeople of Yemen and reflects our country\u2019s \ncommitment to democracy as a peaceful means of \nsharing power and popular participation in \ndevelopment and economic and social reform. \n The recent developments in Lebanon and \nPalestine include the destruction of Lebanon\u2019s \ninfrastructure owing to aggression by the Israeli war \nmachine \u2014 which has caused the deaths of countless \ninnocent civilians, mainly women, children and the \nelderly \u2014 threats to murder or assassinate the \nleadership of Lebanon and Palestine, extrajudicial and \nother practices. These all run counter to the United \nNations Charter, the rules of international law and \ninternational agreements, including the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights and the Fourth Geneva \nConvention. The massacres committed by the Israeli \nwar machine against Lebanese and Palestinian  \ncivilians \u2014 particularly the Qana II massacre, whose \nvictims were mostly children under the age of 12 and \nwhich was witnessed by the entire world \u2014 have \nevoked feelings of denunciation and condemnation by \nall people. This requires a firmer stance in the face of \nIsraeli policies based on violence and State terrorism. \n It is even more regrettable that the United \nNations stands by and watches helplessly while the \nLebanese people are subjected to devastation and \ndestruction caused by Israeli aggression over 34 days. \nWe would like to reiterate that the implementation of \nSecurity Council 1701 (2006) should not undermine \nthe territorial integrity of Lebanon and should not lead \nto sectarian divisions among the people of that country. \nIt should also mandate that Israel compensate Lebanon \nfor all the destruction. \n Israeli practices, such as assassinations of \nPalestinian individuals, detention of the President of \nthe Palestinian Parliament, the Deputy Prime Minister \nor other Ministers, are a perfect example of Israel\u2019s \ntotal disregard for international law, human rights, or \nagreements signed with the Palestinian Authority. This \nmakes it incumbent upon the Security Council to \nfirmly deal with such Israeli aggression, to demand the \nrelease of all Palestinian leaders under detention and in \nIsraeli prisons, and to deal with the Arab-Israeli \nconflict neutrally and responsibly. It is only thus that \nthe Middle East can enjoy stability and Israel can enjoy \nsecurity. \n In order to achieve a just and comprehensive \npeace, Arab countries have requested that the Security \nCouncil consider the Arab-Israeli conflict file \nresponsibly and fairly in order to put an end to the \nconflict and to spare the region further wars and \nconflicts. If the Security Council fails to do that, then it \nwill bear the responsibility for continuing the conflict \nin the region, with the attendant suffering and dire \nconsequences for all parties concerned. \n From this rostrum, we call upon the international \ncommunity to stand beside the elected Iraqi \nGovernment, to help it spread its authority over its \nterritory, to put an end to violence and interference by \nexternal parties in the internal affairs of Iraq, to respect \nthe territorial integrity of Iraq and to put an end to its \noccupation. \n With regard to the Sudan, we reiterate our \nsupport for the efforts by the Sudanese Government to \nbring peace to Darfur, in accordance with the security \nplan presented to the Security Council. The decision to \nextend the mandate of the African Union forces until \nthe end of December of this year is welcome. Provision \nof adequate logistics and increasing the number of \nthese peacekeeping forces will enable them to play \ntheir role. The dispatch of any international forces \nwithout the agreement of the Government of the Sudan \nconstitutes a violation of the principles of the United \nNations Charter. \n With regard to Somalia, Yemen would like to \ncommend the Arab-African efforts for conciliation \nbetween the Transitional Somali Government and the \nUnion of Islamic Shariah Courts, and the outcome of \nthe talks held at Khartoum under the sponsorship of the \nLeague of Arab States from 1 to 5 September. We call \nupon all international parties to provide support to the \nSomali Government so as to enable it to reconstruct the \ncountry and re-establish State institutions. Yemen has \nalways been a partner in the conciliation process and \nsupports all efforts by all parties. Yemen emphasizes \nthat any external interference in Somalia\u2019s affairs could \nlead to violence and confrontation in the Horn of \nAfrica. \n  \n \n06-52885 52 \n \n Yemen underlines the right of all countries to \npossess nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. We \nhave reiterated our commitment to the General \nAssembly declaration to make the Middle East a region \nfree of all weapons of mass destruction, including \nnuclear weapons, and to compel Israel to comply with \nthe Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in order to \nguarantee stability in the region and to avoid a nuclear \nrace. \n Given our concern for the promotion of trust \namong all countries seeking to develop their nuclear \nenergy for peaceful purposes, we call upon all to \ncooperate in the creation of a joint entity for nuclear \nresearch for peaceful purposes, in cooperation with the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. \n Yemen has reiterated its condemnation of \nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We \nbelieve that this phenomenon, which is alien to our \nsocieties and to the religion of Islam, can be attributed \nto many factors, including a feeling of lack of \ninternational justice, the spread of misleading \njudgements and decrees, and misconceptions of others \nbased on race or religion. Such factors have \nundermined trust among people and have led to the \nspread of extremism and terrorism.  \n An international conference should be convened \nto reach an agreement on an accurate definition of \nterrorism and to deal with its root causes, such as \npoverty, unemployment, lack of education and the \nabsence of international justice. A distinction should \nalso be made between terror against innocent civilians \nand the legitimate right of people to resist foreign \noccupation. \n The Republic of Yemen would like to reiterate its \ncommitment to the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs) adopted in 2000 and to the Monterrey \nConsensus. We are convinced that the mobilization of \nfinancial resources for development and their effective \nuse in developing countries and in countries with \neconomies in transition are essential for the realization \nof a genuine global partnership for development. \n We would like to stress here the need to grant \ndeveloping countries greater freedom in the \ndevelopment and management of their development \nprogrammes, in accordance with their national \npriorities and their special situations, in conformity \nwith international strategies for development. \n Based on our belief that the individual should be \nthe focus of development and its ultimate objective, we \nhave given utmost priority to the MDGs and have \nmainstreamed them in our policies and five-year \ndevelopment plan, 2006-2010, as well as integrated \nthem into the economic, environmental and social \naspects of our plans. \n We have thus adopted a series of measures and \nactions for reform in the financial, administrative and \njudicial fields, the most recent of which is the total \nseparation of the judiciary power from the executive \npower and the appointment of an independent chief \njudge of the country\u2019s judicial authority. We have also \ninvolved civil society organizations, which are key \npartners in economic and political development and \nprogress, and have cooperated with donor countries, \nspecialized agencies and international organizations in \nthe implementation of our second five-year plan for the \nalleviation of poverty. That plan is based on small \nprojects and on the expansion of technical education, \nthe provision of basic services, the promotion of good \ngovernance and the fight against corruption. It is an \nambitious plan that we believe requires international \nsupport in order to achieve its objective and result in a \nqualitative leap in human development in Yemen. \n At the beginning of the twenty-first century, we \nmust review the system of international relations to \nbase it more on trust, dialogue and cooperation. We all \nare in agreement that democracy and the enjoyment of \nfreedoms are at the core of desired reform, and here I \nshould like to stress that the reform of national and of \ninternational policies are two sides of the same coin. \n Democracy in international relations helps to \npromote democracy in national policies and is a \ngenuine motive for it. That requires that the United \nNations itself be an example to follow in terms of the \nexercise of democracy. Thus reform and restructuring \nof the United Nations is required, as well as its \nrevitalization and the restoration of its international \nstanding and prestige, including through the expansion \nof the membership of the Security Council to include \nrepresentation by all continents. That should be done in \nan equitable manner that guarantees representation by \nall cultures and civilizations and also assigns a more \nprominent role to the Economic and Social Council in \nelaborating international policies relating to economic \nand social issues and in the follow-up of their \nimplementation. It should be done also in a manner \nthat promotes international efforts to move \n \n \n53 06-52885 \n \ndevelopment forward and assist developing countries \nto realize the MDGs. \n In conclusion, and on behalf of the Government \nof the Republic of Yemen, I should like to extend our \nthanks and deep appreciation to Secretary-General Kofi \nAnnan for his tireless and dedicated efforts in the \nconduct of the Organization during his two terms of \noffice, working, patiently and diligently, in the service \nof humanity. I would like to wish him every success in \nhis future endeavours. "

        "file_text": "It is an honour for me to \naddress the General Assembly at its sixty-first session \non behalf of my country, Jamaica. \n I would like to congratulate Ms. Haya Rashed \nAl-Khalifa on her election as President of the \nAssembly. It is a particular pleasure for me today to \nacknowledge that achievement, as she is one of only \nthree women in the history of the General Assembly to \nhave occupied that post, and \u2014 significantly \u2014 the \nfirst since 1969, nearly 40 years ago. \n I would also take this opportunity to express deep \nappreciation for the work carried out during the sixtieth \nsession of the Assembly by Mr. Jan Eliasson, under \nwhose leadership so much was accomplished in an \nextraordinarily challenging year, notably the adoption \nof the World Summit Outcome Document. \n As we begin this new United Nations year, we \nask ourselves, \u201cWhat is the state of our world?\u201d We ask \nthis particularly in the context of the determination and \nresolution of our leaders in 2005 to urgently address \nthe issue of the storm clouds which were threatening \nthe vast majority of humankind, particularly in the \ndeveloping world. We see a continued challenging time \nahead for development, for peace and security, for \ndemocracy and social institutions and for \nmultilateralism. We see an environment in which the \ncredibility of the international system to deliver fairly \nand equitably is being increasingly questioned. \n These were the very issues and circumstances \nwhich world leaders sought to address at the beginning \nof the sixtieth session in 2005. Their Summit Outcome \nDocument contained a raft of resolutions, commitments \nand recommendations to deal with fundamental issues \nand constraints, and was intended to give political \nmomentum to achieving the commonly agreed \ndevelopment goals, including the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. The leaders, while recognizing \nthat development, peace and security and human rights \nare interlinked and mutually reinforcing, reaffirmed \nthat development is a central goal in and of itself. \n Jamaica remains deeply committed to the three \npillars of the United Nations, but considers \ndevelopment to be at the very core. For this reason, \nJamaica is concerned about the fact that we have not \ndiscerned any significant focus on implementation in \nthe area of development over the past year \u2014 a year \ndedicated to implementation. The implementation gap \nhas been greater in this area than in either of the other \ntwo areas. \n Increased, albeit still insufficient, attention is \nbeing accorded to those who live in extreme poverty \u2014 \nthose living on less than $1 per day. The Secretary-\nGeneral cited some startling statistics in his report on \n  \n \n06-53615 22 \n \nthe work of the Organization. I would like to refer to \ntwo examples: 10 million children die before their fifth \nbirthday, and women in developing countries are 45 \ntimes more likely to die during pregnancy than women \nin developed countries. That is irrefutable evidence \nthat the situation remains in absolute and comparative \nterms, deeply unsatisfactory and unsustainable in an \ninterdependent world. \n Jamaica and other developing countries \nconsistently argued in all the debates leading up to and \nduring the 2005 Summit that, in addition to the poorest \ncountries, the situation of vulnerable middle- and \nlower- middle-income countries, especially small \nisland and highly externally dependent economies, \nneeded to be addressed. A number of potentially very \nuseful provisions were incorporated into the Summit \nOutcome document to address their particular \ncircumstances. But, frankly, Jamaica has seen little \nresolve on the part of the international community to \nimplement those commitments. We have seen no work, \nfor example, to implement the commitment to support \nthe development efforts of middle-income developing \ncountries to help them meet, among other things, their \nfinancial, technical and technological requirements. \nNor have we seen any effort to develop a framework \nfor providing significant debt relief or restructuring for \nmiddle-income developing countries with \nunsustainable debt burdens that are not part of the \nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative, or to \ncomprehensively address the debt problems of those \ncountries. Thirdly, there has been no effort to \nimplement the development dimension of the Doha \nWork Programme, in particular the World Trade \nOrganization\u2019s Work Programme on Small Economies. \n We recognize that there was a welcome increase \nin official development assistance from $69 million in \n2003 to $106 million in 2005. Much of the additional \nfunding was targeted to a small number of admittedly \nvery deserving countries \u2014 mainly for debt relief \u2014 \nand to peacekeeping. There was little new money for \ninvestment in development projects, even in the \npoorest countries. \n It has always been recognized that many of the \nresources for financing development must come from \ntrade. That was clearly stated in the Monterrey \nConsensus (A/CONF.198/11) and repeated in the 2005 \nSummit Outcome Document (resolution 60/1). In the \nOutcome Document, leaders of developed and \ndeveloping countries committed to work expeditiously \ntowards implementing the development dimensions of \nthe Doha Work Programme. They also emphasized the \nneed to address weak and volatile commodity prices \nand to support the efforts of commodity-dependent \ncountries to restructure, diversify and strengthen the \ncompetitiveness of their commodity sectors. \n Instead of expedition and facilitation, we have \nseen stalemate and breakdown in the Doha round of \nnegotiations. Perhaps even more significant is the fact \nthat, in the negotiations that did take place, the \ndevelopment dimension \u2014 especially as it relates to \nsmall and vulnerable economies such as that of \nJamaica \u2014 was conspicuously absent from the debate. \nThese issues must be addressed in any effort to restart \nthe negotiations. \n Jamaica strongly supports the view that \nfundamental to a viable and equitable trade regime is \nthe need to take account of the wide disparity in \nstructural characteristics and approaches to economic \npolicy among the many members of the World Trade \nOrganization, and the consequent need for flexibility. \nWe would add, for clarity, the need to include the \ndifferences in levels of development among economies \nand the asymmetries existing between developed and \ndeveloping countries. \n As a small country with a debt burden of more \nthan 125 per cent of its gross domestic product; a \ncountry whose exports have been falling in value and \nwhose markets are threatened by the current uncritical \napproach to globalization and trade liberalization; a \ncountry dependent on imported petroleum for more \nthan 90 per cent of its commercial energy and whose \nenergy bill was more than $1 billion in 2005; an island \nvulnerable to a range of natural hazards and still \nworking to recover from major hurricanes and droughts \nin 2004 and 2005; and a country whose skilled \nprofessionals \u2014 doctors, nurses, teachers and scientists \nin particular \u2014 are targeted by some major developed \ncountries, Jamaica understands the need for a \ncollaborative and facilitative international environment \nand for coherence in policies. Successful \nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals \ncannot be assured in the face of those challenges. \n Jamaica recognizes that there can be no sustained \ndevelopment, no poverty eradication and no lasting \npeace without the advancement, equality and \nempowerment of women. Women\u2019s advancement is a \n \n \n23 06-53615 \n \npriority of our national policy, and we support all \ninternational initiatives to that end. \n We are encouraged by action aimed at \nimplementing some of the mandates agreed at the 2005 \nSummit. In the area of international peace and security, \nthe Peacebuilding Commission has been established, \nwith an emphasis on addressing post-conflict \nsituations. Jamaica has the honour to be a founding \nmember of that body and will be actively involved in \nthe achievement of its objectives. With regard to \nhuman rights, the Human Rights Council has been \nestablished. In the field of humanitarian affairs, the \nCentral Emergency Response Fund has been \nestablished, and an agreement has been reached on the \nprotection of humanitarian personnel. We welcome the \nfinalization of the draft Comprehensive and Integral \nInternational Convention on Protection and Promotion \nof the Rights and Dignity of Persons with Disabilities \nand look forward to its formal adoption later this year. \nWe welcome also the 2006 Political Declaration on \nHIV/AIDS (resolution 60/262), adopted at the High-\nlevel Meeting on HIV/AIDS. We urge the full \nimplementation of those decisions to comprehensively \ntackle this scourge in the most seriously affected \ncountries and regions. For the Caribbean region, \nHIV/AIDS is a major human, social and economic \nchallenge. \n The recent High-level Dialogue on International \nMigration and Development, convened in keeping with \nthe mandate of the 2005 World Summit, and the \npublication of the United Nations Population Fund\u2019s \n2006 State of World Population report have been very \ntimely. They highlighted, among other things, the \nmultidimensional nature of international migration, its \nimportance in the globalization process and the \npotential for further widening of the development gap \nbetween rich and poor countries. They raised a number \nof critical issues for the attention of the international \ncommunity.  \n Jamaica is particularly concerned about the \nselectivity in the policies of developed countries, their \ndeliberate targeting of critical skilled professionals of \ndeveloping countries, accompanied by the tightening of \ntheir general immigration laws against the unskilled \nand the young, and their systematic and wholesale \nrepatriation of those who run into difficulty with their \nlaws \u2014 especially hardened criminals, many of whom \nhave little or no connection, if they ever did, with the \nreceiving developing country. Those policies are \ninconsistent, counterproductive and, with all due \nrespect, frankly wrong. They demand the urgent \nattention of the international community. We look \nforward to these issues being studied and given the \nrequired attention at the follow-up meeting to be held \nin Belgium in March 2007. \n We note the continued emphasis on the \nstrengthening of the United Nations and the adoption \nof reform measures aimed at improving accountability \nand transparency and at enhancing the effectiveness \nand efficiency of the work of the Secretariat in \nimplementing the programmes mandated by Member \nStates. We stress that reform should ensure the \nstrengthening of the United Nations. That should be \nour motivation. We should never allow reform to erode \nthe fundamental institutional framework of the United \nNations or the right of each Member State to be fully \ninvolved in the Organization\u2019s decision-making \nprocesses and to contribute to advancing its goals and \nideals. That right has been the fundamental strength of \nthe United Nations and what sets it apart from many \nother multilateral institutions. It is and should remain \nthe standard. \n Geopolitical realities have changed significantly \nsince the establishment of the United Nations. It is \ntherefore logical that the Security Council should be \nreflective of the contemporary international community \nas a whole, on the basis of equitable geographical \nrepresentation and greater representation of developing \ncountries. How can it be that less than 5 per cent of the \nmembership of the Organization continues to wield \ninordinate power over the rest of us? That is \nundemocratic and, ultimately, unsustainable. It is on \nthat basis that Jamaica supports expansion in both \ncategories of Council membership, with increased \nrepresentation for all regional groups. \n Jamaica underscores the vital importance of \ncoherence in policy action and advice among the \nUnited Nations and other international institutions, \nincluding the international financial institutions, as \nwell as regional organizations, in the effort to facilitate \nand encourage development, especially that of the \nsmall, vulnerable and otherwise disadvantaged \ncountries. \n Over the years, Jamaica has experienced more \nthan its fair share in terms of the adverse impact of \nincoherent international policies and advice. I will \nprovide just three examples. First, Jamaica has been \n  \n \n06-53615 24 \n \nforced to hold a large fund of international reserves in \ndeveloped countries. At the end of August 2006, \nJamaica\u2019s net international reserves stood at \napproximately $2.2 billion, or 18 weeks of imported \ngoods and services, while the country needs foreign \nexchange to facilitate investment projects.  \n Secondly, Jamaica has entered into international \ncommitments under the Millennium Development \nGoals, inter alia to expand education and health care, \nto enhance environmental protection, to strengthen \nrural development and to improve housing and \nsanitation. These are all labour-intensive activities. The \nInternational Monetary Fund, without providing any \nanalysis, is giving advice and insisting that Jamaica \nreduce its public service drastically.  \n Thirdly, Jamaica is forced to compete with the \nsalaries being offered by developed countries such as \nCanada, the United Kingdom and the United States to \nlarge categories of employees, including teachers and \nnurses, while seeking to reduce its fiscal deficit. This is \none of the major difficulties that the Government is \nfacing in its current wage negotiations with the \nmembers of some of these categories, with a view to \ncompleting its second memorandum of understanding \nwith public sector workers. \n The United Nations has a major responsibility to \nlead in the quest for coherence in international \neconomic programmes and policies. Jamaica believes \nthat a fortified United Nations, in particular a \nstrengthened Economic and Social Council, is vital if \nthat role is to be effective. \n We continue to live in very turbulent times. \nGlobal peace, security and stability continue to be \nelusive. All the multilateral gains that we have made in \nrecent years will come to little if existing conflict \nsituations are not resolved and if new military \ninterventions, acts of terrorism and other debilitating \nthreats to peace, security and development arise. \n We must continue to emphasize the critical \nimportance of multilateral diplomacy, even-handedness \nand maximum restraint. We must reinforce the \nmutually beneficial relationships among us as a \ncommunity of nations. We must equip the United \nNations to act, and act decisively, when necessary. In \nthat regard, we welcome Security Council resolution \n1701 (2006) and look forward to every effort being \nmade to build on this new platform to secure a lasting \npeace in the Middle East. \n We cannot remain indifferent to the tragic plight \nof the people of Darfur, the Sudan. History has \nrepeatedly demonstrated that indifference emboldens \nthose who seek to act with impunity, resulting in even \ngreater atrocities and humanitarian crises. The \ninternational community must act urgently to promote \nhuman security and to protect the lives of innocent \ncivilians. \n Disarmament and non-proliferation go hand in \nhand. It is only through the total elimination of nuclear \nweapons and other weapons of mass destruction that \ninternational peace and security can be assured. \nJamaica is therefore disheartened that the international \ncommunity failed to seize the opportunities provided \nby the 2005 Review Conference of the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and by the \nWorld Summit to make significant progress on this \nissue. \n Jamaica and other countries in the Caribbean \nregion have to confront major security concerns as a \nresult of the ease of access to illicit small arms and \nammunition and the linkages to transnational organized \ncrime, including drug trafficking. Jamaica feels a deep \nsense of disappointment that the 2006 Conference to \nReview Progress Made in the Implementation of the \nProgramme of Action to Prevent, Combat and \nEradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light \nWeapons in All Its Aspects failed to conclude an \noutcome document which would have introduced \nimprovements in the implementation of the Programme \nof Action. Jamaica will continue to advocate for the \ncreation of a legally binding instrument which more \nstrictly controls the illegal trade in small arms and light \nweapons and ammunition. \n The recent adoption of the United Nations Global \nCounter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288) is a \nvery clear demonstration that the international \ncommunity can come together to confront major threats \nto civility, the rule of law and international peace and \nsecurity. This should be our modus operandi. \n We have been particularly encouraged by \ndevelopments in Haiti, which have led to the \ndemocratic election of the Government of President \nRen\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val. In July, Haiti was able to again take its \nrightful place in CARICOM. Coupled with the renewal \nof the mandate of the United Nations Stabilization \nMission in Haiti until February 2007, attention can \nnow be focused on institution- and capacity-building, \n \n \n25 06-53615 \n \nas well as on reconstruction and other initiatives for \neconomic and social development in that country. \n The bicentenary of the abolition of the trans-\nAtlantic slave trade in the British Empire will be \nmarked in 2007. For all CARICOM countries this is a \nspecial anniversary based on shared history. To \nsymbolize the occasion, CARICOM members will be \nintroducing a draft resolution at this session of the \nGeneral Assembly with the expectation that the \nAssembly will appropriately recognize the event. We \nlook forward to the support of all delegations. \n Jamaica strongly reaffirms its commitment to the \nUnited Nations and the multilateral process. Our \ncontinued commitment at all levels, including our \nsupport for the work of the International Seabed \nAuthority, remains firm. \n Before closing, I would like to take this \nopportunity to pay special tribute to the Secretary-\nGeneral for his outstanding leadership in guiding the \nwork of the Organization over the past 10 years. He \nhas faced the challenges of our times. He has re-\nengineered the position of Secretary-General to \nbecome the face, voice and conscience of the \ninternational community. He has brought civil society, \nnon-governmental organizations and the private sector \ninto the United Nations. He has leveraged and brought \ninto international service high achievers in a range of \ndisciplines. And he has increased opportunities for \nconsultation and dialogue. We wish him the very best. \n Jamaica looks forward to a transparent and \ninclusive process to provide our Organization with a \nnew Secretary-General who enjoys the confidence of \nthe full membership.

We are all aware of the direct impact of \nthose issues on peace, security, development, justice \nand democracy throughout the world.  \n We wish to stress the resolutions and the \nimportant work of the United Nations between the two \nsessions, namely conferences and summits dealing with \nthe information society and the HIV/AIDS pandemic, \nas well as meetings on development, alleviating \npoverty, protecting the environment, promoting the \nadvancement of women, and dealing with \nunemployment and the issues of migration. \n How we meet the need for development, security \nand peace throughout the world will depend on how we \ndeal with the issues of violence and terrorism. Since \nthe phenomenon of terrorism is universal in nature, the \nsolution to it must also be found through a global \nvision that is anchored in understanding and dialogue \nbetween civilizations and nations, a vision that rejects \nconfrontation and conflict and seeks to overcome \npoverty, illiteracy and social, scientific and technical \nunderdevelopment. \n In Mauritania we reject terrorism in all its forms \nand manifestations.

That is the only way to put an end to the \nconflict in the Middle East, on the basis of \ninternational resolutions, the Arab Peace Initiative and \nthe Road Map, which will guarantee the Israeli \nwithdrawal from all occupied Arab territories in \nPalestine, Syria and Lebanon and allow the Palestinian \npeople to restore its legitimate rights and establish an \nindependent State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. \n With regard to Western Sahara, Mauritania \nsupports the measures taken by the United Nations and \nits Secretary-General to find a lasting solution that \nguarantees stability in that region and enjoys the \nsupport of all stakeholders. \n Concerning Iraq, we are following very closely \nthe changing political, security and humanitarian \nsituation in that fraternal country. We note with \nsatisfaction the success achieved by the Iraqi \nGovernment in rebuilding State institutions. We \nreaffirm our support for the unity of Iraq, its territorial \nintegrity and independence and for non-interference in \nits internal affairs. \n After the changes of 3 August 2005, the Islamic \nRepublic of Mauritania ushered in a new era in its \npolitical history. The new era started with the creation \nof a pluralist, democratic system based on the \nguarantee of equality and justice for all. It enshrines \nthe peaceful assumption of authority and transparency \nin management and administrative reform, while firmly \nestablishing the mechanisms of good governance. \n These choices have been implemented on the \nbasis of a sound experiment carried out throughout the \ncountry using all the active forces of our people, \nincluding civil institutions, political parties, trade \nunions and the transition Government, through a \nprogramme of action for justice and democracy that \nhas been implemented with the informed and effective \nparticipation of all stakeholders. It includes \nconstitutional reform, reform of the administration of \njustice, administrative reform to combat corruption, \nand reform of the electoral system by creating an \nindependent national electoral commission on the basis \nof transparency and by encouraging the participation of \nwomen. \n In order to ensure total neutrality in the elections, \nthe Military Council for Justice and Democracy has \ndecreed that the President, members of the Military \nCouncil, the Prime Minister and members of the \ncivilian transition Government are ineligible to take \npart in future municipal, legislative and presidential \nelections. \n The absence of real democracy, free choice and \nfair elections led the Military Council for Justice and \nDemocracy to intervene to end the political stalemate \nthat the country was experiencing before 3 August \n2005. \n Here, on behalf of the Mauritanian people, I \nwould like to thank sincerely all fraternal and friendly \ncountries and international organizations and bodies \nthat have supported our reform process and helped and \nsupported us through its various stages. \n Mauritania is keen to contribute to strengthening \nthe links of fraternity, cooperation and solidarity in its \nregion, in line with the common aspirations of our \n  \n \n06-52988 30 \n \npeoples. Within this framework, we affirm our \nunswerving faith in building an Arab Maghreb as a \nstrategic, non-negotiable choice. \n We are also profoundly attached to the spirit of \nfraternity and solidarity on our African continent and to \nthe close relations that link our country to all fraternal \nAfrican countries. Our country will continue to be \nfaithful to strengthening the basis for dialogue, \nexchange and understanding between peoples and \ncivilizations, particularly within the 5+5 forum and the \nBarcelona Euro-Mediterranean process. \n The major changes that have taken place on the \ninternational scene in recent years require a review and \nreform of the organs and method of work of the United \nNations \u2014 in particular, by revitalizing the role of the \nGeneral Assembly and ensuring respect for its \nresolutions, by reactivating the Economic and Social \nCouncil and by making the Security Council more \nrepresentative. All this should aim to take account not \nonly of important regions in the world, such as Africa \nand Latin America, or important regional groups, but \nalso of industrialized countries that make major \ncontributions to the United Nations, such as Germany \nand Japan. \n We also believe that the Security Council today \nmust improve its methods of work so that it can fulfill \nits task of maintaining international peace and security. \n In closing, I would like to express the wish that \nthe work of this session will be crowned with success.

        "file_text": "It is indeed a great pleasure to address this \nGeneral Assembly on the International Day of Peace, \nin my capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs and \nCooperation. The Government of Spain calls for a \nvigorous United Nations system that can guarantee \ninternational peace and security in a world that is \nglobal, complex and full of uncertainty.  \n I should like to congratulate our President on her \nelection as the first Arab woman to lead the \nAssembly \u2014 a task in which, I predict, she will have \ngreat success. She can count on the full commitment \nand cooperation of Spain. I also wish to express my \ngratitude and congratulations to Mr. Jan Eliasson, \nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Sweden and President \nof the General Assembly at its most recent session. His \nleadership and negotiating skills contributed to the \nadoption of far-reaching political agreements aimed at \nthe implementation of the 2005 World Summit \nOutcome (resolution 60/1).  \n Understanding and cooperation among countries \nwill clear up the unanswered questions of the twenty-\nfirst century \u2014 a century characterized by \nglobalization, which has spread throughout the world, \npervading areas of daily life and causing \ntransformations in the power of States and the system \nof international relations. \n In their analysis of that complex and uncertain \nreality, political theoreticians sometimes turn to \nscientific knowledge, but its formulations fail to \nprovide concrete measures to deal effectively with the \npolitical and institutional challenges of the twenty-first \ncentury. New times call for new politics that cannot be \ninfluenced in any way by fear, distrust or suspicion in \nthe international community. The factors and events \nthat shape today\u2019s international relations must not \ndistract or hold back the innovative spirit of political \naction. \n Today, we know that technology alone does not \nlead to progress with regard to security and social and \neconomic growth. Globalization has great individual \nand collective benefits. It is a mixture of contradictory \ntrends \u2014 hope and despair, humanism and barbarity \u2014 \nin which we find serious imbalances that must be \naddressed with political courage and confidence. \n This new era has not resolved old conflicts that \nare eroding international peace and security. The \nsituation in the Middle East is the present-day version \nof a historical conflict that has challenged the \ninternational community. The adoption of Security \nCouncil resolution 1701 (2006) and the cessation of \nhostilities open the way for hope that the necessary \nconditions will be created for a lasting peace. We have \nalready endured more than five decades of suffering \nand despair. We have already endured five decades of \nappealing in this forum for a definitive solution. We \nhave endured five decades of the international \ncommunity\u2019s impotence. \n From this rostrum, I call for a coalition for peace. \nThis is not about rediscovering the Mediterranean; it is \nabout commitment. We must say \u201cyes\u201d to the creation \nof a democratic, viable and peaceful Palestinian State \nthat lives in peace and security with the State of Israel; \n\u201cyes\u201d to full support for President Mahmoud Abbas; \n\u201cyes\u201d to ending the violence and terror against Israel; \n\u201cyes\u201d to reactivating the Madrid Process, which began \n15 years ago; \u201cyes\u201d to a global peace that includes \nSyria and Lebanon; and, finally, \u201cyes\u201d to an end to this \ntragedy. \n The only possible way to find a solution is \npolitical and diplomatic action, not military action. We \nmust rebuild a dynamic of negotiation to permanently \neradicate violence from this region, which is bleeding \nto death as a result of misunderstanding and pain. \n \n \n39 06-53005 \n \n My Government hopes that all actors involved in \nthe region commit themselves to implementing \nresolution 1701 (2006) and to the tasks in southern \nLebanon that have been entrusted to the United Nations \nInterim Force in Lebanon, in which Spanish troops are \nparticipating. We must give peace and dialogue another \nchance. \n From the eastern Mediterranean, I now turn to the \nwestern Mediterranean. Spain pays particular attention \nto its neighbourly relations with the Maghreb, a region \nwith regard to which we maintain an active and \ncomprehensive policy that strengthens our friendship \nand cooperation. That is why we attach importance to \nthe relaunching of the process of building a united \nMaghreb. \n To accelerate the pace of that project, we will \nneed to find a negotiated and effective solution to the \nconflict in Western Sahara, which has lasted for more \nthan 30 years and urgently calls for an atmosphere \nconducive to breaking the current deadlock. The \ninternational community must create such an \natmosphere to ensure a just and lasting political \nagreement that respects the principle of self-\ndetermination, within the United Nations framework. \n The will to engage in dialogue and compromise \ncould clear up this old conflict, as was the case with \nGibraltar. I am pleased to inform the Assembly that the \nTripartite Forum of Dialogue on Gibraltar, which met \nlast Monday in Cordoba, has already adopted its first \nagreements, which reflect the spirit of the relevant \nUnited Nations resolutions. Those agreements in no \nway mean that my Government renounces its \nsovereignty over Gibraltar. \n Relations with Ibero-America are a constant \npriority of the Government of Spain in its foreign \npolicy. We are committed to promoting the cohesion, \ngrowth and visibility of the Ibero-American \ncommunity, with which we maintain historic ties and \nshare new strategies and objectives. The Ibero-\nAmerican Secretariat, which is participating here for \nthe first time as an observer, strengthens our \ncommunity through dialogue and coordination. The \nforthcoming summit to be held in Uruguay will assess \nongoing activities and propose measures to begin anew \nthe social, economic, cultural and political progress \ndemanded by the civil societies of the Ibero-American \ncommunity. \n The President returned to the Chair. \n Cooperation and understanding also guide our \ntrans-Atlantic relations and, in a very special way, our \nrelations with the United States. In a constructive \nspirit, we discuss concerns and long-term projects that \nstrengthen the international community. \n As multilateral actors, we know that many of our \ndifficulties and problems will not be resolved through \nvoluntarism or national action. Our action must be on a \nglobal scale if we are to effectively address them in all \ntheir complexity \u2014 particularly the new challenges \nfacing the international community that hinder the \npromotion of a more just and equitable globalization.  \n A sense of political responsibility leads us to \nresolve urgent global problems such as security and \nterrorism, to fight hunger and poverty and to manage \nmigratory flows. Through the coordination of the \nUnited Nations, the world must promote the causes of \nsustainable development, security and human rights. \nWe cannot have security without development, there \ncan be no development without security, and we will \nnot attain those objectives if human rights are not \nrespected. \n We cannot accept terrorism, regardless of its \norigin. Our acceptance would transform it into terror \nand would unleash a spiral of fear in which freedoms \nwould suffer. We must not let down our guard against \nterrorism; neither must we let down our guard against \nthe erosion of freedoms. The Government of Spain \nwelcomes the adoption of the Global Counter-\nTerrorism Strategy, which does not overlook victims \nand their families. \n Situations of extreme poverty and humanitarian \ncatastrophes are inconceivable at the beginning of the \ntwenty-first century. We must deepen our sincere \ncommitment to the Millennium Development Goals \nand to the fight against hunger and poverty in order to \nalleviate the uncertainty, hardship and despair that \naffect millions of citizens throughout the world.  \n The traditional areas of Spanish action have been \nbroadened and reinforced through the progressive \nconsolidation of an advanced cooperation policy. Spain \nhas increased the quality and quantity of its Official \nDevelopment Assistance (ODA), which will reach 0.5 \nper cent of our gross domestic product (GDP) in 2008. \nSpain\u2019s contribution to international organizations and \ntrust funds has increased this year by more than 400 \nper cent. \n  \n \n06-53005 40 \n \n Spain\u2019s development aid has been expanded in \nthe Mediterranean countries and the African continent, \nwhere planning has played an important role. The plan \nfor Africa has required a major effort of cooperation \nand commitment to deal with dramatic situations of \npoverty and sickness, which jeopardize the well-being \nof African societies. \n Future programs, such as the one proposed by \nPresident Wade of Senegal, merit all our consideration \nand support. Poverty has brought us a new global \nchallenge, namely, the management of migration flows, \nsince hunger and need know no borders. Inequalities in \nthe distribution of wealth, unemployment, the lack of \nfuture prospects, political instability, inadequate \nrespect for human rights and intolerable life conditions \npush more than 200 million people in the whole world \nto migrate. The demographic impacts of these flows are \nperceived not just in countries of origin, but also those \nof transit and destination. Therefore, immigration is \none of the greatest challenges of the twenty-first \ncentury and Spain is on the frontline. We must confront \nit in all its aspects, both internal and external, with \nmeasures for development assistance and border \ncontrols. \n Migrations, exchanges and communications \ntechnologies have given birth to a multicultural society \nthat is not without tensions. This emerging reality \nstimulates the appearance of challenges that demand a \ncritical analysis in order to build solid bridges between \nEast and West. \n The initiative of the Alliance of Civilizations, \nsponsored by Spain and Turkey, belongs today to the \ninternational community and the United Nations and \nseeks to provide answers to these challenges. The \nmanagement of cultural relations can only be achieved \nfrom the perspective of security, education, promotion \nof culture and interreligious dialogue. This respect \namongst the different cultures and creeds must \nencourage the reduction of frictions that could inspire \nviolence and terror. The cartoon crisis and the effects \nand wrong interpretations of the words of His Holiness \nthe Pope urgently demand the implementation of the \nAlliance of Civilizations. \n The twenty-first century will be the time when we \nare called upon to resolve old conflicts and confront \nnew global challenges effectively. For that, a reform is \nneeded in the United Nations. The Government of \nSpain is satisfied with the reform process in the areas \nof peace and security, development and human rights. \nThe Peacebuilding Commission, the Human Rights \nCouncil, the United Nations Democracy Fund, the \nGlobal Strategy against Terrorism and the Central \nEmergency Relief Fund are new instruments that have \na bearing on the challenges facing the international \ncommunity. \n Allow me to conclude with a few verses of the \nuniversal Spanish poet Federico Garcia Lorca, from his \nbook \u201cPoet in New York\u201d,  \n \u201cIf hope is extinguished and the Babel of \nincomprehension begins, what torch will light the \npaths of the Earth?\u201d \nLet us not give up the dream of peace. Let us work \ntogether to achieve it. "

        "file_text": "I am \nhonoured to address the Assembly on behalf of the \nGovernment and people of Haiti. Allow me, first, to \noffer my heartfelt congratulations to Ms. Haya Rashed \nAl-Khalifa on her election to the presidency of the \nGeneral Assembly in its sixty-first session. I am \nconvinced that her wealth of legal training, her \nprofound knowledge of public affairs, her national and \ninternational career and her keen negotiating skills \nmean that this session will be a success. Allow me to \nreiterate to the President the full support of my country \nand of the Haitian delegation in discharging her lofty \ntasks. \n I wish also to congratulate Ambassador Jan \nEliasson, whose practical spirit, his sense of \ncompromise and great know-how, meant that the \nsixtieth session was a successful one. I wish him every \nsuccess in his new job as his country\u2019s Minister for \nForeign Affairs.  \n I wish to convey to the Secretary-General, His \nExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan, sincere thanks for the skill \nwith which he has conducted the Organization over the \npast 10 years. I congratulate him also on his continued \ncommitment to my country. The people of Haiti is \nprofoundly grateful to him for his subtlety and \ndetermination demonstrated in the quest for viable \nlasting solutions to the long crisis that has beset my \ncountry in recent years. Mr. Annan deserves the full \nappreciation of the international community for his \nlaudable, indefatigable efforts for peace, justice, human \nrights, democracy and development. \n On 3 July 2006, the Republic of Haiti regained its \nseat in the Caribbean Community and Common Market \n(CARICOM), thus putting an end to an absence of two \nlong years. We recognize that during this period our \nbrothers and sisters in the Caribbean never lost interest \nin Haiti\u2019s affairs. Quite the contrary: they were \nstrongly committed to finding appropriate solutions, \nwhich have allowed my country today to have the \nhonour to participate side by side with them in the \ngreat debates concerning the region. On 11 September, \nHaiti finally rejoined the great family of the \nNon-Aligned Movement, whose purpose is to \nstrengthen South-South cooperation. This was most \nwelcome. Those two events clearly show that we want \nto be open to the world.  \n I would like to take this opportunity to welcome \nthe accession of the Republic of Montenegro to \npolitical sovereignty and to the great family of our \nOrganization. \n Today, more than ever before, our world is facing \nmanifold threats that imperil its very existence. Despite \nthe Organization\u2019s intensive efforts to make the world \nmore human and more liveable, the spectre of major \npandemics, poverty, hunger, organized crime, \nterrorism, armed conflict, civil war and natural \ndisasters continues to haunt us. We therefore need to \nredouble our efforts to refine our diplomatic \napproaches and to give priority to dialogue, honest, \nopen negotiations, flexibility and compromise. Those \nprinciples lie at the very basis of the creation of the \nUnited Nations and reaffirm its strength and its raison \nd\u2019\u00eatre. Our Organization remains the ideal forum, the \nreference point for finding appropriate solutions to the \nproblems that beset our world. Nothing should make us \nabandon that spirit. \n The Republic of Haiti unreservedly supports all \nof the international community\u2019s initiatives to resolve \nconflicts in Africa, in East Asia and in the Middle East \nby finding peaceful negotiated solutions respectful of \nthe sovereignty of States. \n  \n \n06-53958 6 \n \n Terrorism is today assuming apocalyptic \nproportions. The attacks of 11 September 2001 against \ntargets in the United States and subsequent attacks \nelsewhere in the world were wake-up calls to us, \nforcing us to silence our petty interests in order to face \nthis scourge which, unless it is swiftly curbed, will lead \nto catastrophes with untold consequences. We cannot \nmake mistakes and we cannot hesitate. Recently, we \nhave been impotent, as we witness an infernal cycle of \nviolence, massive destruction of innocent human lives \nand property. We are seeing attempts to annihilate our \ninstitutions and our society. The very future of \nhumanity seems to be taken hostage by unbridled \ngroups that stop at nothing to destroy wherever they \ncan. The Republic of Haiti reaffirms once more its \nresolve to fight terrorism in all its forms, using the few \nresources that it has. It supports the preventive \nmeasures taken against terrorism, measures taken in a \nlegal context. We encourage States to agree on a global \nconvention on terrorism based on a clear definition \nacceptable to all. \n Haiti welcomes the major steps taken to reform \nthe United Nations at the previous session. We are still \nfar from our goals, but some very significant progress \nhas, nonetheless, been made. We hope that the changes \ndecided on will continue to give our Organization the \nresources it needs to carry out its global vocation. We \nmust adapt to new requirements, as we reaffirmed at \nthe World Summit of 2005. Accordingly, I applaud the \ncreation of the Peacebuilding Commission. It should \nplay an important part and its purpose is political \nstability, creating sustainable foundations for \nsocioeconomic development in post-conflict situations, \nas well as to help strengthen democratic institutions \nand make them effective in a constitutional framework \nand under the rule of law.  \n Similarly, I also welcome General Assembly \nresolution 60/251, which created the Human Rights \nCouncil. I congratulate the 47 members of the Council, \nwho were elected in May in order to put their \nexperience to use in promoting and protecting human \nrights. I hope that this new body will, in many respects, \nhelp to develop our society, to make it more open to \ndialogue, understanding, mutual respect, social justice \nand tolerance.  \n Haiti also welcomes the creation of the Central \nEmergency Relief Fund. It will provide upfront \nresources to enable the United Nations to finance \nhumanitarian relief operations, as soon as a catastrophe \noccurs, in other words, to do more, faster.  \n My Government agrees with the idea of \nrevitalizing the Economic and Social Council. As one \nof the main organs of the Organization, it should be \nmore involved in development activities in countries \nthat have been sidelined by history, especially the least \ndeveloped countries (LDCs). It should provide greater \ncohesion in adopting the best approach for attaining the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). The question \nof harmonizing strategies and actions among the \nentities of the United Nations system that work in the \narea of development is, for us, a crucial one.  \n Through the Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti of \nthe Economic and Social Council, my country enjoys \nthe support of the Council and, recently, at the high-\nlevel substantive meeting held in Geneva last July, the \nCouncil extended the mandate of that group through \nJuly 2007, with the possibility of being renewed once \nmore. I welcome the idea that this extension will \nenable various sectors involved in the sustained \ndevelopment of Haiti to achieve tangible results for my \ncountry.  \n Since 1945, date of the creation of the United \nNations, of which my country was a founding Member, \nthe international landscape has undergone profound \nchange. However, after more than sixty years, the \ninstitutional framework of the Security Council has \nremained the same. Any reform of the Organization \nwould, therefore, be incomplete were it not to include a \nreorganization of the Security Council. The \ncomposition of the Security Council must, therefore, \nreflect the realities of the twenty-first century and \ninclude Member States that are capable of shouldering \nresponsibilities of area of the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security. In this new desirable \nconfiguration, it is crucial that developing countries \nfrom Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean \nenjoy equitable representation.  \n In February 2006, Haiti held historic, fair and \ndemocratic elections. This process will be completed at \nthe end of the year by municipal elections and \nterritorial elections, which will help restore democracy \nand open the way to political stability. The people of \nHaiti as a whole decided in favour of change capable of \ngiving it security and improved living conditions. I \nwelcome the activities of the international community \nfor the support and assistance it gave and has continued \n \n \n7 06-53958 \n \nto give to Haiti. I salute the Group of Friends of Haiti \nand all Members of the Organization that have spared \nno effort or sacrifice to support the United Nations \nStabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) by \nproviding it with military or police personnel.  \n I also welcome the adoption of Security Council \nresolution 1702 (2006) of 15 August 2006, which \nrenewed the mandate of MINUSTAH. I hope that this \nmission, which is doing a very difficult job \u2014 \nsometimes a dangerous, but noble job \u2014 will, together \nwith the national police of Haiti and the Government, \nmanage to control the wanton insecurity that is \nbesetting Haitian society. I therefore call upon the \nmission to work closely with the Haitian authorities to \nmake the necessary changes depending on the priorities \nof the moment.  \n I hope that international assistance will also focus \non reforming the judicial system, on the \nprofessionalization of the police and on strengthening \ndemocratic institutions, such as the parliament, \nmunicipal bodies and the territorial collectives. \n To the parents, friends and colleagues of \npeaceworkers who died in Haiti in the line of duty, I \nwould like to reiterate the pain and sorrow of our \nGovernment and the Haitian people, who recognize the \nimportance of the United Nations presence in Haiti, the \nultimate goal of which is to help the country to recover \nits stability.  \n The new team that the head of State of Haiti, \nMr. Ren\u00e9 Garcia Pr\u00e9val, has the privilege of leading \nsince he assumed office in May, has embarked on the \nlong-term task of rebuilding the country. The task is to \nrestore security, to build a modern State, to strengthen \ndemocratic institutions and to offer favourable \nconditions for investment in order to create wealth that \nbenefits everybody. In order to attract investors and \ncreate conditions that favour sustainable development, \nthe implementation of basic infrastructure projects is \nimperative, e.g., the building of roads, ports, airports, \nproviding electricity to the main towns of the country, \nimproving telecommunications networks, all of which \nrequires the support of the international community.  \n Lack of security is a fertile ground for all kinds \nof temptation. It favours destabilizing elements that \nexploit the subhuman conditions under which a large \nnumber of our poor live, by arming them to sow death \nand destruction in the Haitian family, thus imperilling \nthe very future of our Republic. Attacking this lack of \nsecurity and the climate of violence marked by \ndramatic kidnappings and deadly clashes between \narmed gangs and the police is one of the top priorities \nof my Government. Dialogue, on the one hand, and \ntoughness, on the other hand, are necessary in finding a \nviable solution to banditry, which in recent times has \nbeen spreading in the country, causing a flight of \ncapital as well as a brain drain. Accordingly, the \ntechnical and financial support of the international \ncommunity is therefore essential in the effective \nimplementation of the disarmament, demobilization \nand reintegration programme. We are aware that Haiti \nis not a classic case, but that does not mean that we \nshould do nothing.  \n In order to provide speedy relief to the sufferings \nof the masses and to reduce, even eliminate, the \nsources of gang recruitment, my Government has \nlaunched a social pacification programme. This \nprogramme provides for the establishment of a \ndatabase of more than 300 projects and actions in \nvarious sectors of our national life and throughout the \nterritory. It will help create labour-intensive jobs and \nwill enable the State to reduce unemployment, to \nguarantee some relief and thereby to reduce \nwrongdoing.  \n Moreover, in order to create a climate conducive \nto good governance our head of State initiated an open, \nhonest dialogue with all political sectors upon his \nelection to the presidency. They understood the \nurgency and responded positively to the invitation by \nagreeing to participate in the current outward-looking \nGovernment, which includes members of various \npolitical parties, which are also represented in \nparliament. The point is to achieve social cohesion and \npolitical reconciliation, which are essential for \nstability, security, economic recovery and the \nrebuilding of an inclusive society. \n The international conference for the economic \nand social development of Haiti, which was held in \nPort-au-Prince on 25 July 2006, produced promises of \nfinancial commitment by the international community. \nMy Government intends to carry out a long-term \ndevelopment plan. That attests to our strong \ncommitment to take control of the destiny of the \ncountry, and that of our international partners to \nrespect the priorities defined by the Government.  \n In order to facilitate the task of the Government \nto create the necessary conditions for true economic \n  \n \n06-53958 8 \n \nand social development, I call upon donors to live up to \ntheir promises and to support Haiti in the long term. \nFinancial aid from the international community will \nfacilitate the consolidation of democracy and will help \nus to establish the basis for sustainable development. \nIn order to attain those results and to strengthen its \ncredibility, the Government is determined to comply \nwith the requirements of good governance, to ease the \npoverty of the disadvantaged and to continue the \nceaseless fight against insecurity and corruption in \norder to facilitate private national and foreign \ninvestment. \n In conclusion, I would note that the Government \nof Haiti is counting on the active cooperation of the \ninternational community to assist it in its quest for \npeace and socio-economic development. Throughout \nthe general debate and listening to the statements made \nby our many friends from CARICOM, the Americas \nand all over the world, Haiti has been aware of the \nkeen desire of our partners to work side by side with \nHaiti in order to meet the challenges faced by our \nGovernment. Here, I wish to express the gratitude of \nthe Government of Haiti. Haiti is faced with a daunting \nchallenge, but there is no lack of political will. My \ncountry will \u2014 with our Organization and with all of \nus working together \u2014 attain our goals. "

        "file_text": "Let me start by \ncongratulating you on your election, Madam President, \nand by wishing you every success in the coming \nmonths of hard work. The outgoing president of the \nGeneral Assembly, Mr. Eliasson, left an impressive \ntrack record of progress on a number of reform issues. \nIt is my expectation that you will continue to meet the \nhigh standards set by him.  \n Behind many of the changes here at the United \nNations over the past decade we have noted the light \nand decent hand of one distinguished person, Mr. Kofi \nAnnan. As he prepares to leave his position at the helm \nof the Secretariat, I would like to take this opportunity \nto thank him most cordially for all he has done. He has \nmade it very difficult and challenging for his successor \nto do the job with the same vigour, skill and \ndedication. \n To choose the right successor to the Secretary-\nGeneral will definitely not be an easy task, but I do not \nwant to leave the Hall without stating clearly the \npreferences of my country. No one from my own \nregional group has thus far occupied this important \npost. We think that time has come to seriously consider \nsuch an option. Mrs. Vaira Vike-Freiberga of Latvia is \nan excellent candidate who qualifies perfectly well for \nthe position of Secretary-General. She can count on our \nfull support. \n Let me also welcome a new Member of the \nUnited Nations, the Republic of Montenegro, whose \npresence here brings us closer to the goal of a truly \nuniversal United Nations. \n The President of Finland spoke on behalf of the \nEuropean Union (EU) a few days ago. The Czech \nRepublic fully associates itself with that statement. The \nEU has made an enormous effort to contribute to the \npreparations for this session, and my country was an \nintegral and active part of that process. I shall therefore \nlimit myself to sharing with the Assembly just a few \nideas and comments on issues that are at the forefront \nof our interests. \n I strongly believe that all of us want the world to \nbe a safer place. That is the bottom line. Yet, the \nabsence of safety and security seems to be almost \nomnipresent. There is a lack of support for billions of \npeople suffering from hunger and disease in developing \ncountries. There is a lack of protection for many people \nexposed to various environmental risks and natural \nhazards. There is a widening debate regarding energy \nsecurity. There is lack of freedom and dignity for many \nwomen and men living under oppression. There is a \nlack of peace, and a sense of vulnerability vis-\u00e0-vis all \nkinds of armed conflict.  \n  \n \n06-53952 2 \n \n On top of all that there is the ominous threat of \nterrorism \u2014 often fed by Islamist extremists \u2014 which \nis creating fear and striking targets around the world, \nincluding their very own countries. All that makes it \nimperative for us to continue to adapt our security \nsystems; otherwise we will not be able to face that \nthreat. And we need to be efficient. \n To make the world a better and safer place is a \ncomplex challenge. It involves individual States as \nwell as various international organizations. But, at the \nglobal level, the role of the United Nations in \nresponding to that challenge is irreplaceable. The \nMillennium Summit of 2000 and the 2005 World \nSummit contributed enormously to shaping our agenda \nto that effect by, inter alia, balancing security, \ndevelopment and human rights concerns. We know \nwhat should be done. But we often fail to deliver \nbecause our collective will is not strong enough to \nsupport the implementation of designed measures and \nactions. We often know the diagnosis. We know the \nright remedy. And, yet, we are unable to apply it. \n Two weeks ago, we commemorated the fifth \nanniversary of the horrible terrorist attacks against not \nonly the United States but, dare I say, against our \nshared values. The world after 9/11 is not what it was, \nand the United Nations has had to adapt accordingly. \nOn the eve of that chilling anniversary, we succeeded \nin adopting the landmark United Nations Global \nCounter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288), \nbuilding on previous efforts by both the Security \nCouncil and the General Assembly. I hope that the \nStrategy will provide more than guidance, and that it \nwill become a real tool that provides real help for those \nwho fight the scourge of terrorism in the field. \n There is general agreement that the international \ncommunity and the United Nations should do much \nmore for States and territories recovering from conflict \nand disorder. We now have the United Nations \nPeacebuilding Commission. There is a spirit of hope \nthat the Commission will lead the efforts in generating \nboth the political will and the means to assist countries \nin post-conflict environments while promoting the rule \nof law and democratic values and preventing those \ncountries from slipping back into conflict. The Czech \nRepublic stands ready to assume its duties as a member \nof the Commission beginning in January 2007. \n Peacebuilding has to maintain strong ties with \npeacekeeping. Indeed, we are facing a surge in demand \nfor that service provided by the United Nations, with \nLebanon as the most recent example. But even if the \nnumber of Blue Helmets were to be multiplied, there \nwould still be room for meaningful engagement with \nregional organizations in assisting the United Nations \nto maintain peace and security. I welcome recent \ndebates on the role of those organizations, which \nalready shoulder a fair part of the burden in \nAfghanistan, the Balkans, the Democratic Republic of \nthe Congo and the Sudan. From our trans-Atlantic \nperspective, I particularly applaud the intensifying \ncooperation among the United Nations, the EU and \nNATO. I am proud to say that my country plays an \nactive part in that regard. We have a strong presence in \nthe Kosovo Force and the International Security \nAssistance Force in Afghanistan. We are prepared to \nexplore other forms of support where we are not \ndirectly involved. \n It was very unfortunate that last year\u2019s Summit \nwas not able to find common language on disarmament \nand non-proliferation. The uncontrolled spread of the \nillicit trafficking in conventional weapons, their use \nagainst civilian populations and the deadly existence of \nlandmines all serve to continue to fuel conflict, human \nsuffering and insecurity around the world. My country \nsupports all efforts \u2014 as well as several \nprogrammes \u2014 aimed at bringing the arms trade and \nthe use of arms under strong controls. But there is an \neven greater threat: the possible proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction.  \n We welcome the fact that the Security Council is \nincreasingly engaged in those matters. Council \nresolution 1540 (2004) was a major step forward. It \nwas recently followed up by strong messages addressed \nto the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and Iran. \nBoth those countries should fully comply with the \nnuclear non-proliferation regimes and abandon any \nambitions going beyond the peaceful use of nuclear \npower. \n There is no freedom or security where masses of \npeople are plagued by poverty, hunger and unhealthy \nliving conditions. The Government of the Czech \nRepublic therefore attaches great importance to \ndevelopment cooperation and to achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDG). Following the \neconomic transformation of the 1990s, we have \nsteadily increased our development aid every year. For \nexample, in 2005 Czech development assistance \nincreased by 16 per cent in real terms \u2014 reaching a \n \n \n3 06-53952 \n \nlevel of 0.11 per cent of our gross national income. \nThat likely makes us the leading country providing \ndevelopment assistance among new EU members. Our \nhumanitarian aid grew even more sharply and we are \ndetermined to continue that trend. My country also \nsupports other measures that could provide additional \nassistance \u2014 a fair solution to the debt problem for \npoor countries, limiting agricultural subsidies and \ncreating more open conditions for trade. In that, we \nassociate ourselves with the goal of a global \npartnership for development. \n Development assistance is more effective in an \nenvironment of stable and predictable conditions, the \nrule of law, democratic structures, a successful fight \nagainst corruption and respect for human rights \u2014 not \nto mention that those qualities attract donors as they \nare inherently worth supporting and cultivating. The \nattention paid to those issues by the United Nations has \ngrown significantly over the last decade, resulting, \ninter alia, in the establishment of the United Nations \nDemocracy Fund last year. My country was one of the \nfirst contributors to the Fund. We are thus on the right \ntrack, and I feel that we should go even further along \nthat road. \n It was also decided at the United Nations Summit \nlast year \u2014 as part of the overall United Nations \nreform \u2014 to transform and upgrade the Commission on \nHuman Rights, which became the Human Rights \nCouncil. We have to work hard with others in Geneva, \nto make it a beam of hope for millions of people living \nunder oppression and deprived of their rights in \ndifferent parts of the world.  \n However, the transformation of the United \nNations human rights machinery will be a failure, \nunless the new body is stronger and more effective \nthan the old one, unless it succeeds in enhancing its \nspecial procedures and country-oriented activities, \nunless it finds the ways and means to respond where it \nis needed, and unless it secures full international \ncooperation in enforcing elementary standards of \nfundamental human rights. \n Regimes that behave contrary to all democratic \nprinciples, use their power against their own citizens, \nimprison their opponents arbitrarily and violate \nelementary standards of the Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights must be confronted with an efficient \nsystem. It is one of the sad ironies of our time that \nAung San Suu Kyi remains under house arrest in \nMyanmar, 15 years after being awarded the Nobel \nPeace Prize.  \n We cannot remain silent when members of \npeaceful democratic opposition in Cuba, who are \ncalling for national dialogue and reconciliation, are \nstill jailed and harassed as alleged enemies of the State. \nWe also have to raise our voice of solidarity when a \npresidential candidate of democratic forces in the \nrecent presidential elections in Belarus, Aleksandr \nKozulin, is sentenced to a term in prison for alleged \nincitement to disorder. \n Over several years, \u201creform\u201d was one of the most \nfrequent and often misused words in our United \nNations vocabulary. But, even skeptics must admit that \nthe United Nations in 2006 is profoundly different \nfrom the United Nations 10 year ago. While some \nreform projects were put aside, a number of others \nwere carried out. Some projects \u2014 most notably the \nlong overdue reform of the Security Council \u2014 \ncontinue, however, to wait for the green light. \n This year\u2019s highlight is management reform and \nthe reform of the United Nations development \nmachinery in the interest of system-wide coherence. If \nwe succeed in those areas, the United Nations could \nbecome stronger, leaner, less bureaucratic and more \noperational. Let us hope, that the changes will be \nbacked by the adoption of a new and fairer scale of \nassessments, by adequate budget and payment \ndiscipline, and last but not least, by progress in \nimplementing the Capital Master Plan. \n In conclusion, let me assure you, Madam \nPresident, that my country is ready to fulfil, in a timely \nand orderly manner, all its obligations as a Member of \nthe United Nations, including our increased share of \nthe overall budget and our contributions to the \npeacekeeping operations. We acknowledge and honour \nour share of responsibility. More than that \u2014 we \ncontinue to increase our volume of humanitarian aid \nand to engage ourselves in assisting peace and security \nin a number of areas around the world. I believe that \nqualifies my country as a strong candidate for an \nelected seat on the United Nations Security Council for \nthe term 2008-2009. "

        "file_text": "It is a \ngreat honour for me, as Prime Minister of Canada, to \n \n \n21 06-52988 \n \nspeak to the Assembly today about the important issues \nconfronting us as Members of the United Nations. \n(spoke in English) \n The United Nations was born from a combination \nof the essential needs of nations for stability and \nsecurity and the higher ideals to which we should all \naspire \u2014 freedom, democracy, human rights and the \nrule of law. \n(spoke in French) \n Our responsibilities in this Organization are as \nvaried as they are important, and I cannot mention \nthem all, nor do each the justice they deserve. \n(spoke in English) \n Nor can Canada be effective by diffusing our \nefforts across all of these matters. We must focus our \nconsiderable, but limited, resources where we can \nmake a real difference. So let me turn to one particular \nand key area where global interests and higher purpose \ncome directly together: the United Nations Assistance \nMission in Afghanistan. \n The United Nations recognized shortly after the \nattacks of 11 September 2001 that the Taliban regime, \nby its promotion of terrorism, was a threat to \ninternational peace and security. \n(spoke in French) \n Kofi Annan, our Secretary-General, whom we \nthank for his 10 years of loyal service, summed up in a \nfew words the reason why we must combat terrorism. \nTerrorism, he said: \n \u201cis a direct attack on the core values the United \nNations stands for: the rule of law; the protection \nof civilians; mutual respect between people of \ndifferent faiths and cultures; and peaceful \nresolution of conflicts.\u201d \n(spoke in English) \n That is why we in the United Nations have the \nresponsibility to defeat terrorism. That is why, with \nunity and determination, the United Nations undertook \nits responsibility and its role in Afghanistan. And that \nis why Canada, which lost 24 of its own citizens on \n9/11, answered the call. \n And there we are. The United Nations Assistance \nMission in Afghanistan is the United Nations single \nlargest political mission. It is also, by far, Canada\u2019s \nbiggest and most important overseas mission. So the \nUnited Nations mission is Canada\u2019s mission. \n No fewer than 19 United Nations agencies are in \nAfghanistan. They are working tirelessly to help the \nAfghan people and their national Government shake \noff the perpetrators of terrorism and build a democratic \nand secure society. \n At the same time, approximately 20,000 troops \nfrom 37 countries \u2014 roughly 2,500 Canadians \nincluded \u2014 are contributing to military efforts to help \nstabilize Afghanistan and eliminate the remnants of the \nTaliban regime. And we want to do that once and for \nall. \n(spoke in French) \n All our actions in Afghanistan \u2014 civilian and \nmilitary \u2014 are being taken in accordance with the \nmandate of the Security Council. In short, we all stand \ntogether with the democratically elected Government \nof Afghanistan under the banner of the Organization \nthat represents our collective will. In Afghanistan the \nUnited Nations mission is Canada\u2019s mission. \n(spoke in English) \n Let us be realistic. The challenges facing \nAfghanistan are enormous. There will be no quick \nfixes. Moreover, success cannot be assured by military \nmeans alone. This we all recognize. For success also \nrequires a strong and unwavering civilian contribution: \neducators, engineers, elections advisers, direct and \ntechnical aid. The list is lengthy, but the contributions \nare essential. \n That is why Canada is engaged in work like the \nrebuilding of girls\u2019 schools, ripped down and destroyed \nby the Taliban in their frenzy of hate. \n(spoke in French) \n That is why last spring we increased our \ndevelopment assistance, raising Canada\u2019s total \ncontribution to nearly $1 billion over 10 years, to assist \nthe people of Afghanistan. \n(spoke in English) \n These two actions \u2014 rebuilding a shattered \nsociety and providing a stable security environment \u2014 \ngo hand in glove. And we are making progress \u2014 of \nthat there is no doubt: 5 million refugees repatriated; \nover 5 million children enrolled in primary schools;  \n  \n \n06-52988 22 \n \n10 million Afghans registered to vote in successive \ndemocratic elections. \n More than one quarter of the seats in \nAfghanistan\u2019s legislature are now held by women \u2014 \nremarkable in a nation where a few short years ago \ngirls could not attend school and women had no human \nrights of any kind. \n The success of this Mission, in providing both \nsecurity and development, is vital to the safety, \nlivelihood and very future of the Afghan people, but it \nis also vital to the health and future of this \nOrganization. \n(spoke in French) \n Let us recall that the democratically elected \nGovernment of Afghanistan, led by President Karzai, \nrequested the assistance of the United Nations and its \nMember States in the struggle against terror, \nintimidation, violence and oppression. \n(spoke in English) \n We have responded. But we have not made \nAfghanistan\u2019s progress irreversible \u2014 not yet. \nCanadian defence personnel, diplomats and \ndevelopment officers are on the front lines of the fight \nfor the future of Afghanistan. Canadians feel \ntremendous pride in the leadership role they have \nassumed, and we share equal grief for the casualties \nthey have taken. We are therefore acutely aware that \nthe United Nations job in Afghanistan is not yet done. \nWe have no illusions about the difficulties that still lie \nbefore us. Difficulties do not daunt us. But lack of \ncommon purpose and will in this body would. \n After all, if we fail the Afghan people, we will be \nfailing ourselves. For this is the United Nations \nstrongest Mission and therefore our greatest test. Our \ncollective will and credibility are being judged. We \ncannot afford to fail. We will succeed. \n(spoke in French) \n The United Nations is also facing other \nchallenges \u2014 in Haiti, for example. Canada has played \nan important role there, dispatching troops, police and \ndevelopment officers to support United Nations \nactivities aimed at restoring stability and establishing \ndemocracy. And we are offering the country  \n$100 million in economic development assistance. \nHowever, we must act together to ensure that our \nmultinational force paves the way for stability and \nprogress, and empowers the Government of Haiti to \nhelp its citizens, the poorest in the western hemisphere. \n(spoke in English) \n Darfur, too, is a significant challenge, as \nmultinational security efforts are transferred from the \nAfrican Union to the United Nations. It is also a test of \nthe principle that this body endorsed last year \u2014 the \nresponsibility to protect. The United Nations has \nauthorized a mission there, with a robust mandate. But \nwill the Government of Sudan accept it? \n In the Middle East, Canada has joined the \ninternational community in the reconstruction of \nLebanon. But will the United Nations Interim Force in \nLebanon ensure security on Israel\u2019s northern border \nand lead to progress in the Middle East peace process? \n Nuclear proliferation threatens us all. Are we \nprepared to ensure that Security Council decisions will \nbe implemented fully? Will we act to halt activities that \nhave no reasonable purpose other than the acquisition \nof nuclear weapons? \n These are some of the tests the whole world must \nface. And there are other challenges internal to this \nOrganization. \n Will the new Human Rights Council become a \nforum where human rights are genuinely put above \npolitical maneuvering? Or will it emulate the fate of its \nfailed predecessor organization? I must say that the \nearly signals suggest that too little has changed and \nthat the page has not yet been turned. \n And what will be done to make progress on \nUnited Nations management reform? \n(spoke in French) \n Earlier this year Canada\u2019s new Government was \ngiven a mandate to make our national Government \nmore accountable and more responsible, to ensure that \ntaxpayers get full value for their money and to pursue a \nclear, focused agenda that produces tangible results. \nThe United Nations should accept nothing less. \n(spoke in English) \n This Organization must become more \naccountable and more effective. Management reform \nmust continue, and at an accelerated pace. The \ntaxpayers of Member nations, Canadians among them, \nmake significant financial contributions to this \nOrganization. They have the right to expect stronger, \n \n \n23 06-52988 \n \nmore independent oversight mechanisms, more robust \naccountability for how funds are spent, and human \nresources practices that are based on merit. \n(spoke in French) \n I have just described the tests by which this \nOrganization will be judged. Canada wants this to be a \npositive judgment. We were there when the United \nNations was founded. Like the other countries, we \nwere motivated by a pressing need to establish a new \ninternational consensus in a world devastated by war. \nAnd, like the others, we were motivated by our own \npragmatic interests and noble aspirations for all of \nhumanity. More than 60 years later the formula \nremains the same. \n(spoke in English) \n The challenge has always been the same: to bring \nnations together to build a better world by forging \nconsensus on common purposes and by finding the \npolitical will to translate these into action. \n When these goals have been achieved, Canada \nhas always been with the Organization \u2014 through the \nwar against fascism, the cold war, dozens of United \nNations-sponsored peacekeeping missions, and more \nrecent multinational military engagements in the \nBalkans and the Persian Gulf. \n Today Afghanistan leads the list of challenges \nthat we face collectively \u2014 peacebuilding in a nation \nwhere there is not yet peace, where progress requires a \nwide range of capabilities undertaken by a wide array \nof our Member States. \n My earnest hope is that we will say with pride to \nfuture generations of leaders: We, the United Nations, \ntook up that responsibility in Afghanistan, rose to the \nchallenge and met it firmly, collectively, successfully. \nIn this endeavour, as with the others I have outlined, \nCanada will be there with the Organization at every \nstep along the way.

        "file_text": "I wish to join \nothers in congratulating you, Madam, on your election \nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \nsession. Please be assured of my country\u2019s support and \ncooperation throughout your tenure. \n The Marshall Islands commends all members of \nthe General Assembly for their efforts, contributions \nand cooperation throughout the sixtieth session aimed \nat achieving many of our common aspirations. \nAlthough we have achieved a good measure of success, \nthere is still much work ahead. We must work together \nand pool our resources, our talents and our skills for \nthe betterment of all the citizens of the world. It is in \nthis regard that I urge the wealthier and more \ndeveloped Member States to increase their generosity \n  \n \n06-53952 18 \n \nwith official development assistance so as to address \nissues of human misery. \n As one of the smallest States Members of the \nUnited Nations, the Marshall Islands hopes that the \nsixty-first session of the General Assembly will do \nmore to protect and secure our people from threats to \ntheir livelihood and existence. \n The Marshall Islands is committed to various \ninternational and regional plans and agreements, \nincluding the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), \nthe Mauritius Strategy for the further Implementation \nof the Programme of Action for the Sustainable \nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, the \nPacific Plan and, more recently, the Micronesian \nChallenge initiative, which sets ambitious targets for \nmarine and terrestrial conservation areas throughout \nthe Micronesian region. \n We emphasize the need for the full and effective \nimplementation of the commitments, programmes and \ntargets adopted, particularly those of the International \nMeeting to Review the Implementation of the \nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development \nof Small Island Developing States, and for the \nmobilization of the necessary resources from all \nsources for the effective implementation of the \nMauritius Strategy. \n Given that the livelihood of our people depends \nheavily on the oceans, we again join our Pacific \nneighbours in requesting that our ocean resources be \nmanaged and protected from exploitation. Because our \nnation\u2019s single most important productive sector is \nfisheries, which provide us with our key export, the \nstate of the world\u2019s oceans and fish stocks and the way \nin which those vital resources are being exploited \nremain concerns of the utmost importance. \n As a party to the 1982 United Nations \nConvention on the Law of the Sea and the 1995 United \nNations Fish Stocks Agreement, we recognize the \nimportance of the entry into force of the Convention on \nthe Conservation and Management of Highly \nMigratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central \nPacific Ocean and the subsequent conservation and \nmanagement measures adopted thus far by the recently \nestablished Western and Central Pacific Fisheries \nCommission. \n While we acknowledge the implications and \nadverse impact of illegal, unreported and unregulated \nfishing in the region, including the consequences of \nover-fishing for national and regional resources, we are \ncontinuing to develop and explore ways and means of \nconducting and enforcing conservation and \nmanagement measures, as well as of developing our \ndomestic fisheries. We seek a moratorium on bottom \ntrawling until there are clear indications that it has no \neffects on ocean biodiversity. \n It is our hope that regional efforts \u2014 such as \nthose being undertaken by the small islands developing \nStates \u2014 to spread the knowledge of conservation and \nthe sustainable use of biodiversity will be strengthened \nand enhanced by international assistance. \n At the national level, I wish to share with \nMember States the progress that we have made in \nterms of Government leadership and national \ndevelopment. Our national and local government \nleaders met early last month to review our progress in \nachieving our long term National Development Plan. \nThis provided a chance for both the national \nGovernment and local governments to renew their \ncommitments to work together to bring about a better \nMarshall Islands. It also paved the way for \nGovernment officials to discuss issues of critical \nconcern that continue to obstruct our development \nopportunities in the areas of education, health and the \nenvironment, among others. \n Another important issue also being discussed on \nthe home front is that of the nuclear-weapons tests that \nwere conducted in the Marshall Islands. Our people \nhave made a disproportionate sacrifices in helping the \nworld understand the power of the nuclear bomb. We \nhave paid with our own lives, our health and the well-\nbeing of our land and waters, which are so sacred to us. \nSince the Marshall Islands became independent, in \n1986, we have undertaken efforts to better understand \nthe impact of the activities that took place on our \nislands during the cold war. We are finding that the \neffects of the 67 atmospheric weapon tests conducted \nin our country were much worse and much more \nwidespread than previously understood, although we \nstill have a great deal more to learn. \n As a small country with limited resources, we are \nof course focusing our efforts on addressing the \nnuclear legacy. We call on the United Nations and its \nagencies and on Member States that share similar \nexperiences and have expertise in the restoration of \nenvironments contaminated with radiation and in \n \n \n19 06-53952 \n \naddressing health needs linked to radiation exposure to \nassist and support the Marshall Islands Changed \nCircumstances Petition, which was submitted to the \nUnited States Congress in 2000. As knowledgeable and \nresponsible leaders of the world community, the United \nNations has the capacity to positively influence the \nwell-being of the citizens of the Marshall Islands, who \nwere under the care of the Trusteeship Council when \nthe United States nuclear testing programme was in \nprogress \u2014 from 1946 to 1958 following the Second \nWorld War. \n Marshall Islands reiterates its firm commitment \nto the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons (NPT) and its objectives of preventing the \nspread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology, \nfostering the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and \nfurthering the goal of achieving general and complete \ndisarmament. We urge those countries that have not \nalready done so to become a party to the NPT, and \nthose countries that are party to the NPT to fully \ncooperate with the International Atomic Energy \nAgency and fulfil their obligations under the Treaty. \n Marshall Islands and French Polynesia know all \ntoo well that colonial Powers are willing to use \nterritories other than their own to conduct dangerous \nnuclear weapons testing. In that regard, we call on the \nUnited Nations to continue to press for the \ndecolonization of all nations in the Pacific region. \n We also call on the United Nations to admit the \n23 million citizens of Taiwan to the United Nations \nfamily. Taiwan, which shares the Organization\u2019s view \non the principles of universality and self-\ndetermination, has been enjoying a democratic \nGovernment of its own for over half a century. The fact \nthat Taiwan has been denied membership into the \nUnited Nations again and again questions the \nlegitimacy of the Organization. On behalf of my \ncountry, I therefore urge this body to welcome Taiwan \ninto its membership.  \n Marshall Islands wishes to reiterate its support \nfor the reform, restructuring and expansion of the \nSecurity Council. In particular, we emphasize the \ninclusion of Japan as a permanent member of the \nCouncil, and fully endorse Japan\u2019s proposal on the \nmethodology to be used in the preparation of the \nUnited Nations scale of assessments for the period \n2007 to 2009. We are convinced that the entire \nmembership of the United Nations would benefit \ngreatly from Japan\u2019s permanent membership and its \nproposed scale of assessments structure. \n In the regional arena, last year Marshall Islands \njoined two of its neighbours in requesting that the \nUnited Nations step up its presence in the northern \nPacific to pursue various development agendas, not \nonly in our country but also in the Pacific region as a \nwhole. I am pleased to inform the Assembly today that \nthree United Nations agencies \u2014 the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme, the United Nations \nPopulation Fund and UNICEF \u2014 have agreed to \nestablish offices in various countries in the region, \nincluding the Marshall Islands. \n Moreover, our Government has been working \nextensively with others in the region to implement the \nPacific Plan, endorsed at the Pacific Islands Forum \nleaders\u2019 meeting held in Papua New Guinea in October \n2005. I wish to join my colleagues in thanking our \ndevelopment partners for their assistance in making the \nPlan viable. Marshall Islands remains confident that \nthe Pacific Plan will provide a useful framework for \ncontinued regional and international cooperation. \n Internationally, the Marshall Islands joins other \nPacific countries in reiterating our interests and asking \nthe international community to recognize the \nvulnerability of small island developing States. They \nneed the continued support of developed countries to \nbuild up their capacity to manage vulnerability, \nstrengthen food security and build resilience to \neconomic, social and environmental change. We appeal \nto the international community to support and enhance \nexisting and new capacity-building efforts of, and \namong, small island developing States. We need the \nassistance of the international community to establish \nmechanisms to enable small island developing States to \ncope with, and adjust to, globalization and trade \nliberalization. \n Marshall Islands consists predominantly of low-\nlying atolls that are an average of two metres above sea \nlevel. Our small atolls and islands are dwarfed by our \nsurrounding exclusive economic zone, which consists \nof approximately 2 million square kilometres of ocean. \nWhile we rely on our ocean as a means of sustenance \nand survival, the sea becomes our biggest concern \nduring increasingly severe weather conditions. We are \nfearful of sea-level rise, which is threatening the very \nexistence of our islands. \n  \n \n06-53952 20 \n \n We therefore wish to reaffirm our grave concern \nregarding the vulnerability of small island developing \nStates to the impacts of climate change, as well as the \nneed for urgent action at the international level by the \nmajor emitters of carbon dioxide among developed and \ndeveloping industrial countries to halt and reverse \nthose devastating climate change impacts. \n I wish to take this opportunity to thank President \nJan Eliasson for his excellent management of the \nGeneral Assembly presidency over the past year. I also \nwish to congratulate him on his appointment as his \ncountry\u2019s Minister for Foreign Affairs. The General \nAssembly accomplished a great deal under his able \nleadership and I would like to commend him on his \nachievements. I wish him well in his new post. \n The people of the Republic of the Marshall \nIslands join me in wishing Secretary-General \nKofi Annan and Mrs. Nane Annan well in their future \nendeavours. I wish to convey our sincere appreciation \nfor their gesture of friendship and goodwill during his \ntenure as Secretary-General of the United Nations. \n In closing, I would like to assure the Assembly \nthat my country will continue to work with the United \nNations to meet our common challenges. Sixty-one \nyears on, General Assembly members must move \ndeliberately and decisively to overcome the dangers \nthat lie ahead. We must meet our responsibilities to our \nrespective countries and to each other as members of \nthe General Assembly to ensure that we arrive at a \nbetter future. "

We equally appreciate his unfailing support \nfor regional and international development activities to \nensure the promotion of the United Nations \nmechanisms and structures and thus reinforce their \neffectiveness. \n The Kingdom of Morocco welcomes the \naccession of the Republic of Montenegro to \nmembership of the United Nations and we assure it of \nour constructive and continuous cooperation. \n This year\u2019s session coincides with the 50th \nanniversary of Morocco\u2019s joining the United Nations. \nThey have been 50 years of clear and concrete \ncommitment to the purposes and principles of our \nOrganization aimed at fostering peace and security \nworldwide and at consolidating development for the \nbenefit of all peoples and States, mainly in developing \ncountries. \n Joining the United Nations was one of the first \nsovereign decisions Morocco made in the wake of \ngaining its independence. It expressed the Kingdom\u2019s \nfirm belief in the efficacy of multilateral action as one \nof the most viable means of managing chronic crises \nand as an appropriate tool to face growing international \nchallenges. It also reflects Morocco\u2019s unfailing \ncommitment to the values of active solidarity and \nfruitful cooperation, as expressed in a speech given by \nthe late King Mohammed V on 6 November 1956, \nwhen he stated that  \n \u201cMorocco\u2019s attachment to the principles \nunderpinning the United Nations reflects its \ncommitment to supporting freedom and peace \nthroughout the world and to establishing \ninternational relations on the basis of arbitration \nand concord, with no recourse whatsoever to \nviolence or force, and relying on cooperation and \nsolidarity rather than on animosity and \ndiscrimination\u201d. \n Since joining the United Nations, the Kingdom of \nMorocco has endeavoured to contribute significantly to \nhelping our Organization attain its status as a central \nactor in the establishment of international peace and \nsecurity, as well as in organizing and promoting \ninternational relations to create a world order built on \ncooperation, justice and international legality. The \nKingdom has always been an advocate of the principles \nof international law, United Nations resolutions and \nmultilateral actions emanating from constructive \ndialogue and ongoing consultations as the most viable \nway to settle international conflicts and crises \npeacefully. \n  \n \n06-53323 46 \n \n Throughout that period, the Kingdom has \ncontributed to numerous United Nations peacekeeping \noperations in demonstration of its commitment to \ninternational peace and of its deeply rooted belief in \nthe importance of collective security and of the role of \nthe United Nations in that field. Today, our country is \ncontributing to five peacekeeping operations in Africa, \nthe Caribbean and Europe. That has earned Morocco \nthe thirteenth position among countries contributing to \npeacekeeping operations internationally, the second at \nthe Arab level and the sixth at the African level. \n In addition, the Kingdom of Morocco has \nlaunched a process aimed at establishing active \nsolidarity among members of the international \ncommunity through constructive and fruitful \npartnerships between North and South, on the one \nhand, and the reinforcement of South-South \ncooperation as a strategic priority, on the other, in \norder to achieve sustainable and balanced development \nfor the benefit of all. \n The Kingdom of Morocco has further \nendeavoured to implement the recommendations \nadopted at important United Nations meetings and \nconferences on development issues, including the \nMillennium Development Goals, which are in full \nharmony with our national development strategy. In \nthat regard, the National Initiative for Human \nDevelopment, launched by His Majesty King \nMohammed VI on 18 May 2005, testifies to Morocco\u2019s \nwillingness to lay the foundations for a development \nmodel that embodies Morocco\u2019s political choices and is \nhelping to establish a modern and democratic society. \nModernization, democratization and economic \ndevelopment, as well as sustained human development \nindicators, are interdependent in the quest for equitable \nopportunities, the dissemination of knowledge and the \nprovision of basic social services. \n Our development initiative places a special \nemphasis on the empowerment of the Moroccan citizen \nas the focus of comprehensive development, in line \nwith the Secretary-General\u2019s report of 2005, entitled \n\u201cIn larger freedom: towards development, security and \nhuman rights for all\u201d. \n In that context, and in a spirit guided by universal \nprinciples aimed at creating the necessary harmony \nbetween Morocco\u2019s international commitments and its \nnational priorities, a workshop on the promotion of \nhuman rights was convened in Morocco. The workshop \nwas marked by the issuance of specific \nrecommendations upon the end of the mandate of our \nequity and reconciliation commission, in a critical and \ntransparent evaluation of a specific period of \nMorocco\u2019s past with a sense of responsibility and a \nconstructive vision of its future. \n Since its inception, the United Nations has \ncontributed to the settlement of many international \ndisputes and the establishment of peace and security in \nmany regions. However, the Middle East and Africa \nstill suffer from many conflicts, wars and economic \nand social crises that thwart peoples\u2019 natural \naspirations to security, stability and development. \n In that regard, and having welcomed the Israeli \nwithdrawal from Gaza as a first step towards the \nestablishment of a Palestinian State in accordance with \nthe road map, Morocco hopes that the current dire \nsituation, which has led to even more killing and \ndestruction, will rapidly come to an end. Following the \nfailure of various international and regional efforts to \nresume the peace process and settle the Arab-Israeli \nconflict, the Kingdom of Morocco reiterates its call on \nthe international community, and the Security Council \nin particular, to assume their responsibilities in the \nsearch for a comprehensive and lasting solution to the \nconflict, in accordance with the terms of reference of \nthe peace process, relevant United Nations resolutions \nand international legality, as well as the principle of \nland for peace. \n Concerning the military aggression against \nbrotherly Lebanon and the resultant loss of civilian life \nand destruction of infrastructure and service facilities, \nMorocco welcomed Security Council resolution 1701 \n(2006) and expresses its hope that all concerned parties \nwill cooperate in providing the appropriate political \nconditions for a lasting settlement on the basis of the \nTaif agreement and the relevant resolutions of the \nSecurity Council. Morocco also calls upon the \ninternational community to provide more cooperation \nand solidarity in the reconstruction of Lebanon and to \nsupport the success of efforts to achieve peace and \ntranquillity for our brother Lebanese.  \n As for the situation in the brotherly country of \nIraq, Morocco acknowledges the outcome of the \npolitical process, in which all Iraqi parties and \ninfluential political actors took part. However, \nMorocco is still hoping for an end to the ongoing \nviolence, which continues to bring suffering to \n \n \n47 06-53323 \n \ninnocent Iraqi civilians. We hope that our Iraqi brothers \ncan agree, as soon as possible, on the time and venue \nfor a conference on Iraqi national accord, which could \nhelp establish a basis for the completion of institutional \nreforms thereby ensuring the sovereignty, territorial \nintegrity, security and stability of a unified and safe \nIraq. \n The Kingdom of Morocco, whose head of State, \nHis Majesty King Mohammed VI, chairs the Al-Quds \nCommittee of the Organization of the Islamic \nConference, reaffirms its commitment to work together \nwith all parties towards a just and comprehensive \npeace in the Middle East. The achievement of that \nobjective will depend on the Israeli withdrawal from \nall the occupied Arab territories and the establishment \nof a Palestinian State, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its \ncapital, living side by side in peace and security with \nthe State of Israel. \n Morocco firmly believes in dialogue and \nnegotiations as a means of settling regional and \ninternational disputes. It also considers that resorting to \nforce, whatever the reason or motives, will not yield \nviable solutions or lead to a just, lasting and \ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East. On the \ncontrary, it will only exacerbate and prolong the status \nquo. \n Morocco is equally convinced that peace in the \nregion can be achieved only if the United Nations \ncreates the right environment and works to eradicate \nthe causes of tension and escalation and coordinates \nregional and international efforts aimed at reviving the \npeace process on all tracks, with a view to ultimately \nachieving security and lasting peace. In that way, the \npeoples of the region would be able to move towards a \nmore promising future in which generations to come \ncan cooperate and live together in harmony. \n The African continent is facing a number of \nserious threats and major challenges. It is currently \nbeset by many crises and conflicts that have proved \ndifficult to resolve. Indeed, half of the armed conflicts \nin the world over the past decade have taken place in \nAfrica, which also hosts half of the world\u2019s refugees. \nThe continent is also confronted by numerous \neconomic and social problems, including poverty, \nhunger, desertification and infectious diseases, which \nthreaten the daily lives of millions of people. \n This critical situation, which should by no means \nbe considered inevitable, making Africa a priority for \nthe United Nations and for international development \nprogrammes and agendas. However, programmes and \ninitiatives must be better harmonized and coordinated \nif they are to create conditions conducive to sustainable \ndevelopment in Africa. To that end, we must consider \ncreating an international mechanism that includes \nexperts in the fields of security and development to \nsupervise the implementation of the range of \ninternational programmes and initiatives concerning \nAfrica. \n For its part, the Kingdom of Morocco will \ncontinue to support all development efforts in Africa. \nHis Majesty King Mohammed VI, a champion of peace \nand development whose enlightened and far-sighted \nvision is based on a full and deep understanding of the \nconcerns of the continent, has introduced many \ninitiatives and visited many African countries with the \naim of strengthening the bonds of brotherhood, \ncooperation and solidarity among African peoples. \n In this regard, Morocco calls for the holding next \nyear of a high-level dialogue on Africa and \ndevelopment with a view to further intensifying the \ndevelopment debate and consultation and establishing \nmechanisms to guarantee the implementation of all \ninternational initiatives aimed at making full use of the \ncontinent\u2019s huge economic and human potential in the \nservice of its development. \n In his first address to the General Assembly, His \nMajesty the late King Mohammed V declared that the \nKingdom of Morocco had chosen negotiation as the \nbasis for its international relations, with a view to \nreaching mutual agreements, freely arrived at, and \nproviding for peace, unity and solidarity among \nnations. In keeping with that broad vision, the \nKingdom of Morocco has renewed its commitment to \ncooperate with the Secretary-General and his Personal \nEnvoy in order to find a lasting, negotiated and \nmutually acceptable political solution to the dispute \nover the Moroccan Sahara. \n In this respect, and in response to the call of the \nSecurity Council to break the current deadlock and \nmake progress towards a political, consensus-based \nand final solution to the dispute, Morocco will present \nan autonomy plan that would enable the inhabitants of \nthe region to manage their local affairs within the \nframework of the national sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity of the Kingdom of Morocco. \n  \n \n06-53323 48 \n \n To that end, nationwide consultations were \nlaunched in November 2005 with all political actors \nand local representatives of the region, within the \nframework of the Royal Consultative Council for \nSaharan Affairs, whose membership has been renewed, \nstructure modernized and mandate strengthened. This \nprocess has been carried out on the basis of \nparticipation and transparency aimed at encouraging \nthe adherence of all parties to the notion of autonomy. \nThis experience is unique in the Arab North African \nregion. \n More than ever, the world needs a more efficient \nUnited Nations that can translate into reality the \naspirations and expectations of all the peoples of the \nworld, uphold the principles of international legality \nand foster the spirit of multilateralism through \ninnovative mechanisms, value-added components and \nnew ideas that can yield positive results. \n As it has done over the past 50 years, the \nKingdom of Morocco will contribute to strengthening \nthe principles of the Organization and enhancing its \nwork in the service of peace, development and accord \namong all peoples of the world.

        "file_text": "In 2006, several important anniversaries coincide and \nprovide a background for our debate. For the United \nNations, 2006 represents a new opportunity to assess \nprogress since the adoption six years ago of the \npackage of commitments generally known as the \nMillennium Development Goals, which received \nrenewed impetus during the 2005 World Summit. The \noutcome of that summit provides the main theme of our \ndebate during this Assembly, as well as the guidelines \nfor the reform of our Organization. For this great city, \nthe site of the Headquarters of our Organization, 2006 \nmarks the fifth anniversary of the tragic events of \n11 September 2001, which altered history forever. For \nGuatemala, 2006 marks the tenth anniversary of the \nsigning of the Peace Accords that put an end to a \nbloody internal conflict lasting over four decades. For \nour Secretary-General, it marks the end of his 10-year \nterm, which has had a highly positive result: a result \nthat I want to acknowledge and for which I would like \nto thank him. \n I will move on to address some of these \nsubstantial issues. But before doing so, I would like to \nstate our appreciation of Mr. Jan Eliasson\u2019s \nstewardship and exceptional leadership of the previous \nsession of this Assembly. At the same time, we \nwelcome your election, Madam President, and have no \ndoubt that you will bring us to a safe port. \n I should like to allude very briefly to four \nmatters: compliance with the Guatemalan Peace \nAccords, a process in which the United Nations \nparticipated very closely; follow-up of the 2005 World \nSummit, especially Millennium Goal 8, namely, to \nfoster a global partnership for development; our views \non certain aspects of United Nations reform; and our \nviews on certain positive developments that affect \ninternational relations. \n The brief time allotted to me does not allow me \nto go into detail, but it is undeniable that we have \nadvanced substantially in the direction of giving \nconcrete expression to the vision contained in the \nPeace Accords. More to the point, if we contrast \ntoday\u2019s Guatemala to that of 1996, we now have a \nsociety that is more plural, tolerant, deliberative and \nparticipative than in the past. Our representative \ndemocracy is taking root, after three free and \ntransparent elections. The army is truly subordinated to \n  \n \n06-52885 2 \n \nthe civil Government. Important progress has been \nachieved in strengthening a multi-ethnic and \nmultilingual society. The State is committed to \nrespecting of civil, political and human rights and to \npromoting greater participation of women in our \nsociety. Significant efforts have been in strengthening \nthe administration of justice and consolidating the rule \nof law. The proportion of public expenditure assigned \nto the provision of social services has increased \nsignificantly in the past few years. We have assisted the \nvictims of the conflict through a programme of \nreparation payments. We promote the National Front \nagainst Hunger as a priority of my Government. \nLikewise, we recently adopted a policy on rural \ndevelopment, which was prepared and will be \nimplemented with the participation of entrepreneurs, \npeasants and trade unions. \n At the same time, we recognize that much \nremains to be done. Human rights violations persist, \noften linked to an increase in crime, including \norganized crime. It is for this reason that we invited the \nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights \nto open an office in Guatemala and to join us in \nstrengthening our own capacity to defend and protect \nvulnerable groups. We have also invited the United \nNations to support an initiative to establish a \ncommission to investigate illicit and clandestine \ngroups. Furthermore, we have promoted domestic \nlegislation to combat the scourge of crime, including \nthe recently promulgated law against organized crime. \n The commitments contained in the Peace Accords \nentail serious budgetary implications. To address them, \nwe recently sent to Congress, and Congress approved, \nan act to combat tax evasion. At the same time, we \nhave forged a broad consensus on an agreed tax \npackage that ensures the financing of future \ndevelopment through improvements in the allocation \nand administration of public expenditures and the \ncollection of taxes. \n My Government assigns priority to the \nrecognition of the identity and rights of indigenous \npeoples. In this regard, we trust that the General \nAssembly will soon adopt the Draft Declaration on the \nRights of Indigenous Peoples, which saw light in the \nHuman Rights Council and which will contribute to \nachieving the Millennium Development Goals. \n In summary, our Government Plan has embraced \nthe Peace Accords and is committed nationally to \ncomplying with them. In 2005, a Framework Act on the \nPeace Accords was passed in order to strengthen the \ninstitutional aspects of the peace process. One of our \ngoals is to achieve socio-economic development that is \nparticipatory and responds to the needs of the entire \npopulation. \n This leads me to the second item, namely, the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). Indeed, a \nmajor part of our Government programme is entirely \nconsistent with those goals, especially with regard to \ncombating poverty and hunger and achieving universal \nprimary education. Our policies, which emphasize rural \ndevelopment, take an approach that favours the poorest \nstrata of our society. The efforts undertaken have been \nbased mostly on domestic resources \u2014 Government \nand civil society \u2014 but we have also received support \nfrom the international community in the context of a \ngenuine partnership. \n The international community\u2019s respect for our \npriorities has grown, and it has increasingly adapted its \nmethods to our budgetary procedures. From our \ncountry\u2019s point of view, significant progress has been \nachieved since the International Conference on \nFinancing for Development was held in 2002. We have \nalso noted a reversal, over the past four years, in the \nearlier trend towards declining official development \nassistance (ODA). It is hoped that the new trend of \nincreasing ODA will persist and accelerate, especially \nin favour of the least developed countries. \n In contrast to the relatively encouraging picture \nin the area of financing for development, it is a source \nof great concern that the negotiations of the Doha \nDevelopment Round have been suspended. That is a \nserious setback for the global economy and especially \nfor the chances of developing countries to improve \ntheir participation in international trade. \n If the potential of the Development Round is not \nsalvaged, which must include the dismantling of \nagricultural subsidies as well as other restrictive \npractices of trade in agricultural products that persist \namong the main developed economies, it will be \ndifficult to continue referring to a global partnership \nfor development as posited by the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. In that regard, it is urgently \nnecessary to renew the negotiations of the Doha Round \nunder the aegis of the World Trade Organization. On \nthat subject, we also support the strengthening of \nSouth-South cooperation in all areas. \n \n \n3 06-52885 \n \n Moving on now to the third part of my remarks, \nwe believe that the reforms undertaken at the United \nNations since 2000, and in particular since the 2005 \nSummit, have been significant and headed in the right \ndirection. We identify with the new Human Rights \nCouncil, of which we are a member, and support the \nfulfilment of its role in promoting and protecting \nhuman rights at the global level. \n We also understand the considerable potential of \nthe new Peacebuilding Commission to contribute to the \njoint work of the Security Council and the Economic \nand Social Council for the benefit of countries now in \npost-conflict situations. We promote the revitalization \nand strengthening of the General Assembly as the only \nuniversal body with enough legitimacy to debate and \nadopt policies, as prescribed by the Charter and as \nagreed in the Millennium Declaration and at the 2005 \nSummit. \n We reiterate our strong support for the Economic \nand Social Council as a meeting place to foster \nsustainable development. We especially applaud the \ndecision to convene a high-level meeting on \ndevelopment cooperation every two years. We add our \nvoices to all the others urging an end to the stalemate \nin the discussions on Security Council reform. The \nparameters of that debate are well known. For our part, \nwe have historically favoured a moderate expansion in \nthe number of non-permanent members, but more \nrecently, we have signalled that we could support any \nformula that would be capable of bringing about a \nconsensus, including the expansion of members in both \ncategories. We also support a more representative, \ntransparent and effective Council. \n We are candidates for a non-permanent seat on \nthe Council for the biennium 2007-2008, because we \nbelieve that our experience as a country that made the \ntransition from conflict to peace and democracy \nprovides us with insights that would contribute to the \nwork of the Council. In addition, we are one of the few \noriginal signatories of the Charter that have not yet had \nthe opportunity to serve in the work of that body. If \nelected to the Security Council, we commit ourselves \nto carrying out our responsibilities in a professional, \nresponsible and dignified manner \u2014 in the \nrepresentation of our region \u2014 and also to promote \nfrom within the reform of that crucial forum for \nassuring peace and stability in the world. \n My country\u2019s foreign policy is in accordance with \nour national interests based on improved participation \nby Guatemala in the globalized world, as well as the \nstrengthening of multilateralism and regional \nintegration. We have promoted a deeper integration \nwith our immediate neighbours in Central America, \nand important progress in the establishment of a \ncustoms union has been achieved. We, the five Central \nAmerican countries, have also agreed on a free trade \nagreement with the United States of America, and in \n2007, will begin negotiations on an association \nagreement with the European Union. \n Moreover, my Government has endeavoured to \ndeepen its bilateral relations with Belize, while at the \nsame time seeking to find a definitive, just, equitable \nand honourable solution to the territorial dispute \nbetween our countries. Thus, on 7 September 2005, we \nsigned, under the auspices of the Organization of \nAmerican States, an Agreement on a Framework for \nNegotiations and Confidence-Building Measures, \nwhich covers a wide range of subjects and will bring us \ncloser. One of the tangible results of that effort has \nbeen a free trade agreement signed just a few months \nago. \n Guatemala participated actively in the High-level \nDialogue on International Migration and Development \nheld in this same Hall less than a week ago. In that \ncontext, we emphasize that attention to the situation of \nGuatemalan migrants is another priority of my \nGovernment. An essential element of the public policy \non that subject is full respect for the human rights of all \nmigrants, an element which will only be fulfilled when \nall States become parties to the International \nConvention on the Protection of the Rights of All \nMigrant Workers and Members of Their Families. \n My Government is working with the recipient \ncountries, in particular with the United States of \nAmerica, to promote comprehensive migration reform \nthat would include mechanisms to manage the supply \nof workers in the countries of origin and the demand \nfor workers in the recipient countries. That would help \nregularize the situation of emigrants, whose \ncontribution to the well-being of their communities is \nsubstantial, and would make it possible to overcome \nthe great vulnerability of our population. \n We feel solidarity with other countries that have \nendured under conflict situations. This is why we have \ntaken part in an increasing number of United Nations \n  \n \n06-52885 4 \n \npeacekeeping operations. We are proud of our \npresence, along with many other Latin American \ncountries, in our neighbour Haiti, and we celebrate the \ndemocratically elected Government of President Ren\u00e9 \nPr\u00e9val. We also have troops in the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo and military observers in six \nother countries in the African continent. \n We deplore the violence that has affected several \ncountries in the Middle East, in particular Lebanon. We \ncall for a solution that will allow Israel and a sovereign \nPalestinian State to live in peace within safe borders in \nthe wider context of a region that finds its own destiny \nin harmony and progress. \n Given the importance of coordination among \nStates of the region, Guatemala organized, from 11 to \n13 September 2006, the first regional security meeting \nof Central America and the Dominican Republic, with \nthe goal of achieving a consensus among the countries \nof the Central American group, as well as Mexico, \nColombia, Belize and the Dominican Republic, to \ndevelop a comprehensive strategy and to counteract the \nmain threats to the area, a consensus to unify the \nsecurity policies and procedures already agreed and \ncontained in multilateral regional and international \nagreements, treaties and conventions, as well as those \nadopted at summit meetings. We hope we can continue \nto count on the support of the international community \nand of the United Nations to organize three more \nmeetings to complete the development of that strategy. \n It is important to emphasize that Guatemala is \norganizing, jointly with Transparency International, the \n12th International Anti-Corruption Conference, from \n15 to 18 November this year. The theme for the \nconference will be \u201cTowards a fairer world: Why is \ncorruption still blocking the way?\u201d This effort reflects \nmy Government\u2019s firm commitment to fight the \nscourge of corruption that has corroded our institutions \nfor many years and has prevented our citizens from \nmaking the transition to a more just country. On that \nnote, you are all welcome, and we are eager to share \nour challenges, progress and difficulties in this \ncommon struggle. \n Under your leadership, Madam President, at this \nsession the General Assembly will have to address \nissues of great importance for humanity and for our \nOrganization. Guatemala pledges to participate actively \nin the debates planned for this year. From this moment \non, we offer you our full cooperation for the success of \nyour presidency. "

        "file_text": "On behalf of \nthe people and Government of the Republic of \nMozambique, and indeed on my own behalf, I would \nlike to place on record our congratulations to the \nPresident on her election to preside over the sixty-first \nsession of the General Assembly. We are delighted to \nsee a distinguished daughter of Bahrain in the \nstewardship of the highest organ of the United Nations. \n We reiterate our congratulations to her \npredecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, Minister for Foreign \n \n \n11 06-52988 \n \nAffairs of Sweden, for his leadership during the \nsixtieth session. We congratulate him once again on the \ncommendable work done during his tenure of office. \n We would also like to pay a glowing tribute to \nMr. Kofi Annan for his accomplishments during his \nmandate as Secretary-General. We commend the \ndevotion and tireless efforts of this son of Africa, our \ncontinent, for his work for the promotion of \ninternational peace, security and development, as well \nas for having created the solid foundations for wide-\nranging reforms of the United Nations. \n One of the issues on which our debate focused \nlast year related to development. We noted with \nconcern then that there was a substantive lack of \nprogress in forging partnerships. In this regard, we \nsalute the President for bringing the theme \n\u201cImplementing a global partnership for development\u201d \nfor debate at this session. \n We live in a very unbalanced world, in which \ndeveloping countries find themselves in a vicious cycle \nof dependency and vulnerability. This plight \nundermines our efforts to address, speedily and \nsuccessfully, the challenges that prevent our enjoying \nsounder economic and social growth and weaken our \ncapacity to deal, more effectively and with greater \nimpact, with the various manifestations of poverty and \nto fight, more vigorously, diseases such as malaria, \ntuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. Given our state of \ndevelopment, more often than not we are powerless to \nprevent or mitigate the impact of natural disasters and \nenvironmental degradation. Consequently, poverty \nprevents the part of our humanity located in developing \ncountries from enjoying the freedom of choice and \naction that the other part of mankind takes for granted. \n The merit of the theme that the President has put \nforward for our debate is that it gives us yet another \nopportunity to reflect on issues that we have dealt with \nin the past in seeking solutions for the remaining \nchallenges imposed by underdevelopment. It also lends \nitself to a debate of at least three important issues \nrelated to the problem of underdevelopment. \n The first is that no country alone, however \nresourceful it may be, can successfully overcome these \nchallenges on its own, at least not in the medium term, \nbecause these are challenges noted for their complexity \nand interrelationships with other global problems and \nphenomena.  \n The second point that can be inferred from this \ntheme is that, while underdevelopment can be \nattributed to or identified with a given country, its \nconsequences transcend national borders. They go \nbeyond geographical boundaries to, on the one hand, \naffect national security and demography in other \ncountries and, on the other, raise moral obligations of \nnew dimensions, as well as material challenges in other \nsocieties. \n The third issue relates to a static view of poverty. \nThe poor need to regain their self-confidence so that, \nlike people in other parts of the world, they too can rid \nthemselves of the shackles of poverty. By the same \ntoken, those who can assist also need to overcome the \ndeep-rooted view that the poor will not escape from \npoverty, as they are destined to remain poor. On the \nother hand, they also need to overcome the \npreconceived idea that development must be imposed \nfrom the outside. \n This discussion brings us back to our realization \nthat, given the global nature of the challenges facing us \ntoday, we have no choice but to weave together and \nstrengthen the national, regional and global \npartnerships. As a result of this realization, we adopted \nthe Monterrey Consensus, as well as the Johannesburg \nPlan of Implementation and the Millennium \nDeclaration. The expectation was that these \nconsensuses would translate, in concrete terms, into \nour commitment to forge global partnerships for \ndevelopment. Regrettably, little has been achieved so \nfar. Abject poverty remains a common feature of the \nmajority of developing countries. \n Therefore, I urge that we need to reiterate our \ncommitment to work together at various levels for the \nwell-being of humanity. Mankind is not a far-fetched \nconcept. For example, the very fact that the language I \nam using now can be translated into the other \nlanguages of the planet is a clear demonstration of how \nwe belong to the same humanity. Let us, therefore, \nredouble our efforts so as not to frustrate the \nexpectations of billions of citizens worldwide, in the \ndeveloped and the developing countries alike. All of \nthem are longing for a fairer, prosperous and peaceful \nworld. Through these partnerships we can also, more \neffectively, contribute to conflict resolution in Africa, \nin the Middle East and in the world at large. \n At this juncture, we would like to share with the \nAssembly our experience and views on the role and \n  \n \n06-52988 12 \n \nplace of partnerships to overcome the challenges \nbefore us today. \n At the national level, we are of the view that the \ndevelopment projects must be owned and driven by \ntheir primary and ultimate beneficiaries. In this regard, \nthe Government creates and promotes an environment \nthat facilitates the honing of self-esteem, promotes \nrecourse to individual creativity and supports \nincremental development. At the same time, the \nGovernment encourages and sustains partnerships with \nother collective development actors, such as civil \nsociety organizations, the private sector and \ninternational partners in cooperation. The products of \nthis approach to governance include, for example: the \nsecond Action Plan for the Reduction of Absolute \nPoverty for the period 2006-2009, drawn up with the \nactive participation of civil society organizations; \nannual meetings with the private sector; meetings of \nthe social partners, with the participation of the \nGovernment, trade unions and employers; the national \nforum for the African Peer Review Mechanism; and the \njoint review meetings between the Government and the \ndevelopment partners involved in direct budget \nsupport. \n These partnerships are held together by our \nadherence to open and inclusive governance. They are \nalso sustained by the collective commitment of various \nstakeholders engaged in the development of \nMozambique to reduce the incidence of absolute \npoverty from 54 per cent in 2003 to 45 per cent in \n2009. The environment of peace and stability in which \nwe live and which we promote also contributes to \nenhancing these partnerships. \n Regional cooperation plays an important role in \nbuilding and sustaining partnerships for development. \nThe Southern African Development Community \n(SADC) is a case in point. Since its birth, SADC has \nbeen playing a crucial role in promoting the political, \neconomic and social integration of countries and \npeoples of the region. At the same time, SADC allows \na given number of its member states to take initiatives \nthat further its ultimate objective of a more prosperous \nregion. In accordance with this principle, last August \nMozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe launched \nthe Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park, a project that \naims to transform an area of approximately 35,000 \nsquare kilometres, rich in biodiversity, into a \ndevelopment hub. \n Viewed as one of the building blocks of the \nAfrican Union, SADC plays an important role in \npromoting the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s \nDevelopment (NEPAD), the African Union road map \ntowards prosperity. We take this opportunity to \ncommend the international community for aligning its \nassistance ever more closely with the NEPAD \npriorities. We would also encourage our development \npartners to increase their support for NEPAD. \n By deciding last week in Havana on the \ncontinuation of the Non-Aligned Movement\u2019s \nrevitalization process, the Non-Aligned Summit put \ngreater emphasis on the role the Movement should play \nin forging partnerships among the countries of the \nSouth, as part of the global partnerships. Thus, the \nNon-Aligned Movement reinvigorated the Bandung \nspirit, which, as we all know, inspired the \nestablishment of the New Asian-African Strategic \nPartnership. \n In addition to the Monterrey Consensus, we \nadvocate an increase in international financial support, \nincluding official development assistance and foreign \ndirect investment for countries such as ours that have \npotential for agriculture, agro-industry and tourism. \n Similarly, we are in favour of the establishment \nof a fairer and more favourable global trading system \nthat is more conducive to sustainable development in \ndeveloping countries. In this context, we regret the lack \nof progress in the Doha Development Round, and we \nurge developed countries to be more flexible, within \nthe framework of the World Trade Organization, in \ntheir approach to the needs of developing countries. We \nreiterate this appeal because we are convinced that our \npartners do not want to witness the perpetuation of the \nmarginalization of developing countries from the \nglobal economy. \n The assessment made in 2005 indicates that a \nnumber of developing countries are making progress \ntowards the attainment of the Millennium Development \nGoals. Mozambique is part of this positive trend. \nHowever, to ensure that it is irreversible, we call upon \nour development partners to continue to provide \nsubstantial and timely support for the priorities \nidentified by the recipient countries. We believe that \nour partners are also touched, in their souls and in their \nspirit, by the poverty that still afflicts that part of \nhumanity. \n \n \n13 06-52988 \n \n In conclusion, we join previous speakers in \nemphasizing the need for the United Nations reforms to \nmove forward. We all recognize the United Nations \npotential to forge effective partnerships for \ndevelopment. Therefore, we reaffirm the commitment \nof the Government of the Republic of Mozambique to \ncontribute to the success of this reform process, always \nbearing in mind the need to safeguard the \nintergovernmental nature of the United Nations. \n Mozambique is proud that its Prime Minister, \nMrs. Lu\u00edsa Diogo, is one of the Co-Chairs of the High-\nlevel Panel on System-Wide Coherence in the areas of \ndevelopment, humanitarian assistance and the \nenvironment, established by the Secretary-General. It \nis our belief that the Panel\u2019s report will contribute to \nthe success of the United Nations reforms. A reformed \nUnited Nations will be better placed to respond to the \ninternational challenges imposed by the need to \nstrengthen international law and multilateralism and to \npromote partnerships for development and peace \nworldwide.

        "file_text": "On behalf of \nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Omer Hassan \nAl-Bashir, President of the Republic of the Sudan, and \nto invite him to address the Assembly. \n President Al-Bashir (spoke in Arabic): It gives \nme great pleasure, Madam, to extend my warmest \ncongratulations to you on your election as President of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-first session. There is \nno doubt that your election is an honour for us, because \nof the excellent relations between our two sisterly \ncountries. I am fully confident that you will lead our \ndeliberations to a successful conclusion. I would like \nalso to commend your predecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, \nfor the efficient way in which he guided the work of \nthe previous session. I seize this opportunity, \nfurthermore, to express our appreciation for the \nendeavours of the United Nations Secretariat in the \npast period. \n The Members of the United Nations are about to \nselect a new Secretary-General. We hope that they will \nchoose a new Secretary-General who will undertake his \nduties in a neutral, objective and transparent manner, \nso that our Organization can achieve the purposes to \nwhich we all aspire, serving the international \ncommunity in achieving peace, stability and global \nprosperity. \n I take this opportunity to welcome the Republic \nof Montenegro to membership of this Organization. \n This session has special importance for my \ncountry. It occurs on the fiftieth anniversary of the \nSudan joining the United Nations after it gained its \nindependence in the mid-twentieth century. The five \ndecades that have passed since then have strengthened \nthe aspirations of our country and our people for an \neffective and fair United Nations, as well as our \nconviction that the independence and political freedom \nachieved by our country, as well as our hopes for a \nbright, prosperous and developed future, could be \ndestroyed by the challenges of the present phase, \nincluding the double standards, the dangers of \nhegemony and the use of international forums to \nachieve political, economic or strategic objectives. \n The Government and the people of the Sudan \neagerly seek peace, which has become our strategic \nobjective. Because of our sincere will and strong \ndesire, peace has become a living reality. In January \n2005 we witnessed the signing of the Comprehensive \nPeace Agreement. That Agreement did merely address \nthe causes of the dispute between the south and the \nnorth, but offered fair solutions to all the problems \nfaced by our country. It established political rules for a \nsystem that recognizes citizenship as a basis for rights \nand duties, and that recognizes diversity and considers \nit to be a source of strength and unity. The system is \n  \n \n06-52737 44 \n \nbased on power-sharing, democratic principles, the rule \nof law, good governance and respect for human rights \nand freedoms. \n In the economic area, that Agreement establishes \nrules for wealth-sharing in accordance with criteria of \nfairness, brotherhood and equality between the central \nGovernment and the provinces of the south and the \nnorth. The Agreement is based on sound principles and \nstandards of justice and thus establishes the correct \nrules for a comprehensive peace, which should prevail \nthroughout the country. \n The implementation of the Agreement has \nprogressed at the national level. A Government of \nNational Unity has been formed, as was a Government \nof South Sudan. Legislative bodies have also been \nestablished, as well as the National Constitutional \nReview Commission, the National Judicial Services \nCommission and the National Petroleum Commission. \nAll options were presented to the President, who \nselected the best among them. At the moment, serious \nefforts continue to complete work on the other \ncommissions realistically, objectively and with good \nintentions. We have also begun, in cooperation with the \nUnited Nations, to prepare for the return of refugees \nand displaced persons, some of whom have already \nreturned. \n We were convinced that peace would not fully \nsucceed unless it also prevailed among our people in \nDarfur. I am pleased to convey to the Assembly that in \nMay we were able to sign the Darfur Peace Agreement, \nin Abuja. That had been a principal objective since the \nconflict in that region began. We express our deep \ngratitude and appreciation to all those who contributed \nto bringing about that great achievement, prominent \namong them the African Union, which has contributed \ntroops since the beginning of the crisis and has \nsponsored the negotiations on the issue. We also thank \nsisterly Nigeria, which has hosted the negotiations, and \nthe other partners who have worked to bring the \ndivergent views closer together and have spared no \neffort in pushing the parties towards an agreement. The \ngreat role undertaken by the African Union in Darfur is \nproof of what regional organizations can do to settle \ndisputes in their regions. \n That pioneering experiment should impel the \nSecurity Council to encourage all such organizations \nand genuinely and objectively support them in the \nmaintenance of regional peace and security, in \naccordance with the United Nations Charter and \nwithout their efforts being aborted or their roles \npre-empted by certain hegemonic parties that have \ntheir own illegal agendas. \n We have begun steps to implement the \nAgreement, through ongoing consultations with the \nAfrican Union and the Sudanese parties that are \nsignatories to the Agreement, in particular concerning \nsecurity arrangements, the sharing of power and wealth \nand the return of displaced persons, in addition to \npreparing for the Darfur-Darfur dialogue. \n We have buttressed the implementation effort \u2014 \nwhich is being carried out according to a timetable \u2014 \nby appointing Mr. Minni Arko Minawi, leader of the \nSudan Liberation Movement, as senior assistant to the \nPresident and Chairman of the Transitional Darfur \nRegional Authority. the Authority will be responsible \nfor enforcing the provisions of the Agreement. Those \nsteps will take us to the final phase: completion of all \nthe mechanisms necessary to implement the \nAgreement. \n Here we reaffirm the Government of National \nUnity\u2019s commitment to the Agreement in letter and in \nspirit. I take the opportunity to sincerely invite all the \nparties that have not yet signed the Agreement or \njoined the peace process to do so, in order to \nconsolidate national efforts towards attaining stability. \n If the armed factions continue to refuse to join \nthe peace efforts, and persist in violence against and \nintimidation of citizens, they must be isolated and \nprevented from acting, in accordance with the Abuja \nPeace Agreement, which also stipulates that efforts by \nall signatories to the Agreement should be encouraged, \nin order to accelerate full implementation in letter and \nin spirit. The international community would thus be \nenabled to assist us in strengthening our capacity to \nbring about rehabilitation and reconstruction. \n We hope and expect that the international \ncommunity will fulfil its commitments concerning the \ncancellation of all of our foreign debt to States or to \nfinancial institutions, and will lift all restrictions and \neconomic and trade sanctions that had been imposed by \nsome international parties. These are impeding our \nreconstruction and development efforts. We will thus \nbe able to shoulder the burden of reconstruction, \nincrease the rate of growth and provide a life of dignity \nfor our people. \n \n \n45 06-52737 \n \n It is regrettable that some influential international \nparties, rather than fulfilling their pledges and \ncommitments and respecting the provisions of the \nAbuja Peace Agreement, continue instead to undermine \nthose efforts through unfair and unjustifiable pressures \nand partiality, and through the negative signals that \nthey send to non-signatories of the Abuja Agreement. \nThis has culminated in the exploitation of the Security \ncouncil, which has adopted resolutions that serve those \nparties\u2019 interests and strategies, such as Council \nresolution 1706 (2006) which seeks to undermine \nnational and regional endeavours to implement the \nAbuja Agreement, as that resolution contradicts the \nAgreement in letter and in spirit. Indeed, it would place \nour country under the trusteeship of those influential \nparties. That makes it imperative to continue our \nefforts to implement the Abuja Agreement and to \nmobilize the resources and funding necessary to \nachieve a sustainable peace in Darfur, so that our \ncountry and our region can enjoy the fruits of that \npeace. \nMr. Jenie (Indonesia), Vice-President, took the \nChair. \n Our country refuses all forms of dictates and all \nattempts to humiliate it and usurp its national will. It \nwholly rejects any attempts to re-colonize us in a new, \nsly manner. Thus we reject all attempts to impose new \ninternational forces in Darfur without taking into \naccount Darfur\u2019s special circumstances and without \nconsultations with the Government of Sudan. The \nsubject has become, in itself, a goal in the service of \nsome internal political objectives of some parties. \n World leaders who met here last September to \nfollow up the results of the Millennium Summit \nadopted a document that calls for reform of the United \nNations, the promotion of international peace and \nsecurity, respect for human rights, adoption of \ncollective measures to combat poverty and bringing \nabout development and, in particular as regards issues \npertaining to funding development based on the \nMonterrey Consensus. \n What has been agreed to with regard to \npromoting the role of the United Nations calls upon us \nto work collectively with the necessary political will, \nparticularly on the part of the permanent members of \nthe Security Council. That should enable the \nOrganization to carry out its work in a truly democratic \nmanner. \n In this context, we call for agreement on reform \nof the Security Council and updating its working \nmethods. The Council\u2019s present composition does not \nachieve this; it is an impediment to what we are \nseeking \u2014 real democracy in the management of \ninternational relations. What makes the call for reform \nmore imperative is the eruption of conflicts that \nthreaten peace and security without the Council \nmaking any effective move to contain them. A good \ncase in point are the tragic developments in the Middle \nEast. The Council watched helplessly while those \ndevelopments occurred. This emphasizes the point that \nstructural and institutional reform of the Security \nCouncil has become more imperative today than ever \nbefore. \n In this context, my delegation reaffirms its \ncommitment to the African position as stipulated in the \nEzulwini document, a position that was reiterated at the \nAfrican summits held in Serte, Khartoum and Banjul. \n The follow-up to the outcome of the Millennium \nSummit has shown clearly that what has been achieved \nhas not met our expectations, particularly in regard to \nthe African continent, which is bleeding to death under \nits debt burden and is facing an incompatible, non-\nconducive economic and trade environment. The \nproblems of hunger, poverty and disease in Africa have \nreached very serious dimensions and constitute a great \nthreat to the international community. They will \ncontinue to haunt us unless efforts by the international \ncommunity are consolidated in order to accelerate \nfairer development in developing countries, \nparticularly in the least developed ones. It will be \nimpossible to reach the Millennium Development Goal \nof reducing poverty by half by the year 2015. The \ncorrect path towards achieving the MDGs requires that \nwe emphasize the importance of total debt \ncancellation, as debts are a great impediment to \nbringing about those goals, particularly in Africa and in \nthe least developed countries. \n We attach great importance to the fact that \ndeveloped countries should fulfil their commitments \nconcerning financing for development and \nimplementing the Brussels Programme of Action for \nthe Least Developed Countries. They should work to \nreform financing institutions, which will promote \ntransparency and lead to larger representation for \ndeveloping countries in such institutions. They should \nincrease technical and financial assistance so that an \ninvestment environment for the private sector can be \n  \n \n06-52737 46 \n \ncreated, suitable infrastructures can be brought about, \nthe environment can be protected and corruption can be \ncombated. \n The imposition of unilateral coercive economic \nmeasures on developing countries constitutes an \nimpediment to freedom of commerce and investment. \nFunding issues and the transfer of technology are still \nmain components of sustainable development. Here we \nwould like to emphasize the provision of assistance to \nthe least developed countries in social services, \neducation, health care, and for combating diseases such \nas AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, which kill millions \nof people every year. \n We seize this opportunity to reaffirm once again \nour commitment to what we agreed on in the \nMillennium Declaration and to reaching the Goals \ncontained therein for a better life for humanity as a \nwhole, with full emphasis on the right of developing \ncountries to determine their own development \npriorities without restrictions or prior conditions that \nwould hinder their development efforts. We would like \nto highlight also the importance of guaranteeing that \nthe proposed new financing mechanisms will not \nnegatively impact investment flows. \n The Sudan has made great efforts towards \nachieving those Goals and has achieved noticeable \nprogress, particularly in reducing the poverty rate and \nexpanding public education, despite the unjust embargo \nand the longstanding conflict in the south of the \ncountry. \n My country has expressed its condemnation of \nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations and has \ncalled for the adoption of an international strategy to \ncombat it. In this context, we believe that the definition \nof terrorism distinguishes it clearly from the just \nstruggle by people to preserve their legitimate right to \ndefend their freedom and the right to self-\ndetermination. That must be the main pillar on which \nthe international community should fully agree. The \nSudan believes in the international campaign to combat \nthe phenomenon of terrorism, in accordance with the \nUnited Nations Charter, principles of international law \nand the inviolability of the sovereignty of States. \n The question of Palestine is a story that embodies \nthe suffering of a people that has been deprived of its \npolitical and economic rights. The Israeli occupation \ncontinues to be a heavy burden on the legitimate \nPalestinian dreams to bring about freedom and \ndevelopment. The international community must force \nIsrael to fulfil the obligations it has undertaken, \nincluding the road map, halting construction of the \nseparation wall, and heeding the Advisory Opinion of \nthe International Court of Justice issued in July 2004. \nThis was adopted by the General Assembly at its tenth \nemergency session, enabling the Palestinian people to \nexercise its right to self-determination and to establish \nan independent State, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its \ncapital. \n We renew our full support to the Palestinian \npeople and its elected institutions. We call on the \ninternational community to respect the choices made \nby the Palestinian people and to shoulder its \nresponsibilities vis-\u00e0-vis the Palestinian \nGovernment \u2014 which has come about through free and \nfair elections \u2014 to lift the embargo imposed against it \nand to support it. We call upon the international \ncommunity to pressure Israel to halt its ongoing \naggression against the Gaza Strip and release the \nabducted Palestinian ministers and parliamentarians. \n The Israeli aggression against Lebanon last \nAugust, which targeted innocent civilians \u2014 women \nand children \u2014 has shaken the world\u2019s conscience. \nThis is a flagrant violation of international \nhumanitarian law and agreements. We would like to \nexpress our full solidarity with the people and the \nGovernment of Lebanon and with the resistance. We \ncommend their steadfastness in the face of this flagrant \naggression, and we hold Israel responsible for the \ndestruction and the sabotage of brotherly Lebanon. We \ncall for the establishment of an international \ncommission to investigate the war crimes perpetrated \nby Israel, and we call also on international, regional \nand volunteer organizations to intensify their \nemergency efforts to provide assistance to the victims. \n We have always been convinced that the volatility \nof the situation in the Middle East and the ongoing \ntensions are due to the Israeli occupation, and that a \ncomprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict \nand the advent of peace in the region cannot be \nachieved unless Israel withdraws completely from all \nthe territories occupied since 1967, including the \noccupied Syrian Golan and the Shab\u2019a farms. \n We wish to emphasize in that context the \nimportance of making the Middle East a zone free of \nweapons of mass destruction, with no exceptions, in \n \n \n47 06-52737 \n \norder to bring about security and stability, which would \nbenefit all the peoples of the region. \n We reiterate our support for Iraq and its territorial \nintegrity. We believe that its sovereignty should extend \nto all its territory, and we call on all segments of Iraqi \nsociety to engage in dialogue with a view to resolving \ntheir problems. We welcome the initiative of the \nLeague of Arab States to hold a national reconciliation \nconference, and we support all sincere efforts aimed at \nbringing stability to brotherly Iraq, so that it can \nresume its rightful place in the regional context. \n In Somalia, there have been recent positive \ndevelopments in the reconciliation process led by the \nSudan, in coordination with the Arab League, which \nhave led to the Somali Transitional Federal \nGovernment signing an agreement with the Islamic \nCourts Union and a reconciliation statement in \nKhartoum in June 2006. There is no doubt that this will \npromote the reconciliation efforts currently led at the \nregional level by the Intergovernmental Authority on \nDevelopment (IGAD). We hope that our brothers in \nSomalia will continue the dialogue and promote \nreconciliation efforts in order to bring about stability \nand security, so that sisterly Somalia can transcend this \nvery difficult phase. \n We are fully convinced that Africa is rich in \nhuman resources and cultural heritage and that it has \nthe material and human means to ensure a bright future \nfor itself. However, Africa faces many complex \nchallenges, such as the achievement of stability and \ndevelopment. \n Unless all of Africa works in a united and \nconcerted manner, it will not be possible to realize our \naspirations. We in Africa, more than anyone else, are \nresponsible for translating those aspirations into reality. \nWe are prepared to work, in an effective partnership \nwith others, to do so. That will benefit our African \npeoples and contribute to stability at the international \nlevel, as envisaged by the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s \nDevelopment initiative. \n The Great Lakes region is emerging from a \nlengthy and deadly conflict, which has given way to a \nphase in which democracy is taking root. The \nInternational Conference for the Great Lakes Region, \nwhich is still in the preparatory stages and is aimed at \ndefining conditions and criteria conducive to ongoing \nregional cooperation among the States of the region, \nwill hold its second summit next December in Nairobi \nto adopt a treaty on security and stability in the region. \nThe process is facilitated by the United Nations, the \nAfrican Union and some of our partners and is tangible \nproof of the genuine political will of the countries of \nthe region. It is a unique initiative to build peace in the \nregion. \n I should like from this rostrum to call on the \ninternational community to step up the pace in the \nprovision of the financial and political support \nnecessary to push this treaty forward and ensure its \nadoption for the Great Lakes region. We call for \nsupport for the implementation of that treaty, so that \nthe peoples of the region will cease being victimized \nby disputes, humanitarian disasters or insecurity and be \nable to realize their aspirations to peace, stability and \ndevelopment.

        "file_text": "It \ngives me pleasure at the outset to congratulate you, \nMadam President, on your election to the presidency of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-first session. I wish \nyou every success in your endeavours. I should also \nlike to thank your predecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, for \nhis efforts during the Assembly\u2019s sixtieth session. Our \nthanks also go to Mr. Kofi Annan, who has been \nworking to strengthen the role of the United Nations. \n During the September 2005 Summit, the \ninternational community reaffirmed its commitment to \nthe global partnership for development in order to \nachieve internationally agreed development objectives. \nThe United Nations system remains one of the most \nimportant pillars of international support for that \npartnership. I wish to recall here that the State of Qatar \nhas always been a supportive partner in development \nefforts, particularly in combating poverty, because all \nthat has positive results for stability and international \npeace and security. \n In 2001 Qatar hosted the Fourth Ministerial \nConference of the World Trade Organization, which \nculminated in the Doha Ministerial Declaration. It also \nhosted the South Summit in 2005, in which His \nHighness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, Emir of \nthe State of Qatar, launched his initiative to establish \nthe South\u2019s Fund for Development and Humanitarian \nAssistance. Moreover, His Highness reaffirmed Qatar\u2019s \ncommitment to meet the internationally agreed official \ndevelopment assistance target relative to its gross \nnational product. His Highness also offered to host the \nfirst Review Conference of the International \nConference on Financing for Development. I am \npleased to note that the State of Qatar will be hosting \nthe Sixth International Conference of New or Restored \nDemocracies, scheduled for 30 October to 1 November \nthis year.  \n I should also like to recall here that Qatar has \nextended emergency and disaster relief assistance and \nmade many contributions to the various United Nations \nfunds and programmes. \n We must work to strengthen the role of the United \nNations and revitalize and support its institutions so \nthat they can carry out the tasks entrusted to them in \ndifferent parts of the world. However, if the \nOrganization is to discharge its role in full, its Charter \nmust be adhered to and respected. Furthermore, an \nagreement must be reached on a new formula to reform \nthe Security Council and update its working methods. \nThe General Assembly must be allowed to play its role \nin the maintenance of international peace and security \nalongside the Security Council.  \n We were shocked and astonished at the \ndisproportionate Israeli response against fraternal \nLebanon, which killed hundreds of innocent civilians, \ntotally decimated its infrastructure and left scores of \nLebanese towns and villages in ruins. It has also \ndisplaced one quarter of Lebanon\u2019s population, which \nis indeed a full-scale war crime. \n The Arab-Israeli conflict and the Palestinian \nquestion must be accorded top priority, for which a \ncomprehensive, permanent and just solution is urgently \nneeded. The Palestinian question is an example of \nsuffering visited upon a people whose legitimate rights \nwere denied, a question that has been on the agendas of \n \n \n27 06-52879 \n \nthe Security Council and the General Assembly for \nmore than 50 years. Therefore the international \ncommunity must review its position towards a \nfundamental issue that it has left unresolved for more \nthan half a century, thus compounding the tragedy of \nthe Palestinian people.  \n Compelling Israel to implement United Nations \nresolutions is a collective duty that we must all fulfil so \nthat international legitimacy will not be branded as \nselective. The Palestinian people must be enabled to \nexercise their right to self-determination and to \nestablish their independent State with Jerusalem as its \ncapital.  \n A comprehensive, peaceful settlement of the \nArab-Israeli conflict should also be achieved, on the \nbasis of Israel\u2019s withdrawal from all the territories it \noccupied in 1967, including the Syrian Golan and the \nLebanese Sheba\u2019a farms. We also stress that the \nguarantee of permanent peace, security and stability in \nthe region lies in making the Middle East a zone free \nfrom all weapons of mass destruction without any \nexceptions. \n The difficult situation in fraternal Iraq requires \nour cooperation in order to help it overcome this \nuntenable situation and its repercussions. We have \ncontinuously reaffirmed our commitment to the unity \nand sovereignty of Iraq, to the rights of Iraqis to live in \ndignity and freedom and to rebuild their country, and \nfor Iraq to regain its well-deserved place in the region \nand among the family of nations. \n We want to pay tribute to the Government of the \nSudan, which after tireless efforts has succeeded in \nestablishing peace in the south of the country. It \ncontinues its sincere efforts to achieve security and \nstability in different parts of the country. We fully \nsupport those efforts and look forward to more support \nfrom the international community to fraternal Sudan in \norder to preserve its unity and territorial integrity.  \n We also support ongoing efforts by the League of \nArab States to achieve national reconciliation in \nfraternal Somalia and to restore the rule of law in that \ncountry. We call upon the international community to \nsupport those efforts so that stability and security can \nbe restored to Somalia. \n We reaffirm the important role of the United \nNations and the need to enhance it so that it can put \ninternational relations on a solid foundation of \nunderstanding and common interests. We also stress the \nimportance of resolving conflicts and disputes by \npeaceful means and of cooperation among all nations \nto end violence and combat terrorism. We must avoid \nsquandering our resources and wasting our energies on \nwars and conflicts. Instead, we should channel them \ntowards development and progress. We look forward to \na new world governed by the principles of justice, \nequality, freedom, democracy and peaceful coexistence \namong its peoples, nations and civilizations. "

        "file_text": "I am grateful for the privilege of \nspeaking to the General Assembly. \n Last week, America and the world marked the \nfifth anniversary of the attacks that filled another \nSeptember morning with death and suffering. On that \nterrible day, extremists killed nearly 3,000 innocent \npeople, including citizens of dozens of nations \nrepresented right here in this Hall. Since then, the \nenemies of humanity have continued their campaign of \nmurder. Al-Qaida and those inspired by its extremist \nideology have attacked more than two dozen nations. \nAnd recently, a different group of extremists \ndeliberately provoked a terrible conflict in Lebanon. At \nthe start of the twenty-first century, it is clear that the \nworld is engaged in a great ideological struggle \nbetween extremists who use terror as a weapon to \ncreate fear and moderate people who work for peace. \n Five years ago, I stood at this rostrum and called \non the community of nations to defend civilization and \nbuild a more hopeful future. This is still the great \nchallenge of our time. It is the calling of our \ngeneration. This morning, I want to speak about the \nmore hopeful world that is within our reach \u2014 a world \nbeyond terror, where ordinary men and women are free \nto determine their own destiny, where the voices of \nmoderation are empowered and where the extremists \nare marginalized by the peaceful majority. This world \ncan be ours if we seek it and if we work together. \n The principles of this world beyond terror can be \nfound in the very first sentence of the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights. This document declares \nthat the \u201cequal and inalienable rights of all members of \nthe human family [are] the foundation of freedom, \njustice and peace in the world\u201d. One of the authors of \nthis document was a Lebanese diplomat named Charles \nMalik, who would go on to become President of this \nAssembly. Mr. Malik insisted that these principles \napply equally to all people, of all religions, in all \nregions \u2014 including the men and women of the Arab \nworld that was his home. \n In the nearly six decades since that document was \napproved, we have seen the forces of freedom and \nmoderation transform entire continents. Sixty years \nafter a terrible war, Europe is now whole, free and at \npeace, and Asia has seen freedom progress and \nhundreds of millions of people lifted out of desperate \npoverty. The words of the Universal Declaration are as \ntrue today as they were when they were written. As \nliberty flourishes, nations grow in tolerance, and hope, \nand peace. And we are seeing the bright future begin to \ntake root in the broader Middle East. \n Some of the changes in the Middle East have \nbeen dramatic, and we see the results in this Hall. Five \nyears ago, Afghanistan was ruled by the brutal Taliban \nregime, and its seat in this body was contested. Now \nthis seat is held by the freely elected Government of \nAfghanistan, which is represented today by President \nKarzai. Five years ago, Iraq\u2019s seat in this body was \n \n \n9 06-52731 \n \nheld by a dictator who killed his citizens, invaded his \nneighbours and showed his contempt for the world by \ndefying more than a dozen Security Council \nresolutions. Now Iraq\u2019s seat is held by a democratic \nGovernment that embodies the aspirations of the Iraqi \npeople, represented today by President Talabani. With \nthese changes, more than 50 million people have been \ngiven a voice in this Hall for the first time in decades. \n Some of the changes in the Middle East are \nhappening gradually, but they are real. Algeria has held \nits first competitive presidential election, and the \nmilitary remained neutral. The United Arab Emirates \nrecently announced that half of its seats in the Federal \nNational Council will be chosen by elections. Kuwait \nheld elections in which women were allowed to vote \nand run for office for the first time. Citizens have voted \nin municipal elections in Saudi Arabia, in \nparliamentary elections in Jordan and Bahrain and in \nmultiparty presidential elections in Yemen and in \nEgypt. These are important steps, and the Governments \nshould continue to move forward with other reforms \nthat show that they trust their people. Every nation that \ntravels the road to freedom moves at a different pace, \nand the democracies they build will reflect their own \ncultures and traditions. But the destination is the same: \na free society where people live at peace with each \nother and at peace with the world. \n Some have argued that the democratic changes \nwe are seeing in the Middle East are destabilizing the \nregion. This argument rests on a false assumption: that \nthe Middle East was stable to begin with. The reality is \nthat the stability we thought we saw in the Middle East \nwas a mirage. For decades, millions of men and women \nin the region have been trapped in oppression and \nhopelessness. And these conditions left a generation \ndisillusioned and made this region a breeding ground \nfor extremism. \n Imagine what it is like to be a young person \nliving in a country that is not moving toward reform. \nYou are 21 years old, and while your peers in other \nparts of the world are casting their ballots for the first \ntime, you are powerless to change the course of your \nGovernment. While your peers in other parts of the \nworld have received educations that prepare them for \nthe opportunities of a global economy, you have been \nfed propaganda and conspiracy theories that blame \nothers for your country\u2019s shortcomings. And \neverywhere you turn, you hear extremists who tell you \nthat you can escape your misery and regain your \ndignity through violence and terror and martyrdom. For \nmany across the broader Middle East, this is the dismal \nchoice presented every day. \n Every civilized nation, including those in the \nMuslim world, must support those in the region who \nare offering a more hopeful alternative. We know that \nwhen people have a voice in their future they are less \nlikely to blow themselves up in suicide attacks. We \nknow that when leaders are accountable to their people, \nthey are more likely to seek national greatness in the \nachievements of their citizens, rather than in terror and \nconquest. So we must stand with democratic leaders \nand moderate reformers across the broader Middle \nEast. We must give voice to the hopes of decent men \nand women who want for their children the same things \nwe want for ours. We must seek stability through a free \nand just Middle East where the extremists are \nmarginalized by millions of citizens in control of their \nown destinies. \n Today, I would like to speak directly to the \npeople across the broader Middle East. My country \ndesires peace. Extremists in your midst spread \npropaganda claiming that the West is engaged in a war \nagainst Islam. This propaganda is false, and its purpose \nis to confuse you and justify acts of terror. We respect \nIslam, but we will protect our people from those who \npervert Islam to sow death and destruction. Our goal is \nto help you build a more tolerant and hopeful society \nthat honours people of all faiths and promotes peace. \n To the people of Iraq: nearly 12 million of you \nbraved the car bombers and assassins last December to \nvote in free elections. The world saw you hold up \npurple ink-stained fingers, and your courage filled us \nwith admiration. You have stood firm in the face of \nhorrendous acts of terror and sectarian violence, and \nwe will not abandon you in your struggle to build a \nfree nation. America and our coalition partners will \ncontinue to stand with the democratic Government you \nelected. We will continue to help you secure the \ninternational assistance and investment you need to \ncreate jobs and opportunity, working with the United \nNations and through the International Compact with \nIraq endorsed here in New York yesterday. We will \ncontinue to train those of you who stepped forward to \nfight the enemies of freedom. We will not yield the \nfuture of your country to terrorists and extremists. In \nreturn, your leaders must rise to the challenges your \ncountry is facing and make difficult choices to bring \nsecurity and prosperity. Working together, we will help \n  \n \n06-52731 10 \n \nyour democracy succeed, so that it can become a \nbeacon of hope for millions in the Muslim world. \n To the people of Afghanistan: together, we \noverthrew the Taliban regime that brought misery into \nyour lives and harboured terrorists who brought death \nto the citizens of many nations. Since then, we have \nwatched you choose your leaders in free elections and \nbuild a democratic Government. You can be proud of \nthese achievements. We respect your courage and your \ndetermination to live in peace and freedom. We will \ncontinue to stand with you to defend your democratic \ngains. \n Today, forces from more than 40 countries, \nincluding members of the NATO alliance, are bravely \nserving side by side with you against the extremists \nwho want to bring down the free Government you have \nestablished. We will help you defeat these enemies and \nbuild a free Afghanistan that will never again oppress \nyou or be a safe haven for terrorists. \n To the people of Lebanon: last year, you inspired \nthe world when you came out into the streets to \ndemand your independence from Syrian dominance. \nYou drove Syrian forces from your country and you \nre-established democracy. Since then, you have been \ntested by the fighting that began with Hizbollah\u2019s \nunprovoked attacks on Israel. Many of you have seen \nyour homes and your communities caught in crossfire. \nWe see your suffering, and the world is helping you to \nrebuild your country and helping you deal with the \narmed extremists who are undermining your \ndemocracy by acting as a State within a State. \n The United Nations has passed a good resolution \nthat has authorized an international force, led by \nFrance and Italy, to help you restore Lebanese \nsovereignty over Lebanese soil. For many years, \nLebanon was a model of democracy and pluralism and \nopenness in the region \u2014 and it will be again. \n To the people of Iran: the United States respects \nyou. We respect your country. We admire your rich \nhistory, your vibrant culture and your many \ncontributions to civilization. You deserve an \nopportunity to determine your own future, an economy \nthat rewards your intelligence and your talents and a \nsociety that allows you to fulfil your tremendous \npotential. The greatest obstacle to this future is that \nyour rulers have chosen to deny you liberty and to use \nyour nation\u2019s resources to fund terrorism, and fuel \nextremism, and pursue nuclear weapons. \n The United Nations has passed a clear resolution \nrequiring that the regime in Tehran meet its \ninternational obligations. Iran must abandon its nuclear \nweapons ambitions. Despite what the regime tells you, \nwe have no objection to Iran\u2019s pursuit of a truly \npeaceful nuclear power programme. We are working \ntoward a diplomatic solution to this crisis, and as we \ndo, we look to the day when you can live in freedom \nand America and Iran can be good friends and close \npartners in the cause of peace. \n To the people of Syria: your land is home to a \ngreat people with a proud tradition of learning and \ncommerce. Today your rulers have allowed your \ncountry to become a crossroad for terrorism. In your \nmidst, Hamas and Hizbollah are working to destabilize \nthe region, and your Government is turning your \ncountry into a tool of Iran. This is increasing your \ncountry\u2019s isolation from the world. Your Government \nmust choose a better way forward by ending its support \nfor terror, and living in peace with your neighbours, \nand opening the way to a better life for you and your \nfamilies. \n To the people of Darfur: you have suffered \nunspeakable violence, and my nation has called these \natrocities what they are: genocide. For the last two \nyears, America joined with the international \ncommunity to provide emergency food aid and support \nfor an African Union peacekeeping force. Yet your \nsuffering continues. The world must step forward to \nprovide additional humanitarian aid, and we must \nstrengthen the African Union force that has done good \nwork but is not strong enough to protect you. The \nSecurity Council has approved a resolution that would \ntransform the African Union force into a blue-helmeted \nforce that is larger and more robust. To increase its \nstrength and effectiveness, NATO nations should \nprovide logistics and other support. The regime in \nKhartoum is stopping the deployment of this force. If \nthe Sudanese Government does not approve this \npeacekeeping force quickly, the United Nations must \nact. Your lives and the credibility of the United Nations \nare at stake. So today I am announcing that I am \nnaming a presidential Special Envoy \u2014 former \nAdministrator of the United States Agency for \nInternational Development, Andrew Natsios \u2014 to lead \nAmerica\u2019s efforts to resolve the outstanding disputes \nand help bring peace to your land. \n The world must also stand up for peace in the \nHoly Land. I am committed to two democratic States, \n \n \n11 06-52731 \n \nIsrael and Palestine, living side by side in peace and \nsecurity. I am committed to a Palestinian State that has \nterritorial integrity and will live peacefully with the \nJewish State of Israel. This is the vision set forth in the \nroad map, and helping the parties to reach this goal is \none of the great objectives of my presidency. The \nPalestinian people have suffered from decades of \ncorruption and violence and the daily humiliation of \noccupation. Israeli citizens have endured brutal acts of \nterrorism and constant fear of attack since the birth of \ntheir nation. Many brave men and women have made \nthe commitment to peace. Yet extremists in the region \nare stirring up hatred and trying to prevent these \nmoderate voices from prevailing. \n This struggle is unfolding in the Palestinian \nterritories. Earlier this year, the Palestinian people \nvoted in a free election. The leaders of Hamas \ncampaigned on a platform of ending corruption and \nimproving the lives of the Palestinian people, and they \nprevailed. The world is waiting to see whether the \nHamas Government will follow through on its \npromises or pursue an extremist agenda. The world has \nsent a clear message to the leaders of Hamas: serve the \ninterests of the Palestinian people, abandon terror, \nrecognize Israel\u2019s right to exist, honour agreements and \nwork for peace. \n President Abbas is committed to peace and to his \npeople\u2019s aspirations for a State of their own. Prime \nMinister Olmert is committed to peace, and has said he \nintends to meet with President Abbas to make real \nprogress on the outstanding issues between them. I \nbelieve that peace can be achieved and that a \ndemocratic Palestinian State is possible. I hear from \nleaders in the region who want to help. I have directed \nSecretary of State Rice to lead a diplomatic effort to \nengage moderate leaders across the region to help the \nPalestinians reform their security services and support \nIsraeli and Palestinian leaders in their efforts to come \ntogether to resolve their differences. \n Prime Minister Blair has indicated that his \ncountry will work with partners in Europe to help \nstrengthen the governing institutions of the Palestinian \nadministration. We welcome his initiative. Countries \nlike Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt have made clear \nthat they are willing to contribute the diplomatic and \nfinancial assistance necessary to help these efforts \nsucceed. I am optimistic that, by supporting the forces \nof democracy and moderation, we can help Israelis and \nPalestinians build a more hopeful future and achieve \nthe peace in the Holy Land that we all want. \n Freedom, by its nature, cannot be imposed; it \nmust be chosen. From Beirut to Baghdad, people are \nmaking the choice for freedom. And the nations \ngathered in this Hall must make a choice as well. Will \nwe support the moderates and reformers who are \nworking for change across the Middle East, or will we \nyield the future to the terrorists and extremists? \nAmerica has made its choice: we will stand with the \nmoderates and reformers. \n Recently, a courageous group of Arab and \nMuslim intellectuals wrote me a letter. In it, they said \nthis: \u201cThe shore of reform is the only one on which any \nlights appear, even though the journey demands \ncourage, patience and perseverance\u201d. The United \nNations was created to make that journey possible. \nTogether we must support the dreams of good and \ndecent people who are working to transform a troubled \nregion. And by doing so, we will advance the high \nideals on which this institution was founded. "

        "file_text": "Once again, we have convened \nat this seat of the Organization of the peoples of the \nworld, representing the whole of humanity and coming \nfrom all corners of the world. Our pilgrimage this year \nis tinged with sadness, because we are also paying \n  \n \n06-52731 12 \n \nhomage to one of the most outstanding servants of the \nUnited Nations, a native son of Africa, Kofi Annan, \nwhose term of office will soon come to an end. \n The Group of 77 and China, as well as my own \ncountry, South Africa, sincerely thanks the Secretary-\nGeneral for the selfless and dedicated work he carried \nout during one of the most challenging periods in the \nhistory of this Organization. In the midst of increasing \npoverty and underdevelopment during an era of \nunprecedented wealth accumulation and technological \nadvances, and as the river that divides the rich and the \npoor zones of the metaphorical global village ever \nwidened, the Secretary-General never lost focus on the \nimperatives of our time. \n We thank him for never losing sight of the fact \nthat poverty and underdevelopment remain the biggest \nthreats to the progress that has been achieved, and that \nequality among nations big and small is central to the \nsurvival, relevance and credibility of this global \nOrganization. \n We are only six years into the twenty-first \ncentury. Those who populate the poorest of the regions \nof the world \u2014 that is, Africa \u2014 have boldly declared \nthat it will be an African century. It is a century that \nbillions of citizens of the developing world and other \npoor and marginalized people want to transform into a \ncentury for all humanity. \n If the wishes of the majority of the world could \nturn into reality, this would be a century free of wars, \nfree of internecine conflicts, free of hunger, free of \npreventable disease, free of want, free of \nenvironmental degradation and free of greed and \ncorruption. Indeed, we began the century with great \nhopes for a better, peaceful and more humane world. \n Together, we crafted comprehensive plans and \nbold declarations to defeat the scourge of poverty and \nunderdevelopment. Together, we committed ourselves, \nwith what seemed like renewed vigour, to transform \nthe United Nations to reflect the modern reality that is \ndefined by free, sovereign and equal nations. \n However, six years into the twenty-first century, \ndispassionate observers might well challenge us to \nachieve our noble and lofty objectives, pointing to the \nterrorists\u2019 acts that welcomed us into the new century. \nThey might emphasize the unilateralism that threatens \nto negate the democratic advances of the last decades \nof the twentieth century and draw attention to renewed \nconflicts and wars that seem to compete with the \ndestructive fury of the conflicts of the last century. \n They would remind us that for a decade and \nmore, some of the developed nations have consistently \nrefused to implement the outcomes and agreements of \nthis world body that would help to alleviate the \nwretchedness of the poor. Thus, Madam President, \nwhen you correctly urge us to implement a global \npartnership for development, we, the members of the \nGroup of 77 and China, who represent the poor people \nof the world, understand you to be communicating a \nmessage that we should give substance to the common \ncommitments we solemnly made at this supreme \nOrganization of the nations of the world. \n Yet, this common commitment for a global \npartnership for development cannot be transformed \ninto reality when the rich and powerful insist on an \nunequal relationship with the poor. A global \npartnership for development is impossible in the \nabsence of a pact of mutual responsibility between the \ngiver and the recipient. It is impossible when the rich \nunilaterally demand the right to set the agenda and \nconditions for the implementation of commonly agreed \nprogrammes. \n We who represent the poor know as a matter of \nfact that these billions of poor people are increasingly \nbecoming impatient, because every year they hear us \nadopt declaration after declaration and yet nothing \npractical is done to assuage the hunger pains that keep \nthem awake at night. Only few and selected agreements \nare implemented, with outcomes that are clearly \ninsufficient to alleviate the excruciating pain of their \nchildren who cannot cry anymore because to do so is to \ninvite more pain. \n Those of us who were at the 14th Summit of the \nNon-Aligned Movement in Havana heard this message \nvery clearly emanating from all the countries and \norganizations that spoke. Those who are capable of \nlistening should take note of what that great son of \nIndia and South Africa, Mahatma Gandhi, said on this \nmatter: \n \u201cThe test of friendship is assistance in adversity, \nand that too, unconditional assistance. \nCooperation which needs consideration is a \ncommercial contract and not friendship. \nConditional cooperation is like adulterated cement \nwhich does not bind.\u201d \n \n \n13 06-52731 \n \n Precisely because of the absence of a global \npartnership for development, the Doha Development \nRound has almost collapsed. Indeed, because the rich \nimplicitly invoked the slogan of an over-confident \nEuropean political party of the 1960s, and directed this \nuncaring declaration to the poor of today \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m \nalright, Jack!\u201d \u2014 we have not implemented the \nMonterrey Consensus on Financing for Development, \nthus making it difficult for the majority of the \ndeveloping countries, especially those in Africa, to \nachieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), \nand we have reduced the Johannesburg Plan of \nImplementation to an insignificant, and perhaps \nforgotten, piece of paper. \n Part of the problem with this unequal relationship \nis the imposition of conditions on developing countries \nand the constant shifting of the goalposts, whenever the \npoor adhere to each and every one of those conditions. \n Among other things, we have recently seen an \noutbreak of great social instability across Europe and \nother reactions of the poor to their miserable conditions \nin different parts of the world, which calls into \nquestion the image of a seemingly harmonious well-\nwoven tapestry of diverse groups, because we continue \nto fail to implement our own decisions as taken at the \nUnited Nations World Conference against Racism, \nRacial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related \nIntolerance. Those who coined the slogan: \u201cI\u2019m alright, \nJack!\u201d were communicating, whether consciously or \nnot, a message and an attitude that said \u201cI don\u2019t care \nabout my neighbour as long as my family and I eat \nwell and sleep peacefully\u201d and that \u201cIt is not my \nresponsibility to ensure that my poor neighbour also \neats well and sleeps peacefully.\u201d \n Today, the attitude among some of the rich also \ncommunicates the same message to the rest of the \nworld, namely, \u201cI\u2019m alright, Jack!\u201d, even when they are \nacutely aware that many in their neighbourhood are \ndying from hunger, preventable diseases and abject \npoverty. \n This happens also in the cruelly ironic situation \nwhere resources flow from those who have little to \nthose who have plenty. Although the rich and powerful \nknow the miserable life circumstances of the poor and \nhave solemnly committed themselves to the collective \neffort to reverse those conditions, their attitude and \nresponse resembles that of the Biblical Cain, who, after \nhe killed his brother, Abel, and the Lord asked him \n\u201cWhere is Abel, your brother?\u201d, replied: \u201cI do not \nknow. Am I my brother\u2019s keeper?\u201d \n Perhaps, all of us, especially the rich, should heed \nthe words of one of the great sons of the United States \nof America, who perished because of his belief in \nequality and justice for all human beings and whose \ncivil rights movement is currently marking its golden \njubilee. Martin Luther King Jr. warned that \n \u201cAs long as there is poverty in the world I can \nnever be rich, even if I have a billion dollars. As \nlong as diseases are rampant and millions of \npeople in this world cannot expect to live more \nthan 28 or 30 years, I can never be totally healthy \neven if I just got a good check-up at the Mayo \nClinic. I can never be what I ought to be until you \nare what you ought to be. This is the way our \nworld is made. No individual or nation can stand \nout boasting of being independent. We are \ninterdependent.\u201d \n The majority of the human race is entitled to ask \nthe question whether the rich respond the way they do \nbecause further impoverishment of the poor is to the \nadvantage of the rich, giving meaning to the old \nobservation that the rich get richer as the poor get \npoorer. As the divide between the rich and the poor \nwidens and becomes a serious global crisis, we see an \nincrease in the concentration of economic, military, \ntechnological, media and other power. \n Something is seriously wrong when people risk \nlife and limb travelling in suffocating containers to \nWestern Europe in search of a better life. Something is \nwrong when many Africans traverse, on foot, the harsh, \nhot and hostile Sahara Desert to reach European \nshores. Something is wrong when walls are built to \nprevent poor neighbours from entering those countries \nwhere they seek better opportunities. Something is \nindeed wrong when all these people, whose fault is \nmerely the fact that their lives are defined by poverty, \ntry desperately to reach countries where they believe \nthe conditions of their existence could improve, only to \nmeet hostile, and at times, barbaric and inhuman \nreceptions. \n In part, the United Nations is unable to fulfil \nsome of the objectives set by the founders in San \nFrancisco because, in truth, it does not reflect the \nexpansion of the global family of free nations. Because \nthis Organization of the peoples of the world has \ngrown to encompass the entire world, many had \n  \n \n06-52731 14 \n \nthought that it would be logical that this custodian of \nglobal democracy would itself serve as a beacon in our \ncontinuing quest for democracy in all our countries. \n Clearly, for the United Nations to continue \noccupying its moral high ground, it has to reform itself \nurgently and lead by practical example, showing what \nit means to be democratic. Even as we face the cold \nreality of the indifference of many among the rich and \npowerful, this Organization of the peoples of the world \nhas continued to offer hope and the possibility of the \nfulfilment of the aspirations of the majority of the \npeoples of the world. \n All of us, including those who hesitate to \nimplement the commonly agreed positions, agree that \nthis Organization has entrenched the correct \nunderstanding that development is a right and is central \nto the advancement of humanity. All of us, individually \nand collectively and as Members of the United \nNations, must do whatever is necessary to develop and \nimplement policies and strategies aimed at the \nachievement of sustainable development. It is \nimportant that international organizations such as the \nBretton Woods institutions, the World Trade \nOrganization (WTO) and others should, without any \nequivocation, seriously embark on the implementation \nof all the commitments that we have made as the \ninternational community. \n This Organization of the peoples of the world \ncannot merely note the unacceptable situation that \nAfrica will not achieve the Millennium Development \nGoals by 2015. We need further programmes, focused \nand concrete, to accelerate development in Africa and \navoid the possibility of that continent sinking further \ninto the morass of poverty and underdevelopment. \n Because we are our brothers\u2019 and sisters\u2019 keepers, \nwe have the responsibility to end the rhetoric and \nimplement programmes that ensure that all human \nbeings live decent, humane and prosperous lives. \n On behalf of the Group of 77 and China, as well \nas my own country, South Africa, I take this \nopportunity to thank His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson, \nfor the great work he did in steering this Organization \nduring this past year as President of the General \nAssembly. \n We are honoured to welcome Her Excellency \nSheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa as President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-first session, and we \nwish her well in her important work. Madam President, \nwe pledge to do whatever is necessary to make your \nwork easier, so that through your efforts, the poor can \nregain full confidence in the ability of the United \nNations to improve their conditions of life. \n Every day the masses cry out in pain, frustration \nand anger. Every day they ask whether there is \nanybody who stops to hear their voices, anybody who \nlistens and who is ready to respond to their heartfelt \nplea for the restoration of their dignity. "

        "file_text": "It is indeed an \nhonour for me to express to you, Madam, sincere \ncongratulations on behalf of the Government and the \npeople of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago on your \nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-first session. Your appointment as the third \nwoman ever to hold that esteemed position is of special \nsignificance and must be duly recognized. Trinidad and \nTobago is convinced that your extensive experience in \nmultilateral diplomacy and your international legal \nexpertise adequately equip you to guide the work of the \nAssembly to a successful conclusion. \n We also take this opportunity to welcome most \nwarmly the Republic of Montenegro as the 192nd \nMember of the United Nations and to wish its people \nand its Government continued peace, stability and \nprosperity. \n We would also like to recognize the astute and \nefficient leadership of the President of the General \nAssembly at its sixtieth session, Mr. Jan Eliasson of \nSweden, who efficiently, dispassionately and with \nsubtle dexterity discharged the mandate of follow-up \nentrusted to the sixtieth session by our leaders at the \n2005 World Summit, getting us past hurdles that \nchallenged to the core the working methods of the \nAssembly. His efforts also enabled the international \ncommunity to create two crucial new international \ninstitutions \u2014 the Human Rights Council and the \nPeacebuilding Commission \u2014 as part of the ongoing \nreform of the United Nations. \n Trinidad and Tobago is hopeful that the Human \nRights Council will be an effective instrument for the \ndefence and promotion of human rights worldwide, \ndenouncing without fear or favour gross violations of \nhuman rights and seeking, through dialogue and \ncooperation, to bring about full compliance with \ninternationally accepted norms related to universal \nfundamental human rights and freedoms. \n Institutional support for countries in transition \nfrom the post-conflict phase to that of sustainable \ndevelopment is a sine qua non for the success of efforts \nto restore peace and normalcy. It is in that context that \nTrinidad and Tobago views the indispensable role to be \nplayed by the Peacebuilding Commission in those \ncountries that have been traumatized by years of \ninternal strife. \n His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan is a very special \nfriend of Trinidad and Tobago \u2014 and, might I confide, \nespecially of Tobago. It is thus with mixed emotions \nthat we bid him farewell at this session. Over the \ncourse of his tenure, our seemingly unassuming \nSecretary-General has steered the vessel that is the \nOrganization with an abundance of skill and with \nclarity of vision, keeping it on an even keel as it has \ntraversed one of the most turbulent periods in its \n  \n \n06-53952 28 \n \nhistory. He has been a champion of principle, a \nspokesman for international justice and the staunchest \ndefender of all that the Organization stands for and to \nwhich all of our countries subscribe. There is so much \nthat the Secretary-General has done that history will \nrecord. For us, it suffices that he has been the beacon \nthat has kept the United Nations ideal alive during \nthese difficult times. \n The role of the Secretary-General in the twenty-\nfirst century is no longer that of a mere chief \nadministrative officer \u2014 burdensome as that role may \nbe \u2014 but one that requires profound knowledge of the \ndynamics of current inter-State relations. Trinidad and \nTobago is hopeful, therefore, that as we elect a \nsuccessor to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the \nSecurity Council will recommend to the General \nAssembly a person whose diplomatic skills are highly \nregarded, whose leadership abilities are well \nrecognized and who will be able to maintain an \nexcellent working relationship with all Member States \nand enjoy the confidence of the five permanent \nmembers of the Security Council, thereby facilitating \ndecisive and timely actions by the Organization when \nthey are most urgently needed. \n However, the functions of the Secretary-General \ncan be carried out effectively only with the firm \nsupport of the entire international community. It is \ntherefore vital that the process through which the \nchosen candidate will emerge be as inclusive and \ntransparent as possible and that it remain faithful to the \nprinciples and procedures enshrined in the Charter as \nthey relate to his or her appointment. \n The international community continues to grapple \nwith the absence of realistic and pragmatic solutions to \nmany longstanding global problems. A just and lasting \npeace in the Middle East continues to elude us, and the \nhumanitarian situation of the Palestinian people \ncontinues to worsen daily in view of the economic and \nfinancial stranglehold placed on their economy \nfollowing the assumption of power by democratic \nmeans of the political grouping of their choice. We \nurge the major political parties in the Palestinian \nterritories to find common ground that would satisfy \nthe aspirations of the Palestinian people, who for \ngenerations have longed to exercise their inalienable \nright to self-determination and independence. \n Peace and security in the Middle East also remain \nthreatened by conflicts of a more recent vintage. The \nuse of force disproportionate to the threat at hand, as in \nthe recent cases of Gaza and Lebanon, has also had the \neffect of increasing the suffering of the civilian \npopulations concerned and of destroying vital national \ninfrastructure, and has served only to increase \nbitterness and hatred among those populations and to \ninspire resort to extremism. \n Trinidad and Tobago also views with growing \nalarm the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the \nDarfur region of the Sudan and calls upon the \ninternational community to exercise its responsibility \nto protect the people of Darfur. The international \ncommunity has a fundamental legal and moral \nobligation to act in cases of egregious violations of \nhuman rights such as this. It is incumbent on us to \ninstitute immediate measures to provide security and \nalleviate the suffering. We must also bring to justice at \nthe International Criminal Court (ICC) those \nresponsible for the crimes against humanity committed \nin Darfur. \n Trinidad and Tobago exhorts the Government in \nKhartoum to accept the presence of a United Nations-\nmandated peacekeeping force that would enhance the \ncapacity to monitor the Darfur Peace Agreement. Such \na force could also provide the necessary security for \nthe hundreds of thousands of internally displaced \npersons living in makeshift camps and for the return of \nrefugees from neighbouring Chad, and would facilitate \nthe provision of humanitarian assistance. \n On another front, Trinidad and Tobago applauds \nthe efforts of the International Criminal Court and \nwelcomes with satisfaction the progress made to bring \nto justice the perpetrators of the heinous crimes \ncommitted against the peoples of Uganda and the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. Trinidad and \nTobago views universal adherence to the ICC as \nintegral to entrenching the rule of law in the conduct of \ninternational relations, and as yet another pillar of the \npromotion of international peace and security. We \nagain urge States Members of this Organization that \nare not yet party to the Rome Statute of the \nInternational Criminal Court to consider acceding to \nthat instrument as soon as possible. \n The well-being of peoples the world over is \nthreatened not only by violations of international \nhumanitarian and human rights law, but also by \nindividual and collective acts of terrorism which the \nGovernment of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago \n \n \n29 06-53952 \n \nresolutely condemns. We are, indeed, hopeful that the \nrecent adoption by the Assembly of the Global \nCounter-Terrorism Strategy will lead to a holistic and \nintegral approach to a phenomenon that threatens the \ninternal peace and security of States in virtually all \nregions of the globe. It is also our sincere hope that this \nbody will, in the near future, conclude its deliberations \non a comprehensive international convention against \nterrorism that would provide a legal framework for \ncombating that scourge \u2014 a framework acceptable to \nall nations. \n It has become something of a clich\u00e9 to say that \nthere will be no peace and security in the world \nwithout development and, conversely, no development \nwithout security. It was therefore with a degree of \nconcern that we witnessed the near-total relegation to \nsecondary status of the development dimension of the \ninternational agenda at the 2005 millennium review \nSummit. Some degree of relief was provided \nsubsequently when, after long and arduous \nnegotiations, we were able to agree on a development \nresolution that sought \u2014 on the basis of a global \npartnership, among other things \u2014 to operationalize \nand implement the development commitments made at \nthe major summits in the economic, social and related \nfields. \n That resolution also provided for monitoring \nmechanisms to follow up on the commitments of the \nBretton Woods institutions and the World Trade \nOrganization. Trinidad and Tobago is hopeful that the \ncommitments to the achievement of those international \ndevelopment objectives, as set out in that resolution, \nwill be honoured and will not be the subject of \nrenegotiation at the next review. \n Global peace and security are also threatened by \nthe failure of the international community to bring \nabout the necessary structural changes in the fields of \ninternational trade and in economic and financial \nrelations. Like most developing countries, Trinidad and \nTobago is painfully aware of the significant imbalances \nthat have been having an adverse impact on developing \neconomies. The current suspension of the Doha trade \nnegotiations, and the delay in the resumption of those \ntalks, are consequently of particular concern to us, \ngiven the outward-looking orientation of our economy \nand the fact that the most basic tenet of our trade \npolicy relates to increased market access for the export \nof our goods and services. \n Trinidad and Tobago therefore joins with other \nsmall vulnerable economies in calling for a process \nthat would accelerate the recommencement of \nnegotiations, while ensuring that adequate treatment is \nafforded to the development dimension. It is crucial \nthat global trade rules be enhanced in recognition of \nthe need for treatment to be accorded to small, \nvulnerable economies that takes their special \ncircumstances into consideration and allows them to \nparticipate in world trade in a manner commensurate \nwith their national capacity to do so. \n Even as our economies grapple with the systemic \nimbalances in the international trading system at home, \nTrinidad and Tobago, like many other Caribbean \ncountries, faces social challenges that have global \nimplications. One such challenge manifests itself in the \nincreasing resort to gun violence by our young people \nand by others engaged in the nefarious drug trade. The \ncountries of the Caribbean region are not producers of \nsmall arms and light weapons, yet small arms are \nincreasingly visible in our societies and raise the \nfatality levels resulting from the commission of many \nserious crimes. \n Much of the illicit trade in firearms and related \nactivity in our Caribbean region is linked to the illicit \ntraffic in drugs. Yet international cooperation \u2014 \nessential to help us stem the flow of illicit drugs \nthrough our countries, which are already recognized as \nkey transit States \u2014 is not forthcoming from our \ndevelopment partners. Trinidad and Tobago \naccordingly urges the international community to \nprovide the necessary resources to bolster Caribbean \nregional efforts aimed at interdicting drug shipments \nand putting an end to the flow of illicit firearms, which \nnegatively and profoundly affect the security and \ndevelopment of the region.  \n It is well known that the living standards \nsuggested by positive economic indicators are of little \nconsequence if the basic security and sense of well-\nbeing of the individual is under threat. Similarly, the \nfailure by the international community earlier this year \nat the Review Conference to reach broad agreement on \nadditional measures to further implement the 2001 \nUnited Nations Programme of Action on Small Arms \nhas been a source of disappointment to Trinidad and \nTobago. We are heartened, however, that within the \ninternational community a broad understanding appears \nto be emerging regarding the utility of an international \n  \n \n06-53952 30 \n \nlegally binding instrument to govern the international \narms trade. \n Trinidad and Tobago therefore strongly endorses \nthe call by some States for the conclusion of such an \ninstrument. We are also of the view that until such a \ntreaty becomes a reality, it is imperative that the major \nproducers and exporters of small arms and light \nweapons establish comprehensive export controls in \norder to ensure that such weapons are not diverted into \nthe illicit trade. \n Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s approach to development \nplaces primary focus on enhancing the living standards \nand sense of well-being of the individual. Thus, even \nas we address major problems of a global nature, we \nshould not forget those among us who face greater \nchallenges in realizing their full potential. The \ninternational community has recently become \nincreasingly sensitized to the difficulties faced in \nalmost all spheres of activity by persons with \ndisabilities, and during the sixtieth session of the \nGeneral Assembly, we successfully negotiated a draft \nconvention on the promotion and protection of the \nrights of persons with disabilities. Trinidad and Tobago \njoined in the adoption by consensus of the final \nnegotiated text, and looks forward to its formal \nadoption by the Assembly and its subsequent opening \nfor signature. We have in the interim developed, and \nare in the process of implementing, a national policy \non persons with disabilities. \n Another area that cries out for timely and \ndecisive action by the international community is that \nof the environment. Our planet today continues to be \nravaged by patterns of production and consumption \nthat gravely threaten its sustainability and give rise to \nphenomena whose management consumes the already \nstretched energies and resources of small island \ndeveloping States in particular. The challenges to those \ncountries posed by such phenomena as climate change \nand sea-level rise, as well as the effort and resources \nnecessary to recover from adverse seasonal weather \npatterns, add another dimension to the challenges that \nthey already face in the area of economic and social \ndevelopment.  \n Trinidad and Tobago invokes that same spirit of \npartnership of the international community to work \ntowards the full implementation of the Mauritius \nStrategy, that being the framework for the collective \ndevelopment of this vulnerable grouping. \n In the midst of such daunting challenges, the \nlittoral States of the Caribbean are faced with the \nconstant threat of a maritime casualty resulting from \nthe shipment of radioactive or other hazardous wastes \nthrough the Caribbean Sea. Such an occurrence could \ncreate the potential for an environmental disaster for \nall countries along the Caribbean coastline, but, in \nparticular, it would threaten the economic well-being \nand livelihood of the many small island developing \nStates of the Caribbean that depend on this fragile \necosystem. \n Trinidad and Tobago is of the view that the \nintegrated management approach of the recently \nconceived Caribbean Sea Initiative will be critical to \nadvancing the development goals of the member States \nof the Caribbean and uses this opportunity to seek the \nsupport of all United Nations Member States for the \nInitiative, which seeks to ensure that the Caribbean Sea \nis recognized by the United Nations as a special area in \nthe context of sustainable development. \n Trinidad and Tobago is committed to the \npartnership approach in all areas of international \ninteraction, be it for sustainable development, peace \nand security, human rights or humanitarian assistance. \nIt is a position that informs a fierce defence of \nmultilateralism in full recognition of the benefits of \ncollective action and of the responsibility of each \ncountry to assist when in a position to do so within the \nlimits of its resources. This thinking underlies the \nactions taken by Trinidad and Tobago in respect of the \nprovision of economic and humanitarian assistance, \nboth institutionally as well as directly, to countries in \nour region and to those further afield. \n It is in this context that Trinidad and Tobago \npledges its full support for the economic and social \ndevelopment of the Republic of Haiti in its return to \nconstitutional governance, which has led to its \nreadmission into the Caribbean Community Council \nand calls for the release of all donor funds that have \nalready been pledged. The history of Haiti is of special \nsignificance in the struggle for independence in the \nCaribbean and is linked to other historical \ndevelopments more international in scope. One such \ndevelopment was the abolition of the Atlantic slave \ntrade, the 200th anniversary of which will be marked in \n2007. The slave trade has had long-term effects on the \nsocial and economic development of parts of Africa \nthat are still being felt today. \n \n \n31 06-53952 \n \n Nor were we in the Caribbean spared the effects \nof the slave trade, and we are of the view that any call \non the international community to mark this occasion \nshould go beyond the need merely to reflect on the \natrocities committed during this perverse period of our \nhistory. Trinidad and Tobago thus lends its support to \nthe call made by countries of the African diaspora in \nthe Caribbean and elsewhere for the commemoration \nby the United Nations in 2007 of the abolition of the \nAtlantic slave trade. \n The United Nations is central to any resolution of \nthe problems with which the international community \nis confronted in today\u2019s world. It is only by having a \nstrong United Nations, fully resourced by its Member \nGovernments and imbued with the necessary political \nwill, that we will be able to tackle these problems and \nprovide this generation and succeeding generations \nwith a life of dignity and free from daily degradation of \nthe human spirit. We seek a life in peace and security \nand  free from the ravages of war, lived in good \neconomic and social conditions, without poverty, \nilliteracy, hunger or disease. \n This historical moment requires bold initiatives \non the part of the General Assembly President, who, in \ntandem with the new Secretary-General, is called upon \nto provide the vision, courage and strength of \nconviction necessary to carry the United Nations \nforward along the path to confronting the myriad \nchallenges facing the Organization in today\u2019s world. \nWe are confident that they will both be up to the task."

        "file_text": "Let me begin by \ncongratulating you, Madam, on your election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \nsession. Your election is a demonstration of the trust \nand confidence placed in you and your country, the \nKingdom of Bahrain, by the international community. \n I would also seize this opportunity to pay tribute \nto your illustrious predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Jan \nEliasson of the Kingdom of Sweden, for his sound \nleadership and achievements during the sixtieth \nsession.  \n Additionally, let me commend the Secretary-\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, for his \ndecade of devoted and selfless service to humanity. \nThis great son of Africa, with his visionary leadership \nof the United Nations, has provided, and continues to \nprovide, the embodiment of our collective aspirations \nto achieve a more peaceful, just, equitable and \nprosperous world. He is indeed Africa\u2019s great gift to \nhumanity. \n Within the next five days, Botswana will mark 40 \nyears of its existence as a democratic, independent and \nsovereign nation. \n When the first President of Botswana, the late Sir \nSeretse Khama, addressed the Assembly on \n24 September 1969, he described Botswana, in part, as \na country faced with a problem of underdevelopment \nof classic proportions. \n Botswana had to contend with the harsh realities \nof its history and geographical position. We were \ncompletely surrounded by oppressive, aggressive and \nracist white minority regimes. As a small, weak and \npoor country, we had to begin the process of building \nnational institutions and laying the foundation for \nsocial and economic development in a very hostile \nenvironment. The United Nations and its Member \nStates served as a pillar of strength and gave us \npolitical and diplomatic support. \n Standing here today, we express our deep \ngratitude for the support and assistance extended to us \nover the years. It has been a 40-year journey of \ndetermined and sustained effort to achieve human-\ncentred development. \n It is a journey we have travelled with \ndevelopment partners from all continents. This has \nenabled us to achieve some measure of progress in \nimproving the human condition. At 40, we are an adult \nnation and have assumed full ownership of and \nresponsibility for our own development. We have \nadopted policies, legislation and practices aimed at \n  \n \n06-53341 2 \n \ncreating an environment conducive to economic growth \nand development. \n Many milestones have been achieved in our \nnational development effort. Today, Botswana is a \nmiddle-income developing country, but we still face \nenormous challenges for which we need assistance. In \nthis regard, the decision of the 2005 World Summit \nshould be implemented to ensure that small middle-\nincome developing countries such as Botswana do not \nfall back into the doldrums of poverty and \nunderdevelopment. \n Botswana has been blessed with one of Africa\u2019s \nmajor natural resources: diamonds. It must be stated \nthat 65 per cent of the world\u2019s diamonds, worth \n$8.3 billion per year, come from African countries. I \nam pleased to state that diamonds have done, and \ncontinue to do, good in Botswana. The diamond \nindustry in Botswana has been at the cutting edge of \nhuman development and is transforming lives for the \nbetter, in all fields of human endeavour. \n We continue to prudently manage the revenue \nfrom the sale of diamonds and to effectively use such \nrevenue to educate our people, provide potable water \nand health care and build an infrastructure network, \nincluding roads, telephones and rural electrification. \nThis is the good that diamonds have done and continue \nto do. \n As a participant in the Kimberley Process \nCertification Scheme, of which we currently hold the \nchairmanship, Botswana is strongly committed to \nworking alongside other participating countries to \nmaintain the credibility of the Scheme and the \nlegitimate diamond trade. The Kimberley Process \nCertification Scheme is one of the best examples of \nglobal cooperation. The Scheme is the embodiment of \nglobal consensus, unrelenting political will and the \ndetermination of members to do the right thing, \nunderpinned by strong support and the resolutions of \nthe Security Council. That is important, because about \n10 million people globally are either directly or \nindirectly supported by the diamond industry. In \nsouthern Africa, more than 28,000 people are employed \nby the industry. \n We are also here to reaffirm our commitment to \nthe Charter of the United Nations and our strong belief \nin the Organization as the only vehicle by means of \nwhich the enduring peace and prosperity of the human \nrace can be assured. We welcome the opportunity for \nthe nations of the world to meet here annually to \nexchange views on matters which are central to our \ncommon destiny. \n There are many challenges which we must \naddress. But chief among them is ending the evil of \nwar. It is deeply regrettable that, although the human \nspecies left the jungle many, many years ago, the \njungle remains in human beings. As a matter of fact, if \nthe beasts of the jungle acquired language, they could \nactually claim some superiority over the human race. \nWhile animals may fight and brutally kill each other, \nthey never spend time planning how to destroy one \nanother or thinking about how to produce weapons of \nmass destruction. \n Be that as it may, we still have hope and \nconfidence in the human spirit to do good. As human \nbeings, we have a shared destiny and we are therefore \nour own saviours. \n The responsibility to save the human species \nfrom the scourge of war cannot be passed to anyone \nelse. It is for that reason that we consider that this \nAssembly provides a rare opportunity for the \ninternational community to move beyond platitudes \nand to squarely address the critical challenges of our \ntime. \n An atmosphere of international peace and \nsecurity is essential for human development. \nExperience has repeatedly shown that we cannot \nrealistically hope to pursue a meaningful global \ndevelopment agenda under conditions of war, conflict \nand insecurity. \n Conflicts in our world today should therefore be a \nmatter of grave concern to all of us. In 2000, at the \ndawn of the new millennium, we gave an undertaking \nthat, above all else, the twenty-first century should be \nan epoch of peace and prosperity. We consciously made \na commitment to reduce by half by 2015 the number of \nthe world\u2019s poor. If we are to achieve that objective, \nwar should certainly be the first casualty. \n Botswana is particularly concerned about \nconflicts in Africa. Regrettably, Africa is the only \ncontinent that is facing the bleak prospect of failing to \nachieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \nCan we really afford the resources for war in the midst \nof poverty, disease, deprivation and \nunderdevelopment? The answer must obviously be a \nresounding \u201cNo\u201d. \n \n \n3 06-53341 \n \n Today, Africa is host to the largest number of \nrefugees, displaced persons, global poor and people \ninfected with and affected by HIV/AIDS. Yet, sadly, \nwe have the lion\u2019s share of the world\u2019s conflicts. \nEnding conflicts is therefore as much a calling as it is a \nmoral and political imperative. \n We should all be concerned about the atrocities in \nthe Darfur region of the Sudan. The perpetuation of \nthat conflict, in defiance of the collective will of the \ninternational community and the Charter of the United \nNations, is totally unacceptable. Worse still, the \ncarnage of daily killings is an affront to the sanctity of \nhuman life. This undermines our humanity. \n We call on all parties to the conflict to comply \nwith and respect the Darfur Peace Agreement. Those \nwho have not signed the Agreement must do so as a \nmatter of urgency. It is only through dialogue and \nmutual accommodation that durable peace can be \nattained. War can beget only misery and anarchy. \n The United Nations has expressed its desire to \nhelp, through the deployment of a multinational \npeacekeeping force. In principle, the African Union \nPeace and Security Council has welcomed the decision \nof the Security Council. \n Every year we come to this rostrum to call for \nprogress in the Middle East peace process. For \ngenerations that region has known no peace. If there is \nany lesson to be learned, it is that the only avenue to a \nlasting political settlement is through dialogue, \naccommodation and compromise. It is only in an \natmosphere of negotiation that reason and common \nsense can prevail over extremism and war-mongering. \n Israel and Palestine must coexist as sovereign \nStates that share, not only a border, but a desire for \npeace, security and prosperity. We urge the people of \nthe Middle East to summon up the courage to \nrecognize the folly of war and accept the virtue of \ndialogue. They should start building a common future \nfor generations that will know no violence and conflict, \nbut only cooperation and concord. \n My delegation shares the concern about the threat \nof terrorism. Terrorism pervades every crevice of our \nworld, much to the detriment of humanity. In this \nrespect, we welcome the recent adoption of the United \nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution \n60/288) by the General Assembly. \n When the Doha Ministerial Declaration was \nadopted in 2001, we had hoped for and envisaged \nnegotiations lasting three years. We knew then, as we \nknow today, that that was an ambitious and onerous \nundertaking. We have already missed several important \ndeadlines. That should be a source of concern for all of \nus. For many of our people, a fair and equitable \ninternational trading system is not only a noble \nobjective, but also a development imperative. It holds \nhope and promise of prosperity and the alleviation of \npoverty, which is all the more reason why we must not \nallow the Doha round of trade negotiations to fail. \n The indefinite suspension of the Doha round of \ntrade negotiations on 24 July 2006 has raised questions \nabout our collective commitment to development. In \nthis respect, the major question before us today is how \nwe can revive the Doha round of trade negotiations. It \ntook eight years to complete the Uruguay round. That \ngoes to show that at times it is not how fast the \nnegotiations are concluded but the substance and \ncontent of such negotiations. It is clear that we are \ngoing to miss the December 2006 deadline which we \nset for ourselves in 2005. \n It is therefore our collective responsibility as the \nUnited Nations to give the necessary political direction \nto the World Trade Organization, not only to revive the \nnegotiations, but also to ensure the necessary impetus \nfor their timely and successful conclusion. A successful \nconclusion should address the ever-growing special \ndevelopment challenges of developing countries by \nupholding the development dimension of the Doha \nround. \n During the sixtieth session of the General \nAssembly, a number of key decisions were made and \nwere outlined in the 2005 World Summit Outcome \n(resolution 60/1). Heads of State or Government called \nfor the establishment of institutions with a view to \nmaking the United Nations more effective in carrying \nout its mandate under the Charter and in serving \nMember States better. \n This session should be an implementation \nsession; we must commit ourselves to collective \nimplementation. It is important that we demonstrate in \ndeeds that, here at the United Nations, we make \nstatements to communicate thoughts, ideas and action \nplans. Such ideas are not to remain on paper; they must \nbe translated into programmes and projects for the \ncommon good. \n  \n \n06-53341 4 \n \n Botswana strongly supports comprehensive, wide \nand deep reform of the United Nations. Regarding the \nongoing management reform, we welcome the \ndecision, in resolution 60/283, to allow the Secretary-\nGeneral adequate authority to deploy resources and \nstaff from lower to higher priority programmes. We are \nconvinced that as chief administrative officer, the \nSecretary-General should be accorded more leverage to \ncommand both human and financial resources so that \nthe Secretariat can deliver more effectively. Member \nStates must recognize the importance of timely and \nunconditional funding of the mandates entrusted to the \nSecretary-General by the legislative bodies of the \nOrganization. It is incumbent upon the Secretariat to \nensure accountability and the prudent management of \nsuch resources. \n Enabling the Organization to effectively deliver is \na collective responsibility of the Member States and \nthe Secretariat. What is essential is for Member States \nto ensure that there are efficient oversight bodies to \nguarantee compliance with standing rules and \nregulations. \n One of the major successes of the sixtieth session \nwas the implementation of the World Summit decision \non the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission. \nAfrica expects the Peacebuilding Commission to \neffectively discharge its mandate. \n The establishment of the Human Rights Council \nis also one of the significant achievements of the \nsixtieth session. It demonstrates our collective desire to \nelevate human rights to new heights of prominence and \nvisibility consistent with the changing times. It is our \nexpectation that the new body will operate on the basis \nof principles of cooperation, genuine interactive \ndialogue and tolerance coupled with respect for \ndiversity. The importance of issues of development \nshould not be underestimated. In developing countries, \nthese issues are real challenges which should not be \noverlooked. The Human Rights Council must therefore \naddress issues of capacity building and find ways of \nresponding to institutional weaknesses and resource \nlimitations which hamper the process of translating \nconstitutional and statutory human rights provisions \ninto reality. \n Let me conclude by reaffirming Botswana\u2019s \nabiding faith in the utility and universality of the \nUnited Nations. The United Nations is nothing else but \nourselves, the Member States, put together. It should be \ngreater than the sum total of all of us. We must \ntherefore have the courage to strengthen ourselves by \nfollowing through with reforms, including the reform \nof the Security Council. The reform of the Security \nCouncil should not pose difficulties to anyone. We are \nall responsible for keeping this world safe. \n It is only when Member States consider their \nnational interests to be an integral part of the wider \ninterests of the international community that they can \nset aside their apprehension with regard to a Security \nCouncil enlarged in both the permanent and non-\npermanent categories.

        "file_text": "Let me add my voice of \ncongratulations to President Sheikha Haya Rashed \nAl-Khalifa on her assumption of this driving seat, \nwhich has mainly been occupied by men in the history \nof the United Nations. Before this Assembly last week, \nwe welcomed the first African woman to become a \nnational President \u2014 Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf of Liberia. \nAt last, the glass ceiling that has tended to frustrate the \nattempts of women to become presidents is surely \ncracking in several places. We should celebrate that. \n Let me also congratulate Ambassador Jan \nEliasson of Sweden for a job well done as President of \nthis Assembly. \n Kenya is a United Nations country. We attach \nspecial significance to our being hosts of the biggest \nUnited Nations centre outside the developed world \u2014 \nthe United Nations Office at Nairobi, which also hosts \nthe global headquarters of the United Nations \nEnvironment Programme and the United Nations \nHuman Settlements Programme. We are a major \n  \n \n06-53615 14 \n \ncontributor to United Nations peace missions around \nthe world. We subscribe to the principles and ideals of \nthis Organization and have always upheld its Charter. \n In my contribution to this general debate, allow \nme to dwell on the crisis that is Somalia. I do not think \nthat I need to remind the world that there is a crisis in \nSomalia, but I believe that I must encourage the \ncommunity of nations to understand that the problem \nof Somalia is not going to go away unless we take \ndeliberate steps to address the crisis. The comfortable \nthing to do is to look at Somalia as being far away and \nhope that the problem will resolve itself somehow. \n This afternoon, I bring the bad news that the \nproblem of Somalia is not going to get resolved \nsomehow by itself. All of us, the community of \nnations, must chip in. If, for a moment, we dwell on the \ncomforting notion that Somali does not concern us, \nthen it may be worth talking to my friends from South \nKorea or China, which are 8,000 to 10,000 kilometres \naway from Somalia. A few months ago, pirates from \nSomalia hijacked merchant ships in international \nwaters off the coast of Somalia. It was only after \nprotracted negotiations that included use of Kenyan \nintelligence that the merchant seamen from South \nKorea and China were released safely to their families. \n I recount this story of merchant seamen so that all \nof us in the international community should appreciate \nthat the Somali phenomenon, with no Government in \nplace, is a danger not just to neighbouring countries, \nbut to the whole world. As criminal elements establish \ntheir safe enclaves in a country like Somalia, the \nneighbouring countries and the international \ncommunity are soon forced to intervene, even \nmilitarily, to free hostages, to hunt terrorists or to flush \nout rebels. \n In the new global village, we are all neighbours \nof Somalia. As a front-line State to that country in \ncrisis, we have participated in negotiations to free \nhostages. We have cooperated in attempts to arrest \ncriminal elements. We continue to host close to a \nmillion refugees. We provide life-saving support in \nterms of medical facilities and supplies. But above all, \nwe continue to work on efforts to create peace in \nSomalia. The Transitional Federal Government, the \nTransitional Charter and the Transitional Federal \nParliament were established all as a result of a process \nthat took place in Nairobi when we hosted up to 2,000 \nrepresentatives from a cross-section of Somalia over a \nperiod of two years. \n Today, I appeal to the rest of the world to take \ndeliberate steps to help Somalia. The time to help is \nnow. Tomorrow may be too late. \n There are many communities around the world \nthat attach great importance to funerals. In those \ncommunities, most people only stand by and watch \nwhen their kin have fallen ill. An occasional visit and \nsome token of support are what obtains. As soon as the \npatient dies, an avalanche of support flows in. The \ncommunity of nations must not take that cynical or \nundertaker\u2019s approach. We are already too late, and any \nintervention we implement now is of an ambulance-\nand-fire-brigade variety, at best, but it is better than \nsimply standing by like spectators. \n Somalia is almost dying. We can see it. We have \nknown that for the past 16 years. This is the time to \nsend in life-saving support. It is really a tribute to the \nresilience of the Somali people that there are still living \nhuman beings in that country. One day or one month \nwithout Government, police, hospitals or banks in \nmodern society is unimaginable. The Somalis have \nendured for 16 years. How much longer are they \nexpected to endure? Where is the international rescue \nplan with a billion dollars? Where is the Marshall Plan \nfor Somalia? \n Even a much better but devastated Japan and \nGermany needed a Marshall Plan after the Second \nWorld War. We in our region are sure that humanitarian \nintervention now will yield better and faster results \nthan military intervention and at a much cheaper price \nthan sending troops to pursue criminal elements in a \nfailed State. That is not rocket science or complex \neconomic theory. That is common sense. All we need is \nthe will and the focus to apply ourselves collectively to \nthe problem of Somalia. I appreciate how difficult it is \nto be focused, given the several competing issues \naround the world, but focused we must be if we are to \navoid the current flip-flopping from one crisis to \nanother like chickens with their heads cut off.  \n I hear talk today about religious extremists in \nSomalia. What did we expect? Our own seven-year-old \nchildren become extremists in our households if they \ngo without food for one day. Somali children, youth, \nwomen and men have been going hungry for 16 years \nand living under very difficult circumstances. To be \nextremist is the normal human reaction in such \n \n \n15 06-53615 \n \ncircumstances and one does not have to have studied \npsychiatry at the PhD level to recognize that. If similar \ncircumstances in Somalia prevailed in other countries, \nwe all know that moderation would be the exception. \n Yesterday, I had the opportunity to brief the \nSecurity Council on the position of the \nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) \non Somalia. Our IGAD position is to support the \nTransitional Federal Government, together with such \nlegitimate transitional federal institutions as the \nParliament in Baidoa and the Transitional Charter that \nis the broadly negotiated road map for Somalia. \n As IGAD, we have also opened a window of \ndialogue with the Islamic Courts Union (ICU). Some \nfour weeks ago, I met representatives of the ICU in \nNairobi. We believe that, as in all situations of conflict, \nthe final resolution is best achieved through dialogue. \nThat is why, in our communiqu\u00e9 issued in Nairobi, we \nwelcomed the Khartoum talks that brought together the \nTransitional Federal Government and the ICU. But we \nare also concerned that communiqu\u00e9s after these \ndialogue conferences should be genuine. Soon after the \nKhartoum meeting, the news from Somalia has not \nbeen encouraging. There was an assassination attempt \non the life of President Yusuf. One more city was \novertaken by the ICU, not to mention the cold-blooded \nmurder of a long-serving humanitarian worker, a \ndedicated Catholic nun. The upbeat communiqu\u00e9 \nreleased from Khartoum begins to look like a sandwich \nwithout meat, fed to a world that is starved of any \nencouraging news from Somalia. \n There is a critical path that was set up by IGAD \nwith the help of the international community and that \nresulted in the formation of the Somali Transitional \nCharter that is recognized by the African Union and the \nUnited Nations. We are encouraged by the United \nNations positive endorsement of the Transitional \nCharter, which includes the Transitional Federal \nGovernment and the Transitional Federal Parliament. \nIndeed, the Transitional Federal Government is fully \naccredited to the United Nations, the African Union \nand IGAD, and the presidency of the Security Council \nhas articulated that recognition through its various \ncommunications, including the presidential statement \nof 13 July.  \n However, there is a major obstacle faced by the \nTransitional Federal Government of Somalia. Without \nsubstantive international support beyond the \nrecognitions, accreditations, resolutions and statements \nI have alluded to, the bottom line remains that the \nTransitional Federal Government is like people thrown \ninto the deep end of turbulent waters and are expected \nto swim with their hands tied behind their backs while \nhungry crocodiles surround them. It is not a very \nencouraging scenario. That is why we appeal for more \nmeaningful support for the Transitional Federal \nGovernment, even as we insist that it continue to \ndialogue with various groupings in Somalia. \n The international community must work to help \nSomalia and not inadvertently compound the problem \nin that country. It is vital that the international \ncommunity consolidate its efforts and not send \ndiscordant messages from Stockholm, New York, \nNairobi, Khartoum, Cairo, Addis Ababa or anywhere \nelse. Whatever the motives behind the proliferation of \ninitiatives from different capitals, we must recognize \nthat discordant signals act only to give incentive to \nsome of the actors on the ground to attempt to establish \nnew facts on the ground that they may leverage in \nfuture negotiations. \n I discussed that matter with the Secretary-General \nof the Arab League this morning and yesterday. Kenya \nhas put forward the following proposal, which I would \nlike to share with the General Assembly. We propose \nthat an international joint committee on Somalia be \nconstituted with the following membership: IGAD, \nrepresenting the front-line States; the African Union; \nthe Arab League, also representing the front-line \nStates; the European Union; and the United Nations, \nwith at least one or two permanent members of the \nSecurity Council to be included. It is our submission \nthat the international joint commission will help \nconsolidate our efforts and bring about a speedier \nresolution of the problem.  \n It is worth noting that the initiative that resulted \nin the formation of the current Transitional Federal \nGovernment was the fourteenth attempt to resolve the \nSomali conflict after 14 years. Its collapse would bring \nus back to square one in terms of coming up with an \ninstitutional framework that enjoys political legitimacy. \nThe Secretary-General of the Arab League has \nexpressed his support for the Kenyan proposal and we \nhope that we can proceed on that path by building on \nthe foundations already established by IGAD, rather \nthan allow another proliferation of vertical initiatives. \nWe appeal to other partners to embrace the proposal. \n  \n \n06-53615 16 \n \n On a more hopeful note, let me register our \ndelight at the progress made by our neighbours \nTanzania, Uganda and South Africa in brokering the \nBurundi peace agreement. We commend their \ncollective effort. The news from the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo is also encouraging. \n As Kenya takes over the chairmanship of the \nInternational Conference on the Great Lakes Region, \nwhich will convene in December this year, let me \nassure the Assembly that we will do our best to \ncontribute to the stabilization of our region, which is \nreally a very tough neighbourhood to live in. \n Finally, let me congratulate Secretary-General \nKofi Annan on his exemplary stewardship of this world \nbody. As a brother from Africa, I can confidently say \nthat he has done us proud. "

        "file_text": "At the outset, on behalf of \nthe Cambodian delegation, let me extend our heartfelt \ncongratulations to you, Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa of \nthe Kingdom of Bahrain, on your election to the \npresidency of the sixty-first session of the General \nAssembly. Your election to that important post is a \ntestament to Your Excellency\u2019s distinctive abilities and \nimpressive achievements over the years. I am \nconvinced that under your direction, this year\u2019s session \nwill achieve a successful outcome. \n Please allow me also to pay tribute to the vision \nand tireless efforts of Secretary-General Kofi Annan in \npromoting global peace and in taking the necessary \nsteps to encourage many initiatives for the reform of \nthe United Nations. Our appreciation is also addressed \nto His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson for his efficient \nleadership as President of the sixtieth session of the \nGeneral Assembly, as well as for his countless \ncontributions to United Nations reform initiatives. \n In the face of uncertainties and challenges, where \nthe world seems to be inundated with conflicts and \nserious threats \u2014 such as the proliferation of weapons \nof mass destruction (WMDs), terrorism, environmental \ndegradation and infectious diseases \u2014 it is important \nfor all of us to keep our commitment to maintain peace \nand security in the world. In addition, I believe that the \nreduction of global poverty and the achievement of \nsustainable development in many developing countries \nare vital for human security. At the same time, they are \na daunting task for the United Nations as a catalyst of \nthe international community in helping to improve the \nsituation of those countries. \n Concerning the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction, Cambodia is of the view that the \ninternational community needs to be more vigilant \nabout the issue and to ensure that WMDs or their \ncomponents do not fall into the wrong hands \u2014 those \nof terrorists, organized crime groups or others \u2014 \nwhich could have dangerous implications for \ninternational peace and security. In that regard, we \nneed to strengthen the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT) regime in order to secure a \nbetter and more peaceful world for all. Nor should \nsmall arms and light weapons be underestimated, as \nthey are an equally dangerous source of conflict, \ntransnational crime and violence in many regions and \ncountries. \n The fight against terrorism remains of utmost \npriority for all Governments and for the United \nNations, given the continuing threat posed by terrorism \ndespite the serious measures and actions that have been \ntaken by Governments and international and regional \norganizations at various levels, including this world \nbody. To combat terrorism effectively requires, I \nbelieve, more efforts, more technical capacity, more \neducation, more information-sharing among law \nenforcement authorities and intelligence communities \nand maybe more understanding in some specific cases \nof the root causes of acts of violence which are \ntantamount to reactions of despair. \n Concerning the Middle East crisis, we have to \ncongratulate the Security Council on the adoption of its \nresolution 1701 (2006) to end the recent war in \nLebanon. We call upon all parties concerned to fully \nrespect that resolution in order to prevent a repetition \nof the conflict and further loss of innocent life. In the \nsame vein, the international community should work \nmore actively to help bring about a permanent end to \nthe violence between Palestine and Israel. I believe that \npeace in the Middle East will be better guaranteed only \nwhen the leaders of both sides \u2014 Palestine and \nIsrael \u2014 have the courage and wisdom to realize that \nthey cannot continue to destroy each other forever, but \nmust work together for a lasting peace in the region.  \n Both Israel and Palestine have the right to coexist \nas independent and sovereign States. At the same time, \nthey need to overcome their historical animosity and \nhatred towards each other. Whether they like it or not, \nIsrael and Palestine are destined to coexist as \nneighbours forever. I strongly believe that a peaceful \nsolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would create \nthe foundation for durable peace and security in the \nentire Middle East.  \n With regard to United Nations reform, it is clear \nthat in recent years, every State member of the world \nbody has wanted the United Nations to be reformed. \nHowever, when the opportunity arises, we face a \ndeadlock on this very important issue, because too \nmuch emphasis has been placed on reform of the \nSecurity Council. In that regard, I think that we should \nlearn this lesson and try to avoid repeating such \nmistakes in the future. In other words, we should take a \nstep-by-step approach and tackle minor problems first, \n  \n \n06-53329 4 \n \nsuch as strengthening the role of the Economic and \nSocial Council to deal with development, since that \nissue is less controversial and there is more inclination \nto support it.  \n Next, we might consider revitalizing the General \nAssembly as the sole body representative of all United \nNations Member States. Afterward, we can move \nforward to the reform of the Security Council. We have \nto start first with issues where consensus could be \neasily reached, and then move to the more difficult \nones, without having to completely stall the United \nNations reform process. \n Since their adoption in 2000, by and large there \nhas been progress in achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). But in actuality there has \nbeen little achievement for developing countries thus \nfar due to a number of factors, such as lack of financial \nand human resources, including the negative impact of \nglobalization, which has led to a widening gap between \ndeveloped countries and poor nations. \n In Cambodia, the Royal Government has set up \nits own \u201cMDGs\u201d, called the Cambodia Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, with specific target priorities. \nSince their establishment, Cambodia has made positive \nprogress in some areas, such as reducing poverty, \ncombating HIV/AIDS and improving the livelihood of \nour people, thanks to the rectangular strategy of the \nRoyal Government, which yielded strong economic \ngrowth over the past year. \n Extreme poverty in the world today is an affront \nto the whole world with 1.3 billion people still living \non the margins of life, earning less than one dollar a \nday, while another 1.8 billion are living on less than \ntwo dollars a day, in spite of the commitment to the \nMDGs in 2000. Addressing this crucial problem \nrequires painstaking efforts at the national and \ninternational levels. The eradication of poverty is, first \nand foremost, the responsibility of the whole world and \nrequires the cooperation of the developed countries and \ninternational organizations. Given the enormous \nresources and wealth of this world, I believe that no \none on this planet should go hungry while in developed \ncountries there is an over-supply of food, which has led \nto wasteful dumping. \n To deal with global poverty, a comprehensive \napproach and collective actions are needed. Official \ndevelopment assistance, debt relief, market access, \ntransfer of know-how, foreign direct investment and so \nforth must be addressed all together, so that developing \ncountries can catch up with the current globalization in \norder to bridge the gap between peoples and nations in \nthis world where we all are living. \n Finally, let me reiterate that our world today will \ncontinue to face major global threats and challenges. \nThe role of the United Nations, as an Organization that \nis representative of the whole world, in tackling these \nphenomena is of paramount importance for humankind. \nTherefore, Cambodia hopes that United Nations reform \ncan move ahead to significantly contribute to dealing \nwith these challenges successfully.

        "file_text": "The United Nations \ntoday is at a crossroads. It needs to become part of the \ntwenty-first century, and it must do so with great \nurgency. It needs to gear itself to become an institution \ncapable of taking on the serious challenges that \nconfront the international community. \n As we address these tasks, your election, Madam \nPresident, to preside over the sixty-first session of the \nGeneral Assembly is a tribute to your wisdom and \nskill. It is also a compliment to your great country. I \ntake this opportunity to congratulate you. At the same \ntime, it gives me pleasure to express appreciation to \nMr. Jan Eliasson, who presided so ably over the \nsixtieth session. Today, as the United Nations \napproaches the end of one era and the beginning of \nanother, the Maldives expresses its profound \nappreciation to the outgoing Secretary-General, Mr. \nKofi Annan. He has led the Organization for a decade, \nwith great devotion and skill. \n Modernization should be a top priority for any \norganization that wants to remain relevant in a time of \nrapid change. It is particularly important for the United \nNations because of the central role that it must \ncontinue to play in promoting cooperation for \ninternational peace and security, economic and social \ndevelopment, human rights and the rule of law. The \nMaldives believes that reform of the United Nations \nmust be transparent, balanced, comprehensive and \ninclusive. \n In addition to modernizing the Security Council, \nwe must strengthen the General Assembly and the \nEconomic and Social Council. These reforms must \nmake the Organization more action-oriented and \ndemocratic. A reformed United Nations must be \nresponsive to the entire membership, and be faithful to \nits founding principles. The Organization must be \nadapted to carry out its mandate in full. There can be \nno doubt that this can be achieved by gearing the \nUnited Nations to implement all its mandates, \ndecisions and resolutions without fear or favour. \n The question of equitable representation and an \nincrease in the membership of the Security Council is a \n  \n \n06-52879 14 \n \ncrucial part of the reform process. The Maldives \nbelieves the membership of the Council must reflect \nthe realities of the present day. In this regard, the \nMaldives reiterates its support for the proposal of the \ngroup of four on Security Council reform. \n For the Maldives the next few years will be a \ncrucial period in our national development. As a result \nof national efforts made with the support of the \ninternational community, the Maldives is today set to \nsay goodbye to its least developed country status. The \nthree-year smooth transition period will begin in \nJanuary 2008. Graduation from the least developed \ncountry list will pose numerous challenges to us. \n However, we look forward to that event as a \npositive development. We have already begun work \nwith the donor community to identify ways in which \nthe economic and social progress of the country will \ncontinue without disruption after graduation. In this \nregard, I note the successful launching of the Maldives \nPartnership Forum as an annual event. The first such \nforum was held in June this year. I wish to thank our \ndonors for their continued commitment to support the \ndevelopment of the Maldives beyond graduation. \n The graduation of the Maldives from least \ndeveloped country status to that of a developing \ncountry coincides with an important political phase in \nthe country\u2019s development. Over the past three years \nwe have been engaged in a major political \ntransformation. These reforms are based on the \nsustained social and economic progress that has \nqualified the Maldives for graduation. The political \nreform programme that we began in 2003 covers \ninstitutionalizing political pluralism and strengthening \nhuman rights protection, media freedom and judicial \nreform. \n The achievements of the programme to date \ninclude the formation of four political parties last year, \nstrengthening the fundamental rights of the people and \nenhancing the rule of law. Also a constitutional \nassembly is in session to modernize the constitution. \nOther projects are being implemented to overhaul the \ncriminal justice system, set up a modern police service, \nstrengthen media freedom and develop civil society. \n We are also determined to meet the standards \nprescribed in international human rights treaties. Over \nthe past two years we have acceded to the Convention \nagainst Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading \nTreatment or Punishment and its Optional Protocol. We \nhave also acceded to the Optional Protocol to the \nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of \nDiscrimination against Women. Just yesterday I \ndeposited with the Secretary-General our instruments \nof accession to the International Covenant on Civil and \nPolitical Rights and its Optional Protocol and to the \nInternational Covenant on Economic, Social and \nCultural Rights. \n The Maldives was the country worst affected by \nthe 2004 tsunami. Twenty-one months into the \nrecovery programme, much has been achieved, but \nmuch remains to be done. I take this opportunity to \nthank the donor community and friendly countries for \nthe support and assistance extended to our recovery \nprogramme. The biggest obstacle to the programme is \nthe substantial funding shortfall in key aspects of \nrecovery, in particular in the areas of repair and \nreconstruction of housing, transportation, water and \nsanitation, and environmental mitigation. The funding \ngap is estimated at $100 million. In addition, as a result \nof the impact of the tsunami and of high petroleum \nprices on public finances, there is a budget deficit of \n$100 million. At this critical juncture of our national \nprogress I call upon our development partners, and the \ninternational community as a whole, to continue to \nassist the Maldives. \n It is a matter of satisfaction to us that, despite the \ndevastation caused by the tsunami and the short-term \nfiscal pressures, the Maldives has been able to meet \nsome international development targets. In reducing \npoverty and in providing primary education the \nMaldives has already met the Millennium Development \nGoals. We are confident that we can attain the targets \nfor health care and gender empowerment. \n Instability in any part of the world has \nimplications for the entire international community. \nOne of the most intractable disputes of our time is the \nconflict in the Middle East, particularly the non-\nrealization of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian \npeople. The recent hostilities in Lebanon and the \nsufferings of the Lebanese people have their roots in \nthe Palestinian problem. The Palestinian issue must be \nresolved, in accordance with international law and the \nrelevant resolutions of the Security Council. \n The continued instability and violence in \nAfghanistan and Iraq is a matter of great concern to the \nMaldives. Years of instability and conflict have \n \n \n15 06-52879 \n \nravaged the lives and society of the peoples of these \ncountries. \n The Maldives fully subscribes to the efforts made \nby the international community to combat terrorism. \nWe are party to the major international conventions \nthat have been formulated to defeat terrorism. \nTerrorism is an assault on the values of freedom and \nhuman solidarity. However, our efforts to combat the \nmenace should avoid undermining the very values that \nwe seek to protect. There is a resurgence of the \nvilification of Islam and Muslims. As the Maldives has \nbeen a 100 per cent Muslim nation for more than 850 \nyears, we are dismayed by this trend. Islam has \nprovided the basis for peace and social harmony in the \nMaldives. Islam preaches moderation, not extremism. \nViolence and killing are abhorrent to Islam. The Holy \nKoran states, \u201cTake not life, which Allah hath made \nsacred, except by way of justice and law.\u201d (The Holy \nKoran, VI:151) \n Needless to say, we are deeply pained and \noutraged by the negative imaging of Islam and the \neffort to associate fanaticism and violence with our \npeace-loving faith. The Holy Koran says, \u201cAllah \ncommands justice, the doing of good, and liberality to \nkith and kin, and He forbids all shameful deeds, and \ninjustice and rebellion.\u201d (ibid. XVI:90) \n Only love can conquer hatred. Knowledge alone \ncan overcome prejudice. Tolerance can defeat fear. \nStable peace requires inclusion. Effective and \nmeaningful dialogue among civilizations and mutual \nrespect among diverse peoples are necessary to address \nthe challenges that we face today. Tolerance and \nrespect for diversity are given a high value in Islam. \n Civilization is under serious threat from the \ncontinued degradation of the environment and its \nresultant effects of global warming, climate change and \nsea-level rise. Small island States such as the Maldives \nand other low-lying regions of the world are in the \nfront line of danger from rising seas. The extreme \nweather events of the past few years have been more \nfrequent and destructive than ever before. They clearly \ndemonstrate that the entire world is vulnerable to the \ndevastation caused by climate change. The Kyoto \nProtocol has been a great disappointment. We call upon \nall countries to accelerate the adoption of urgent and \nrealistic measures to stop climate change and sea-level \nrise. \n If we are to address the vast array of challenges \nthat humanity faces today we must effectively \nimplement crucial blueprints and action programmes \nagreed through the multilateral process. We must \nbreathe new life into Agenda 21. We must also adhere \nto the Monterrey Consensus. The Millennium \nDeclaration must be followed up diligently. And, as \nSecretary-General Kofi Annan said earlier this month, \nthe United Nations must move from a culture of \nreaction to one of prevention. \n Today I am speaking in my vernacular language, \nDhivehi. It represents the legacy of several \nmillenniums of continuous settlement and the culture \nthat it has produced in the Maldives. Is not the \nprotection of such legacies the touchstone of success of \nthis global family of nations? If the United Nations can \nmake small and vulnerable countries feel safe, then \nwho will be facing any danger at all? "

        "file_text": "As President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez said in his brilliant \nstatement, only four days ago the Fourteenth Summit \nof the Non-Aligned Movement, held in Cuba, \nconcluded. Today I speak on behalf of the Movement\u2019s \nChairman, President Fidel Castro, fulfilling our \nobligation to inform the Assembly of the main \ndecisions agreed at the summit conference in Havana. \n As First Vice-President of the Council of State \nand Minister of the Republic of Cuba, Ra\u00fal Castro, \nsaid in his opening speech: \n \u201cThe current international situation, characterized \nby the one super-Power\u2019s irrational attempts to \ncontrol the world, aided by its allies, shows that \nwe need to be increasingly united in defence of \nthe principles and purposes upon which the Non-\nAligned Movement was established, which are \nthose enshrined in international law and the \nCharter of the United Nations.\u201d \n While the founding of the Movement was \nnecessary more than four decades ago, its continued \nrelevance in today\u2019s world is beyond doubt. The \nsummit held in Cuba was an indisputable success, in \nspite of the threats and pressures of those who oppose \nthe unity and common efforts of the countries of the \nsouth. The summit saw high levels of participation, in \n  \n \n06-52879 24 \n \nterms both of the number of countries attending the \nconference and of the attendance of heads of State or \nGovernment. Profound and fruitful debates were held \nin an atmosphere of true understanding, unity and \ncohesion, which allowed for the adoption of documents \nof crucial importance to the role of the Non-Aligned \nMovement. \n As the new Chairman, Cuba was given clear \nmandates and an action programme that will govern its \nactivities as head of the Movement. As a result of the \nsummit, the Non-Aligned Movement has been \nstrengthened and consequently so has the political \nunity of the countries of the South. The diverse and \nheterogeneous nature of the Movement\u2019s membership, \nfar from weakening it, constitutes its essential strength. \nThese features have allowed for the creation of solid \nconsensus that will be a positive contribution to our \nefforts to overcome the many and serious challenges \nhumanity faces today. The commendable work of \nMalaysia as the Movement\u2019s Chairman over the past \nthree years was acknowledged at the Summit. There \nwas no cause or demand by a country of the south \nwhich was not duly considered or which did not meet \nwith the support of the Movement. \n Progress in the defence of multilateralism, \ndemanding respect for the sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity of all States, and ensuring the full realization \nof our peoples\u2019 right to development and peace were \nratified at the Summit as the Movement\u2019s principles, \nwhose implementation was urgently needed. The Heads \nof State or Government decided to work to suppress \nacts of aggression or other actions contrary to the \npreservation of peace and to encourage the peaceful \nsettlement of international disputes. \n The summit called on all nations to abstain from \nthe use of force or from threatening to use force against \nthe territorial integrity or independence of any State. \nParticipating nations promoted the development of \nrelations of friendship based on respect for the \nprinciple of equal rights and the will of all peoples to \nstruggle against foreign occupation. They urged nations \nto extend international cooperation with a view to \novercoming the serious economic, social, cultural and \nhumanitarian challenges that face the world and to \npromoting respect for the human rights and \nfundamental liberties of all for the benefit of all. The \nfundamental and inalienable right of all peoples to self-\ndetermination was reaffirmed in Havana. The non-\naligned countries agreed that world peace and security \nare today more imperilled than ever as a result, among \nother factors, of the growing trend of the most \npowerful States to resort to unilateral measures and to \nthe threat of pre-emptive wars. \n The Movement\u2019s commitment to general and \ncomplete disarmament, and nuclear disarmament in \nparticular, under strict and efficient international \nmonitoring, was underscored. The summit also \nreaffirmed the basic and inalienable right of all States \nto research, develop, produce and use nuclear energy \nfor peaceful purposes and to be free from any kind of \ndiscrimination in this connection, in conformity with \ntheir respective international obligations. Similarly, the \nsummit clearly and firmly pronounced itself to be \nagainst terrorism, double standards in international \nrelations, coercive unilateral measures against any \nnation, regime-change policies, and the failure of \ndeveloped countries to fulfil their commitments in \neconomic and social areas.  \n The heads of State or Government reaffirmed \ntheir hope to live in a peaceful world in which all \nnations have the right to a better future and a fair and \nequitable world order based on the sustainable \ndevelopment of all nations. They affirmed that in its \ncurrent form globalization perpetuates and even \nexacerbates the marginalization of the countries of the \nsouth and demanded that it be radically transformed \ninto a positive force for change for the benefit of all \npeoples. \n The participants reaffirmed the right of the \nPalestinian people to have their own State, and \ncondemned the Government of Israel for the new wave \nof crimes and massacres in Gaza and other occupied \nterritories. They also vigorously condemned Israel\u2019s \nmerciless acts of aggression against Lebanon and the \nserious violations of that nation\u2019s sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity. \n The people and Government of Bolivia, facing \nattempts to destabilize the country instigated by \nexternal forces, received a gesture of support and \nsolidarity from the summit. The process under way in \nthat sister nation, aimed at guaranteeing the real rights \nof all Bolivians and at securing full national control \nover the country\u2019s natural resources, was offered solid \nsupport. \n The Movement considered with great concern the \naggressive policies and intensification of action aimed \nat undermining the stability of the Bolivarian Republic \n \n \n25 06-52879 \n \nof Venezuela and expressed support for the inalienable \nright of the Venezuelan people to determine its form of \ngovernment and choose its economic, political and \nsocial system, free from foreign intervention, \nsubversion, coercion or restrictions of any kind. The \nnon-aligned undertook to promote and participate in a \ntrue process of democratization and reform of the \nUnited Nations so as to leave behind the anti-\ndemocratic impositions and practices of the Security \nCouncil and to give the General Assembly its due \ndecisive role, in conformity with the roles and powers \ndescribed in the United Nations Charter.  \n I have mentioned only a few examples of the \npositions adopted at the summit held in Havana with \nrespect to the most diverse issues on the international \nagenda. The documents adopted will be officially \ndistributed to all United Nations Member States. A \nnumber of the decisions adopted at the summit will \nsoon be put into practice at this session of the General \nAssembly. \n Cuba is aware of the immense responsibility \ninherent in presiding over the Non-Aligned Movement \nat one of the most difficult times in human history, \nwhen we face more inequality and injustice than ever \nbefore. We shall not rest in our efforts to have the \nMovement occupy the place it can and must occupy in \nthe international arena, in keeping with not only its \nbroad membership of 118 countries \u2014 nearly two \nthirds of the membership of the United Nations \u2014 but \nalso its history of acting on behalf of the loftiest \ncauses. \n Inaugurating the Sixth Summit of the Non-\nAligned Movement in Havana 27 years ago, President \nFidel Castro said: \n \u201cThe struggle for peace and for a just economic \norder and a workable solution to the pressing \nproblems that weigh on our peoples is, in our \nopinion, increasingly becoming the main question \nposed to the Movement of Non-Aligned \nCountries. Peace and the immense risks that \nthreaten it, is not something that should be left \nexclusively in the hands of the big military \nPowers. Peace is possible, but world peace can \nonly be assured to the extent that all countries are \nconsciously determined to fight for it \u2014 peace, \nnot just for a part of the world, but for all \npeoples.\u201d \nA few days later in this same Hall, reporting on that \nsummit, President Castro said: \n \u201cThe sounds of weapons, of threatening language, \nand of arrogant behaviour in the international \narena must cease. We have had enough of the \nillusion that the problems of the world can be \nsolved by nuclear weapons. Bombs may kill the \nhungry, the sick, and the ignorant, but they cannot \nkill hunger, disease or ignorance. Nor can they \nkill the righteous rebellion of the peoples.\u201d \n The countries of the South will work united for \njustice, peace and the development of our nations and \nthe entire world, convinced that a better world is \npossible if we all struggle for it. \n I should now like to say a few words on behalf of \nthe people and Government of Cuba. Our people\u2019s \nexercise of its right to self-determination faces new \nthreats. The Bush Administration has stepped up its \nbrutally hostile measures against Cuba with new \neconomic sanctions that further intensify what is \nalready the longest blockade human history has known. \nMore severe reprisals are also being taken against \nthose from other nations who have business dealings \nwith Cuba, and financial transactions with our country \nare viciously persecuted. The very Government of the \nUnited States recognizes that it is spending more today \nin persecuting and punishing those who have business \ndealings with Cuba than in monitoring the finances of \nthose who attacked the twin towers. \n This past June the Bush Administration approved \nthe second version of its most recent plan of aggression \nand domination against our country, aimed not only at \noverthrowing the revolution but also at destroying the \nCuban nation. In violation of international norms and \nlaws, an unprecedented build-up of financial and \nmaterial support for subversive actions aimed at \noverthrowing the constitutional order freely chosen by \nthe Cuban people is being promoted. That anti-Cuban \nplan contains a chapter that is being kept secret.  \n The precedents for these decisions are the covert \nactions undertaken against the Cuban revolution, which \ninclude mercenary invasions, terrorist actions, the \nintroduction of plagues and epidemics to the country, \nand more than 600 plots to assassinate Fidel. \nThousands of Cubans have lost their lives or been \nmaimed for life as a result of this criminal policy. As \nthe height of hypocrisy and irresponsibility, the \nGovernment of the United States tolerates the presence \nof, and protects, the terrorists who plan new actions \nagainst our people on United States soil. While \nmanoeuvring to free the murderers responsible for \nmonstrous crimes \u2014 such as the notorious \n  \n \n06-52879 26 \n \ninternational terrorist and CIA agent Luis Posada \nCarriles, whom they refuse to extradite to Venezuela \u2014 \nthe United States Government is illegally and unjustly \nkeeping five courageous anti-terrorist Cuban activists \nin prison.  \n In spite of all these acts of aggression and the \ncriminal blockade, the Cuban people will never be \ndefeated. Cuba\u2019s internationalist efforts continue \nunhindered. More than 30,000 Cuban doctors and other \nCuban health professionals are saving lives in 68 \ndifferent countries today. We are participating in the \nstruggle against illiteracy on several continents. We are \ndeveloping a plan to train 100,000 doctors for the third \nworld, and we are helping hundreds of thousands of \npeople in many countries to regain their sight through \nOperation Miracle. With these efforts we are just \nfulfilling our fundamental duty in solidarity to aid all \nthe peoples of the world. \n Cuba is making progress and will continue to \nadvance and face the future with optimism and unity. \nIts educated and hard-working people, who consider \nhumanity to be their homeland, will struggle hand in \nhand with the peoples the Assembly represents for the \nright to live in peace, justice and dignity for all.

        "file_text": "We \nrecently celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the death \nof Albert Einstein. He recommended the construction \nof the atomic bomb to President Roosevelt, yet always \ndescribed himself as a militant pacifist. He shared his \nqualms of conscience with Sigmund Freud. In the \ncourse of their correspondence, the two men agreed in \nparticular that, if all peoples were to live in peace on \nthis planet, the world needed an international \norganization with which all people could identify. \nEmpathy towards that organization could provide it \nwith the authority to counter war. It was in that \nconviction and with the same emotion that the men and \nwomen of my country voted in favour of Switzerland\u2019s \naccession to the United Nations almost five years ago. \n Today, I affirm that we are glad to have taken that \nstep. \n Switzerland may not have experienced war within \nits own borders for a number of centuries, but that is \nnot enough to satisfy us, for war is not only there \nwhere bombs fall, killing men, women and children. \nWe are all involved in the conflicts that ravage our \nplanet. So long as these wars continue, no one can talk \nconvincingly of peace. We can overcome that feeling \nof powerlessness in the face of armed conflict by \njoining together to work towards peace. The country \nthat I have the honour to represent is convinced that the \nUnited Nations is the most important means of \npursuing that vision. The United Nations embodies our \nhopes for peace, solidarity and justice throughout the \nworld. \n Only through a common alliance of all nations do \nwe have that opportunity. No country is capable of \nmeeting the challenges of globalization alone. War, \nterrorism, drug trafficking, the offshoring of jobs and \nenvironmental and climate-related disasters are all \nglobal threats. They know no borders, not even those \nof powerful nations. No State, not even the strongest, is \nthe master of its own fate. Only through an inclusive \nnetwork with universally applicable norms can might \nand violence be replaced by justice. The United \nNations has been the world\u2019s most successful effort to \nachieve that end. \n Every nation and every community is guided by \nits own historical and cultural experiences in dealing \nwith conflicts. Nations behave and organize themselves \naccordingly. In Switzerland, our values are based on \nthe three pillars of democracy, the rule of law and \nsocial equilibrium. That influences our view of how the \ninternational community could address conflicts \nworldwide by helping the victims of violence or \ndisaster, establishing a legal system and enforcing it, \nand examining the deeper causes of violence and \nseeking to redress them. \n The first reaction of a human being towards a \nsuffering victim is to help that person. The United \nNations has stood by victims of natural disasters with \nhumanitarian assistance, be it after a tsunami or in a \ndrought. It also assists people affected by war. In so \ndoing, it has succeeded in building up positive empathy \nand in strengthening trust in it worldwide. \n Should the United Nations fail in its humanitarian \ntask, however, desperation and the tendency towards \nviolence increase and intensify conflicts. That can be \nseen with brutal clarity in the Middle East and in \nDarfur. \n Why should the international community not \nestablish norms just like a State does? I refer here to \nthe Millennium Development Goals, human rights, the \nclimate change Protocol and international law. States \nhave adopted penal codes to prosecute criminals, bring \nthem before a court, sentence them and have their \nsentence enforced. Doing justice to victims prevents \nacts of vengeance and a never-ending spiral of further \nviolence. It also serves as a deterrent to potential \ncriminals. \n What is good for a State should also be good for \nthe international community. It must treat war \ncriminals according to the same rules. The \ninternational community has to fight terrorism. There \nis no alternative to absolute respect for the rule of law, \nhuman rights and international law. The Geneva \nConventions are no hindrance to that; on the contrary, \nif the appropriate instruments are lacking, new ones \ncan be created, such as the convention on terrorism. \nAbove all, however, we must not betray our principles \nand our values. Torture or any other illegal procedure \nhas no place in our struggle and represents the radical \nnegation of the rule of law. Recourse to such means \nstrips the fight against terrorism of all its legitimacy. \n  \n \n06-52737 14 \n \n The establishment of the International Criminal \nCourt (ICC) was a key date in the history of humanity. \nIt is in this Court that war criminals are tried, found \nguilty and sentenced. Unfortunately, the process can \nsometimes take a long time, as we have seen in the \ncase of Liberia, and sometimes it can take far too much \ntime, as in the case of the Balkans. War criminals must \nbe extradited so that justice can be done. All war \ncriminals, including those from the Darfur conflict, \nmust be made aware of the consequences of their \ncrimes and know that they will not go unpunished. \n Respect for the law implies that all States, from \nthe smallest to the largest, become parties to the ICC \nStatute. Public international law, while it is of \nfundamental importance for small countries which are \nunable to defend themselves on their own, also serves \nthe interests of large States, and even super-Powers, if \nthey do not want to find themselves accused of \narbitrary acts of imperialism. \n We all know that no State can function purely on \nthe basis of laws and ordinances. Laws and ordinances \nmust have the full support of the public. The same is \ntrue for the United Nations. That is why the Human \nRights Council in Geneva will search for solutions \nthrough dialogue partnerships rather than by issuing \nthreats. That will take time, a great deal of time. The \nexistence of the Peacebuilding Commission at the \nUnited Nations clearly shows that the United Nations \npeacekeepers cannot bring about or enforce peace by \nthemselves. There need to be blueprints for peace and \nexpert evaluations, together with a long-term \u201cvariable-\ngeometry\u201d commitment on the part of the international \ncommunity, in order to prevent conflicts. \n Critics who believed that the United Nations was \nincapable of reform now have before them proof to the \ncontrary. By establishing a Human Rights Council and \na Peacebuilding Commission, the United Nations has \ndemonstrated that it wanted to give new life to values \nsuch as the protection of human rights and that it could \ndevelop new peacekeeping instruments. \n Just as a democracy strives to involve all its \ncitizens in political decisions, regardless of their \nbackground or financial standing, the United Nations \nmust not allow small groups of States or individual \nStates to impose their law on others. A broad consensus \nmust prevail. That is why we would like to see the \nreform and enlargement of the Security Council, which \nwould undoubtedly strengthen its legitimacy. Given \nthat we have still a long way to go before that point is \nreached, let us, rather, remain pragmatic and content \nourselves with short-term improvements to the \nCouncil\u2019s working methods, in particular, the right of \nveto. \n Every State will try to find the underlying causes \nof threats to its cohesion and endeavour to overcome \nthem, and so it is with a community of States. \n Environmental disasters give rise to mass \nmigration and legions of refugees. The signatories of \nthe Kyoto Protocol want to cut off this evil at the root. \nBut, here again, all States, without exception, must set \nfor themselves the same goals as were set at Kyoto \nand, above all, take appropriate measures. \n Every military conflict and every terrorist attack \nstems from economic inequalities and social injustices. \nThat is why we must do our utmost to fight poverty, \nlack of future prospects and political impotence. \n Religious conflicts are also born of economic and \nsocial inequalities. In reality, the East-West divide is \nperhaps more a North-South divide. If we want to \npromote religious tolerance, we must pay the price, \nwhich is greater social and economic justice. By \nadopting the Millennium Development Goals, the \nworld has set itself the task of reducing extreme \npoverty by half by 2015. Let us give ourselves and the \nUnited Nations the means for keeping that promise. \n It is through dialogue that it is possible to address \nthe conflict in the Middle East, the stabilization of Iraq \nand the nuclear crisis with Iran, and all the parties \nconcerned should do everything they can to avoid \nfanning the flames of discord. Respect for the basic \nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations is just \nas essential. In other words, no State is entitled to deny \nthe right of another to exist. Lastly, we cannot \ndisappoint those who aspire to self-determination if \nthey have the law on their side. \n When there is a clash of cultures, the response \nmust be dialogue between cultures and between \nreligions. We have no other choice. Humiliation and \nlack of respect for other cultures undoubtedly serve as \nbreeding grounds for terrorism. Since all States are \nrepresented here, the United Nations is a forum unlike \nany other. We are looking forward to the issuance of \nthe report on the alliance of civilizations by the High-\nlevel Group appointed by the Secretary-General. \nSwitzerland will be very active in this endeavour. \n \n \n15 06-52737 \n \n Switzerland is a neutral country. Our neutrality \nhas never authorized us to look upon the world with \nindifference or to stand on the sidelines. It has always \nmeant that we have the obligation to work to establish \npeace. We have never wanted to be, and have never \nbeen, neutral towards victims of oppression and \nviolence or the rules of the international community \nand of international law. The only legitimate ally of a \nneutral country is public international law. Neutrality \nmeans refusing all forms of hegemony and \nchampioning the peaceful coexistence of all countries, \nwhich all enjoy equal rights. That is how Switzerland \nunderstands neutrality and how it intends to exercise it \nhere. \n As I said at the outset, Albert Einstein concluded \nthat the empathy that people would come to feel for \ncommunity institutions could become the means to \nprevent war. But how is such empathy brought about? \nIt develops thanks to people who, in word and deed, \ncommit themselves in these institutions and thereby \ngenerate optimism about justice and peace. \n Secretary-General Kofi Annan is one of these \npeople. He has given the United Nations the face it has \ntoday, thank to his commitment in all areas of United \nNations activity, sometimes in the most delicate of \nsituations. We are greatly indebted to him, and we ask \nhim to accept our very sincere thanks. Switzerland is \nparticularly grateful for his personal involvement in \nsupport of our country\u2019s joining the United Nations. \nAnd yes, I confirm once again today, we are glad that \nwe took that step.

        "file_text": "On behalf of the \nGovernment and people of the State of Eritrea, I avail \nmyself of this opportunity to extend to Ms. Haya \nRashed Al-Khalifa, and to the Government and people \nof the Kingdom of Bahrain, my sincere congratulations \non her election as President of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-first session. I also wish to express our \nappreciation to Mr. Jan Eliasson of Sweden, who \npresided over the sixtieth session of the Assembly, for \nhis dedication and skilful leadership during the past \nyear. \n For reasons of brevity, I do not wish to dwell on \ngeneric themes of global economic development, \nUnited Nations reforms and other issues of interest that \nhave been addressed comprehensively by many \nspeakers with whom we share similar views. I shall \ninstead focus on cardinal issues of peace and security \nthat remain of paramount importance to my country \nand the Horn of Africa region as a whole. \n In this respect, allow me, Sir, to bring to the \nattention of this Assembly, for the umpteenth time, \nEthiopia\u2019s reckless flouting of international law that is \nthreatening peace and security in our region. It is \npainful for my Government to harp on the same theme \nat every Assembly session for the past four years. But \nthese are the sad facts of a perilous reality imposed on \nmy country. In the event, we are duty bound to press \nfor and exhaust all legal processes to stave off \ndangerous consequences before it is too late. \n As the Assembly is aware, demarcation of the \nboundary between Eritrea and Ethiopia remains stalled, \nmore than four years after the legal award, owing to \nEthiopia\u2019s rejection of the final and binding arbitration \ndecision. Ethiopia\u2019s conduct is contrary to the terms \nand conditions of the Algiers Peace Agreement. Indeed, \narticle 4.15 of the Agreement stipulates as follows: \n  \u201cThe parties agree that the delimitation and \ndemarcation determinations of the Commission \nshall be final and binding. Each Party shall \nrespect the border so determined, as well as the \nterritorial integrity and sovereignty of the other \nparty\u201d. \n It must be stressed that there is no equivocation \nor ambiguity in the general provisions of this \nAgreement. Yet, Ethiopia has violated the core of the \nAlgiers Peace Agreement with impunity. And, it has \ncontinued to occupy, by force, the sovereign territory \nof a United Nations Member State for the past four \n  \n \n06-53341 18 \n \nyears, in violation of that Agreement and Article 2, \nparagraph 4, of the United Nations Charter. \n How and why did this happen? \n To single out Ethiopia as the primary and only \nculprit would be missing the forest for the woods. The \nfact is that Ethiopia has neither the power nor the \npolitical skill to defy international law for even a single \nday, let alone for four long years. If it has done so for \nthe past four years, it is simply because its unlawful \nconduct has been, and continues to be, encouraged and \nsupported by certain Powers in the Security Council. \n This poignant state of affairs is best exemplified \nby the following three instances. First, when three \nyears ago, in September 2003, Ethiopia\u2019s Prime \nMinister sent an ominous letter to the Security Council \nannouncing his Government\u2019s blatant rejection of the \nBoundary Commission decision and calling for a \u201cnew \nmechanism\u201d outside the Commission to overrule the \nlegal award, the Secretary-General and the Council \nchose to accommodate Ethiopia\u2019s unlawful conduct. \nThis happened in spite of the fact that the Council is \nthe main guarantor of the Algiers Peace Agreement and \nhas treaty obligations to maintain the integrity of the \nlegal decision. It must be recalled that the Council is \nexplicitly empowered, by article 14 of the same \nagreement, to invoke Chapter VII of the United \nNations Charter to ensure compliance by the parties. \n As it happened, the Secretary-General and the \nCouncil opted for the wrong path and appointed a \nSpecial Envoy, in contravention of the legal agreement. \nThe demarcation process has thus been stymied for the \npast four years at huge financial cost to the \ninternational community and inestimable cost in terms \nof lost opportunity and heightened tension for the \npeoples of Eritrea and Ethiopia. \n Secondly, when this Special Envoy scheme \nproved unworkable, the United States Government \nemployed its full diplomatic clout to unlawfully alter \nand modify the legal Award under the rubric of a \u201cnew \ninitiative\u201d. This time around, the United States dropped \nall pretensions of influencing the demarcation process \nfrom without, through an external envoy wearing a \nUnited Nations mantle. The current plan consists of \ndirectly planting a senior expert as an adjunct to the \nBoundary Commission and bestowing on him wide \npowers to alter the decision in the process of \ndemarcation. \n Washington\u2019s package further envisages creating \na new and political appellate body \u2014 outside the \nBoundary Commission \u2014 to accommodate Ethiopia\u2019s \nadditional requests in case of dissatisfaction with the \n\u201calterations\u201d that would be implemented through the \nservices of the expert. This United States \u201cdiplomatic\u201d \nscheme, which in effect renders fundamental tenets of \nthe Algiers Peace Agreement null and void, has been \ntailored to fully address Ethiopia\u2019s request for an \nextrajudicial mechanism when it rejected the Boundary \nCommission decision in September 2003. \n From the foregoing, one can only surmise that \nEthiopia\u2019s original rejection of the award must have \nbeen tacitly supported by Washington from the outset. \nThe United States Government has even resorted to a \nseries of measures against my Government with the \napparent purpose of furthering this aim. In this \nconnection, I wish to refer particularly to the seizure of \nfinancial and other assets of our Embassy in \nWashington by the United States Homeland Security \nDepartment in contravention of the Vienna Convention \non Diplomatic Relations and to avail myself of this \noccasion to lodge a complaint on behalf of my \nGovernment and to solicit the support of the \ninternational community for redress and restitution. \n Thirdly, the semi-annual and other periodic \nreports of the Secretariat to the Security Council have \ninvariably tended to downplay Ethiopia\u2019s violation of \nthe Algiers Peace Agreement and the Charter of the \nUnited Nations. These reports have often tended to \napportion equal blame to both parties without \ndifferentiation and, particularly in the last two years, to \nimpugn Eritrea alone. In this regard, Security Council \nresolution 1640 (2005), which the Security Council \nadopted in December last year, went so far as to \nthreaten imposing punitive measures against Eritrea, \nostensibly for curbing the freedom of movement of the \nUnited Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea \n(UNMEE), while overlooking Ethiopia\u2019s refusal to \naccept unconditionally the final and binding decision \nof the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission (EEBC).  \n This unlawful conduct by Ethiopia is indeed \nthreatening to unravel the peace process as a whole. \nWe can also cite various instances in which the United \nNations Secretariat went out of its way to downplay \nunacceptable excesses and infringements of Eritrea\u2019s \nsovereignty by UNMEE staff and to blame my \nGovernment instead of taking appropriate remedial \nmeasures. Incidentally, whether the huge annual \n \n \n19 06-53341 \n \nfinancial outlays for the sustenance of UNMEE are \nreally justified and provide value for money spent \nremains a critical matter that requires thorough \nscrutiny and auditing. \n For us, these concerted unwarranted acts belie an \noverarching theme. The solemn pledges that we have \nheard on this podium from leaders of major Powers on \nupholding international justice and the rule of law, like \nthe collective commitments to prevent and resolve \nconflicts and avoid humanitarian disasters, ring hollow \nat the altar of reality. When the chips are down, major \nPowers, and especially the United States, continue to \npursue their perceived narrow interests at the expense \nof regional peace and security and the sovereign rights \nof nations and peoples. \n Be this as it may, my Government is determined \nnot to allow the legal process to be derailed through \nvarious subtle subterfuges. Let me recall that Eritrea\u2019s \nright of independence was compromised by the United \nNations in the 1950s \u2014 during the period of African \ndecolonization \u2014 to serve the interests of the United \nStates. Half a century later, we shall not allow any \nencroachment of our territorial integrity.  \n In addition, as my Government underlined during \nthe last meeting of the Boundary Commission, first, the \naward that is \u201cfinal and binding\u201d in accordance with \nthe Algiers Peace Agreement should not be tampered \nwith under any circumstances. In this connection, \nEthiopia\u2019s acceptance of the decision must be \nascertained publicly and unequivocally. Secondly, the \ndetails and modalities of demarcation must be worked \nout in an environment that is free from political \ninterference, unlawful and compounding mechanisms, \nand loopholes susceptible to distortion. \n Allow me now to briefly dwell on the dangerous \ndevelopments that are unfolding in Somalia and the \nmuddled interpretations, both deliberate and innocent, \nthat have gained currency in recent months. We must \nrecognize that the current crisis in Somalia derives \nfrom multifaceted and cumulative underlying causes \nthat have been in place for the past 15 years. Collective \nor individual initiatives that will be taken to promote \nenduring peace and stability in Somalia must \naccordingly address the following parameters if they \nare to bear fruit. \n First, the daunting problem in Somalia is \nessentially an internal political problem that must be \nresolved through negotiations among Somali political \nforces themselves. In this spirit, my Government \nwelcomes the efforts of the Sudanese Government to \nfacilitate talks among Somali political forces. \n Secondly, the portrayal of recent developments in \nSomalia in terms of the global war on terrorism is \nfactually untenable and politically imprudent. The \noverarching national cause of the Somali people should \nnot be reduced to or lumped together with this singular \nconcern. \n Thirdly, any external military intervention will \nfurther polarize the political realities of Somalia and \ninduce greater conflagration. Ethiopia\u2019s military \nintervention, under whatever guise or justification, is \nparticularly dangerous both for reasons of historical \nanimosity and because of the events of the past few \nyears. It must be understood that there is no consensus \nwithin the Intergovernmental Authority on \nDevelopment (IGAD) on the modalities, timing and \nnature of deploying foreign forces, although the matter \nwas comprehensively discussed at ministerial meetings \nfor the purposes of contingency planning only. We find \nthe African Union\u2019s recent call for deployment of an \n8,000-strong peacekeeping force in the absence of a \nrobust framework of peace unwise and fraught with \nunnecessary complications. Its practicality is also \nquestionable in view of the financial and other \nchallenges that the African Union Mission in the Sudan \n(AMIS) is grappling with in that country. \n Fourthly, a recent call by some forces for a \nselective lifting of the United Nations embargo on arms \nis unbalanced, misguided and fraught with the potential \nfor dangerous consequences. Indeed, a selective lifting \ncan only imperil the political process of reconciliation \nin Somalia and a durable political settlement there. \nAccordingly, appropriate adjustments to the arms \nembargo in Somalia can be contemplated only when \nthere is irreversible progress in the political \narrangements giving rise to national institutions that \nhave credible legitimacy and popular support. \n Fifthly, the challenges for promoting lasting \npeace and stability in Somalia are formidable. They \nwill be complicated if different actors work, or are seen \nto be working, at cross purposes. Closer coordination \nand consultation among all interested players must be \ncultivated and structured. \n Finally, the current situation in Somalia is raising \nthe spectre of territorial claims and disputes between \nSomalia and its neighbours. Territorial disputes and \n  \n \n06-53341 20 \n \nclaims can only be settled by strict adherence to the \nsanctity of colonial boundaries. \n Let me conclude by urging caution and prudence \nin the international efforts to help resolve the problems \nin the Sudan. The truth is that the high price of hasty \nand ill-advised policies will ultimately be borne by the \npeople of the Sudan and the region as a whole. The \ncomplexities of the situation must therefore be gauged \ncarefully, and all international efforts must be \nharnessed to promote a robust peace package that will \nbring about a lasting solution. Focus on short-term \narrangements without an overall peace framework will \nonly postpone and complicate a lasting solution. "

        "file_text": "These days, the days of the \ngeneral debate of the General Assembly, fall this year \nat a time of unique significance for the Jewish people. \nThey come on the eve of the Jewish New Year and the \nDay of Atonement and are known as the Days of Awe. \n In Jewish tradition, these are days of soul-\nsearching and prayer, of judgement and of renewal. \nThat concept of reflection is fitting not just for the \nfaithful. It should be a time of reflection for nations as \nwell. Let us use this time and this gathering to look \ndeeply and honestly at the world in which we live \u2014 \nthe world as it is and as it might be. The United \nNations emerged from the horrors of war and offered a \nvision of a new and peaceful world, but we see the \nsuffering of the people of Darfur, we see bloodshed and \nviolence across the globe, and we know that that is not \nyet the world in which we live. \n Our planet remains torn by conflict, At its heart, \nthis is a conflict about values \u2014 a battle of ideas. It is a \nconflict about whether to respect or to reject the \nother \u2014 a conflict between tolerance and tyranny, \nbetween the promise of coexistence and the \nhopelessness of hate. We see it played out in internet \nchat rooms and in houses of prayer, in classrooms and \nnewsrooms, on the battlefield and in the corridors of \npower. It is the challenge of our time. \n We, the people of Israel, have lived for many \nyears on the frontlines of this conflict. Our nation has \nfelt its fury; our soldiers have fought and died in its \nbattles. An ancient people in the heart of the Middle \nEast \u2014 great in history but small in number \u2014 we \nhave been a constant target of those that oppose our \nvery existence. We face this conflict on different \nfronts \u2014 as Jews against the dark forces of anti-\nSemitism, as Israelis against the enemies of our \nstatehood, and as members of the free world against \nthe merchants of global terror. \n We have been guided in this conflict by two core \nvalues that are embodied in our declaration of \nindependence and shape our national identity. The first \nis that Israel, with Jerusalem at its heart, is the national \nhomeland of the Jewish people, their refuge from \npersecution, their first and last line of defence. The \nsecond is that Israel is a democracy and that the values \nof justice, peace and humanity \u2014 first expressed by the \nprophets of Israel \u2014 are an integral part of our nation\u2019s \nsense of mission. We share the same values as the \ncommunity of democratic States. We are ready and \nproud to be judged by them. They are our own.  \n  \n \n06-52885 44 \n \n But too often there is a gap between perception \nand reality. Too often, Israel is not seen for its unique \ncreativity and spirit of enterprise, or for its \ncontribution \u2014 well beyond its size \u2014 to the sciences \nand to literature, to human development and \ninnovation. In many parts of the world, we are seen \nmainly through the lens of the Arab-Israeli conflict. \nAnd too often, that lens is distorted. To many, this \nconflict is portrayed as a clash of David and Goliath, \nwith Israel perceived unjustly as Goliath, but this \nsimplistic image ignores the fact that Israel remains a \nthreatened democracy in a hostile region. \n We have, of necessity, the capacity to defend \nourselves, but we will always be constrained in its use \nby our values. And yet, we face an enemy willing to \nuse all the means at its disposal to kill without restraint \nand without distinction. Every innocent casualty in this \nconflict is a tragedy. There is no difference between the \ntears of a grieving Israeli mother and a grieving \nPalestinian mother, but there is a critical moral \ndifference between the terrorists who hunt down \ncivilians and the soldiers who target terrorists while \ntrying to avoid civilian casualties. \n To protect its integrity, the international \ncommunity must uphold that basic moral distinction. \nTerror is terror, even when it is called resistance. It \ncannot be justified and it cannot be equated with the \nactions of those seeking only to defend themselves \nagainst it. \n If we want to protect our values, it is not enough \nto believe in them \u2014 we must act according to them. \nThere is no greater challenge to our values than that \nposed by the leaders of Iran. They deny and mock the \nHolocaust. They speak proudly and openly of their \ndesire to wipe Israel off the map. And now, by their \nactions, they pursue the weapons to achieve that \nobjective, to imperil the region and to threaten the \nworld. The moment of truth is here. \n The international community is faced with no \ngreater responsibility than to stand against that dark \nand growing danger \u2014 not for Israel\u2019s sake, but for its \nown; for the sake of the values it claims to embrace; \nfor the sake of the world we all wish our children to \ninherit. What more needs to happen for the world to \ntake the threat seriously? What more needs to happen \nto end the hesitation and the excuses? We know the \nlessons of the past. We know the consequences of \nappeasement and indifference. There is no place for \nsuch leaders in this forum. There is no place for such a \nregime in the family of nations. \n For any who still had doubts, the Iranian threat \nwas exposed to all in the recent conflict in Lebanon. \nArmed, financed and directed by Iran, Hizbullah \nkidnapped Israeli soldiers and targeted Israeli cities, \nbut it was the hopes of an entire region that they sought \nto take hostage. Out of the conflict \u2014 and because of \nIsrael\u2019s response to it \u2014 opportunity has emerged, but \nmuch is needed to turn opportunity into reality. \nHizbullah can never again be allowed to threaten the \nfuture of the region. The world faces a critical test \u2014 \nto ensure the full implementation of resolution 1701 \n(2006) and the immediate and safe release of the Israeli \nhostages. \n As we gather here, we think of anxious families \nthat ache for the return of their loved ones \u2014 parents \nwaiting for a son, a brother for a brother, a wife for a \nhusband. Israel will not rest until all the Israeli \nhostages are returned safely to the arms of their \ndevoted families and to the embrace of a loving nation. \nLet us all make them the same promise today. \n Last year, a great leader of Israel, Ariel Sharon, \nstood before this forum and said:  \n \u201cThe Palestinians will always be our neighbours. \nWe respect them and have no aspirations to rule \nover them. They are also entitled to freedom and \nto a national, sovereign existence in a State of \ntheir own.\u201d (A/60/PV.5, p.46) \n That was not only the voice and vision of one \nman. It is the voice and vision of a nation. We do not \nbelieve that Israeli-Palestinian relations are of \nnecessity a zero-sum game. Not every Israeli interest is \nat odds with Palestinian interests. There is, in fact, a \ncommon vision that binds together Israelis, moderate \nPalestinians and the international community. It serves \nthe goals of both peoples and represents the basis of a \ngenuine and lasting peace. At its heart is the vision of \ntwo States, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in \npeace and security. Israel believes in this vision, and \nfrom this vision we have drawn our principles for \npeace. \n The first is inherent in the very idea of two \nStates. For the Jewish people, Israel was established to \nbe our national homeland. It was the solution for \nJewish refugees and the realization of Jewish rights. \nAnd this is the true calling of the future State of \n \n \n45 06-52885 \n \nPalestine: a national homeland for the Palestinian \npeople \u2014 the solution to Palestinian claims, the \nfulfilment of Palestinian dreams, the answer for \nPalestinian refugees, wherever they may be. If \nPalestinian leaders are unwilling to say this, the world \nshould say it for them. Instead of giving false hope, it \nis time to end the exploitation of the refugee issue and \nto begin to resolve it on the basis of the vision of two \nStates, two homelands.  \n That is the real and only meaning of the two-State \nvision. It requires each people to accept that their \nrights are realized through the establishment of their \nown homeland, not in the homeland of others.  \n The second principle for peace is drawn from the \nconcept of living in peace and security. On the basis of \nthis principle the international community has insisted \nthat the State of Palestine that emerges next to Israel \ncannot be a terror State. A terrorist State is the last \nthing our troubled region needs. It is for that reason \nthat the road map requires an end to terror. It is for that \nreason that the international community has demanded \nthat any Palestinian Government fulfil three basic \nconditions: renounce terrorism, recognize Israel\u2019s right \nto exist and accept existing Israeli-Palestinian \nagreements. Those conditions are not an obstacle to \npeace or to the establishment of a responsible \nPalestinian State; they are a crucial ingredient for the \nrealization of those goals.  \n An end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will also \nrequire agreement on a common boundary. There are \nthose who believe that if only we could turn back the \nhands of time to 1967 all would be resolved. But, in \n1967 there was no Palestinian State; there was no link \nbetween the West Bank and Gaza; and there was no \ncommitment to lasting peace. A two-State solution \nrequires the creation of a new reality which never \nexisted in the past. For it to succeed, both sides will \nneed to commit themselves to compromise and to \nbelieve in coexistence. \n If only we could end the conflict today. But we \nhave learned from bitter experience that to reach \nlasting peace it is not enough to have a vision. Peace \nmust be built on the solid foundations of shared values, \nnot the shifting sands of false promises. Without this, \nthe political horizon will always be out of reach. We \nhave seen negotiations doomed by mistrust and \nfrustration. We have seen them lay the ground for \ngreater violence, not greater understanding. We cannot \nafford to repeat that experience. \n Unfortunately, the Palestinian Authority is \ndominated today by a terrorist organization that teaches \nchildren to hate and seeks to transform the conflict \nfrom a resolvable political dispute into an endless \nreligious confrontation. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict \nis the consequence and not the cause of this ideology \nof intolerance and hatred. We cannot reach peace by \nignoring these realities. We cannot find the solutions \nfor tomorrow without addressing the problems of \ntoday. \n But we also cannot give up hope, and I refuse to \ndo so. In a Middle East where being moderate is often \nthe same as being weak, our challenge is to empower \nthe peacemakers and disempower their opponents. The \nroad map phases and the three international conditions \nare designed precisely for that purpose. But if the \nworld hesitates in enforcing these standards, the \nextremists sense opportunity. And if it appeases, they \nsense victory. This is the moment for determination not \nhalf-measures and vague formulations. It is the \nmoment to demand that those Palestinian leaders that \nbelieve in peace determine the future on these terms, \nnot on the terms of terrorists. \n Unfortunately, there are no shortcuts on the road \nto peace. But stagnation is not in our interest, and it is \nnot our policy. \n It is in this spirit that Israel embarked on the \npainful process of disengagement, to create an \nopportunity for progress. But, sadly, we received terror \nin return. And it is in this spirit that I met with \nChairman Abbas two days ago, and we agreed to re-\nenergize the dialogue between us and create a \npermanent channel to pursue ways to advance together. \nThe parties do not need another forum to act out their \ndifferences, and the only forum that will resolve them \nis the bilateral negotiating table. We have no illusions \nabout the difficulties before us. We must face them not \nignore them. But we can advance along the road to \npeace if we have the strength to defend its principles \nand the courage to confront its enemies. \n In these days, while Jews prepare to welcome a \nnew year, Muslims around the world prepare for the \nholy month of Ramadan. As two great faiths begin their \nannual journey of reflection and decision, let the \nnations of the world begin it too. \n  \n \n06-52885 46 \n \n The Jewish prayers tell us that this is a time of \ndecision not just for individuals but also for States: \n\u201cwhich for the sword and which for peace, which for \nfamine and which for plenty\u201d. \n Those are sobering words, but they are also \nempowering ones. The message of these special days is \nthat no future is predetermined; no conflict is \ninevitable. It is up to us to make the right choices. \nHistory will judge us by them. In the words of the \ntraditional greeting: may the curses of the last year \nend; may the blessing of the new year begin. Shana \ntova: may it be a good year. "

        "file_text": "Allow me, \nMadam President, to make a few preliminary remarks. \nFirst, Saint Kitts and Nevis extends sincere \ncongratulations on your assumption of the presidency \nof the United Nations General Assembly. My \ndelegation is confident that you will rise to the \noccasion, and in so doing, make not just the Kingdom \nof Bahrain, but the United Nations family proud of \nyou. Secondly, I wish to laud the leadership of His \nExcellency Jan Eliasson during the course of the \nsixtieth session of the United Nations General \nAssembly. His leadership was propitious and \noutstanding at a time of reform and intense challenges \nfor the United Nations.  \n Thirdly, it would be remiss of me if I did not \nsalute the quintessential diplomat in the personality of \nHis Excellency Kofi Annan who, for nigh on 10 years, \nskilfully steered the United Nations ship through many \nrough and difficult waters. We are indebted to him for \nhis supreme statesman-like leadership. I hail him as a \nbrother of the diaspora and a gem of human \ncivilization.  \n Fourthly, Saint Kitts and Nevis warmly welcomes \nthe Republic of Montenegro into the United Nations \nfamily. It has taken a bold step in order to play an \nactive role in the international discourse and we \napplaud it for that initiative. \n This year\u2019s theme \u201cImplementing a Global \nPartnership for Development\u201d coincides with my \ncountry\u2019s focus on linking the need for human rights \nwith the desire for a comprehensive and sustainable \nhuman development strategy. For too long, the issues \nof human rights and human development have not \nalways run in parallel. My delegation believes that \noversight needs to be corrected.  \n Over the years, the international community has \nfocused its attention either on human rights violations, \nor on human development. What has transpired at \ntimes is, unfortunately, a withdrawal of resources from \none programme to supplement the other, which then \nhas an adverse effect on the former. What I suggest \ntoday is that there should be a strategy of linking \nhuman rights and human development so as to ensure \nthat our peoples are cared for in a holistic manner. \n Many of us may recall that during the previous \nsession of the General Assembly, when the Human \nRights Council was being established, there was a call \nfor the right to development to be included within the \nbroader theme of human rights. My delegation believes \nthat is, in principle, still necessary. At the same time, \nwe also believe that development in all of its forms \nwill not have any long-term effects or benefits unless \nhuman rights are incorporated in that development. \n We propose, therefore, that during the sixty-first \nsession the Assembly ensure that the drive for a global \npartnership for development is pursued with the goal of \nensuring that human rights and human development \nrun in tandem and, in effect, complement each other. \nMy delegation believes that only through that approach \ncan true global partnerships for development occur. \n Those ideals can be achieved. Saint Kitts and \nNevis has witnessed the possibility first-hand. Within \nthe Caribbean Community, we have embarked upon a \nregional partnership for development and in that \ndevelopment we have ensured that the rights of our \ncitizens and the development of our people are at the \nforefront of our regional partnership. A few months \nago, we formally established the CARICOM Single \nMarket and Economy. That was an initiative years in \nthe making; CARICOM member States remained \ncognizant of all the effects that the initiative would \nhave on its people, and we attempted, of course, to \naddress them all. \n We acknowledged that there would be growing \npains but we also realized that, for our nationals to \ntruly benefit in this rapidly globalizing world, it was \nnecessary. However, my CARICOM colleagues and I \nhave sought to minimize any short-term negative \neffects. \n For a country like mine, which only recently \nmade the painful decision to close our 360-year-old \nsugar industry, the partnerships we have nurtured \nwithin CARICOM have helped to ease the pain and \nhelped to prepare us for the Single Market. What we \nneed on a global scale is: partnerships for development \nthat consider and ensure human rights and human \ndevelopment for every State. \n Whatever way is deemed most appropriate, \npartnerships should begin with mutual respect and a \ncommitment to understanding each other. We live in a \ndiverse world, and, owing to globalization, that \ndiversity is felt now more than ever before. If we do \nnot strive to respect and understand each other, \ntensions will mount and instability will reign. \n \n \n5 06-53952 \n \n That is why Saint Kitts and Nevis has stood at \nthis rostrum time and time again, and called for the \nhuman rights of the people of the Republic of China \u2014 \nTaiwan \u2014 to be acknowledged in this body. The \nRepublic of China is a democratic country that has \ncontinued to embody the principles of the United \nNations. That country has continued to ensure that \nhuman rights and human development are nurtured and \npreserved together, and has many contributions to \nmake in the pursuit of a global partnership for \ndevelopment. It has been a great and magnificent \nfriend to several States members of the United Nations \nfamily, and not just those with which it has diplomatic \nties. We, as the pre-eminent international body, owe the \nRepublic of China and its 23 million people our \nsupport and acceptance, and we owe ourselves the \nbenefit of having the Republic of China fully \nparticipating in the United Nations system. \n My delegation would like to single out and \napplaud the peoples of the Democratic Republic of the \nCongo and of Haiti for striving to overcome periods of \ninstability and uncertainty through the democratic \nprocess. For the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \nmore than two generations have passed between \ndemocratic elections. And Haiti\u2019s 200-year history has \nbeen tumultuous in terms of its approach to democratic \nlife. The Caribbean Community was especially pleased \nwith the important democratic step taken by the \nRepublic of Haiti, and we were able this year to \nwelcome Haiti back into our fold. \n Those landmark elections could not have \noccurred without a concerted effort by all concerned to \nundertake partnerships, while respecting each other and \nstriving for full and comprehensive human rights and \nhuman development, along with a desire for peace. \nThis is a fragile period for those countries, but my \ndelegation lauds their efforts and initiatives, and we \nstand firm in our commitment to join in the global \npartnership for the development of those two countries. \n One year ago, the heads of State or Government \nof the majority of the States Members of the United \nNations signed on to the World Summit Outcome \nDocument (resolution 60/1). The document was viewed \nas the catalyst for a renewed commitment to a global \npartnership for development, security and human \nrights. During the sixtieth session, that commitment \nwas further solidified with the establishment of the \nPeacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights \nCouncil. Dialogue continued on issues relating to the \nreform of the United Nations. However, more \ncommitment and partnership are needed to see these \nreforms come to fruition. \n We must make a concerted effort. I cannot stress \nthat enough. If we were to be honest with ourselves, \nwe would acknowledge that the principles of the \nUnited Nations have not been at the forefront of our \nnegotiations and that human rights and human \ndevelopment have not been universally preserved. I \nhave already alluded to our diversity, but that must not \ncontinue to produce adversity. Rather, it should \nproduce a more holistic reform agenda. \n Saint Kitts and Nevis remains committed to \naction on the reform of the United Nations. The reform \nof the United Nations must be transparent. Three of the \nmore contentious areas of the reform of the United \nNations have revolved around the issue of \ntransparency. I speak of the reform of the Security \nCouncil and of the General Assembly, and the process \nof selecting the Secretary-General. \n The United Nations has evolved. We all have to \ncome to terms with that fact. The body that existed 61 \nyears ago could not operate in the world of today. Full \nrepresentation is necessary, and transparency is a must. \nThis, in our view, is tantamount to a successful global \npartnership. \n For this session of the General Assembly, Saint \nKitts and Nevis proposes a renewed emphasis on \nhuman rights and human development. We have \nactually begun that process in a very promising way \nwith the recently concluded High-level Dialogue on \nInternational Migration and Development. In that \nregard, we agree that it is imperative that the human \nrights and human development of migrants be taken \ninto serious consideration to ensure greater production \nand development in the countries involved. \n Recently, States members of the group of least \ndeveloped countries (LDCs) held a review of the \nBrussels Programme of Action. My delegation supports \nthe initiative of the LDCs and stresses that human \nrights and development must remain core principles in \nthe partnerships of LDCs with other members of the \ninternational community. \n For my own country of Saint Kitts and Nevis, we \nask that the international community also remain \ncommitted to the Mauritius Strategy for the Further \nImplementation of the Programme of Action for the \n  \n \n06-53952 6 \n \nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing \nStates.  \n Realizing sustainable development presents a \nformidable challenge for small island developing \nStates. They remain vulnerable to natural disasters, to \nclimate change and to the effects of globalization and \ntrade liberalization. We still need to examine the issue \nof graduation closely and at our own pace. Our cultural \nproducts still remain susceptible to piracy and our \nopportunities for reaping the benefits of science and \ntechnology are still limited. Developing countries are \nstill locked out of the decision-making processes of the \nglobal financial institutions, whose policies often \nundermine and \u2014 yes \u2014 circumscribe development. In \nour view, true global partnership should translate into \nconsideration of the requirements of every Member \nState, whether big or small, and of the issues critical to \nthem. \n During the sixty-first session, though there will \nnot be a high-level conference on HIV/AIDS, \npandemics such as HIV/AIDS continue to strike at the \nheart of development by crippling a nation\u2019s most \nimportant asset, namely, its people. Without \nmeaningful development, women, children, the elderly \nand the disabled will remain at-risk sectors of our \nsocieties. Financing for development will still be a \nmajor concern for all developing countries, and \ninternational peace and security will continue to affect \nus all. \n Throughout most of this year, the majority of the \nUnited Nations membership experienced the adverse \nimpact of the energy crisis on growth and livelihoods. \nThe United Nations family, which comprises producers \nand consumers of oil and energy products, must \ncollectively address a global energy security pact \nincorporating best practices on energy conservation \nand energy sources. \n Finally, development is a matter of extreme \nimportance for all of us. What we need, therefore, is a \nholistic approach to our global partnership. All of our \ncritical concerns need to be addressed. However, we \nshould begin with a careful consideration of human \nrights and human development. "

        "file_text": "Today, we stand on the \nverge of global uncertainty. The international \nlandscape is scarred by wars, conflict, civil unrest, \nepidemics, drought and famine. Poverty and \nmalnutrition continue to ravage the lives of millions of \nthe world\u2019s inhabitants. \n The very values and fabric on which the United \nNations was founded are being besieged by new ideas \nand principles that are undermining the authority of \nthis body to maintain global peace and security. The \nclash of ideologies and of cultural and religious \ndifferences continues to give much food for thought. \nThe United Nations stands at a crossroads. While it has \nthe mandate to address those challenges, it remains \nparalysed as a result of actions taken by the hegemonic \nPowers of today. That is the dilemma confronting the \nOrganization. \n The value of the human person and his or her \nright to live in a world that is fair and just seems but a \ndream. Ensuring the dignity of one\u2019s right to live with \naccess to the most basic necessities in life remains our \ngreatest challenge. We speak so ambitiously of creating \na world that is equitable and just, but the outcomes \nhave been unimpressive. \n The schism between the minority rich and the \nmajority poor continues to grow. The multitudes of the \ndisadvantaged are being further marginalized from the \nso-called benefits of globalization. Fear has struck \nmany small countries of the developing world. It is not \nthe fear that the developing world has no capabilities in \ncontributing to peace and security, but the fear \u2014 the \ngreatest fear, in fact \u2014 that the undemocratic practices \nof the major United Nations organs, such as the \nSecurity Council, are causing tension and disarray in \nthe work of the United Nations. \n The disparities in the quality of life between the \nhaves and the have-nots have grown to be fertile \nbreeding grounds for new and hostile generations. And \nit is here that the phenomenon of terrorism continues to \nchallenge the frontiers of our imagination. It is perhaps \nmuch clearer today than ever before that there are \nreasons for increased resentment in certain parts of the \nworld. \n My Government condemns terrorism in whatever \nform or manifestation it assumes, and there is an urgent \nneed for all the Members of the United Nations to work \ntogether openly in combating those dangerous \ndevelopments. The destruction of innocent lives should \nnot be the means to meeting an end. That is inhumane. \nAll United Nations Member countries therefore have \nthe responsibility \u2014 a moral and ethical \nresponsibility \u2014 to eradicate that menace from the face \nof the Earth. \n  \n \n06-53615 2 \n \n Peace cannot be won through injustice, the \npractice of double standards, aggression or war. We \ncannot be victorious in the fight against terrorism if we \nfail to address its root causes. Conversely, it is \nincumbent on all Member States to act responsibly to \nensure the implementation of all United Nations \nresolutions. Moreover, if we are to have any hope of \nbuilding a better future, then peace must sometimes \ncome at a price. \n We must begin to look deeply, honestly and with \nopen hearts if we are really to understand the world \naround us. If there is a question of repressive policies \nthat influence and dominate the international economic \nand political order, then those concerned must take \nremedial action. The adoption of the resolution on the \nUnited Nation\u2019s Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy is \ntherefore a positive step forward. \n The central focus on the fight against terrorism \nhas taken centre stage for some, and the diversion of \nresources is jeopardizing the realization of the \nMillennium Development Goals and official \ndevelopment assistance target levels. Accessibility to \nthe markets of the affluent nations has also restricted \nthe progress of development in many countries of the \ndeveloping world. Major world players must not lose \nsight of those goals. \n Inter-State relations, mutual understanding and \ntolerance begin with respect for the individual. The \ndignity of the human person is of the essence in \nbuilding equality between all persons. That is one of \nthe fundamental principles of the United Nations. As \nMembers of the United Nations, we have all agreed to \nembrace those principles and we continue to believe in \nthose values. Vanuatu joined the United Nations in \n1981 because it believed in the Organization. Today, I \nstand before the Assembly to again reaffirm faith in the \nUnited Nations, but I agree that changes must take \nplace to adapt the United Nations system to the \nevolution of the international and geopolitical and \neconomic framework. \n Reforms of the various United Nations bodies are \ntherefore absolutely essential. There must be reform of \nthe Security Council to ensure that it is democratic and \nmore representative of the United Nations membership. \nThe veto power in the Council dilutes all the good \nintentions of the majority of the United Nations \nmembership towards addressing many of the \nchallenges confronting us today. The underlying \nquestion, though, is: Has the disproportionate use of \nthe veto power sustained reasonable levels of \ninternational peace and stability? \n Cultural and religious differences cannot be seen \nto be obstacles in that regard. The United Nations \nbrought civility and etiquette to the conduct of \nrelations between States, and central to that are \nrelations between individuals. The art of statesmanship \nhas therefore become very critical at this time. Respect \nmust therefore begin here at the United Nations. When \none world Power speaks here, this Hall is jammed. \nThereafter, the debate becomes routine. That is remiss \nof many of us. The annual general debate of the \nGeneral Assembly is the only practical occasion at \nwhich almost all leaders are together in one place to \ndiscuss and share views on the development challenges \nfacing the globe. The United Nations is not about one \nor several nations; it is about this family of nations \nwith the one common objective of maintaining \ninternational peace and security. \n Over the past few days, millions around the globe \nhave monitored the unfolding debate in this noble Hall \nof the General Assembly. A war of words has \nresounded from this rostrum, exposing an alarming rift \nin relations between some super-Powers and the voices \nof the developing world. The media have exploited the \nsituation to scrutinize those events, often ending up \nwith gross assumptions and conclusions that have only \ninstilled fear amongst the world\u2019s innocent population. \nNow, is that the right message of hope we are giving to \nour peoples, who have faith in the United Nations? Is \nthe United Nations not the beacon of hope for all \nhumanity? \n Confrontation must be resolved through tactful \ndiplomacy and negotiation consistent with the purposes \nand principles of the United Nations Charter and \nestablished international law. In that spirit, we also \nappeal to those concerned to exercise great restraint \nand to have the wisdom and responsibility to ensure \nabove all that any action they take serves that purpose, \nwhich must be in the interest of future global justice, \npeace and security. Any retreat from multilateralism \nwill result only in increased tension and aggression. \nAgain, mutual dialogue through appropriate \nmechanisms is absolutely critical at this very delicate \ntime. \n On the question of the Middle East, both Israel \nand Palestine have the right to live side by side in \n \n \n3 06-53615 \n \npeaceful coexistence as independent and sovereign \nStates. The international community must be realistic \nabout the future. Let us allow justice, security and \nlong-lasting peace to prevail for both the Israeli people \nand the Palestinians. \n Recently, Vanuatu was recognized by the Happy \nPlanet Index, published by the British-based New \nEconomics Foundation, as the happiest place on Earth. \nWe are proud to have been placed so high amongst all \ncountries of the world, but we have been careful not to \nbe carried away, and so often it is that island paradox \nthat conceals the diverse development challenges that \nsmall island countries of the Pacific, such as Vanuatu, \nface in today\u2019s world of globalization. \n Last week, during the High-Level Meeting on the \nMidterm Comprehensive Global Review of the \nImplementation of the Programme of Action for the \nLeast Developed Countries, I spoke of the many \nchallenges facing my country in the implementation of \nthe Brussels Programme of Action. Vanuatu has been \nshowing positive signs of gradual economic growth. \nHowever, in the light of our vulnerability to natural \ndisasters, exogenous market demand and supply price \nfluctuations and their adverse impacts on the three \nmost important sectors contributing to our gross \ndomestic product, we consider this an inappropriate \ntime to include Vanuatu in the list of countries eligible \nfor graduation. \n Furthermore, while the current methods used to \nmeasure the three main thresholds for graduation are \ndependent on statistical variables, it is commonly \nunderstood that statistical data for countries in the \nPacific \u2014 including Vanuatu \u2014 contain major \ndiscrepancies. Therefore, relying solely on such data to \ndetermine Vanuatu\u2019s achievements in relation to the \nthresholds would yield inaccurate results. \n Very soon, the General Assembly will be \nconsidering countries recommended for inclusion in \nthe list of countries eligible for graduation. That list \nincludes Vanuatu. Our arguments for exclusion from \nthe list are well founded and based on practical \nrealities. My Government considers as premature the \nrecommendation by the Committee for Development \nPolicy to include Vanuatu on the list. We therefore call \nupon Members of the United Nations to understand and \nsupport Vanuatu\u2019s case. \n As a responsible United Nations Member, \nVanuatu is also contributing towards international \npeace and security. Vanuatu peacekeepers have \nparticipated in United Nations peacekeeping missions \nin Bosnia and East Timor, and we currently have \npeacekeepers stationed in the Congo, Haiti, C\u00f4te \nd\u2019Ivoire and the Sudan. Vanuatu has also participated \nin regional peacekeeping missions in Bougainville and \nSolomon Islands. Those efforts illustrate Vanuatu\u2019s \nresolve to engage in peacekeeping and peacebuilding \nin both the regional and international contexts. \n With regard to the question of the environment \u2014 \nin particular global warming and climate change \u2014 my \nGovernment strongly aligns itself with other small \nisland States in urging the international community to \nreduce emissions. The failure of major emitters to sign \nthe Kyoto Protocol is a major disappointment. \n The Charter of the United Nations espouses the \nprinciples that continue to guide the Organization\u2019s \nefforts in the process of self-determination. It calls for \nrecognition of and respect for the fundamental rights of \npeoples and territories still under colonial rule. We \nmust not lose sight of that goal. The United Nations \nmust make renewed efforts where it has failed to allow \njustice to prevail for those peoples who continue to be \ndenied their inalienable right to freedom and \ndemocracy. We must relegate that dark legacy to the \npast.   \n Determining how to bring more cohesiveness and \nunity to this great community of nations has now \nbecome a much more formidable challenge. I affirm \nmy support for the challenging exercise before us. Our \nAlmighty Creator entrusted us, the human race, with \nthe safeguarding of a great asset, the Earth. It is \nincumbent on us to make the most of that opportunity. \nThe world\u2019s destiny is in our hands. In that spirit, I \nextend my congratulations to Montenegro on its \nadmission as the 192nd Member of the United Nations. \n Before closing, I would like to acknowledge the \nsupport of our development partners \u2014 in particular \nAustralia, New Zealand, France, Japan, the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, the United States of America and \nthe European Union \u2014 as well as the various United \nNations bodies that are strongly supporting the \ndevelopment of Vanuatu. I also extend our appreciation \nto India, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia \nfor their continuous support within the framework of \nSouth-South cooperation. In addition, my Government \nis encouraged by the initiative and the kind gesture of \nVenezuela in committing $2 million to the Pacific \n  \n \n06-53615 4 \n \nislands through the work programme of the United \nNations Convention to Combat Desertification. Those \nare positive developments that together are \ncomplementing the leadership role being played by my \nGovernment in its development path. \n In closing, I take this final opportunity to pay our \nrespects to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for \nhis outstanding stewardship of the United Nations. His \nwisdom has ensured that the United Nations will retain \nits credibility and its relevance. During periods of \nturbulence and uncertainty, he has been relentless in \nthe pursuit of his belief in United Nations reform. My \nGovernment salutes him for his distinguished service \nto the United Nations. We wish him all the best in his \nfuture endeavours. "

        "file_text": "Let me \nbegin by congratulating the presidency on the success \nof the High-level Meeting on the least developed \ncountries, earlier in the week. I had the honour of \nparticipating in the Meeting, which heralded a very \nproductive year for the Assembly under the astute \nleadership of Her Excellency Ms. Haya Rashed \nAl-Khalifa, President of the General Assembly, and her \nBureau. \n I would like to express my deepest thanks and \nadmiration to His Excellency Secretary-General Kofi \nAnnan for his unparalleled dedication and contribution \nto world peace and prosperity through his dedicated \nservice to our global Organization. \n The United Nations was created, first and \nforemost, to forestall another world war. Not only has \nit achieved that cardinal goal despite four decades of \ncold war, but it has also offered States multiple means \nof resolving their differences, short of war. However, \nwe cannot be sanguine about future trends. If the \nprimary task of the United Nations in the twentieth \ncentury was to curb inter-State conflict, its core \nmandate in the new century must be to strengthen \nStates and to preserve the inter-State system in the face \nof new challenges. \n Some assert that the United Nations is poorly \nequipped to deal with new threats, such as those posed \nby non-State actors seeking to undermine the \ninternational order. The Charter was crafted to give \nMember States ample flexibility in adapting the United \nNations machinery to respond to novel threats in a \nchanging world. But our tools need sharpening. \n Since the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, \nthe United Nations has played an increasingly \n \n \n25 06-53005 \n \nindispensable role in the international community\u2019s \ncounter-terrorism efforts. Still, agreement on a \ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism \nremains elusive. But we must continue to try. In the \nmeantime, the United Nations Global Counter-\nTerrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288), adopted at the \nend of the sixtieth session of the Assembly, will guide \nour collective efforts to free the world from the scourge \nof terrorism. \n The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \nposes an equally urgent and unacceptable threat to the \npeace and security of the world. We cannot permit the \ncredibility of the international nuclear non-\nproliferation regime, built around the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), to be \nundermined by evasion and concealment concerning \nsafeguards obligations. We should redouble our efforts \nto get more countries to sign and ratify International \nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) additional protocols. \nAn early start of negotiations on a fissile material cut-\noff treaty and an early entry into force of the \nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) \nshould also be supported. \n Meanwhile, we must seek peaceful solutions to \nthe outstanding challenges to the system, including the \nIranian nuclear issue that is before the Security \nCouncil. It is not too late to work towards a negotiated \nsolution on that issue with its far-reaching \nimplications. I would call for creative, constructive \nthinking on the part of all parties concerned, so as to \nresolve the issue within the framework of the NPT \nregime. \n As for the situation on the Korean peninsula, the \nnuclear and missile programmes of the Democratic \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea constitute a serious \nchallenge to the non-proliferation regime, as well as to \nregional security. My Government fully supports \nSecurity Council resolution 1695 (2006). We urge the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea to refrain from \nany action that might aggravate the situation, and to \nreturn to the Six-Party Talks without preconditions, for \na diplomatic resolution of the matter. \n In that regard, during the summit meeting held \nlast week in Washington, D.C., President Roh \nMoo-hyun and President Bush agreed to work with \nother nations of the Six-Party Talks to develop a \ncommon and comprehensive approach to energize the \nstalled talks. I strongly hope that those efforts will bear \nfruit and that we can work to realize the \ndenuclearization of the Korean peninsula as envisaged \nin the Joint Statement adopted on 19 September 2005. \n Although not mentioned in the Charter, \npeacekeeping has become a defining feature of the \npost-cold-war era, as well as the largest, most \nexpensive and most visible operational activity of the \nUnited Nations. The surge in calls for the services of \nthe Blue Helmets attests to the Organization\u2019s \ncontinuing, even growing, relevance. \n The expanded United Nations Interim Force in \nLebanon (UNIFIL) in southern Lebanon is a \nchallenging case in point. To succeed, UNIFIL must \nhave the active support of all Member States, backed \nby timely humanitarian and economic assistance. To \nthat end, my Government has been providing \nsubstantial humanitarian assistance to the afflicted \npopulation. \n The undiminished human suffering in Palestine \nremains another source of deep concern. We urge the \nearly revival of the stalled peace process. \n The violence and the loss of innocent lives in Iraq \nconcern us enormously as well. We trust that Iraq will \nbecome a stable and prosperous democracy under the \nleadership of its new Government. As a friend of Iraq, \nmy Government supports its efforts at national \nreconstruction and welcomes the recent launch of the \nInternational Compact with Iraq to speed the process. \n In Africa, stability and democracy are gaining \nground, step by step, in Sierra Leone, Liberia and the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. The security and \nhumanitarian crisis in Darfur, however, remains acute. \nThe Secretary-General\u2019s strong personal engagement \nhas been critical in sustaining international attention \nand the flow of assistance to the beleaguered people of \nDarfur. Now, the smooth transition of the African \nUnion Mission in the Sudan to the United Nations \nMission in the Sudan must be accomplished in \naccordance with Security Council resolution 1706 \n(2006). \n The performance of the United Nations cannot be \nmeasured by the creation of new machinery, any more \nthan by the adoption of resolutions. As the Secretary-\nGeneral has wisely reminded us, what matters is \nwhether and how the United Nations makes a \ndifference in the lives of people and in the conduct of \nStates and non-State actors over time. \n  \n \n06-53005 26 \n \n Two new intergovernmental bodies, the Human \nRights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission, \nseek to make just such a difference. Their success, \nhowever, is far from assured. A great deal is at stake. \nWill the new Human Rights Council usher in an era of \nrenewed cooperation and solidarity in the work of the \nUnited Nations on human rights? Will the universal \nperiodic review succeed in offering all States a candid \nand constructive assessment of ways to enhance their \nhuman rights practices? \n Together, we can make the Council the pre-\neminent global forum for the advancement of human \nrights around the world. Divided, we will lose a \nhistoric opportunity. The protection of human rights is \nnot a matter of choice. It is the solemn duty of all \nresponsible members of the international community. \nWithout respect for human rights \u2014 in particular for \nthe most vulnerable members of society \u2014 peace and \ndevelopment have little meaning. \n The successful conclusion of the negotiations on \na convention on the rights of persons with disabilities \nspeaks to the essential humanity of the United Nations, \nwhich is its most precious asset. The Republic of Korea \nis fully committed to the principle of all human rights \nfor all. We deeply empathize with the suffering in those \nareas of the world where human rights are given little \nmore than lip service.  \n In particular, we fully share the international \ncommunity\u2019s concern over the situation of human \nrights in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. \nWe call upon the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea to heed those concerns and to meet the call for \ndialogue on human rights. \n The United Nations greeted the twenty-first \ncentury with a solemn promise to achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. \nProgress has been made, but it has been far too uneven \nfrom country to country and from region to region. \nThose countries in Africa that lack the minimum \nresources for development require the focused attention \nand assistance of the international community. Key \ngoals, such as the eradication of extreme poverty and \ncurbing the spread of HIV/AIDS and other diseases, \nare in danger of slipping out of reach if we do not act \nquickly and decisively. \n Meeting the MDGs by 2015 is a tall order, but we \nshould never forget that, for the neediest members of \nhumankind, the United Nations may be the only beacon \nof hope for a better life. The credibility of the United \nNations largely depends upon its ability to accomplish \nits mission as regards the MDGs. While developing \ncountries should take primary responsibility and \nownership for their own development, we must honour \nour commitments and redouble our efforts to realize \neffective global partnerships for development.  \n The target established at the 2005 World Summit \nof 0.7 per cent of gross national income for \ndevelopment assistance forms the cornerstone of our \nstrong commitment to achieving the MDGs. Innovative \nsources of financing, such as the air-ticket solidarity \nfund, need to be further explored. New sources of \nfinancing should not, however, be a substitute for \nexisting official development assistance (ODA). As \npart of its commitment to doubling overall ODA by \n2009, this year my Government launched Korea\u2019s \nInitiative for Africa\u2019s Development. Under that \ninitiative, we will substantially increase our \ndevelopment assistance to Africa.  \n The key lessons to be drawn from the Korean \nexperience over the decades are that education is key to \ndevelopment, and that women and girls are the most \neffective agents for change and social progress. Gender \nmainstreaming must be made a central pillar of policy \nstrategy, in particular with regard to attaining the \nMDGs in such areas as eliminating poverty and \ncombating HIV/AIDS. Lasting social change cannot be \nrealized until women are fully incorporated into the \nprocess. \n The urgency, complexity and scope of the three \npillars of the work of the United Nations \u2014 peace and \nsecurity, development and human rights \u2014 demand the \nhighest standards of efficient, effective and \naccountable management. The highly decentralized \nnature of the United Nations system puts a premium on \ncoherence and coordination. We must streamline the \nUnited Nations machinery, reorganize priorities and \nminimize redundancy. The High-level Panel on United \nNations System-wide Coherence may offer some fresh \nideas in that regard. \n A number of valuable ideas for reforming United \nNations management practices were contained in the \nSecretary-General\u2019s report (A/60/692) entitled \n\u201cInvesting in the United Nations\u201d. Some of those \nproposals have already been adopted by the General \nAssembly, while others await further consideration \nduring this session.  \n \n \n27 06-53005 \n \n The Secretary-General\u2019s comments on the \nevolving nature of the human resource needs of the \nUnited Nations were especially apt in the light of the \naccelerating demands for field staff. The General \nAssembly should give positive consideration to steps to \nmake the Secretariat more mobile, integrated and \nmulti-skilled. The United Nations needs to be able to \ndeploy the best people where they are needed and when \nthey are needed, to ensure that managers have the \nrequisite expertise and experience to oversee highly \ndynamic and professional operations under often trying \nconditions.  \n Improving the accountability and oversight of the \nSecretariat while building upon the measures already \ntaken over the past year remains a priority. The early \nlaunch of an independent audit advisory committee that \nis genuinely independent and professional, along with \nsteps to ensure management accountability, would be \ninstrumental in that regard.  \n The United Nations procurement system requires \nstrengthened internal controls and transparent \nmanagement to match the growing dimensions of its \nwork.  \n As Member States and stakeholders in this vital \nOrganization, we should address mandate review as a \nhistoric opportunity to streamline, focus and strengthen \nour collective efforts. \n This unique world body was forged by men and \nwomen of conscience, courage and determination. \nTheir genius was to understand that we need the United \nNations not because we always agree but because \nfrequently we do not. The United Nations remains no \nmore and no less than what we make of it. The United \nNations journey is never easy, but it is always well \nworth taking. We have come a very long way, but the \nroad still stretches out endlessly before us. I have every \nconfidence that, with the founding principles and \npurposes as our guideposts, and empowered by \nrenewed faith and commitment, we can together go \nvery far and fast in the challenging and exciting times \nto come.

        "file_text": "I join other countries in \ncongratulating you, Madam, on your assumption of the \npresidency. We in Singapore pledge our full support to \nyou. \n The recent war in Lebanon had no clear victor. \nIsrael succeeded in removing the immediate threat \nacross the border, but could not wipe out Hizbollah. \nHizbollah claimed victory, having survived Israeli air \nbombardments and ground action, even though \nenormous damage was inflicted on Lebanon. On both \nsides, innocent people have suffered greatly. Whether \nthe present ceasefire can become a lasting peace \ndepends on many factors, not least the ability of the \nLebanese army and the United Nations Interim Force \nin Lebanon to maintain the buffer in southern Lebanon. \nBut one thing is clear: without the eventual \nintervention of the United Nations, the fighting would \nhave continued and more lives would have been lost. \n The Middle East is going through the throes of \nchange. In Palestine, there is no escaping a two-State \nsolution. However, defining the precise boundaries of \nthat solution is a grinding process which will take time. \nNo one can achieve all his demands; no party can insist \non absolute security. A new balance is being \nestablished between Sunnis and Shiites in Lebanon, \nIraq and elsewhere in the region. This will also take \ntime. In many countries, there is tension between those \nwho are impatient for change and those who believe \nthat discontinuity will lead to chaos and anarchy. As \nlong as there is more despair than hope, terrorist \norganizations will be able to find fresh recruits. What \nhappens in the Middle East affects the entire world. No \ncountry is insulated, and certainly not from the terrorist \nthreat or from high energy prices. \n No grand solution is possible. The end of the cold \nwar marked the end of an era when the major Powers \ncould settle the terms among themselves over the heads \nof lesser countries. It was not that long ago \u2014 but it \nseems so strange today \u2014 that a cold peace could have \nbeen maintained for decades by each side pointing tens \nof thousands of nuclear missiles at the other. \nTechnology has changed the rules. Warfare has now \nbecome asymmetric. Cruise missiles and submarines \ncannot solve the problem of suicide bombers. And \nthose who manipulate these terrorists might well take \npositions in global financial markets to benefit from \nthe havoc that they create. \n In a sense, technology has globalized the world \nand broken it into smaller pieces. Empires have broken \nup. New countries have been born. In large countries, \n  \n \n06-53323 24 \n \npower has devolved downwards and regions have \nbecome more assertive. It has become a messier world, \nwhich presents new challenges to global governance. \nImproving global governance from above sometimes \nseems like an impossible task. Take the reform of the \nUnited Nations, for example: despite all the efforts \nmade and the fine speeches delivered, the results have \nbeen quite modest.  \n The near-collapse of the Doha talks is another \nexample of how difficult it is to effect change from the \ntop down. When the General Agreement on Tariffs and \nTrade was formed in 1948, there were only 23 \nmembers. Today, the World Trade Organization has 149 \nmembers. No country or group of countries seems able \nor willing to take the lead in brokering a compromise. \nWe must hope that Director-General Pascal Lamy will \nsucceed in his heroic efforts to rescue the Doha \ndevelopment round from failure.  \n There are other areas in which global action is \nneeded, but is insufficient. All of us worry about global \nclimate change, but how can there be consensus when \nthe costs and benefits are distributed so unevenly and \nthe major polluters are unwilling to accept \nresponsibility? We hear dire warnings from the World \nHealth Organization about a global flu pandemic, yet \nour collective response is so feeble. \n While we should never give up hope on global \ninitiatives, we should be realistic, because achieving \nglobal consensus in a multipolar world is, to say the \nleast, challenging. When Governments have to win \nelections, they are more likely to respond to short-term \npolitical needs than to worry about long-term global \nconcerns. We can often do more at the regional level: \nat the regional level, the stakes are clearer to our \nconstituencies and the need for action is easier to \nexplain. The Charter recognizes the role that regional \narrangements can play in helping the United Nations to \nachieve its objectives. \n In a globalized world with porous borders, \nregional cooperation can often bring quick benefits. We \nneed only consider, for example, the simple act of \nreopening, three months ago, after 44 years, the Nathu \nLa pass in the Himalayas between China and India. \nImmediately, on both sides of the pass, ordinary people \nbenefited from trade and travel. New problems will \narise, of course, but they can be managed. \n All over the world now, regional initiatives are \nproliferating. Many overlap. Some are modest in their \nobjectives, providing forums for public and private \nsector leaders to meet and consult. Others are more \nambitious, creating regional free-trade areas or \nfostering joint efforts against problems like drug \ntrafficking and terrorism. Many of these regional \ninitiatives are open and inclusive, and should be \nencouraged. Those which are superfluous will \ngradually wither away. Some can make significant \ncontributions to global governance and reduce the \nburdens borne by the big Powers. International \norganizations like the United Nations, the World Trade \nOrganization, the World Health Organization, the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency and the United \nNations Environment Programme should work with \nthem, strengthen their capabilities and encourage \nmutual learning. These initiatives create a habit of \ncooperation among neighbouring countries and reduce \nmisunderstanding. \n In Asia, the role of the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN) has not only been beneficial \nto the 10 countries of South-East Asia; it has also \nhelped to create a larger architecture of cooperation. \nFounded 39 years ago, in 1967, when the war in Indo-\nChina was raging, ASEAN began as a grouping to \npromote what then-President Suharto of Indonesia \ncalled \u201cregional resilience\u201d. The original five non-\ncommunist countries of ASEAN \u2014 Indonesia, \nMalaysia, Thailand, the Philippines and Singapore \u2014 \nwere determined to keep the peace among ourselves \nand concentrate on economic development. Brunei \nDarussalam joined ASEAN in 1984 after it became \nindependent. With the end of the cold war, peace \nreturned to Indochina and ASEAN gradually expanded \nto include the newer member States of Viet Nam, \nCambodia, Laos and Myanmar, to become what it is \ntoday: a community of 10. \n In 1992, the countries of ASEAN decided to \nestablish a free trade area in stages. For trade in goods, \nwe have largely attained our objectives. For investment \nand services, we still have some way to go. But there is \nconsiderable political will to press on and make the \nwhole of ASEAN one economic space. Already, \nASEAN as a grouping plays a major role in \ninternational trade, accounting for some 6 per cent of \ntotal world trade. \n The re-emergence of China and India as major \nPowers presents us with opportunities as well as \nchallenges. ASEAN\u2019s trade with both is growing \nrapidly. But they are also a competitive challenge to us.  \n \n \n25 06-53323 \n \n When the leaders of ASEAN met in Bali three \nyears ago, they took a major decision: to establish an \nASEAN Community by 2020 with three main pillars \u2014 \nsecurity, economic cooperation and cultural \ncooperation. To create such a community, an ASEAN \ncharter will be drawn up next year to provide the legal \nbasis for our future integration. It will include \nprovisions for dispute settlement by independent \npanels. \n The European Union is an inspiration to us in \nASEAN. Two months ago, the European Commission \nhosted members of an ASEAN eminent persons group \nand generously offered advice and assistance. While \nASEAN integration will never be as deep or as broad \nas that of the European Union, there is much that we \ncan learn from the European experience. \n For ASEAN to prosper, it is important that we \nmaintain good relations with all the major Powers. For \nmany years now, ASEAN has promoted good relations \nwith our dialogue partners, including the United States, \nthe European Union, Russia, China, Japan and India. \nWith strong growth in global trade, ASEAN has \nnegotiated or is in the process of negotiating free trade \nagreements with China, India, Japan, Korea, Australia \nand New Zealand, and closer economic partnerships \nwith the United States and the European Union. We \nhave a simple strategy, which is to give all of them a \nstrong stake in our unity and in our development. \nStrategically, some of the most important sea lanes \npass through ASEAN waters. About a third of global \ntrade, half of global oil trade and 80 per cent of the oil \nbound for China and Japan pass through the straits of \nMalacca and Singapore. \n Through the ASEAN-plus groupings and the East \nAsia Summit, which includes China, Japan, Korea, \nIndia, Australia and New Zealand, we are creating a \nnew architecture of peaceful cooperative development \nin the larger Asia. ASEAN is not big enough to be a \nmajor global player, but ASEAN plays a significant \nrole in holding Asia together and keeping it open to the \nrest of the world. Whatever we do in Asia must not \ncause the United States, the European Union or Russia \nto think that we are excluding them. \n ASEAN is a work in progress. Like other regions \nin the world, we face many problems, related to \neconomic development, separatist movements, \nterrorism, drug trafficking, environmental degradation, \nmaritime security, ethnic and religious divisions and \navian flu, among other issues. However, what each of \nus in ASEAN has come to appreciate is that, without \nASEAN, each of these problems is much harder to \nsolve, and that ASEAN alone cannot solve any of \nthem: we have to be united and work with other \ncountries and with international organizations. We are \ngrateful for their assistance, their partnership and their \ncooperation. \n Madam President, ASEAN strongly supports you \nand the United Nations. We will work with you to \nimprove the workings of the United Nations and to \nmake it more effective. In this regard, ASEAN \ncontinues to endorse the candidature of Mr. Surakiart \nSathirathai as the next Secretary-General despite the \nrecent coup in Thailand. Although the coup was a \nsetback to both Thailand and ASEAN, Thai society has \na deep resilience which will enable it to recover \nquickly. ASEAN will always be on the side of the Thai \npeople.  \n If every region in the world, working with the \nUnited Nations, can help to stabilize its own immediate \nenvironment and promote favourable conditions for \ndevelopment, the prospects for global peace will be \nenhanced. What the nations of Africa have been able to \ndo despite adverse circumstances is impressive. The \nwillingness of individual African countries to agree on \ncommon positions is unique to that continent and is an \ninspiration to the rest of us.  \n The United Nations is already stretched and can \nonly do so much. Instead, let us, in each of our regions, \ndo our part and work with the United Nations and its \norganizations in a complementary way. In order to stop \nthe killing Darfur, for example, we need close \ncooperation between the United Nations and African \ncountries. \n Wherever possible, regional organizations should \nbe strengthened. The United Nations and other \ninternational organizations can play a facilitating role, \nprovide resources and advice, set standards and \nestablish benchmarks. Even in the Middle East, where \nthe work often seems hardest, regional cooperation can \nhelp create a better environment for peace and \ndevelopment. For example, the reconstruction of Iraq \nwill be much more difficult, if not impossible, without \nthe goodwill of its neighbours. \n With over 500 million people, ASEAN has 8 per \ncent of the world\u2019s population. Our share of global \ngross domestic product is much lower, at 2 per cent. \n  \n \n06-53323 26 \n \nBut within the limits of our modest capabilities, we in \nASEAN will do our part to contribute to the good work \nof the United Nations in making this a better world, not \nadding to its problems.

        "file_text": "First, Madam, I should like to congratulate you on your \nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-first session. Your election is proof of the high \nesteem in which the international community holds \nyour country, Bahrain, and also yourself, whose wealth \nof diplomatic experience will help us find the right \nsolutions to the problems facing this session of the \nAssembly. I would also ask you kindly to convey my \ndelegation\u2019s congratulations to the other members of \nthe Bureau. You may count on my delegation\u2019s \n  \n \n06-53952 12 \n \nunremitting willingness and desire to work with you \nfor the success of this session. Allow me also to \nexpress to your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Jan \nEliasson of Sweden, the Ivorian delegation\u2019s gratitude \nfor his intensive activities during his presidency and \nfor the quality of the work he accomplished. \n I would also like to pay well-deserved tribute to \nSecretary-General Kofi Annan and to reiterate my \ncountry\u2019s appreciation for the skill with which he has \ndischarged his mission at the head of our Organization. \nAs he prepares to leave his office, I would like to say \nhow proud my country, a neighbour of Ghana, his \nmotherland, is for the distinguished way he has guided \nthe United Nations over the past 10 years. I would like \nto express to him once again the sincere gratitude of \nthe people and the Government of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire for his \npersonal commitment to advancing the process of \npeace and reconciliation in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. \n We welcome the Republic of Montenegro, which \nhas just joined the great family of the United Nations; I \npledge C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\u2019s readiness to cooperate with it. \n As the General Assembly marked the sixtieth \nanniversary of the United Nations, we all expressed our \nambition to reform the Organization. We raised the bar \nvery high for our objectives in the main areas of United \nNations activity, namely international peace and \nsecurity, development and human rights. We decided, \namong other things, to create a new mechanism to \nrestore and consolidate peace in countries devastated \nby conflict and war, to adopt strategies to combat \npoverty and disease and to act collectively to prevent \ngenocide and promote human rights. At the sixtieth \nsession, which recently came to an end, we were able \nto achieve significant progress while seeking to \novercome existing differences. \n Further tangible progress has been made since \nthen in many areas, such as counter-terrorism, human \nrights, democracy, peacekeeping, humanitarian \nintervention and management reform in order to make \nthe Secretariat more effective and accountable. \n With regard to the strengthening of the human \nrights machinery, for example, I should like to \nwelcome our joint commitment to help the Office of \nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Human \nRights to strengthen its services and to double its \nworking budget. The creation of the Human Rights \nCouncil, which began its work in Geneva on 19 June \n2006, to replace the Commission on Human Rights is \nanother sign of our common awareness that we need to \nset the question of the respect and promotion of human \nrights among our priorities. We now have a Human \nRights Council, which must work with determination \nand a sense of responsibility, so as to regain respect \nand obtain the results expected by all. \n As for terrorism, on whose definition everyone \nhas yet to agree, my delegation welcomes the existence \nwithin our Organization of a structure to coordinate the \nfight against terrorism in all its forms and \nmanifestations, committed by whomever, wherever and \nfor whatever purposes. \n Another source of satisfaction is the creation of \nthe Peacebuilding Commission, which is aimed at \ngiving assistance to countries emerging from armed \nconflict. In this respect, and in the context of creating \nthe solidarity that should exist within our Organization, \nthe United Nations and the international community \nmust continue their efforts to bring lasting peace in \npost-conflict periods in countries emerging from war. \nThey must be involved financially in this process not \nonly to consolidate this peace but also and above all to \ncontribute to the economic recovery and sustainable \ndevelopment of those countries. \n In his important \u2014 and final \u2014 report on the \nwork of the Organization (A/61/1), introduced to the \nAssembly on 19 September 2006 (see ), \nSecretary-General Kofi Annan advocates a United \nNations that is able to find solutions in this divided \nworld so that people can fulfil their common destiny. \nIn explaining his thinking, he said that we now face a \nworld whose divisions threaten the very notion of an \ninternational community whereas most of the \nchallenges require a global response. My delegation \nfully shares this affirmation of the Secretary-General. \nFinding a global, indeed comprehensive, response to \nall the world\u2019s problems in all areas, particularly those \nof international peace and security, sustainable \ndevelopment and fundamental human rights, are the \nreal objectives of this Organization. \n More than half a century after the creation of our \nOrganization, increasingly serious and complex \nproblems continue to arise in the world. We have seen \nserious violations of international law and a repeated \nuse of force at the expense of dialogue. We can add to \nthis poverty, illiteracy, hunger, pandemics, local \nconflicts and terrorism, not forgetting natural disasters. \nIn addition to these challenges, increasing \n \n \n13 06-53952 \n \nglobalization imposes demands and responsibilities \nthat are increasingly burdensome for the international \ncommunity. We are living in a world where the media \ncan come into our homes and make us more aware of \nthe suffering of others. This forces the world\u2019s \ndecision-makers to display more justice and equity.  \n The events of the past few years \u2014 particularly \nthe most recent events in the Middle East \u2014 seem once \nagain to call into question the commitment set out in \nthe Millennium Declaration to share responsibilities, in \nthe context of the multilateralism represented by the \nUnited Nations, in order to address the threats to \ninternational peace and security. Those events seem to \nhave caused deep divisions within the international \ncommunity and have raised new questions about the \neffectiveness of United Nations action and the \nprinciples that guided its establishment. \n It is thus urgent that the General Assembly begin \nto have in-depth discussions about the future of \nmultilateralism. Indeed, my delegation believes that the \nconcept of multilateralism should reflect a broad \nconsensus regarding the means to prevent major threats \nto international peace and security and responses that \nmust be made to those threats.  \n The legitimacy of the United Nations is the \nOrganization\u2019s main asset. Therefore, that legitimacy \nmust be reinforced by the confidence of States and of \ninternational public opinion in the capacity of the \nUnited Nations to resolve international problems \nthrough agreed action.  \n There are positive examples in this area \nillustrating that assertion. Indeed, following the attacks \nof 11 September 2001, the United Nations \ndemonstrated that it could act swiftly by establishing a \ncollective mechanism to combat terrorism. In the area \nof peacekeeping and peacebuilding, we have also seen \nthat the Organization could carry out complex \nmandates and tackle the difficult task of stabilizing a \nconflict situation and assisting countries in transition \ntowards peace and democracy. Pertinent examples can \nbe cited in that regard: Timor-Leste at the time of its \nindependence, Kosovo, Sierra Leone and Liberia.  \n Those examples demonstrate that authorization to \ndeploy multinational forces is proving to be the \nappropriate tool for calming down \u2014 if not \nextinguishing \u2014 hotbeds of tension. In that connection, \nmy delegation is grateful to the countries and \norganizations that have headed such forces. We remain \naware of their acts of solidarity, and we welcome their \ninterest in maintaining peace throughout the world. \n With regard to weapons of mass destruction and \nsmall arms and light weapons, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire agrees \nthat there is a need to strengthen and complete existing \ninternational legislation. I believe that the United \nNations must broaden its action in this area and adopt \nthe measures necessary to prevent the proliferation of \nthese weapons. It must also take unequivocal measures \nspelling out the consequences for any State that does \nnot respect such legislation. \n Another new challenge with global consequences \nthreatens our existence: the phenomenon of terrorism. \nIndeed, no one is safe from terrorist attacks. As \nstressed by the Secretary-General in his report on the \nwork of the Organization during the fifty-eighth \nsession (A/58/1), terrorism continues to pose a major \nthreat to international peace and security. It must thus \nbe combated everywhere and tirelessly. While \nuniversal condemnation of terrorism must remain \nstrong and unwavering, the fight against it must be \ncarried out within the framework of strict respect for \nhuman rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of \nlaw.  \n Returning to the subject of conflict prevention, \nmy delegation would like to commend the work begun \nby the United Nations through its adoption of \nresolution 57/337, which is aimed at integrating that \nissue into its areas of action and invites States and \nregions to adopt conflict prevention strategies. Specific \nactivities to establish a structural culture of conflict \nprevention at the national, regional and international \nlevels must be carried out and strengthened. \n Moreover, my delegation believes that additional \nresources should be devoted to conflict prevention \nprogrammes and projects. A mechanism for \nstrengthening international cooperation in this area \nshould be established in countries at risk. Indeed, \nhistory teaches us that disagreements \u2014 even \nseemingly insignificant ones \u2014 can lead to difficult-to-\nmanage conflicts if they are not contained in time. \nThus, it is important that the Organization\u2019s \ninterventions be preventive in order to avoid the \ndramatic and tragic consequences of such conflicts. \nThat is in the interests of everyone, and in the interest \nof the Organization\u2019s credibility. \n Henceforth, it should be a major United Nations \npriority to establish a policy of conflict prevention by \n  \n \n06-53952 14 \n \nstrengthening international dialogue and creating \nappropriate mechanisms for conflict settlement. \nConstant monitoring of international commitments \nshould be a part of this new vision of peaceful \ncoexistence and international harmony. \n C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire has always supported the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s United Nations reform programme. We \nwelcome the major progress already made with a view \nto making the Organization more active and more \neffective. The resolve shown by the Secretary-General \nin that regard must also be demonstrated by all \nMember States. \n The current composition of the Security Council, \nin both quantitative and qualitative terms, remains a \nprisoner of the past and does not reflect the \ngeopolitical realities of the twenty-first century. \nDeveloping countries \u2014 and Africa in particular \u2014 \nhave not yet found their place on the Council. \nTherefore, so long as this issue remains unresolved, the \nCouncil\u2019s decisions will continue to be perceived as \nreflecting mainly the interests of the countries \nbenefiting from its current composition. Member \nStates \u2014 particularly the Council\u2019s five permanent \nmembers \u2014 must display a spirit of initiative and \nopenness with regard to this issue, which has been on \nthe United Nations agenda for more than a decade. \n The comprehensive implementation of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) remains a \nfundamental United Nations priority. My delegation is \nparticularly concerned by the current trends, which \nindicate that many developing countries are falling \nbehind and that, at the current rate, those countries will \nnot be able to attain the Goals without assistance.  \n Accomplishing the MDGs requires partnership \nand cooperation among all the countries of the world. \nIn that connection, my delegation would like to urge \nthe international community to provide the necessary \nsupport to developing countries, particularly the least \ndeveloped and most heavily indebted countries. A \nsufficient amount of official development assistance \nand foreign direct investment would likely enable such \ncountries to take their place in the process of socio-\neconomic development. \n Therefore, my delegation would like to \ncongratulate the Secretary-General on his efforts to \nundertake reforms to make our institution fully address \nthe important task of achieving the MDGs. The socio-\neconomic survival of developing countries is at stake. \nMy delegation thus encourages the United Nations \nsystem to continue to support the Governments of these \nStates in their resolve to integrate the Goals into \nnational and regional development programmes and \nstrategies. In Africa, for example, the New Partnership \nfor Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD) would be an ideal \nframework for the achievement of these goals. This is \nwhy NEPAD should be implemented and why our \ndevelopment partners\u2019 promises should be fulfilled \nwithin the agreed deadline.  \n C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire also welcomes the determined \ncommitment of the Secretary-General to place the \nOrganization at the service of its Members. Reforms \nnow under way could very much help to place the \nOrganization in the forefront of the fight to eliminate \npoverty and eradicate HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis \nand many other pandemics. This is why my delegation \nwelcomes the launching of the International Drug \nPurchase Facility (UNITAID) on 19 September 2006, \nhere during the current Assembly and in the presence \nof the Secretary-General. This initiative by France, \nwhich has been supported by other countries, such as \nBrazil, Chile, the United Kingdom and Norway, will \ngive the poorest people access to drugs of known \nquality, including generic drugs, at the lowest prices \nand also to the means of diagnosing AIDS, tuberculosis \nand malaria. I am delighted that my country, C\u00f4te \nd\u2019Ivoire, was one of the first four to establish a tax on \nair tickets to help finance the abovementioned fund.  \n At this stage in my statement, allow me to briefly \nmention the socio-political situation in my country, \nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. Indeed, since the formation of the \nGovernment of Prime Minister Charles Konan Banny \non 28 December 2005, following the adoption of \nSecurity Council resolution 1633 (2005) on 21 October \n2005, the peace and reconciliation process in C\u00f4te \nd\u2019Ivoire has seen \u2014 thanks to the actions of the \nGovernment, the main parties involved in the conflict \nand the Ivorian people as a whole \u2014 brought tangible \nprogress in the implementation of the Government\u2019s \nroad map. \n While significant progress has been achieved, \nmuch still remains to be done. In this respect, my \ndelegation welcomes the invaluable assistance that the \nUnited Nations, the African Union, the Economic \nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS), the \nEuropean Union and friendly countries have all given \nto C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. My delegation invites them all to \ncontinue to give their support to the Government and \n \n \n15 06-53952 \n \npeople of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire in their search for a definitive \nway out of this crisis, which is unprecedented in the \nhistory of my country.  \n The future of the West African region and \nbeyond \u2014 that of Africa as a whole \u2014 is at stake. We \nremain fully confident both in the United Nations and \nin the international community.  \n The legitimacy and credibility of our \nOrganization, now sixty-one years old, remains intact, \nand its actions for the advancement of well-being and \nfor better living standards on this planet all continue to \nbe irreplaceable. The new challenges that the \nOrganization faces, with the help of a multilateral \nperspective and a sense of an increased and clearly \nunderstood collective responsibility, should strengthen \nits effectiveness. Essential reforms, which it should \nembark upon in order to adapt to the new context of \ninternational relations, should enable it to respond \nmore swiftly and effectively to the legitimate \naspirations of its constituent peoples, who continue to \nhave complete trust in it.  \n In sum, the United Nations remains useful, even \ntoday. It could be even stronger tomorrow, if we wish \nit.  "

        "file_text": "It is my privilege to \naddress this forum and share with it the views of the \nRepublic of Macedonia on the issues of primary \nimportance on this year\u2019s agenda of the General \nAssembly and of the international community at large. \n Terrorism is not a new world issue, but it has \nunfortunately become our tragic daily reality, thus \nrapidly gaining new and more devastating dimensions \nin the increasingly globalized world. We are all \naffected in one way or another \u2014 whether we speak \nabout actual terrorist attacks or threats. \n The real question, however, is: can we or should \nwe, the nations of the world, continue to live in that \nkind of atmosphere, to live in fear, threatened? It \nwould be a failure of humanity, of free spirit and \ndemocracy, of prosperity and mankind, and finally, if I \nmay say so, a failure of all of us here at the United \nNations. Recently we adopted the United Nations \nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy. I believe it was \nhigh time that we adopted a unified position and \nstrategy, that all of us gave a strong international \nresponse. Comprehensive international cooperation and \ncoordination against this evil is equally important to \nactivities at the national and regional level. We need to \nhave results; the sooner, the better. \n Outside this building, when the United Nations is \nmentioned, for many peoples, even nations, it means \nhope and help; it means peace; and it means cure. It \nmeans also freedom, democracy and safety \u2014 it means \nlife. So the United Nations should not be shy to \nrespond, to act and to resolve when it is asked. The \nUnited Nations has to react. Only by resolving \nproblems do we make progress. We have to follow and \nreact to the changes and to the new challenges that are \nincoming. \n The overall reform of the United Nations, \nincluding better management, must be an ongoing \neffort. There are still issues from the World Summit \nFinal Document yet to be delivered, such as mandate \nreview and Security Council reform, to name only \nsome. Hopefully, there will be enough understanding \nand progress achieved on them too. \n Last month we had yet another reminder of how \nfragile world peace actually is. The Middle East again \nerupted. We have witnessed how difficult it is to \nrestore peace, to hold a ceasefire and to send United \nNations peacekeepers there. Macedonia welcomed the \nunanimous adoption of Security Council resolution \n1701 (2006) of 11 August. Macedonia supports the \nefforts of the United Nations and the international \ncommunity to provide timely humanitarian assistance \nto those affected and for the reconstruction of Lebanon. \n  \n \n06-52988 14 \n \nThe United Nations must fight to make a lasting \npeaceful solution for the Middle East. \n From the very beginning the Republic of \nMacedonia has been part of the international \nantiterrorist coalitions in Iraq and Afghanistan, and it \nhas recently increased its contingents as part of the \ninternational forces. Peace- and democracy-building in \nthose two countries remains one of the key challenges \nfor the international community and the Iraqis and \nAfghans themselves. I again reiterate Macedonia\u2019s \nsupport for their efforts to rebuild those countries and \ncreate a better life for their people. \n Last year at the Summit we reaffirmed our \ncommitment to the global partnership for development, \nas set out in the Millennium Declaration, the \nMonterrey Consensus and the Johannesburg Plan of \nImplementation. It is beyond doubt that every country \nhas a principal responsibility for its own development. \nHowever, it is more than obvious that national \ndevelopment efforts must be supported by global \nactions. The contribution of the private sector and civil \nsociety may play a critical role in our common \nendeavour. \n In addition to human rights standard setting, the \nUnited Nations, since the adoption of the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights, has been a guardian of \nhuman rights. We trust that the recently established \nHuman Rights Council will give a new impetus in this \narea. We hope that the Commission\u2019s weaknesses will \nbe overcome, but we have to be aware that this requires \na strong political commitment on the part of the \nmembership. Guided by the wish to contribute to the \nwork of this important body, we have announced our \ncandidacy for membership for the 2009-2012 period. \n Today Macedonia is a stable and functional \nmulti-ethnic democracy. Over recent years we have \nlaunched and carried out a large number of reform \nprojects, which have brought us closer to the European \nUnion and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n(NATO) alliance. In December last year Macedonia \nwas granted candidate status for European Union \nmembership. Macedonia rightfully expects that the \npace of the needed reforms the country is committed to \nwill lead to an opening of the negotiations on joining \nthe European Union. As for NATO, we expect the \ninvitation to join it at the next enlargement summit. \n The region of south-eastern Europe to which my \ncountry belongs has experienced significant changes in \nthe recent past and made considerable democratic \nprogress: the start of European Union accession \nnegotiations of Croatia and Turkey; Macedonia \nbecoming a candidate country for membership in the \nEuropean Union; the signing of the Stabilization and \nAssociation Agreement with Albania; and the opening \nof the negotiations for the same agreement with Serbia, \nBosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, the newly \nindependent State. Furthermore, Romania and Bulgaria \nare expected to become full European Union members \nin a few months. \n Good-neighbourly relations and regional \ncooperation have been and are among the top priorities \nof Macedonia\u2019s foreign policy. We will continue to \npursue such a policy even more vigorously. There is no \nalternative to dialogue, and all outstanding regional \nissues should be resolved in that manner. This year the \nMacedonian delegation will once again introduce in the \nFirst Committee a resolution entitled \u201cMaintenance of \ninternational security \u2014 good-neighbourliness, \nstability and development in South-Eastern Europe,\u201d \nwhich is traditionally widely supported and co-\nsponsored by Member States. \n I should like to say a few words about the Kosovo \nissue and Kosovo\u2019s future status. Macedonia fully \nsupports the work of the Secretary-General\u2019s Special \nEnvoy, Martti Ahtisaari, and his team on the Kosovo \nstatus talks. I stress that every effort should be made to \nachieve a negotiated settlement mutually acceptable to \nthe parties concerned, in line with Security Council \nresolution 1244 (1999) and the Contact Group guiding \nprinciples. The Republic of Macedonia, with its active \ngood-neighbourly policy, has been a factor that has \nlargely contributed, and continues to contribute, to the \nfinal, overall stabilization and positive developments in \nthe region. \n Yet there is one important, still pending, issue in \nthis context for the Republic of Macedonia: that of the \ntechnical demarcation of our northern border on the \nKosovo section, in line with the agreement between the \nRepublic of Macedonia and the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia, signed in February 2001, and the \nrecommendations made by the then Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s Special Envoy, Kai Eide. We urge that this \nissue be closed in that manner before the final Kosovo \nstatus decision is reached. \n \n \n15 06-52988 \n \n I am confident that our deliberations will \ncontribute to creating a better world for all. Although \nthe debates at times show how different we are, our \ndifferences must not be an obstacle to our common \nvision. The personification of the hope of mankind for \na better tomorrow remains with the United Nations. "

        "file_text": "I \nfeel very honoured to be the emissary of the Honduran \npeople, who send to all at this General Assembly \nbrotherly, warm and effusive greetings on the occasion \nof the sixty-first session of the Assembly. \n We come here today before the representatives of \nthe nations of the world to merge the larger part of our \ndreams and hopes in order, together, to achieve the \ngreatest goals for world peace. Our high aspirations, \nalong with the worthiness of the members of the \nAssembly, are part of humanity\u2019s common purpose of \nattaining international law and justice. \n But we also have to recognize that there are \nthings that are difficult to understand in an \nenvironment that is supposed to be conducive to peace \nand development: the contrast we see among different \nlatitudes of the Earth; the immense needs of peoples; \nthe contrast of poverty; drums of war that resound \neverywhere; nuclear threats; cruel situations for nations \nand peoples. \n Rather than narrowing, social divides have grown \nwider in recent decades. Morality is not being \ncombined with economy or science. Morality is \nmoving away from the principles and values of a just \nand true God. That is why our presence in this \nimportant Assembly is needed to focus clearly on the \nfact that humanity needs to seek its objectives \naccording to healthy principles that will dignify our \npeoples. \n When the last half of the twentieth century came \nto an end, we sincerely believed that we had put an end \nto political, ideological and religious tyrannies. But \ntoday we see them cropping up again, together with the \ntyrannies of trade, which are often more cruel than the \nothers. Today, they want to sell us a free-market policy, \nbut ultimately that is a ruthless, insensitive economic \npolicy that is protectionist for many sectors. Instead of \nopening the door to a social approach to the market, \nwhere freedom is for people, we only have freedom for \ninvestment, and we forget about individuals and \ncitizens and the rights of women and children, the most \nvulnerable groups who, although lacking in power, \nyearn for a better life. \n  \n \n06-52737 16 \n \n Certainly, we need to have protection, but not just \nprotection for investments and big capital. We also \nneed protection for the vulnerable of the world: for \nchildren and young people, for farmers who sow their \nsmall plots; for those businesspeople who cannot get a \nfoothold on the ladder of international trade; for the \nowners of microenterprises who are reaching out in \nsearch for the well-being and dignity they deserve. \n All of us, of course, want a free market, but an \nethical one. We want to live in a globalized world \u2014 \nbut one in which respect for identity, patriotism and the \ndignity and sovereignty of peoples are also global. So \nwe are here to denounce hypocrisy, double-talk and \nmoral double standards on the part of those who \nproclaim and promote a solution to our problems \nthrough democracy and free trade, but who seize and \nhold hostage the concepts of internal and external \nspaces and promote a system of privileges, oligopolies \nand monopolies, half-truths and flawed markets that \nthey hold captive. They are insensitive to the demands \nof the majority, very often tortured by hunger, \nunemployment, indifference and exclusion. \n We have come to this Assembly to wish everyone \nthe best, but also to point the finger at those who \npreach false free trade that only deepens poverty and \nseek to seduce us with the erratic mirage of remittances \nthat we so easily accept but which in fact are the fruit \nof a labour force that we have exported; the result of \nthe cruel fate of our emigrants; the inexorable and evil \ntragedy of people caught between freedom, \nmarginalization and slavery. \n My Government and the people of Honduras \ncondemn the monopolistic controls, the privileges and \nthe absurd exceptions that prevent us from building \ntrue freedom with democracy and market access, the \nparadigm that we all want to move towards without the \nprotectionism we all condemn. \n The Governments of the world must be led by \nmen and women who long for peace and not by \nmultinational corporations that promote war. Here, \ncivil society organizations could play a major role in \ncorrecting this situation and denouncing it. \n I represent Honduras, a country of the Isthmus of \nCentral America, and, like our Central American \nbrothers and sisters, we continue to face the \ninnumerable paradoxes that arise between civilization \nand barbarism. We have been the historical theatre of \nabsurd wars, ambitions and sterile battles, very often \nexported, and the horrors of death and pillage. Yet the \npeoples of Central America are in the vanguard of \nthose looking for joint solutions. We have the creative \ncapacity that keeps us from losing faith or hope in a \nbetter world. \n America has been inspired throughout history by \ngreat men and women of renown. Here in North \nAmerica, Lincoln was a splendid guide for democracy. \nIn the South, it was Sucre, San Mart\u00edn and Bol\u00edvar; \nJos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed in the Caribbean; Villa and Zapata in \nMexico. And in Central America, we have Jerez, Mora, \nValle, Dar\u00edo, Turcios, Omar Torrijos and the pro-union \nmartyr Francisco Moraz\u00e1n, among others. The Chilean \npoet, Pablo Neruda, Nobel laureate for literature, said \nit well: \n \u201cDeep in the night Moraz\u00e1n is watchful. \n Is it today? Yesterday? Tomorrow? You know the \nanswer, \n Central ribbon, slender America, \n ... \n Raised up on emerald sea-feathers: \n Territory, unity, slim goddess \n Born in the water-foam battle. \n They destroy your sons, and worms \n Spread their pestilence over you. \n ... \n Now comes the axe-brandishing tiger. \n They come to devour your entrails. \n They come, fragrant little America, \n To nail you to the cross, to flay you, \n To cast down the metal blazoned on your banner. \n Invaders fill your dwelling-place \n And toss you aside like lifeless fruit, \n ... \n And others plunder your ports ... \n Is it today? Yesterday? Tomorrow? You know the \nanswer. \n Brothers, awaken. And Moraz\u00e1n is watchful.\u201d \n We, the Central American peoples, stand tall, \nready to take the opportunities offered by development \nand genuine free trade, seeking our common destiny, \nseeking it today \u2014 which is not the end of history, but \nthe beginning of a new era for humanity, if we shoulder \nour responsibility and commitment. We have not lost \nour desire for liberty or our longing for hope. We \ncontinue to fight for food security, for energy \nindependence, for the social morality that we all \n \n \n17 06-52737 \n \ndeserve and for an economy that is at the service of \nmarkets, yes, but also at the service of people. We form \na common front against poverty and against the \ncorruption which today is invading our culture at many \nlevels. Unless we overcome this, we cannot win \ngenuine sovereignty. \n Central America opens itself to the world so that \nthe world can open itself to Central America. We are \nprepared for investment in tourism and in various areas \nof our economy and society. We are ready in Central \nAmerica \u2014 El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa \nRica, Panama, Belize and now the Dominican \nRepublic. We represent this central waistband of \nAmerica, this bridge of trade and markets \u2014 a bridge \nto a free world, a better world. \n Time limitations prevent me from addressing all \nthe other important topics. Allow me to conclude this \nbrief statement by expressing wishes for true peace and \nopportunity for everyone, in the conviction that the \npeoples of the world can exist only when in the heart of \nman there is fear of the wisdom of God. \n Let us all say yes to the loving God, to that God \nthat considers man a brother to man and not an enemy \nof man \u2014 to that God of non-violence. That is the God \nwe hymn and glorify, and we in Central America and \nHonduras join together in a song of hope: \n \u201cIs it today? Yesterday? Tomorrow? You know \nthe answer. \n Brothers, awaken. And Moraz\u00e1n is watchful.\u201d "

        "file_text": "Everything has been said; \neverything has been noted. But while it may be true \nthat many boats will rise with the tide, others are \nbound to sink unless goodwill prevails in this house. \nTuvalu wishes to add its voice of solidarity to the work \nof the United Nations and to what has been a highly \nenlightening debate. \n First, we join wholeheartedly in the high \ncommendations already expressed with regard to the \nelection of Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed \nAl-Khalifa as President of the General Assembly and \nher Bureau, and the sterling efforts of the outgoing \nPresident. Ms. Al-Khalifa and her Bureau have our full \ncooperation. We also wish to join others before us in \npaying tribute to the work of the Secretary-General, \nMr. Kofi Annan. His initiatives on development, \nsecurity and human rights have taken the United \nNations ever closer to all peoples and have made the \nOrganization accessible even to small island States \nsuch as Tuvalu. In appreciation, we wish him well and \nall the best in the future. \n For my small island nation, joining the United \nNations at the dawn of the new century is an \nexpression of hope. Our hope is that, through the noble \nideals and principles of this great body, Tuvalu, despite \nits physical remoteness and insignificance, will be \nallowed to paddle its canoe in harmony along with \nsuper-tankers and to share the common future of a \nworld of larger freedom: a world in which every State, \nregardless of its size, is recognized in terms of its \nsovereignty, its independence and the human rights of \nits people. \n We continue to hold fast to that hope. But, in the \npresent world of interdependence, where great \nopportunities are accompanied by great challenges, the \nneed for collective action and multilateral cooperation \nhas never been so pressing and urgent. Victory over \nthose challenges can be won not through political \nfragmentation, finger-pointing and confrontation, but \nthrough cooperation. \n The showdown of words engaged in by some \ncountries in this Chamber is unfortunate. We must \n  \n \n06-53958 10 \n \nnever forget that along with wealth and power comes \nresponsibility towards others. The risk is high that this \nHouse of humanity will fall apart for lack of \nresponsibility and leadership. There is a call for \neveryone to consistently display the highest degree of \nmorality, solidarity and respect for one other\u2019s values \nand concerns. Otherwise, the ideals of the United \nNations cannot be served. As a small, peace-loving \nnation, Tuvalu strongly believes that engaging in open \ndialogue and working together in a spirit of mutual \nunderstanding within United Nations frameworks is the \nonly way to reach our shared destiny in diversity and \nwith respect for one another. \n Tuvalu takes pride in having been part of the \nUnited Nations during the negotiations on its reform \nand development agenda. The adoption and \nestablishment of the Human Rights Council and the \nPeacebuilding Commission and of major innovations in \nthe Secretariat show the benefit of working together. \nThose bodies must be supported to ensure peace and \nthe protection of the human rights of all peoples and \ncommunities. But our work will remain unfinished \nuntil we make the Security Council and its operational \nmethodologies truly representative of the United \nNations membership. To that end, we support the draft \nresolution of the Group of Four countries on expansion \nof the Security Council. \n The President returned to the Chair. \n Development, security and human rights are the \ncardinal purposes of the United Nations. The fulfilment \nof those purposes demands that we shoulder our \ncollective responsibility and engage in united action. \nThe successful conclusion of the World Summit last \nyear was a reaffirmation of our resolve to fight poverty \nand ensure sustainable development through the \ninternationally agreed Millennium Development Goals, \nthe Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and the \nMauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of \nthe Programme of Action for the Sustainable \nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States. \n But devising plans without having access to \nadequate resources is akin to presenting a menu to \nhungry people: it may be mouth-watering, but without \nthe necessary ingredients, the dishes it describes will \nremain unattainable. It is essential that we fully \nimplement the Mauritius Strategy by integrating it into \nthe work programmes of the Commission on \nSustainable Development, United Nations agencies, \nconventions \u2014 especially the Rio Conventions \u2014 and \nbilateral cooperation partners. Additionally, the \nstrengthening of the coordination capacity of the \nDepartment of Social and Economic Affairs with \nadequate resources in those areas is imperative. \n Two weeks ago, in this very Hall, the General \nAssembly undertook the midterm review of the \nBrussels Programme of Action for the Least Developed \nCountries. We, as both a least developed country and a \nsmall island developing State, are grateful to the High \nRepresentative for the Least Developed Countries, \nLandlocked Developing Countries and Small Island \nDeveloping States for his dedicated work, and to the \ndevelopment partners for the support Tuvalu has \nenjoyed over the years. \n It is certainly our view, however, that it is \nunrealistic and premature to list for graduation Tuvalu \nand our Pacific least developed country colleagues that \nare also small island developing States. We feel \nstrongly that, before any graduation can be \nrecommended, thorough consideration should be given \nto our unique economic vulnerabilities and that this \nshould be done on an in-country basis, not merely \nthrough data analysis carried out at a desk halfway \naround the globe. For these very reasons, and with a \nview to the achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, there is a critical need to ensure a \nUnited Nations presence in all Pacific small island \ndeveloping States. \n Last month a new Government was elected to \npower in Tuvalu and has pledged good governance and \nmedia freedom as its guiding principles. It has adopted \nthe Tuvalu Sustainable Development Strategy, known \nas \u201cTe Kakeega II: Vision 2015\u201d, as its framework for \ndevelopment partnerships and looks forward to \nworking with the rest of the world in its \nimplementation. \n Security challenges continue to create havoc, fear \nand uncertainty worldwide. Tuvalu strongly deplores \nterrorism in all its forms and expressions. We in the \nPacific are not immune from acts of terrorism. We must \ntherefore collectively continue to make the strongest \nefforts in our campaign against these forces and be \nresolute in ensuring effective global anti-terrorism \naction. \n We also encourage the continuing role of the \nUnited Nations in working towards a solution to the \nPalestinian question and in ensuring peace for the \n \n \n11 06-53958 \n \npeople of Afghanistan, Darfur, Timor-Leste and other \nregions. \n Clearly the United Nations has done well in \npreventing and resolving deadly conflicts throughout \nthe world. But despite those achievements, the non-\nrepresentation of Taiwan in the United Nations and its \nagencies remains an issue of great concern. The threats \nposed by China\u2019s deployment of missiles aimed at \nTaiwan and the use of force in the Taiwan Strait are \nreal, for the East Asian and Pacific region and for the \nworld as a whole. We urge that immediate peaceful and \npreventive actions be taken in the Taiwan Strait for the \nsake of all. \n No other challenge to global security is more \nserious and threatening than the impact of climate \nchange. Climate change is a global problem and can be \nresolved only through global collective action. \nAddressing climate change must therefore must be \nplaced at the centre of the work of the United Nations. \nAs is well known, small island developing States like \nTuvalu are extremely vulnerable to the impact of \nclimate change and sea-level rise, and already evidence \nof devastation is prevalent in all regions of the small \nisland developing States. Over the past few years, \nTuvalu has witnessed unusual flooding of the main \nislands with seawater and king tides, as well as severe \nattacks on fresh water, vegetation, foreshores and coral \nreefs. \n We are frightened and very worried by all these \nthings, which are the result of the actions of others. If \nnothing is done urgently and we are forced out of our \nislands, there is no other Tuvalu to which to move. \nThere is still time to act. Once again we appeal to this \nbody for help and for real action. \n We strongly believe that we have reached a \ndangerous level of greenhouse gas concentrations in \nthe atmosphere and that urgent action is required to \naccelerate the necessary responses. The options are \navailable; what is clearly lacking is political will. \nUnless climate change is addressed, all our efforts for \ndevelopment, security and protection of human rights \nwill be severely undermined. \n Clearly it is urgent that the international \ncommunity take more aggressive action to reduce \ngreenhouse gases. All countries, industrialized and \ndeveloping, must do their part, with the industrialized \ncountries taking the lead, including through the full \nimplementation of the Kyoto Protocol. \n To help developing countries contribute in a \ncommitted way, we need stronger incentives to \npromote the development and distribution of renewable \nenergy and energy efficiency technologies. We need a \nglobal fund to support such efforts. \n It is disappointing to see some large \nindustrialized countries\u2019 continued denial and the \nabsence of enough political will on their part to support \nvulnerable countries such as small island developing \nStates to adapt to the impacts of climate change. We \nmust recognize the \u201cpolluter pays\u201d principle and ensure \nthat the countries that are producing the greenhouse \ngas emissions pay for the damage they are causing to \nthe vulnerable countries. \n There is also a need to generate considerably \nmore funds to underwrite the costs of adaptation, \nincluding international levies to generate income to \nboost funding for adaptation and insurance in small \nisland developing States. The mainstreaming of the \nMauritius Strategy into the work of the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change, as \nrequired under resolution 59/311, is crucial in that \nregard. \n Defining the way forward with respect to future \ncommitments and actions in the area of climate change \nwill require strong political will on the part of all \ncountries. The upcoming twelfth session of the \nConference of the Parties to the Climate Change \nConvention and the second meeting of the Parties to \nthe Kyoto Protocol, to be held in Nairobi, must come \nup with clear and practical timetables for accelerated \naction on mitigation and adaptation. It is imperative \nalso to improve access by small island developing \nStates and least developed countries to Global \nEnvironment Facility climate-change resources and \nconvention-related funds. The Nairobi meetings must \nalso decide on governance and management \narrangements for the Kyoto Protocol Adaptation Fund \nto facilitate its early operation. \n Finally, we strongly believe that the General \nAssembly should host, as soon as possible, a summit at \nthe level of heads of Government aimed at bringing \nforward workable proposals with strong, high-level \npolitical endorsement so as to address climate change \nbeyond the year 2012. \n Our call for urgent action on climate change is \nnot self-serving. Tuvalu and the small island \ndeveloping States may be the first to suffer from the \n  \n \n06-53958 12 \n \nimpacts of climate change, but the consequences of not \ntaking real action now will be felt by all around the \nglobe. We all must work together on climate change in \na spirit of strong solidarity. \n The people of Tuvalu have full confidence in the \nUnited Nations and in its ability to ensure the \nachievement by all peoples of its cardinal purposes of \ndevelopment, security and human rights. It cannot fail \nthe world on climate change; it cannot dash our hopes. \nPlease do not let Tuvalu sink. \n God bless the United Nations family. God bless \nTuvalu.  "

        "file_text": "First of all, I would \nlike to congratulate you, Madam, on your election to \nyour high office and express confidence that, under \nyour skilful stewardship, the sixty-first session of the \nGeneral Assembly will be successful and fruitful. \n Last year\u2019s World Summit reaffirmed the role of \nthe United Nations as an indispensable and universal \nforum for taking important action on today\u2019s burning \nissues. The Summit\u2019s decision to carry out United \nNations reform, the most radical in its history, is a case \nin point. We are now in a position to give a preliminary \nassessment of the work in that area. The results, \nunfortunately, are mixed. \n On the one hand, helpful decisions have been \ntaken to establish new elective bodies within  \nthe United Nations system \u2014 the Peacebuilding \nCommission and the Human Rights Council. They \nwere set up thanks to the intensive efforts of all \ndelegations, which were able to reach a compromise \nthrough negotiations. On the other hand, the lack of \nany progress on the issue of reforming the work of the \nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council is \nseriously impeding the institutional reform of the \nOrganization. In our view, further delays in that \nprocess might have a negative impact on the United \n  \n \n06-53323 30 \n \nNations efforts in the areas of international stability, \nsecurity and development. \n For the delegation of Kazakhstan, the current \nsession is, in a way, an anniversary session. We are \ntaking part in the work of this forum for the fifteenth \ntime. While consistently advancing its national \ninterests in the international arena, my country is \nfirmly committed to the purposes and principles of the \nUnited Nations Charter. \n The establishment in Asia of a mechanism of \ncooperation to enhance regional security and stability, \nknown as the Conference on Interaction and \nConfidence-building Measures in Asia (CICA), was \none of Kazakhstan\u2019s first initiatives, put forward from \nthis rostrum in 1992. We can safely claim that the \ninitiative has proved its viability and has become an \nimportant factor of international relations at this \njuncture, as evidenced by the outcome of the second \nCICA Summit, held in Kazakhstan last June. The \ndocuments adopted by CICA, such as the Catalogue of \nConfidence-building Measures and the Agreement on \nthe Establishment of the CICA Secretariat, have \ncreated propitious conditions for regional cooperation \nand multilateral dialogue in Asia. \n Kazakhstan has consistently called for an \nenhanced nuclear-weapons non-proliferation regime. \nThat position is rooted in the sufferings of our people, \nwho are still reeling from the negative effects of \nnuclear explosions at the Semipalatinsk nuclear testing \nground, shut down exactly 15 years ago by decree of \nPresident Nursultan Nazarbayev. The position was \nbolstered by the historic decision of my country to \nvoluntarily renounce its nuclear arsenal, which used to \nbe the fourth largest in the world. \n We want that step to serve as a commendable \nexample in the light of the ongoing large-scale crisis \nthat has struck the global security system. Regrettably, \nthe lack of any result at the last Review Conference of \nthe Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons (NPT) and the United Nations \nDisarmament Commission remains a major challenge \nfor the international community. \n It is time to make coordinated efforts to overcome \nthat crisis. The process to that end has already made a \ngood start. The Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone \nin Central Asia, signed on 8 September in \nSemipalatinsk, is a demonstration of the political will \nof five Central Asian States: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, \nTajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The signing \nof that milestone instrument could become a catalyst \nfor the process of enhancing the NPT. We believe that \ntangible progress in that area is possible if all Member \nStates comply with their obligations regarding nuclear \ndisarmament and the vertical and horizontal \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The \nCentral Asian States are ready to continue \nconsultations with the permanent members of the \nSecurity Council on the issue of that Treaty\u2019s entry into \nforce. \n In our view, the States concerned should strictly \ncomply with their commitment to a moratorium on \nnuclear test explosions and work to ensure the entry \ninto force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban \nTreaty. All peaceful nuclear programmes should be \ncarried out in a transparent manner under the control of \nthe International Atomic Energy Agency. \n It is a matter of great concern that the crisis has \nextended not only to strategic, but also to conventional \nweapons. Regrettably, Member States have so far failed \nto devise common approaches to the Programme of \nAction in that area. We have to step up efforts to \ntighten national export-control mechanisms. I refer \nfirst and foremost to dual-use materials and \ntechnologies, as well as to missiles and the means of \ndelivery of weapons of mass destruction, with full and \nstrict compliance with the provisions of the Security \nCouncil resolution adopted in 2004. \n The possibility of weapons of mass destruction \nfalling into the hands of terrorists is a matter of grave \nconcern. To prevent such a scenario, we have to push \nfor the accession of all United Nations Member States \nto the International Convention for the Suppression of \nActs of Nuclear Terrorism. \n We live in a world where tensions between States \nand armed conflicts are still very much a part of \neveryday life. The crisis in Lebanon has highlighted \nyet again the need to use effectively the United Nations \ncapacity to maintain international peace and security. \nSince the early days of the conflict, Kazakhstan has \ncalled for the strengthening of the Security Council\u2019s \nrole in the settlement of that crisis. \n The deployment of a strengthened contingent of \nUnited Nations peacekeepers in the conflict zone was \nthe only viable solution to that large-scale crisis. \nRegrettably, the lack of an effective mechanism to \nprevent the break-up and spread of armed conflicts \n \n \n31 06-53323 \n \nremains a serious problem. In our view, the \nestablishment of a United Nations preventive \ndiplomacy and conflict prevention centre in Central \nAsia remains a relevant proposition. That Centre would \nfocus on the provision of advice and expertise to the \ncountries of the region, taking into account their \nnational interests and security considerations. \n It is vitally important to identify how the belated \nadoption of the Security Council resolution on \nLebanon is consistent with the process of United \nNations reform. The inefficiency of the institutional \nsystem of the United Nations and the lack of broad \nunderstanding among Member States negatively affect \nglobal and regional stability and security. \n Kazakhstan has decided to run for a seat on the \nEconomic and Social Council. We express our \nappreciation to those Member States that have \nsupported our nomination. If elected, we intend \nactively to participate in the work of that important \nUnited Nations organ on all substantive items on its \nagenda.  \n Speaking from this high rostrum, I feel obliged to \nexpress serious concern about the resurgence of \ninternational terrorism. Recent explosions in Iraq and \nTurkey and the aborted London terror plot indicate that \nthis global threat is clearly growing. It is impossible to \ncounter the threat without consolidated efforts on the \npart of the entire international community to speed up \nthe implementation of relevant counter-terrorism \nconventions and Security Council resolutions. We have \nto strengthen cooperation between Member States at \nthe United Nations. The early conclusion of a \ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism is \nvery much on our agenda. \n With illegal routes for the delivery of Afghan \ndrugs from Asia to Europe running through its territory, \nKazakhstan makes every effort to address that threat, \nyet it is clear that no country in the world can address \nit effectively on its own. The fight will be effective \nonly if we join our efforts and mobilize the resources \nof the United Nations and its specialized agencies. It is \nprecisely for that reason that Kazakhstan has supported \nthe United Nations initiative to set up in Kazakhstan a \nCentral Asian regional information and coordination \ncentre to fight illegal drug trafficking. \n We welcome the results of the General \nAssembly\u2019s High-level Dialogue on International \nMigration and Development. We believe that those \ndiscussions have helped to lay the groundwork for a \nregular dialogue on that issue among all parties \nconcerned. As a country of destination, transit and \norigin for migration, Kazakhstan is willing to take an \nactive part in the search for solutions to the problems \nof illegal migration, labour migration and the \nprotection of the rights of migrants. \n In our view, development issues should remain \nthe focus of attention of the international community. \nThe timely and effective achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals will grow in \nimportance as we approach 2015. Kazakhstan supports \ndecisions on development issues taken at major \ninternational conferences and United Nations summits, \nand calls for their timely and effective implementation. \n As the largest landlocked country, Kazakhstan \nurges the international community \u2014 above all the \ndeveloped countries \u2014 to make every effort to meet \nthe needs of the least developed and developing \nlandlocked countries. \n The structural reforms carried out since its \nindependence have totally transformed Kazakhstan. \nToday, it is one of the most dynamic States of the \nworld and has set ambitious goals to promote further \ndevelopment. The average growth of our gross \ndomestic product over the past five years is 10 per \ncent. The World Bank has included Kazakhstan in the \ntop 20 most attractive economies for investment. The \nGovernment works to ensure that Kazakhstan will join \nthe ranks of the most competitive economies. To reach \nthat target, we have developed an innovative industrial \neconomic development programme and finance \nrelevant projects through a special national fund. All \nthe basic development institutions have been \nestablished. Negotiations on Kazakhstan\u2019s admission to \nthe World Trade Organization are in their final stages. \nProgrammes are being implemented to use the \ntransport and transit capacity of the country, and large-\nscale projects are being carried out to integrate the \ncountry\u2019s transportation infrastructure into the Eurasian \ntransportation system. \n Kazakhstan renews its commitment to the \nMillennium Development Goals. The United Nations \nDevelopment Programme report issued on the eve of \nthe 2005 World Summit demonstrates that our country \nhas made great strides in that area. \n As a major exporter of energy resources, \nKazakhstan will continue to pursue its policy to ensure \n  \n \n06-53323 32 \n \ntheir delivery to world markets through multiple \nroutes. With the growing economy, the Government is \nconsistently increasing social spending, primarily in \nhealth care, education, employment and other areas. \nOur efforts have made it possible for the World Bank to \nrank Kazakhstan as a successful State with a \ndynamically growing economy. \n We pay close attention to the promotion of \ndemocracy, the building of civil society and the \nenhancement of inter-ethnic and inter-faith accord \nwithin the country. Our accomplishments are evident. \nMy country, home to more than 100 ethnic groups and \npractically all religions, is a model of tolerance, accord \nand stability. \n It is no accident that Kazakhstan has hosted a \nforum of leaders of world and traditional religions. The \nsecond congress has just completed its deliberations in \nAstana, at which religious leaders adopted a \ndeclaration calling for an active dialogue among \nreligions. We cannot allow the use of religious \ndifferences as an instrument of hatred and strife, and \nwe have to save humanity from a global clash of \nreligions and cultures. The congress has become \nKazakhstan\u2019s contribution to global dialogue among \nreligions. \n Kazakhstan carries out a balanced foreign policy \nbased on our long-term national interests and aimed at \nthe development of friendly ties with neighbouring \ncountries and all interested countries of the world. \n As the current Chair of the Commonwealth of \nIndependent States, my country has devised a plan to \nreform that organization in order to enhance its \ncapacity. Kazakhstan has been working actively in the \nShanghai Cooperation Organization and the Eurasian \nEconomic Community and supports the Collective \nSecurity Treaty Organization. \n Ahead of the other post-Soviet countries in many \nareas, Kazakhstan has always assumed responsibility \nfor the implementation of international initiatives, \nwhether it be the decision to shut down the \nSemipalatinsk nuclear testing ground, or to voluntarily \nrenounce nuclear weapons, or its initiatives to convene \na regional security forum in Asia, or to hold a congress \nof leaders of world and traditional religions or to host \nthe first global conference on transit-transport \ncooperation or to host a special meeting of the Security \nCouncil Counter-Terrorism Committee. In 2007, \nKazakhstan will host the sixty-third session of the \nUnited Nations Economic and Social Commission for \nAsia and the Pacific. \n We express our appreciation to all States that \nhave supported Kazakhstan\u2019s candidature for the \nchairmanship of the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe in 2009. Kazakhstan will \ncontinue to be active on all key items of the global \nagenda. \n In conclusion, I would like to quote a popular \nsaying in my country: \u201cNothing can be farther than \nyesterday and nothing can be closer than tomorrow\u201d. A \nyear ago, at the World Summit, we agreed to take \naction to reform the United Nations. We should not \nforget that humanity pins its hopes for a better future \non the United Nations as an indispensable \nOrganization. It is high time to take specific and \neffective action to raise the prestige of our \nOrganization. "

        "file_text": "Madam President, on behalf \nof the European Union, I have the honour to address \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-first session. The \nacceding countries Bulgaria and Romania; the \ncandidate countries Turkey, Croatia and the former \nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia; the countries of the \nStabilization and Association Process and potential \ncandidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \nMontenegro, Serbia; and also Ukraine and the Republic \nof Moldova, align themselves with this statement. \n Let me start by congratulating you, Madam \nPresident, upon your assumption of the office of \nPresident of the General Assembly. I also wish to \nexpress our appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Jan \nEliasson, whose input has been crucial to the United \nNations reform process. We are confident that under \n \n \n15 06-52731 \n \nyour wise leadership, Madam President, this session \nwill turn out to be successful. \n The European Union is deeply committed to the \nUnited Nations and to its comprehensive agenda \npromoting peace and security, sustainable \ndevelopment, human rights and fundamental freedoms. \nWe want to create a more peaceful, prosperous and \ndemocratic world. The European Union continues its \nclose and loyal cooperation with the world \nOrganization. Recent events in different parts of the \nworld have proved once again that, 61 years after its \nestablishment, an effective United Nations is needed \nmore than ever. \n Contrary to our shared ideals, the realities of war \nand violence have not passed away into history. \nConflicts and terrorism continue to destroy the social \nand economic progress for which we are all striving. \nThe recent tragic events that occurred in Lebanon, \nIsrael and the Palestinian territories have again \ndemonstrated the need to achieve a just and lasting \npeace in the Middle East. Sustainable peace in the \nMiddle East and security for the people living there can \nbe achieved only through a commitment to a peace \nprocess that leads to a viable independent Palestinian \nState living in peace with a secure Israel. That remains \nour goal. The European Union is determined to \nparticipate actively in the implementation of Security \nCouncil resolution 1701 (2006) in order to help \nconsolidate the ceasefire and reach a long-term \nsolution based on the terms contained in the resolution. \n The European Union is strongly committed to \nrespect of international humanitarian law, including the \nprotection of civilians and humanitarian personnel \nduring conflict. We therefore condemn the deaths of \nhundreds of civilians in Lebanon and Israel in the \nrecent conflict. We welcome the outcome of the \nStockholm International Donor Conferences on the \nHumanitarian Situation in the Occupied Palestinian \nTerritories and on Lebanon. The European Union has \nresponded swiftly and generously to both humanitarian \nappeals. \n In the Middle East, we have demonstrated our \ncontinued, strong commitment to the United Nations. \nPeacekeepers from European Union countries are \nalready deployed in the area and will form the \nbackbone of the new United Nations Interim Force in \nLebanon (UNIFIL) operation. \n On this occasion, I want to pay tribute to the \nmemory of the United Nations military observers and \nother personnel who recently fell victim to the war in \nsouthern Lebanon. \n The European Union will continue active \nengagement in United Nations peacekeeping operations \nin the future. We see wide scope for further \ncomplementary and combined efforts with the United \nNations as well as with other regional entities. \n In sub-Saharan Africa, many peace agreements \nhave been brokered with the help of the United \nNations, the African Union and the European Union. In \nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, the European \nUnion remains greatly involved in assisting in the \ncompletion of the electoral process through a major \nfinancial contribution and the decisive support of the \nEuropean Union military operation. \n Unfortunately, in Darfur, the humanitarian and \nsecurity situation is deteriorating. The European Union \nwelcomes the recent Security Council resolution on the \nUnited Nations-led peacekeeping operation in the \nSudan, and we strongly urge the Sudanese Government \nto give its consent to the deployment of the United \nNations operation. \n Peacebuilding is an integral part of the broad \nsecurity concept. The newly established Peacebuilding \nCommission brings its own and much-needed \ncontribution to United Nations work for peace and \nsecurity. The European Union will work actively to \nensure that this new body will have a strong and \ndynamic role in the United Nations system. Gender \naspect is important in this context. We also welcome \nthe establishment of the Central Emergency Response \nFund to enhance the capability of the international \ncommunity to respond to urgent humanitarian needs. \n The events of the past year show that terrorism \ncontinues to threaten international peace and security. \nThis threat can be effectively addressed through broad-\nbased cooperation within the framework of the United \nNations. The European Union welcomes the agreement \non a global counter-terrorism strategy as an important \ninstrument and expression of international solidarity in \nthe fight against terrorism. The European Union urges \nUnited Nations Member States to build on this \nachievement and to intensify their efforts to reach a \nspeedy consensus on a United Nations comprehensive \ncounter-terrorism convention. We underline the \nimportance of prevention and of conducting the fight \n  \n \n06-52731 16 \n \nagainst terrorism in accordance with human rights, \nrefugee law and international humanitarian law. \n We consider it important that this session of the \nGeneral Assembly should mark progress in the areas of \ndisarmament and non-proliferation. Concrete action is \nneeded on small arms and light weapons at the \nnational, regional and global levels. The European \nUnion will continue to push for a legally binding treaty \non trade in all conventional weapons. \n Effective multilateralism is crucial in facing the \ngrowing threat of the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction. The Security Council has a central role in \naddressing those threats. In this regard, the European \nUnion welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution \n1695 (2006) on the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea. We look forward to its effective \nimplementation, and we strongly urge the Democratic \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea to implement fully the \nrequirements of this resolution. \n The European Union also welcomes the adoption \nof Security Council resolution 1696 (2006) and calls \non Iran to respond positively and swiftly to the \ndemands of the international community in \nimplementing this resolution, in particular by \nsuspending its enrichment activities in accordance with \nthat resolution. This would pave the way for \nnegotiations on a comprehensive agreement aimed at \nrestoring confidence that the Iranian nuclear \nprogramme serves exclusively peaceful purposes. We \nwelcome the current exploratory talks aimed to \nfacilitate the opening of the negotiations. An \nincreasingly important element in the promotion of \nglobal peace and security is the need to foster \ntolerance, mutual understanding and respect. In this \nregard, the European Union has already expressed its \nstrong support for the Alliance of Civilizations \ninitiative. \n Development builds peace. The United Nations \nand its Member States have created effective common \ngoals for economic, social and environmental \ndevelopment. We must fulfil our common commitment \nto the global partnership for development with all \nstakeholders and implement all the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and other jointly agreed \ndevelopment targets in the time agreed on by Member \nStates. In our view, every country has control over and \nprimary responsibility for its own development. \n The social dimension of globalization, including \nthe importance of decent work for all, deserves special \nattention in the work of the United Nations. Ensuring \ndecent work is not only about economic and social \ndevelopment and individual rights and standards. It is \nalso very much a factor that contributes to the social \nand political stability of countries and regions. \n We have seen positive development also in \nAfrica. However sub-Saharan Africa as a whole is not \non track to reach the Millennium Development Goals \nby 2015. Therefore, the European Union has decided to \ngive 50 per cent of its increase in aid to Africa. We are \nwilling to strengthen the strategic partnership with \nAfrica by developing a joint strategy. \n We also need to improve aid effectiveness and \ndonor practices. The European Union is fully \ncommitted to implementation of the Paris Declaration \non Aid Effectiveness and calls on all other donors to do \nthe same. In addition, the international community \nmust deliver real gains for poor countries on trade. \nTrade can be a strong catalyst for economic growth and \npoverty reduction. Thus trade is a key element to \nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. \n The negotiations of the Doha Development \nAgenda must be resumed, as their successful outcome \nwill deliver substantial development benefits to \ndeveloping countries. We urge quick implementation of \nthe aid-for-trade commitments of December 2005. \n The European Union welcomes the outcome of \nthe Midterm Comprehensive Review of the \nImplementation of the Programme of Action for the \nLeast Developed Countries held in New York this \nweek. We are pleased that from 2001 onwards \neconomic growth in the least developed countries \n(LDCs) as a group has almost reached the 7 per cent \ntarget. As the providers of the greatest net official \ndevelopment aid, we note with satisfaction the overall \nincrease in official development assistance from donor \ncountries, especially to LDCs. \n Ensuring sustainable development is an urgent \ntask. Environmental sustainability underpins long-term \ndevelopment and the achievement of all the \nMillennium Development Goals. Addressing climate \nchange and biodiversity loss are integral parts of \nachieving sustainable development. For this purpose, \nthe Montreal Action Plan on climate change agreed last \nyear needs to be pushed forward urgently. \n \n \n17 06-52731 \n \n The Secretary-General\u2019s High-level Panel on \nUnited Nations System-wide Coherence is about to \nfinalize its work. The European Union looks forward to \nstudying the Panel\u2019s recommendations, which could \ngive an urgently needed global response, especially at \nthe country level. This should be done in close \ncooperation with other multilateral stakeholders and \nthe developing countries themselves. \n The European Union looks forward to continuing \ncooperation in the field of migration and development \nafter last week\u2019s High-level Dialogue. Migration is an \nintegral part of the development agenda, and \ndevelopment is an important element in migration \npolicies. \n The European Union is committed to \nstrengthening and mainstreaming human rights within \nthe United Nations system. One of the major \naccomplishments of the United Nations has been the \ncomprehensive framework of international human \nrights law. It sets out clear standards by which all \nStates are measured. With a view to strengthening that \nframework, we attach great importance to the adoption \nof new instruments on enforced disappearances, the \nrights of indigenous peoples and the rights of persons \nwith disabilities during the present session of the \nGeneral Assembly. \n The newly established Human Rights Council has \nthe potential to significantly strengthen the promotion \nand protection of human rights throughout the world. \nThe European Union wants to ensure that it lives up to \nthat potential and that it soon plays a strong and \ndynamic role in the United Nations system. The Union \nhas high expectations for the second regular session of \nthe Council, which began yesterday. \n The EU is also committed to ending impunity for \nthe most serious crimes of concern to the international \ncommunity. We strongly support the International \nCriminal Court (ICC) and call upon all States that are \nnot yet party to the Rome Statute of the ICC to ratify or \naccede to it without delay. \n The EU will continue to promote the rule of law \nboth at the national level and in international relations. \nIn Iraq, upholding the rule of law is a key challenge. \nThe Union is working closely together with the United \nNations and other partners to assist the Iraqi \nGovernment in that field. \n The EU wishes to see this world Organization \nfunction in a more effective, transparent and \naccountable way. The EU recognizes the need to \nreform the main United Nations bodies, among them \nthe General Assembly, the Economic and Social \nCouncil and the Security Council. Management reform, \nas well as the mandates review, will be high on our \nagenda when we start our work this autumn. We need \nto continue our collective efforts through consensual \ndecision-making. After all, United Nations reform will \nbenefit the entire membership of the Organization. \n Before I conclude, let me pay tribute to our \nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan. For nearly 10 \nyears, he has shown leadership and vision in his work \nto uphold the principles of the United Nations Charter, \nas well as courage in the much-needed transformation \nof our world Organization. He has put a human face on \nthe United Nations, both inside and outside the \nOrganization. I wish him all the best. "

        "file_text": "It honours me to deliver the statement of Saudi Arabia \non behalf of Prince Saud Al-Faisal, Foreign Minister of \nthe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. At the outset, it gives me \ngreat pleasure to express to you and your Government \nmy most sincere congratulations on your election as \nPresident of the sixty-first session of the General \nAssembly. I am fully confident that your diplomatic \nexpertise and thorough knowledge of international \naffairs will guarantee the success of this session. I \nwould like to express my appreciation to your \npredecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, Foreign Minister of \nSweden, who presided over the previous session with \nwisdom and expertise. The constant and diligent efforts \nof the Secretary-General were essential for revitalizing \nthe role of the United Nations and for upholding its \nprinciples, despite the difficult times and crucial \nchallenges we face. He, therefore, deserves our full \nsupport and deepest gratitude. \n The world today faces a host of global problems \nthat can be successfully addressed only within the \ncontext of multilateral cooperation under the umbrella \nof the United Nations. Human suffering caused by \npoverty, hunger, malnutrition, the spread of diseases \nand epidemics and natural disasters still require the \nconcerted efforts of the international community in \ncombating them. These global challenges do not \ndistinguish among people on the basis of colour, \nreligion or nationality. Invariably, it is the most \nvulnerable who suffer the most from these \nhumanitarian threats, making it all the more urgent for \nthe international community to assume its collective \nresponsibility in addressing these issues. \n The Middle East is in the midst of a very \ndangerous phase, with the emergence of new crises and \nthe worsening of old ones, such as the continued Israeli \noccupation of Arab lands in Palestine, Syria and \nLebanon; the volatile situation on the Lebanese-Israeli \nborder; the invasion of Lebanon; the challenges posed \nby continued instability and sectarian violence in Iraq; \nand the as-yet unresolved issue of Iran\u2019s nuclear \nprogramme. The accumulation of crises and tensions in \n \n \n51 06-53323 \n \nthe region can only encourage an environment in which \nextremism and terrorism will thrive with undesirable \nconsequences. It is, therefore, imperative that we warn \nspecifically against the continued trend towards \nstopgap crisis management that has taken the place of \nthe serious pursuit of a comprehensive and just \nsolution based on the principles of international law \nand resolutions of international legitimacy free from \npartiality, double standards or selectivity. \n Undoubtedly, the key to resolving these multiple \ncrises will be to invigorate the peace process with the \naim of achieving a just and durable settlement of the \nPalestinian-Israeli conflict, the oldest conflict in \nmodern times. This conflict is the most enduring \ninternational conflict today, and its continuation \nnegatively affects the prospects of reaching effective \nsolutions to other crises.  \n The ongoing Israeli occupation of Palestine \nrepresents a flagrant breach of international law and \nthe principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of \nterritory by force and blatant disregard for resolutions \nof international legitimacy. This issue lies at the core of \nthe Middle Eastern problem. The international \ncommunity should no longer tolerate procrastination or \nrepeated failures in resolving this situation. The \ninternational community, and especially the major \nPowers, must set aside their divisions and face up to \nthe vital task of reaching, as soon as possible, a \npeaceful, just and lasting solution, in accordance with \nthe principles of international legitimacy. \n The resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict \nmust be placed in its appropriate context by reconciling \nthe rights of the Palestinian and the Israeli people and \nestablishing two neighbouring States enjoying security, \nwhich is a natural outcome of peace. It is peace that \nensures security, and not the other way around. The \nbasis for a solution is clear to all of us, as expressed by \nthe President of the United States in the context of his \ntwo-State vision, which is in harmony with relevant \nUnited Nations resolutions and with the Arab Peace \nInitiative, adopted unanimously at the Beirut Summit. \nWhat is urgently needed today is to link that vision \nwith a clear agenda bound to a specific time-frame. \n Regrettably, the problem has been portrayed as \ninextricably complicated and not amenable to \ncustomary solutions. Using security considerations as a \npretext, exceptional provisions allowed one of the \nparties to the conflict to specify unilaterally the basis \nand conditions for negotiations, to choose its \nnegotiating partner, to violate previously concluded \nagreements, to impose unilateral measures and to use \nforce to impose a status quo. Our purpose here is not to \nenter into futile debates, but it is important to \nrecognize that the peace process has suffered greatly \nfrom these exceptions, which give rise to double \nstandards and inequitable obligations. \n Reviving the peace process will require serious \ninternational cooperation so as to realize the two-State \nvision within a reasonable time-frame. Recent events \nhave once again proved that military solutions only \nundermine the interests and the security of all parties. \nIt is therefore essential that we learn the lessons of our \nprevious failures in the pursuit of peace. These failures \nresulted from an exaggerated emphasis on procedural \nand provisional issues. The establishment of interim \nsecurity arrangements proved complicated and \nexhausting, while procedures for building mutual trust \nenabled the enemies of peace to undermine the peace \nprocess in its entirety.  \n What is required from us today is a fundamental \nchange in our quest to achieve a just and \ncomprehensive peace in the area. It is imperative that \nwe go to the root and heart of the conflict by \nestablishing an effective mechanism to ensure \nimmediate and peaceful negotiations addressing all \nfinal status issues, including Jerusalem, borders, \nrefugees and mutual security arrangements. The \nrequired breakthrough can be achieved only through a \nhistoric and comprehensive deal. \n A clear outline of the solution has been apparent \never since the adoption of resolution 181 (II) in 1947. \nThat resolution set out the partition of Palestine, which \nwas then under a British Mandate, into an Arab and an \nIsraeli State. It also proposed clearly defined borders \nfor those two States. Since then, the Security Council \nand the General Assembly have issued hundreds of \nresolutions, including Security Council resolution 242 \n(1967), which emphasized the principle of refraining \nfrom the acquisition of territory by force, and called on \nIsrael to withdraw from all territories occupied in \n1967. It also reiterated the need to find a just solution \nto the issue of the Palestinian refugees. Thirty-nine \nyears after the adoption of this resolution, the \nPalestinian people continue to be deprived of their \ninherent right to self-determination and of their \nentitlement to live in an independent State with Arab \nJerusalem as its capital. \n  \n \n06-53323 52 \n \n Only two months ago Israel launched a brutal act \nof aggression against Lebanon, resulting in the \ndestruction of Lebanon\u2019s infrastructure, the \ndisplacement of one third of its population, and the \nwounding and killing of thousands of civilians, \nincluding women, children and the elderly. That \nsenseless war, of course, did not make Israel any safer. \nThe only thing achieved by Israel in Lebanon was vast \ndestruction and devastation, provoking yet deeper \nhatred and enmity. We wonder how many tragedies and \nvictims we and the world will have to have before \neveryone understands that military solutions will not \nsucceed.  \n The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reaffirms its full \nsupport for the legitimate Lebanese Government as it \nseeks to extend its authority and influence over its \nentire territory. The Kingdom also calls on the \nbrotherly people of Lebanon to stand united so that \ntheir country may once again enjoy security and \nprosperity. We reiterate the need for all parties to \nremain committed to Security Council resolution 1701 \n(2006) and call for a rapid Israeli withdrawal from the \nSheba\u2019a Farms area, recognized by Israel as an \noccupied territory. We also call for a return to the \nArmistice Agreement signed between Lebanon and \nIsrael in 1949, as this is the only means of \nguaranteeing security and stability and avoiding a \nreturn to the status quo ante.  \n As part of our commitment to reconstruction \nefforts in Lebanon, we call on the international \ncommunity to hold Israel responsible for providing fair \ncompensation for the destruction and losses inflicted \nupon Lebanon as a result of that aggression. One of the \nreasons why Lebanon has been a victim of repeated \nIsraeli invasions \u2014 seven so far \u2014 is that we have not \nheld the aggressor accountable. \n We are profoundly concerned and extremely \nsaddened by the deteriorating security situation in Iraq, \nmarked by daily confrontation, acts of violence and \nbombings. The absence of security and stability in Iraq \ncontinues to hamper the efforts of all countries \ncommitted to assisting Iraq in overcoming its ordeal, \nrehabilitating its economy and helping it to rebuild. \nThe Kingdom has always reaffirmed the importance of \nconsolidating Iraq\u2019s unity, respecting its independence \nand sovereignty, and refraining from interfering in its \ninternal affairs. We call on the international community \nto support the programme adopted by the legitimate \nIraqi Government, led by Mr. Nuri Al-Maliki, to \nachieve a comprehensive national reconciliation; \nrevitalize Government institutions in the security, \nmilitary, political and economic areas; and disarm the \nmilitias. \n It has long been acknowledged that the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons has seriously \nundermined the security of all countries. Over time, a \nnumber of international treaties and conventions have \nproduced bilateral and multilateral obligations, but \nsuch obligations are of no use if they are not fully \nobserved and fully applied. We cannot ignore the \nserious threat to global peace and security that such \nweapons continue to pose, regardless of whether they \nare used in wars between States or fall into the hands \nof terrorist groups. \n Effectively preventing the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction will require abandoning \ndouble standards and emphasizing the importance of \nmaking the entire Middle East, including the Arab Gulf \nregion, a zone free from nuclear weapons. Israel is the \nonly country in the region that is known to possess \nweapons of mass destruction but is not subjected to any \nform of monitoring. \n While we support the right of all countries to the \npeaceful use of nuclear energy \u2014 including the \nacquisition of know-how and nuclear technology for \npeaceful purposes \u2014 we call on all parties to support \nthe path of negotiations and peaceful solutions with \nregard to the Iranian nuclear issue. Iran\u2019s repeated \nstatements that its nuclear programme is restricted to \nthe peaceful uses of nuclear energy should continue to \nserve as a strong basis for negotiations.  \n The Kingdom and other members of the Gulf \nCooperation Council are eager to maintain and enhance \ntheir relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran, and \nwe hope that the Government of Iran will respond \npositively to the repeated calls by the United Arab \nEmirates for the peaceful resolution of the issue of the \noccupied islands belonging to the Emirates. \n International terrorism is a threat to us all. The \nongoing atrocities perpetrated by terrorists continue to \ntest our resolve to combat and counter terrorism. There \nis no acceptable justification for any form of terrorism, \nbut we cannot ignore the fact that it has roots and \ncauses that enable it to thrive. Achieving a decisive \nvictory over terrorism will require not only that we \ndeny all financial support to terrorists, but also that we \naddress the origins of extremist thought and the \n \n \n53 06-53323 \n \nconditions in which terrorists prosper. If we address the \nfeelings of despair, anger and frustration experienced \nby peoples when they are denied their legitimate rights, \nwe will deprive extremists of their causes and rallying \ncries. \n As one of the main targets of terrorism, the \nKingdom has repeatedly denounced terrorism in all its \nforms and manifestations and has achieved tangible \nsuccess in combating it. The Kingdom has acceded to \nmost of the international counter-terrorism agreements, \nas well as the Arab Convention on the Suppression of \nTerrorism and the Convention of the Organization of \nthe Islamic Conference (OIC) on Combating \nInternational Terrorism. The Custodian of the Two \nHoly Mosques, King Abdullah Bin Abdelaziz Al Saud, \nhas proposed the establishment of an international \ncounter-terrorism centre under United Nations \nauspices. The only way to thwart the evil plans of \nterrorists is through the exchange of intelligence and \nupdated information among countries and agencies. \nInnovative solutions can be found to adequately \naddress reservations regarding the sensitivity of such \ninformation and its secret sources. \n As we renew our commitment to and \nparticipation in the international campaign against \nterrorism, we must at the same time draw attention to \ngrowing worldwide concerns about its flagrant use as a \npretext by extremist forces and by advocates of a clash \nbetween civilizations and cultures. \n We must periodically evaluate the effectiveness \nand success of our methods of combating terrorism and \nextremism. Here, I must reiterate that no true religion \nadvocates the use of terrorism; all of the world\u2019s great \nreligions promote noble values. We should not hold the \nvast majority of true believers responsible for the \ndeviant behaviour of a very small minority of \nadherents of any religion. Saudi Arabia strongly rejects \nthe characterization of Islam as a violent religion that \nin any way supports terrorism. Saudi Arabia calls on all \nthose who want to learn more about Islam and its \nattitude towards terrorism to consult reliable \nauthorities or documents such as the 10-year plan of \naction adopted unanimously by the members of the \nOIC at its recent extraordinary summit held in Saudi \nArabia. The success of the global counter-terrorism \ncampaign will depend on our strict adherence to the \nrules of international law, human rights, norms and \nhumanitarian values, and respect for all religions. \n The continued humanitarian suffering in Darfur is \nunacceptable to all of us. We hope that the current \nefforts to remedy the situation will be given a chance \nto succeed. We hope that this destructive conflict, \nwhich is causing unjustifiable losses on all sides, will \nswiftly come to an end. The Sudanese authorities, who \nhave achieved a historic success by bringing about \nreconciliation in the South, are cooperating with efforts \nto achieve reconciliation in Darfur, and have welcomed \nthe deployment of African Union forces. Arab States \nhave committed themselves to providing those forces \nwith the support and financial resources that they need. \nWe are concerned that the deployment of international \ntroops without the consent of the sovereign \nGovernment of the Sudan will make them part of the \nproblem, rather than part of the solution.  \n Saudi Arabia, itself a developing country, plays a \nmajor role in promoting development in other \ndeveloping and least developed countries. To help \nthose countries overcome their problems of poverty \nand underdevelopment, Saudi Arabia provides \ngenerous aid through its national institutions, as well as \nthrough international and regional institutions. Over \nthe past three decades, Saudi Arabia has contributed \napproximately 4 per cent of its gross domestic product \nin official development assistance (ODA) \u2014 the \nhighest percentage contributed by any country in the \nworld. Saudi Arabia has also offered debt relief \namounting to more than $6 billion to a number of least \ndeveloped countries. \n In order to ensure continued global economic \ngrowth, Saudi Arabia has increased its petroleum \nproduction capacity to stabilize petroleum markets, to \nensure the continued flow of sufficient petroleum and \nto curb artificially high prices. Saudi Arabia hosts the \nsecretariat of the International Energy Forum, which it \nestablished as a forum for discussing areas for \ncooperation and dialogue between petroleum-\nconsuming and petroleum-producing countries. \nIncreased cooperation between those countries will \ncontribute directly to the stabilization of petroleum \nmarkets. Petroleum, of course, is an essential strategic \ncommodity for the promotion of sustained global \neconomic growth. \n Our world is experiencing ever-accelerating and \nincreasingly complex political, economic and social \nchanges. Now more than ever, it is vital that we \ncooperate with one another to address the complex \nissues and changes facing us. Balanced and respectful \n  \n \n06-53323 54 \n \nrelations among countries, based on the principles of \njustice, mutual trust and true partnership, are essential \nto that end. Promoting healthy relations and \nunderstanding among nations will best equip us to meet \nfuture challenges and to respond to them in a way that \nwill benefit all of humanity. "

        "file_text": "Let me begin by thanking \nthis institution and all who subscribe to its values and \nmission for providing me \u2014 and the citizens of my \nnation \u2014 with the opportunity to address you today. \n We are gathered here at a time when the \nchallenges and opportunities for the institution of the \nUnited Nations have rarely been greater. And at this \ngathering, we must ask ourselves where hope for peace \nand prosperity would be, if the United Nations system \nwere not such an active presence around the globe. \n My country salutes the ongoing efforts to make \nthe United Nations even more effective and welcomes \nthe candidacy of a Secretary-General whose \ncompetence and unique perspective on gender-equality \nissues will help advance that goal. \n Georgia is grateful for the contributions of the \nUnited Nations, for the commitment to build peace in \nour region and the efforts to create new opportunities \nfor those most in need. I look forward to a continuation \nand deepening of that productive cooperation.  \n In a few weeks time, we will be celebrating the \nthird anniversary of the peaceful, democratic \nrevolution that brought a new era of change and \nprogress to Georgia and the entire region. In fact, that \nrevolution caused reactions all over the world. Ours \nwas a revolution that gave power to its citizens, and it \ndid so by rebuilding the fundamental social contract \nupon which any democracy must rest \u2014 a contract \nfounded on respect for the principles of transparency, \naccountability and responsibility. \n Today, citizens of Georgia\u2019s democracy enjoy the \nfruits of fundamental human security, liberty, human \nrights and opportunity. We have changed the lives of \nour people, and we have done so by confronting and \neliminating corruption, by fighting crime aggressively, \nby investing heavily in education and health care and \nby establishing new rules of the game \u2014 in a society \nwhere little of that existed in the past. The results of \nour efforts have not gone unnoticed.  \n In the last two months alone, the World Bank and \nthe European Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment \u2014 to name a few international \ninstitutions \u2014 have confirmed just how much Georgia \nhas changed. Today, we are recognized as the number \none reformer in the world, as one of the least corrupt \nStates in Europe, as an outstanding place to do \n  \n \n06-53317 2 \n \nbusiness and as a role model for other countries of the \nregion. It is fair to say that our reforms, conducted in a \npart of the world where few thought they were \npossible, have in fact performed.  \n In two weeks time, we will take another step, \nfurther solidifying the institutional framework upon \nwhich our democracy rests, when we conduct local \nelections. We are making that important investment in \nour democracy because we believe in the necessity of \nempowering our people with the responsibility and the \ntools to shape their own future.  \n I look forward to healthy competition, transparent \nelections and a more vibrant democratic system. That, \nin our view, is the way in which we can provide our \nState with the capacity to protect the vulnerable and \nprovide our citizens the means to build a better life. \nHowever, like any nation undergoing great change, we \nstill have challenges ahead. Reform continues in the \njudiciary and in other spheres, local self-government is \nbuilding capacity and employment remains the rightful \nexpectation of every citizen. \n Our national aspirations are, however, not \nparochial. We see Georgia as an active and responsible \nmember of the international community. To protect our \nachievements and consolidate gains, we should face \ncommon challenges and threats together. We are doing \nthat together with our friends, partners and allies in \nplaces like Iraq, Afghanistan and Kosovo, where our \ntroops help support international efforts to defeat \nterrorism and build lasting peace and democracy. \n Because of that commitment, we will continue to \nactively pursue our membership in NATO and welcome \nthe most recent step forward, when just yesterday \nGeorgia was invited to join in Intensified Dialogue \nwith NATO. That is an important decisive step towards \nfull membership. We do so because we believe \ndemocracies are stronger when they are united, and \nthat lasting security is best achieved through alliances \nbased on common values. \n We are a European nation and that is not a recent \nrevelation. We would in fact be denying our history if \nwe felt \u2014 or acted \u2014 otherwise. In the next days, my \nGovernment will be signing an action plan as part of \nthe European Union\u2019s European Neighborhood Policy. \nThus, we will take another step, strengthening the \nbonds that unite the family of European democracies. \n It is the goal of my Government to become a \nmodel European neighbour. We have learned from past \nEuropean experiences that the proper and peaceful \nconduct of neighbourly relations is the foundation of \nlong-term peace and prosperity. That which Europe has \nachieved in the last fifty years, we seek to achieve in \nour neighbourhood in a much shorter time. That is our \ncollective challenge and common goal. \n It will come as no surprise when we say that there \nare still grave obstacles to establishing lasting peace in \nmy country. Reforms, especially when they are \ndemocratic, upset old interests and old habits. It is a \nsimple statement of political fact that there are frequent \nattempts to undermine our reforms, our progress and \nour democratic way of life. We must all beware of \nthose who believe that the presence of a stable \ndemocracy as a neighbour is threatening. Georgia\u2019s \ndemocracy \u2014 like all democracies around the world \u2014 \ndoes not wish to be seen as threatening. \n The painful truth however, is that in Georgia \ntoday we have inherited the brutal legacy of unresolved \nterritorial conflicts. Those conflicts undermine our \nstability and the stability of our region. In fact, that \ninherited legacy is directly responsible for the \nsystematic abuse of the fundamental human rights of a \nlarge portion of our population. Just imagine for a \nmoment, that children who find themselves victims of \nthose savage events are denied the right to learn or \nspeak their native language; that the elderly are not \nallowed access to adequate health care; that young \npeople cannot receive a proper education and that \nhundreds of thousands of people cannot return safely to \ntheir homes where they belong, from which they were \nsystematically ethnically cleansed and which in many \ncases have been illegally sold or destroyed.  \n Further, the painful, but factual truth is that those \nregions are being annexed by our neighbour to the \nnorth \u2014 the Russian Federation \u2014 which has actively \nsupported their incorporation through a concerted \npolicy of mass distribution of Russian passports \u2014 a \npolicy that is in direct violation of international law \nand is unprecedented. There are few more poignant \nexamples of one State seeking to annex the \ninternationally recognized sovereign territory of \nanother State and thus undermining the other State. \n Today, I would like to ask all of you in this Hall, \nif any Members in this great Hall would welcome \u2014 or \ntolerate \u2014 such interference by another Power on their \n \n \n3 06-53317 \n \nown soil. I doubt it. Yet, this is the situation we are \nfacing today in Georgia. These are the actions that we \nmust confront as we seek to consolidate and defend our \ndemocracy. Let us never forget that the victims of \nconflicts are real people, that the climate of fear that \nthey live in is pervasive and that their suffering must \ncome to an end. With those conflicts, we have also \ninherited frameworks for peacekeeping and formats for \nnegotiation that no longer function. Simply put \u2014 they \nneither promote peace nor do they encourage genuine \nnegotiation. If the purpose of our revolution was to \nguarantee to all citizens of Georgia the right to \nparticipate fully in the life and decisions of the State, \nthen our revolution remains unfinished. \n Today, in Georgia\u2019s conflict zones, we do not \nenjoy a status quo of stability and progress; that, \nunfortunately, is a popular fiction. Rather, we find \nourselves facing a deteriorating situation in which \nsponsors of crime and illegality are gaining the upper \nhand. Let us be clear: Georgia is a responsible \ndemocracy, and if we are to take that responsibility \nseriously, we must acknowledge that embracing change \nis the only path towards a just and lasting peace. \n The shortcomings of the current peacekeeper \nsystem are well documented. A few examples, taken \ndirectly from reports provided by the United Nations \nand the OSCE, demonstrate how Russian-dominated \nforces on the ground have served to perpetuate rather \nthan resolve the conflicts and how they have abused \nand made a farce of the principles of neutrality, \nimpartiality and trust. By choice, they themselves \u2014 \nnot we \u2014 have, in effect, annulled their own status. \n Since the deployment of Russian peacekeepers in \nAbkhazia, Georgia, more than 2,000 Georgian citizens \nof all ethnic origins have lost their lives in this zone \ncontrolled by peacekeepers, and more than 8,000 \nGeorgian homes have been destroyed. For more than \n12 years, Russian peacekeepers have been unable to \nfacilitate the return of more than 250,000 internally \ndisplaced persons to their homes in Abkhazia, although \nthis is explicitly stated in their mandate. \n The United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia \n(UNOMIG) and the OSCE have been cataloguing \nnumerous violations involving the transfer of heavy \nweaponry such as tanks, armoured personnel carriers, \nartillery, mortar, anti-aircraft systems and cannons to \nthe separatists, even as the Georgian Government has \nbeen taking action to unilaterally demilitarize. \n Russian peacekeepers have proved unable and \nunwilling to take any measures to halt such violations. \nIn fact, some of them have directly encouraged such \nviolations and assisted in them.  \n In South Ossetia, 18 illegal military exercises \nusing prohibited equipment were catalogued in the past \nyear alone. Many involved the direct participation of \nRussian peacekeepers. This is all well documented. \nUnfortunately, the list goes on. \n Imagine. In the village of Chubirkhinji, during \ntalks sponsored by the United Nations, an 8-year-old \nGeorgian boy saw his country\u2019s flag from the window \nof his school and exclaimed, \u201cLong live Georgia!\u201d At \nthat very moment, in front of live television cameras \nand in front of United Nations observers, local \nseparatist militias moved in, arresting every single \nteacher in that school and taking them to undisclosed \nlocations. That was done before the very eyes of the \ninternational community by the proxies of Russian \npeacekeepers.  \n Let us be under no illusion. The residents of our \ndisputed territories are under a form of gangster \noccupation whose hope is that the international \ncommunity will lose interest and reward the results of \nethnic cleansing. That cannot be allowed to happen. If \nwe stand by, we will have accepted the fact that \nindifference and illegality are the new rules of the \ninternational game. \n This leads me to the topic of Kosovo. As the \ninternational community seeks to find a just solution to \nthis decade-long issue, we must take stock of the \nextraordinarily counterproductive efforts made by the \nRussian Federation to abuse this unique situation for \nthe pursuit of narrow special interests. Here, too, we \nmust be very frank: any attempt \u2014 and many have \nbeen made \u2014 by Russian officials to create or suggest \na nineteenth-century-style solution involving deals and \nterritorial swaps in exchange for agreement on Kosovo \nwould be not only old-fashioned but deeply immoral. \n Mr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein), Vice-President, \ntook the Chair. \n I wish to remind all present that my country\u2019s \nterritories, just like yours, are not for sale or exchange. \nAny hint of a precedent for Abkhazia and South \nOssetia would therefore be both inappropriate and \nreckless. \n  \n \n06-53317 4 \n \n The foundation of modern peace and security in \nEurope is based directly on the principle of respect for \nterritorial integrity and sovereignty. Indeed, it is the \ncornerstone of the contemporary international order. \n If the Russian Federation persists in attempting to \nmake this dangerous linkage and undermine that \nfundamental order, the impact will be far-reaching and \na Pandora\u2019s box will be opened, unleashing violent \nseparatism and conflict not only in the Caucasus but \nacross many parts of our globe. We all must be aware \nof this. \n I must assure the Assembly that, because we are a \nresponsible democracy, Georgia will not allow this to \nhappen. To that end, we will, however, work in the \nspirit, and on the basis, of the values that govern all \ncivilized democracies. In this I do not believe that we \nare alone. It is our firm belief that, as Europe looks to \nintensify its relationship with its neighbours in the \nEast, there is a strong interest in avoiding instability \nand in rejecting the unravelling of sovereign statehood. \n It is with these goals and threats in mind that I \nwould like to share with the Assembly my thoughts on \nhow together we can frustrate the aspirations of those \nwho draw strength from the cynical politics of division \nand fear. Responsible nations have an obligation to act \naccordingly, and my Government is firm in its belief \nthat we need to transform and replace the current \nframework for negotiation and peacekeeping in \nAbkhazia and South Ossetia. It is therefore our solemn \nduty and sovereign right to replace ineffective \nmechanisms with ones that work, substitute partial \nforces with ones that are fair, and replace fear with \nhope, and mutual suspicion with newfound trust. \n Our efforts are guided by principles that are \nsimple, predictable and clear. We will consult, we will \ncooperate, and we will commit ourselves to avoiding \nany policy that is destabilizing. Our goal is the pursuit \nof peace and a peaceful resolution. \n But, again, let me be very clear. If we fail to unite \nin support of new mechanisms to advance peace, we \nwill give the green light to those whose intentions lie \nelsewhere, and we risk plunging the region into \ndarkness and conflict despite our best efforts to \npromote peace. \n That is why I am proposing today a fresh road \nmap aimed at resolving the situation whose goal is the \npeaceful reunification of my country within its \ninternationally recognized borders: a country in which \nall the diverse ethnic groups of Georgia \u2014 and \ndiversity is our strength \u2014 can live in peace and \nharmony, as they did for thousands of years, and enjoy \nthe fruits of democracy in a society that both protects \nand celebrates their unique heritage; a country that \ninvests in new schools, hospitals and roads, rather than \nin weapons and armaments. \n The essential elements of this package must \ninclude the demilitarization of Abkhazia and South \nOssetia, backed by the active engagement of the United \nNations, the OSCE, the European Union and other \ninternational organizations. It must include direct \ndialogue between the parties on the ground, and here I \nmean the central Georgian Government and the \nseparatist authorities, so that together we can assume \nresponsibility for resuming the dialogue for peace \namong peoples and among different communities. \nThese efforts can and will succeed through the \nestablishment of an international police presence in \nboth regions, backed, again, by the robust participation \nof the international community. Once such a force is in \nplace, we will be ready to endorse its mandate by \nsigning a comprehensive non-use-of-force pledge. \n More must also be done to restore trust and \nimprove living standards, and we are prepared to \nrehabilitate the economies of both regions, which is a \nnecessity. Why should our citizens be reduced to living \nin such miserable economic conditions? We are ready \nto contribute significantly to restoring access to the \nopportunities that the rest of Georgia\u2019s citizens are now \nstarting to enjoy. Additional confidence-building \nmeasures will also be implemented.  \n Today, the situation in Georgia is marked by both \nopportunities and threats. Every day there are new \nprovocations, and every day criminal elements \nconsolidate their hold \u2014 actions whose consequences \nwill have international implications. Examples include \nshooting at helicopters, as well as other incidents that \nhave occurred in recent days. \n As we move forward to replace and transform \nthose anachronistic mechanisms, we continue to stand \nready to work with our neighbour, the Russian \nFederation, because Russia must become part of the \nsolution. Consultations aimed at changing those \nmechanisms have already begun and will intensify in \nthe weeks and months ahead. \n \n \n5 06-53317 \n \n It is well established and universally accepted \nthat under international law Georgia has the sovereign \nright to request the removal of foreign military forces \nthat impede the peaceful resolution of conflict. We \nmake no secret of our intention to exercise that right, \nbecause it is based on the most fundamental principles \ngoverning a nation and the international community. \n It is in the spirit of the United Nations Charter \nthat we seek to bring the benefits of our democratic \nrevolution to all the citizens of Georgia and to every \ncorner of our country. \n It is with the deepest respect for this institution \nand on this occasion that I have chosen to signal not \nonly our desires, but also our concerns. Let no one ever \nsay that Georgia was not clear as to how it sought to \nprotect democracy and the State. Let no one ever say \nthat we sought to do so by other than peaceful means. \nThere is simply no other path for our country \u2014 or the \ninternational community at large \u2014 to follow. We \nchose to join the standard-bearers of civilized \ndemocracy; let no one ever say that we did not act \naccordingly. \n We assume that all nations which share these \nsame values are willing to make the necessary \nsacrifices for them, so that collectively we can achieve \npeace in our very important region. Let us, therefore, \nembrace this historic opportunity and not delay. "

        "file_text": "My delegation extends our \nheartiest congratulations to Ms. Al-Khalifa on her \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-first session. Her election signifies a most \nwelcome rebalancing of the General Assembly towards \ngreater gender parity and will certainly bring a breath \nof fresh air to our deliberations. We hope also that it \nwill help our Organization address those issues of war, \nconflict, oppression, deprivation and terrorism that dog \ntoday\u2019s world with the kind of compassion and \nsensitivity known only to mothers. I would like to \nassure her of my delegation\u2019s fullest cooperation and \nsupport at all times. \n The outgoing President, Mr. Jan Eliasson, applied \nall his wisdom and vast diplomatic experience in \npresiding over a session fraught with difficult and \nexceedingly complex organizational reform issues. We \nthank him for guiding us deep into the process and \nwish him well in his new assignment. \n We should not delude ourselves into thinking that \nreforming the United Nations is a task that can be \nachieved quickly. The issues are contentious and \nmultifaceted, and only deep reflection and determined \nnegotiation over time will see us through. For this \nreason, we should not feel disheartened that one year \nafter the World Summit we have still not concluded the \nprocess. We should congratulate ourselves on having \nachieved a breakthrough with the establishment of the \nHuman Rights Council and the Peacebuilding \nCommission. Management reform is problematic, but \nthe desire to achieve it in a fair and balanced manner \nwill remain a key demand of developing countries. A \nselective approach to reforming the Organization will \nwork in no one\u2019s interest. Some reforms are long \noverdue and sorely needed.  \n For us in Africa, Security Council reform is \nurgent and must be concluded as soon as possible. \nRecent events have demonstrated that the old \ndispensation is ill equipped to grapple with the \ncomplexities of the world we live in today. Reform, I \nrepeat, is urgent if today\u2019s Security Council is to be \nseen as poised to take on the new global peace and \nsecurity challenges facing mankind. \n We are gathered together at a time of great \nuncertainty and, for many, despair because of our \ncollective inability and lack of will to abide by the \nguiding principles of our founding fathers. We have not \nbeen too successful in preventing the scourge of war or \nin addressing the factors that give rise to war.  \n Rather than abating, the situation in the Middle \nEast continues to fester and, in fact, deteriorate, as the \nRoad Map leading to a two-State solution to the \nPalestinian-Israeli problem eludes us further. My \ndelegation has repeatedly decried the lack of will on \nthe part of the protagonists to work towards a speedy \nsolution to this problem, which continues to spawn \nmany other conflicts in other regions of the world.  \n It is a matter of deep regret that this world body \nwatched almost helplessly as a Member State \u2014 \nLebanon \u2014 was attacked and made to suffer extensive \ndestruction to infrastructure, property and human life. \nAlthough we have been able to bring about a cessation \nof hostilities, we cannot claim to have achieved peace. \nAll the conditions for a resumption of the conflict \nremain intact. We must address those conditions more \n  \n \n06-53341 26 \n \nresolutely. We must also do everything within our \npower to ensure that the problem between Hizbollah \nand Israel does not pull in other countries of the region \nand lead to full scale war between them and Israel. The \nconsequences would be disastrous for us all. \n My delegation condemns in the strongest terms \nIsrael\u2019s continued illegal occupation of Palestinian \nterritory and Arab lands, its intensive military \ncampaign in the West Bank and Gaza, which has \nresulted in untold civilian casualties and extensive \ndestruction of infrastructure, and its arrest and \ndetention of thousands of Palestinian civilians and their \nleaders. The Hamas Government in Palestine was \nelected democratically by the Palestinian people, who, \nby the tenets of democracy which we all claim to \nespouse, are the only ones who may freely choose their \nleaders. Or are we to understand that this basic tenet of \ndemocracy should apply only if the leaders chosen are \nto our liking and meet with our approval? I urge all \npeace-loving and democratic members of the \ninternational community to assist the Hamas \nGovernment to play its role as a representative of its \npeople in a responsible, democratic and dignified \nmanner. \n In Iraq, the unresolved conflict has now become \nuncontrollable and has all but degenerated into civil \nwar. We must look for imaginative ways of stabilizing \nthat situation and bringing the widespread killings, \ndestruction and suffering to an end. \n We must show leadership. Double standards have \naffected the effectiveness of our response to the peace \nand security needs of the Middle East for far too long \nand have only muddied the waters further. The people \nof the region must now enjoy some respite and be \ngiven the space to pursue their development in an \natmosphere of peace, tranquillity and security. It is \nbecoming increasingly clear that the only remaining \nhonest broker that can ensure that this happens is the \nUnited Nations. We must step up to the plate. \n Violence in Afghanistan appears to be re-\nescalating. The United Nations must join hands with \nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other \npartners to engage all concerned in dialogue, with a \nview to addressing the factors that are driving the \nhostilities to which the long-suffering people of this \ngreat country are subjected. \n While we must obviously intervene to contain \nand arrest raging conflicts, we must not be oblivious to \nthe need to pay equal attention to nascent conflict \nsituations. One such situation is that which is \nprevailing across the Taiwan Strait, where the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China has openly threatened Taiwan with \nmilitary intervention, should it as much as express an \nintention to declare itself independent. In addition, the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China has increased its arsenal of \nmissiles trained on Taiwan to over 800 warheads. It \ngoes without saying that a deterioration of the situation \ninto all-out war will only provoke an unwelcome mix \nof responses from allies within and without the region, \nresponses that could cause a conflagration that would \nmake the Middle East situation pale in comparison. \n In Africa, the good news is that peace continues \nto spread. From Sierra Leone and Liberia to Uganda \nand the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we are \nwitnessing a growing preference for non-violent \napproaches to conflict resolution. We should persist so \nthat this trend continues and embraces countries such \nas Somalia and the Sudan, with its Darfur imbroglio.  \n In Somalia, the central Government should be \nassisted to stand firmly on its own two feet and \nexercise control over the entire Somali territory. The \ninternational community must take every precaution to \nprevent Somalia from becoming a haven for terrorists \nand other extremists.  \n In the case of the Sudan, my delegation appeals \nto the brotherly people of that great country to \nintensify dialogue with the international community in \nits quest for a resolution of the Darfur crisis. In \nreaching a final decision on whether or not the African \nUnion Mission in the Sudan (AMIS) should pass the \nbaton to a United Nations peacekeeping force, we are \ncertain that, with a bit more effort on all sides, a way \nwill be found out of the present impasse. \n While we must all work in concert to fight \nterrorism, we must also endeavour not to lose respect \nfor fundamental human rights and civil liberties in the \nprocess. In addition, we must increase our cooperation \nin this fight and strengthen political and diplomatic \ninterventions in order to win it. No matter how many \nresources or how much firepower are committed to \ncombating the phenomenon, without international \ncooperation of this type, our efforts will come to \nnaught. Recent developments in countries like Iraq \nhave shown that to be the case. \n Last year, we all rededicated ourselves to the full \nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration. There \n \n \n27 06-53341 \n \nare ample indications today that the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) are not likely to be met in \nmost of sub-Saharan Africa if present trends continue. \nIt is clear that we must all do more to identify and help \nremove the bottlenecks that are inhibiting progress \ntowards them. We must address the serious capacity \nconstraints that circumscribe the development efforts \nof many an African country. We must help stimulate \neconomic growth through enabling policy measures \nthat empower our countries for greater and more \nmeaningful participation in world trade. We must make \nreal progress in the Doha round. We must increase \nforeign direct investment in the African economy. We \nmust honour our commitment to increasing official \ndevelopment assistance to 0.7 per cent of gross \nnational income. We must, in partnership, attack the \ngreat health scourges of our time, namely, HIV/AIDS \nand malaria. \n In the Gambia, United Nations and other \nindependent assessments indicate that, on many fronts, \nwe are making steady progress. We are committed to \nachieving the MDGs, in addition to the goals of the \nInternational Conference on Population and \nDevelopment.  \n We have reversed the spread of HIV/AIDS. We \nhave already achieved gender parity in education and, \nby extension, registered significant progress in gender \nequality, equity and the empowerment of women. We \nhave brought potable water and good sanitation to over \n70 per cent of our people. We have reduced the \nprevalence of malaria and the incidence of maternal \nand under-five mortality. We have attained 100 per cent \nchild immunization coverage. We have significantly \nincreased access to education at all levels and shall \nmeet the basic education goal, God willing, next year \nor the year after. Our sharpest focus is on poverty \nreduction, and we are determined to attain that goal \nbefore 2015. \n We have been able to achieve these gains, in spite \nof the severe resource constraints that we face, because \nof determined and committed leadership and our strong \nresolve to live up to our commitments to the \ninternational community. \n According to the expert assessments of the \nUnited Nations agencies, the Gambia is among the very \nfew African countries that will achieve the MDGs on \ntarget, if present trends continue. Our achievements in \nrelation to the development agenda have been made \npossible only through strong and genuine partnerships, \nwhich we hope will continue and will grow to meet the \ntask ahead. \n The trade policy of our Government continues to \nbe guided by the principles of liberalization, \nderegulation and investment promotion. We have \nbrought about a progressive reduction of tariffs and \ncontinued improvements in infrastructure to increase \nour competitiveness as a production and trade gateway \ninto West Africa.  \n We regard the private sector as an important \nengine of growth. Therefore, to further enhance its \ndevelopment, our Government has formulated policies \nfor the systematic strengthening of the small and \nmedium-sized enterprise sector of our economy. It is \nour hope that implementation of these policies will \nlead to the creation of conditions conducive to the \nspeedy attraction of high levels of foreign direct \ninvestment which will, in turn, stimulate the growth of \nemployment and incomes and lead to significant \nreductions in the incidence of poverty among the \nGambian people. \n We are conscious of the need for all our \ndevelopment partners to speak to us with one voice so \nas to increase coherence in the partnership. To this end, \nwe have this year encouraged our major multilateral \npartners \u2014 the World Bank, the African Development \nBank Group, the International Monetary Fund, the \nUnited Nations Development Programme and its \nMillennium Project \u2014 to work together with us in \ncrafting a coherent Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper \nwhich will form the basis for a coordinated framework \nof partnership in development. \n The President returned to the Chair. \n There are many commendable programmes and \ninitiatives designed to assist countries like the Gambia. \nThe Group of Eight initiatives for Africa, the Heavily \nIndebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative of the World \nBank and the International Monetary Fund, the Blair \nCommission for Africa, the Millennium Challenge \nAccount and the Third Tokyo International Conference \non African Development, inter alia, will have an \nimpact only if they do not raise the bar unrealistically \nhigh, such that the countries they are meant to assist \nare unable to meet the stringent criteria for gaining \naccess to the funds. If aid is to be meaningful, it must \nbe accessible, predictable and not fragmented. \nMoreover, a well-designed aid architecture that \n  \n \n06-53341 28 \n \ninvolves recipients in critical aspects of decision-\nmaking is part of the answer for achieving the much-\nsought effectiveness of official development assistance, \na subject of concern in the Paris Declaration on Aid \nEffectiveness. \n Yet, while those programmes and initiatives may \nencourage many least developed countries in their \nhopes for early relief, in reality, the accompanying \nenablers have not been forthcoming. The Doha Round \nis in limbo, our modest economic growth is being \nthreatened by unpredictably high energy prices, and \ndebt relief is still on the distant horizon. For many of \nus, it is one step forward before world economic trends \ntake us two steps back. Of even greater concern is the \nfact that this plethora of initiatives has hardly made a \ndent in the poverty situation in our countries. The \nblueprints are manifold, the responses too few. \nUnfulfilled promises only dash our hopes, leave us \nfrustrated and diminish our faith in the effectiveness of \ninternational partnerships for development. \n We in the Gambia continue to deepen our \ndemocracy. Just four days ago, the Gambian electorate \nwent to the polls to once again choose their leader in a \nfree and fair manner. Let me take this opportunity to \nconvey the thanks and appreciation of His Excellency \nAl Hadji Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh to the many \ndelegations that have expressed to him their \ncongratulations and best wishes on his resounding \nvictory at the elections. The President considers that \nvictory to be a mandate from the Gambian electorate to \ncontinue his service to the Gambian people and, \nindeed, to the international community at large. Our \nelectoral process has been acclaimed throughout the \nworld for its openness, fairness and transparency. \n The subject of the High-level Dialogue held just a \nfew days ago was international migration and \ndevelopment. For the very first time, we had the \ncourage to address that issue within the walls of the \nUnited Nations \u2014 and rightly so, for international \nmigration has been at the core of human history. It has \ndriven the spread of human knowledge and civilization. \nIt has enriched cultures and societies and caused \nmankind to make great leaps in science, technology, \nengineering and overall social and economic \ndevelopment. We are all migrants. Therefore, let us \napproach the issue of international migration with \nhumanity, tolerance, respect and compassion. \n Attempts to penalize or criminalize international \nmigration will not work. In our globalized village, \ninternational migration is an undeniable, positive and \nindispensable force for keeping the wheels of national \neconomies and human society in motion. We must look \nto the positive side of this natural human activity and \ndesist from actions that trample on the dignity of \nmigrants, as well as from acts of racism, xenophobia \nand abuse of human rights. \n As the saying goes, injustice anywhere is a threat \nto justice everywhere. For decades, extensive illegal \nand extraterritorial measures have been pursued against \nCuba, a small, friendly and democratic nation. They \nhave not worked and will never work. My delegation \njoins the vast majority of the members of the \ninternational community in calling for the lifting of the \ndecades-long embargo against Cuba in order to enable \nthe hard-working people of that great country to pursue \ntheir development aspirations in an atmosphere of \npeace. Let us all strive to live and let live.  \n By the same token, we must also urgently address \nthe question of Taiwan. The legitimate quest of the \npeople of Taiwan for a voice and standing in the United \nNations must be ignored no longer. Taiwan is an \nimportant actor in our global economy and contributes \nimmensely to global peace and security. It must be \nformally granted recognition as a responsible member \nof the international community. A simple way to grant \nthat recognition would be to give Taiwan its rightful \nplace in the United Nations. \n In that connection, the Government of the \nGambia wishes to strongly protests the General \nCommittee\u2019s violation of the rules of procedure on \n12 September this year by amalgamating two items \nproposed by its members into one agenda item, thus \npreventing members from participating in the \ndiscussion of those items. We will therefore require a \nlegal opinion from the United Nations on an expedited \nbasis to ensure that we are provided with the \nopportunity to engage in a debate on that issue, as we \nare duly entitled to do.  \n Before I conclude, let me salute, commend and \nbid farewell to one of Africa\u2019s outstanding \npersonalities, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, since \nthis will be the last General Assembly session during \nhis tenure as Secretary-General. President Al Hadji \nYahya Jammeh had the honour to pay tribute to him \nduring the Summit of Heads of State and Government \n \n \n29 06-53341 \n \nof the African Union held in Banjul in July. Therefore, \nI should like to say only that the Government and the \npeople of the Gambia salute his leadership, his astute \ndiplomatic skills, his demonstrated commitment to \ninternational peace, security and development, and his \nunswerving faith in the international system. \nMr. Annan\u2019s term as Secretary-General may be ending, \nbut I am sure that he will continue to be there for us \nand will willingly come to the rescue when we need his \nwisdom and vast experience in mediating complex \nglobal problems. We wish him well in his future \nendeavours, and we wish him and his family continued \ngood health and happiness in their new life. "

        "file_text": "We \nwish to congratulate Ms. Al-Khalifa for her election as \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \nsession, with the certainty that her distinguished \npersonal and professional qualities will ensure the \noptimum performance of the work on the agenda. This \nalso represents recognition of the necessary \nparticipation of women in the reforms of the United \nNations. I also wish to extend our special recognition \nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his \nresolute efforts and dedication to international peace \nand security, stability, human rights and development, \nin addition to his appreciable contribution to the reform \nof the Organization. \n The international community currently has \nchallenges that require our immediate attention. At the \npresent time, there are more than sixteen armed-\nconflicts in the world where the United Nations \nparticipates in peacekeeping operations. El Salvador is \npresent at some of these operations, concretely \ndemonstrating our belief in an international system of \nlaw, and in an international organization capable of \nresolving such conflicts that seriously threaten our \nstability. \n The situation of instability has an indescribable \nimpact in terms of the loss of human life, the \ndestruction of infrastructure, refugees, displaced \npersons and the shortage of resources needed for life. \nThis impacts the affected regions, as well as the \npolitical, economic and humanitarian condition of the \nentire international community. \n I have come to this rostrum to speak out in favour \nof peace and security in the Middle East, as well as \ndialogue and understanding, so that we can find timely \nand sustainable political and diplomatic solutions that \nsupport our belief in the right of the Israeli and \nPalestinian peoples to live in peace within secure and \ninternationally recognized borders. \n We welcome adoption of resolution 1697 (2006) \non 31 July and resolution 1701 (2006) on 11 August by \nthe Security Council and call for compliance with \nthose resolutions as they make possible a cessation of \nhostilities. This should represent the beginning of a \nnew phase in finding a negotiated political solution to \nthe conflict in Lebanon and in the Middle East. \n We are fully convinced that one of the keys to \nprogress towards peace in the Middle East is the \ndisarmament of all armed groups operating outside the \nlaw and Government control in the region, as well as \nthe exercise by Governments of full sovereignty over \ntheir territories. Here, we believe that it is essential for \nthe United Nations, in particular the Security Council, \nto continue to play a proactive and decisive role in \nfinding a lasting, comprehensive and sustainable \nsolution in the Middle East and to redirect the peace \nprocess. \n After a careful analysis of the international \nsituation, and of the Middle East in particular, my \nGovernment made the decision to move its ambassador \nfrom Jerusalem to Tel Aviv. We hope that this will \nmake a contribution to promoting the peace process in \nthe region and serve as an expression of our \ncommitment and respect for compliance with United \nNations resolutions. \n We do hope that this decision, in addition to \nmaking a concrete contribution to peace in the Middle \nEast, will also help to strengthen friendship and \nunderstanding between my country and Israel. We also \nwish to express our feelings of solidarity and \nfriendship to the Palestinian people. They can rely on \nEl Salvador to continue to seek peace, security and \nwell-being for the Palestinian people. \n Terrorism is a real and merciless threat against \nhumanity. Accordingly, I wish to reaffirm our vigorous \ncondemnation of all acts of terrorism in all their forms \nand manifestations, wherever or by whomever they are \ncommitted, irrespective of the objective sought. \n Today, more than ever, it is essential to strengthen \nand expand international cooperation to combat this \nscourge, within the framework of the rule of law, \nhuman rights and international humanitarian law. The \n  \n \n06-52737 28 \n \nUnited Nations has a historic opportunity to combat \ninternational terrorism through the recently adopted \nGlobal Strategy against Terrorism. The threat of \nterrorism is a daily reality, but the opportunity to deal \nwith it is in our hands. Let us do what we need to do to \nimplement this strategy and strengthen international \ncooperation in combating terrorism. \n El Salvador supports and participates actively in \nattaining these objectives. We continue to promote \nsuch action at the national level and hope that our \nlegislative assembly will adopt a law against terrorism \nin the next few days. \n Given the situation of the world as described, we \nwould like to take this opportunity to add our voices to \nthe call of the international community regarding the \ncelebration of the International Day of Peace, set by \nthe General Assembly on 21 September each year. The \nAssembly issued a firm appeal that during that Day all \nparties in conflict, wherever they might be, cease their \nfighting and observe a global ceasefire, leading to \nreflection about the adverse effects of war and the \nbenefits of peace. \n One of the most serious threats to peace, social \nstability, the security of citizens and economic \ndevelopment is the problem of organized crime. \nEl Salvador, together with other countries in Central \nAmerica, has been particularly affected by this problem \nin recent years. The expansion of the criminal activities \nof bands and gangs that act not only within countries, \nbut also beyond borders. They have become criminal \norganizations that not only commit individual and \ngroup murder, but also engage in extortion and terrorist \nacts related to transnational crime. They have \nfurthermore become involved in the trafficking of arms \nand drugs, human trafficking and money-laundering. \n El Salvador is aware of the dimensions of the \nproblem and its impact on society. For this reason, we \nare one of the main countries promoting a \ncomprehensive approach. Not only do we directly \ncombat these groups, but we also use preventive \nmethods, namely, rehabilitation and social \nreintegration. We are convinced that this task cannot be \ndealt with individually. What is needed is collective \naction and international coordination and cooperation. \n In this connection, we believe that this \nOrganization should consider the adoption of measures \nand mechanisms consistent with the instruments and \nprotocols that deal with organized crime, so that we \ncan achieve a broad international consensus aimed at \ncoping more effectively with this evil that, \nincreasingly, is threatening society in general. \nMoreover, we should develop policies and cooperation \nto this end. I would mention, in particular, programmes \nfor young people in high-risk situations or who are at \nodds with the law in our countries. \n Speaking of the reform of the United Nations \nmeans talking about the suitability and relevance of an \ninternational organization could respond adequately to \nthe opportunities and challenges of today\u2019s world. \n We believe that it is particularly important to \nbreak this stalemate in negotiations and settle as soon \nas possible the question of expanding the membership \nof the Security Council, both permanent and non-\npermanent members, so that it can be more \nrepresentative with respect to the current number of \nStates that are Members of this Organization. For my \nGovernment, this is a subject that is extremely \nimportant. Therefore, it is essential to make this \nimportant body more representative, to give it greater \ntransparency, to make it more democratic and \nlegitimate, particularly in the decision-making process \nfor important decisions. \n Also, recognition should be given to some of the \nreforms adopted, and we welcome the beginning of \nwork of the new Human Rights Council and the \nPeacebuilding Commission, of which El Salvador is \nhonoured and appreciative of being a part. Here, I wish \nto reaffirm the commitment of the Government of \nEl Salvador to respect and protect human rights, while \nwe make available to the Peacebuilding Commission \nthe experience gained by El Salvador in its successful \npeace process. This would initially apply to some \ncountries, such as Burundi and Sierra Leone, that are \nnow being considered with regard to which the \nCommission will be able to provide advice to the \nSecurity Council. \n In the life of nations there are always special \nquestions that determine direction and destiny as they \nmove towards their future. The question of the \nRepublic of China in Taiwan is one of those questions. \nEven though it is a political reality that has evolved in \nparallel with other States and embodies all of the \ncharacteristics needed to be a State, there is still failure \nto recognize its existence. This denies the right of 23 \nmillion people of Taiwan to be represented in \ninternational organizations and, in particular, the \n \n \n29 06-52737 \n \nUnited Nations. We firmly believe that the situation of \nTaiwan should be examined pragmatically in the light \nof the current political reality. The United Nations is \nthe proper forum to do so \u2014 not only because it should \nrecognize the right of the Taiwanese people to be \nrepresented, but also because a globalized world \nshould not allow exclusion or marginalization from \ninternational cooperation. Such cooperation \nstrengthens efforts to combat challenges and problems \nthat are common to all and could undermine the quality \nof life and obstruct the development of peoples. Here, \nwe reiterate the need to open up room for the \nrepresentation and participation of Taiwan in the \nUnited Nations, particularly in the specialized \nagencies, which by their nature are related to \nhumanitarian, economic and social questions. \n The President returned to the Chair. \n A subject of special interest for El Salvador is the \nstrengthening of international cooperation for \ndevelopment, particularly with a view to complying \nwith the Millennium Development Goals. In this \nconnection, we believe that, in order to implement and \nfollow up on our development plans, we must have the \nsupport of the international community so as to create \nfairer and more open conditions that would enable us \nto accede to technological resources, the transfer of \ntechnology, environmentally friendly technology, the \nsupport for the generation of technical capabilities and \nnew financial resources in favourable conditions. \nEl Salvador is firmly committed to attaining the \nMillennium Development Goals, as envisaged in our \nGovernment plan, and accordingly, we have made \nefforts and directed resources, primarily through \nnational impact programmes, together with \ninternational cooperation, with special focus on \neducation and health. \n Even though we agree that every country must \nassume fundamental responsibility for its own \ndevelopment, the developed States should contribute to \ncreating the opportunities needed to enable the \nrelatively less developed countries to reduce the \npolitical and economic impact of the social deficit, \nthrough the implementation of measures that will \nenable us to enjoy the benefits of free trade, economic \nglobalization and international cooperation and \nincrease our technical capacity and productivity. This \nmust include the commitment to give 0.7 per cent of \ngross domestic product as official aid to development. \nWe recognize and express our appreciation to the \ncountries that have already done so. \n In this perspective, we have warmly welcomed \nthe adoption of the General Assembly resolution on the \nfollow-up to the results of the 2005 World Summit on \ndevelopment. It is of great importance if we are fully to \ncomply with the Millennium Development Goals that \nwe have set ourselves. We firmly believe that low-\nincome countries and middle-income countries should \nnot be excluded from international cooperation and \ntechnical and financial assistance, whether bilateral or \nmultilateral, particularly those countries that have \nmaintained good responsible management of resources \nobtained through international cooperation and public \nfinance. However, despite the progress achieved in \nimproving the quality of life of our peoples, there are \nstill groups of populations that suffer from extreme \npoverty and require cooperation and international \nassistance to supplement the efforts we are making to \nattain those objectives. \n This could not be otherwise, given the fact that \nmiddle- and low-income countries continue to face \nchallenges in the development process. Therefore, we \nwould like to make a resounding appeal to the \ndeveloped countries, the middle-income countries and \nthe multilateral financial agencies to become real \npartners and strategic allies, so that we can overcome \nour problems and help us to promote the agenda for \ndevelopment and progress for our peoples. \n In this respect, I am pleased to announce that \nEl Salvador is planning to hold a forum next year of \nlow-income countries where we hope to unify criteria \nand positions on this subject, in addition to considering \nthe strengthening of cooperation and technical, \nscientific and financial assistance among participating \ncountries. On this occasion, we cordially invite middle- \nand low-income countries, together with donor \ncountries and development agencies, to participate in \nthis meeting. We hope that their participation and \ncontributions will enrich our analysis and will benefit \nthe middle- and low-income countries, which are \nfrequently excluded from development funds. \n My Government attaches great priority to the \nAgenda for Development, particularly to expand \ncoverage of basic services and generate opportunities \nfor productivity in those areas and communities where, \nbecause of their poverty indicators and their growth \n  \n \n06-52737 30 \n \npotential, we have felt that they deserve strategic \nattention. \n My country has been recognized for having \nadopted a series of measures to strengthen democratic \ninstitutions, economic freedoms and social investment. \nThis has gained us the confidence of the international \ncommunity, which we believe is indispensable for \nestablishing an environment conducive to mobilizing \nalternative sources of funding that can make possible \nsocial programmes aimed at reducing poverty. \n From the beginning of our term in office, we have \ndone much to seek innovative forms of cooperation, \nsuch as those offered by various millennium funds. We \nhave applied for Millennium Challenge Account \nfinancing for a country programme based on national \ndialogue and with the participation of our citizens. It \nwill be an integrated, comprehensive strategy directly \nbenefiting more than 850,000 inhabitants of 92 \nmunicipalities in northern El Salvador, thus \ncontributing reducing poverty in that region. \n No less important and closely complementary, we \nbelieve that international cooperation based on \nsolidarity encompasses the swapping of debt for social \nprogrammes. We welcome the proposals and decisions \nof some developed countries, which are supporting \nsuch mechanisms, especially in health and education, \nthereby encouraging countries that have honoured their \nforeign debt obligations. There is no doubt that these \nactivities strengthen democracy and freedom. \n We feel that despite the decline in oil prices, \ncontinued high prices are not only detrimental to the \nefforts of developing countries to improve and \nstrengthen our economies, because they make exports \nand imports more expensive, reduce income and create \ninflation. They also have a negative impact on chain of \nproduction, and on basic necessities and services, \nopening the way to the possibility of a worldwide \nrecession, which clearly would have political and \nsocial repercussions. We feel that oil should not be \nused as a tool to achieve goals of any kind, but rather \nas a means to strengthen the global economy in \ngeneral. It is important to define rules for creating a \nmore stable oil market and at the same time to enhance \nour efforts to find alternative sources of energy that are \naccessible and environmentally friendly. \n For El Salvador, migration is one of the priorities \non our domestic and international agenda. We have \ndecided to create, for the first time in the history of \nEl Salvador, the post of Vice-Minister for Foreign \nAffairs for Salvadorans Living Abroad, a high-level \nGovernment position within the Foreign Ministry, \nwhose main function is to serve emigrants through a \ncomprehensive, multidimensional policy. The vice-\nministry is operating successfully. Salvadorans living \nabroad are on the presidential agenda. Last week, the \nAssembly held a High-level Dialogue on International \nMigration and Development. El Salvador participated \nproactively and chaired one of the round tables. I am \nthankful for the confidence placed in us. \n Allow me to reaffirm what was expressed by the \nForeign Minister of El Salvador at the High-level \nDialogue. We stress the importance of this issue and \nthe need to continue discussions from a broad-based \nand positive perspective, which gives us a \ncomprehensive view and a higher level of \nunderstanding of the issue of migration as an \ninternational social fact. Migration gives rise to a \ndynamic and complex process involving various \naspects including flows of individuals, capital, goods \nand services. It involves rights and obligations, \norganization, assistance, cooperation, legal and \nlegislative processes, analysis, studies and research on \nthis issue, and subsequent oversight by the United \nNations system, as a complement to domestic, \nsubregional and continental efforts. \n I welcome the outcome of the Dialogue and \nexpress the hope that the United Nations will give the \nissue of migration human, just and balanced \nconsideration. \n On 16 January 2007, we will celebrate the \nfifteenth anniversary of the signing of the peace \naccords for El Salvador. Fifteen years ago, Salvadorans \nwere fully convinced that we were worthy of a better \nfuture and deserved a rebuilt, democratic country, a \ncountry of reconciliation and freedom for us and for \nour children. We can now be proud of our endeavours \nto genuinely fulfil the commitments made at \nChapultepec, whose spirit should prevail as we \ncontinue to strengthen democratic institutions in my \ncountry. \n I would like to pay public tribute to the entire \npeople of El Salvador for their dedication to the cause \nof peace and national reconciliation. I would also like \nto acknowledge the men and women who signed the \npeace accords, whose historic action was the basis for \nour present and future as a nation. Likewise, I would \n \n \n31 06-52737 \n \nlike to pay a special tribute to the United Nations for \nits work and for its effective mediation, which led to \nthe completion in 2003 of its work to monitor the \npeace accords, and to the countries of the Group of \nFriends of El Salvador for their important support for \nthe successful completion of the peace process. \n Today, the United Nations \u2014 an Organization \ncreated to promote and realize universal principles and \nideals that are still valid in our contemporary world, \nespecially the ideal of promoting progress for the \nmillions of persons throughout the world who struggle \ndaily to secure their basic rights, dignity and \nimportance as human beings \u2014 has a choice: either to \nossify and become anachronic, or to modernize and \nbecome an Organization that can deal more efficiently \nand effectively with the challenges of the twenty-first \ncentury in a complex, globalized and interdependent \nworld. \n It is clear that we all wish for a modern and \nviable Organization to meet the challenges together, \nbut Member States will decide whether the \nOrganization changes to fulfil its mandate, especially \nto maintain international peace and security and \npromote respect for human rights and economic and \nsocial development. \n Thus, it will depend on us whether the present \nand the future of the today\u2019s world will be based on \ndiplomacy or will be condemned to use force to resolve \ndifferences in international relations. This is the serious \ndilemma that we must resolve. The task is complex \nbecause of its size and ramifications, due in turn to its \ndiversity in the face of the phenomena of power and \nthe exercise of power. We hold the hope that reason \nand conscience will prevail over force and \ndomination \u2014 for the benefit of all humanity. "

Your experience and \ndiplomatic ability will ensure the success of this \nsession. \n I would also like to congratulate your \npredecessor, His Excellency Jan Eliasson of Sweden, \nfor the critical role he played in the reform of the \nUnited Nations, including the establishment of the \nHuman Rights Council and Peacebuilding \nCommission. \n I would also like to extend my congratulations to \npermanent representatives and experts, for their \npositive contributions during the long and arduous \nnegotiations. I take this opportunity to also \ncongratulate His Excellency the Ambassador of \nAngola, Mr. Ismael Gaspar Martins, for his election as \nPresident of the Peacebuilding Commission. \n Allow me to extend the congratulations of the \npeople and Government of Timor-Leste to the people \nand Government of Montenegro on their new \nmembership at the United Nations. \n At the outset of this sixty-first session, a great \nson of Africa and of the world, His Excellency Kofi \nAnnan, delivered his last report as Secretary-General \nof our Organization. In the complicated international \nlandscape of the past 10 years, he and his team \ncontributed significantly to the advancement of the \nnoble ideals of the United Nations in the world, \nincluding his decisive contribution to the independence \nand liberation of my country, Timor-Leste. \n Our people will never forget his decisive support \nand we wish much success to him and to Mrs. Nane \nAnnan, whom we honour for her contribution to the \nstrengthening the role of women in the world and for \nthe compassion shown to those who suffer. \n In July of this year, the Prime Minister of the \nConstitutional Government, Mari Alkatiri, resigned \nfrom his post and a new Government, under the \nleadership of Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta, was \nsworn in. \n Since our independence in May 2002 and until \nJuly of this year, significant gains were made in the \nestablishment of the institutions of the State and in the \ncreation of basic conditions to facilitate investment, \nboth national and international. \n The new Prime Minister, in his speech to the \nNational Parliament, reiterated his determination to \nimplement the following policies \u2014 reconciliation; the \nconsolidation of security and reform of defence and \nsecurity institutions; parliamentary and presidential \nelections before May 2007; the reduction of poverty, \neconomic growth and investment in rural areas; good \ngovernance; the finalization of the land border \ndemarcation between the Republic of Indonesia and \nTimor-Leste; and ratification of the agreement with \nAustralia, known as \u201cGreater Sunrise\u201d.  \n The Government will continue to implement the \nnational development plan, which was initiated by the \nfirst Constitutional Government, and will do all it can \nto attain the Millennium Development Goals as \noutlined at the Summit in 2000. \n  \n \n06-53952 16 \n \n In relation to political affairs, the Government, in \nconjunction with the Presidency, the National \nParliament, the political parties, the religious \ninstitutions, civil society and traditional society, will \nhold a national dialogue to recapture the confidence in \nour State institutions that was lost. \n Only yesterday, the Head of Government, \nMr. Ramos-Horta, met with the representatives of the \narmed forces who had been dismissed \u2014 now referred \nto as \u201cthe petitioners\u201d \u2014 to once again find a solution \nthat is in conformity with the laws of Timor-Leste and \nthat is acceptable to the various parties involved in the \nsituation. \n The Government of Timor-Leste is determined to \nproceed with the reform of the security and defence \ninstitutions, namely Falintil-FDTL and the National \nPolice Force of Timor-Leste. \n The National Police Force, an institution whose \nmandate it is to promote law and order, disintegrated \npartially during the recent crisis. A first group of 25 \nmembers of the Police Force resumed duty this week \nunder a mentoring scheme run by the United Nations \nPolice in Timor-Leste. The reconstitution of the \nNational Police Force as a professional, non-partisan \npolice force is critical to stability. \n As political leaders of a young nation, we \nacknowledge that not every decision made was right \nand that some decisions created discontent and were \npart of the cause of the demonstrations in April, May, \nJune and July of this year. \n We are all interested in carrying out a profound \nand honest reflection on the causes of this crisis. The \nPresident of the Republic, Mr. Kay Rala Xanana \nGusm\u00e3o, the Prime Minister, Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta, \ntogether with leaders of the Catholic Church and other \nreligious denominations, will co-organize a national \nconference based on our culture and traditional values, \nin which various actors, including civil and traditional \nsociety, will participate. \n(spoke in English) \n As a post-conflict country, we have recently \nexperienced a relapse of violence owing to institutional \nfailures of our defence and police forces, high levels of \nunemployment and wrong political decisions that we \ntook as leaders of a new country. As a result of the \nviolence, we had almost 150,000 internally displaced \npersons and almost 100 dead. Consequently, the \nPresident of the Republic, Mr. Xanana Gusm\u00e3o, the \nPresident of the Parliament, Mr. Francisco Guterres \nLu-Olo, and Prime Minister of the first Constitutional \nGovernment, Mari Alkatiri, had to request international \nhelp. Immediately, our closest neighbours, the United \nNations, members of the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN), the Community of \nPortuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP), and members \nof the Pacific Islands Forum extended their support in a \nvariety of ways.  \n We would like to take this opportunity to thank \nIndonesia, Malaysia, Portugal, Australia, New Zealand, \nJapan, China, the United States of America, Korea, \nKuwait, the CPLP, the European Union and Cuba, and \nmany other countries, for their invaluable support \nduring the recent crisis in Timor-Leste.  \n We also welcome the establishment of the \nIndependent Special Commission of Inquiry for Timor-\nLeste by Secretary-General Kofi Annan to study the \nevents surrounding the crisis and the allegations of \nhuman rights abuses. We commend the members of the \nSecurity Council for their support in the creation of the \nUnited Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste \n(UNMIT) pursuant to Security Council resolution 1704 \n(2006). We praise all United Nations and other \ninternational agencies currently based in Timor-Leste. \nWithout their support, our response to the humanitarian \ncrisis would not have been as successful as it is today.  \n The Government is fully aware that reconciliation \nand justice need to work hand in hand with \ndevelopment. This fiscal year\u2019s budget was increased \nby 122 per cent. It focuses on job creation, not only in \ntowns, but fundamentally in rural areas, where the \nmajority of our population lives. It is a budget for the \npoor. We hope that this new economic policy, \ncombined with the policies of reconciliation and \ndialogue, will help defuse the tension and will build \ncommon understanding and reinvigorate trust and \nconfidence in our common and shared future. \n As in difficult times in the past, we are \ndetermined to succeed and restore to the people of \nTimor-Leste the stability and peace that we need to \ndevelop our country and improve the living conditions \nof our people.  \n To achieve these goals, we also need the support \nof the United Nations and the international community \nat large to help organize and supervise the upcoming \nlegislative and presidential elections in our country. A \n \n \n17 06-53952 \n \nfree, transparent and fair election will definitely pave \nthe way for a stable political and social environment.  \n In the international arena, we have seen an \nincrease in violence, war and intolerance. Last week, in \nthis Assembly, on 21 September, the President of the \nPalestinian Authority, Mr. Mahmoud Abbas, made a \nstrong appeal to the international community to not let \nthe olive branch fall from his hand. The international \ncommunity needs to continue its strong support for the \nforces of peace and moderation in Palestine and for the \nPresident of the Palestinian Authority. The \ninternational community also needs to engage the \nelected Palestinian Government in order to find ways \nto guarantee a free and democratic Palestine living side \nby side with the State of Israel in peace and harmony. \n After many years of conflict and violence, the \npeople of Lebanon need a peaceful environment. We \nhope that the arrival of United Nations forces will help \nprotect that country\u2019s sovereignty and its territorial \nintegrity. \n In Darfur, Sudan, we require the sustained \nattention of the international community in order to \nbring to the people of Sudan the peace and stability \nthey need.  \n With respect to Western Sahara, we believe that a \ndialogue between the Government of Morocco and the \nleaders of the Polisario Front will help lead to a \nsolution in accordance with relevant United Nations \nresolutions.  \n As a small country, we believe that \nmultilateralism, dialogue, negotiations, democracy, \nhuman rights, respect for the Charter of the United \nNations, and respect for each others\u2019 culture and \nreligious values, are the best answers for today\u2019s \nchallenges and intolerance. We will continue to support \nall initiatives, such as interfaith cooperation and \ndialogue among civilizations.  \n After the Monterrey, Mexico, conference, in \nMarch 2002, many initiatives were taken to increase \nthe financial resources of developing countries, one of \nwhich was the Millennium Challenge Account. This \nyear Timor-Leste was selected as a threshold country, \nand we are working with Millennium Challenge \nCorporation members with a view to benefiting from \nthe grant funds. \n We commend President George W. Bush, his \nAdministration, our friends in the House of \nRepresentatives and Senate and the people of the \nUnited States of America for that great initiative. It \nwill definitely help to reduce poverty and promote \ndevelopment in our country and in other countries in \nthe developing world. \n We also commend the European Union and its \nCommission President, Mr. Dur\u00e3o Barroso, for its \ncontinuing support for developing countries, including \nTimor-Leste. \n As a least developed country and a member of the \nGroup of 77 and China, we share the common view \nthat the allocation of 0.7 per cent of the gross domestic \nproduct of developed countries to official development \nassistance is crucial, not only for development in the \nSouth, but also so as to maintain stability, peace and \nprogress in the world. \n We would also like to welcome the recent \ninitiative of Brazil and France to tax air travel in order \nto provide additional funds for financing development. \n In conclusion, I would like to say a few words in \nour national language, Tetum. \n(spoke in Tetum; English text provided by the \ndelegation) \n We would like to reiterate our thanks to all of \nyou, your peoples and your Governments for your \nsupport during the crisis. I pray to God to continue to \nprotect you, your Governments and your peoples. "

        "file_text": "I \ncongratulate you, Madam President, and wish you the \ngreatest success in this session. \n Four years ago I attended this global forum for \nthe first time to announce that Colombia was beginning \nan era of democratic security. I explained why security \nin our time is a democratic value without which \nfreedoms cannot prosper; it is also a centre of \nresources, in whose absence investment does not flow \nand the possibility of eliminating poverty and building \nequality remains elusive. \n  \n \n06-52988 6 \n \n Four years ago I explained to the Assembly why \nour concept of security is democratic and thus deserves \nthe support and confidence of all peoples and of the \nUnited Nations. \n I am aware that I could not address the Assembly \ntoday to propose a theory of democratic security; \nhaving been President of my country for four years, I \nfeel compelled to present the results of this policy. \nColombia has held four general elections and countless \nlocal elections over this period. The referendum and \nthe election of mayors and governors in 2003 were \nevents that tested our democratic meaning of security. \nThis year the presidential and congressional elections, \nheld on two separate dates under a high threat of \nterrorism, were nonetheless among the most peaceful \nin many decades. All political groupings enjoyed \neffective guarantees, regardless of their level of \nsupport for or opposition to the Government. \n Under democratic security, Colombia has elected \nmayors, governors and members of Congress of all \npolitical colours. Security has contained terrorism in \norder to give democracy free expression. \n There is still much to be done in the area of \nsecurity, and a definitive peace is not yet within sight, \nbut progress is undeniable. The effective protection of \nColombians translates into the reduction in the number \nof homicides, kidnappings, acts of terrorism, crimes \nand threats against journalists and trade union leaders. \nAll governors and mayors exercise their powers in \ntheir own jurisdictions, overcoming the nightmare of \nexile that many were subjected to as a result of terrorist \nactions that were not countered by the State. \n To guarantee the sustainability of security over \ntime, our citizens must give it credibility. Our task is to \nbuild credibility based on effectiveness and \ntransparency. Consequently, human rights are an \nimperative of security. In recent years we have \nincreased our security forces by 30 per cent, military \noperations have tripled, and at the same time \ncomplaints against the security forces have fallen by 38 \nper cent. This is all the more important because we are \na country with full internal democracy, completely \nopen to supervision and international criticism, as \nborne out by the presence of an office of the United \nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights. \n In spite of the work still to be done, the most \nimportant achievement is our citizens\u2019 positive \nassessment of security and the collective determination \nto consolidate it. \n We regard organized violence for fictitious \npolitical motives as terrorism, and security as the path \nto peace. When a country has a pluralist, vigorous and \nguarantee-granting democracy, armed actions against it \nare pure terrorism. To deny this would erase the \ndifference between armed combat against dictatorships, \nwhich merited the recognition of insurgent groups in \nother countries, and the violent aggression suffered by \nour democracy, which is terrorism. \n The demobilization of more than 40,000 members \nof violent groups, as a result of democratic security, \nand the efforts proposed by the country to reintegrate \nthem into constitutional life, prove that for us security \nis the path to peace and reconciliation. \n Talking about 40,000 demobilized is easy; \ntallying them up is very difficult; demobilizing them is \neven more difficult; and reintegrating them is a \nmonumental task. Amidst understandable controversy, \nwe have made progress in dismantling irregular forces. \nToday the vast majority of illegal self-defence \ngroups \u2014 which, together with the guerrillas, until two \nyears ago seemed like powers greater than the State \u2014 \nare demobilized, and a large percentage of their leaders \nare being held by our justice system. These results are \nmore eloquent than rhetoric ever could be. I must add \nthat the number of demobilized guerrillas is higher \nthan the number killed by official forces. \n I have come to the United Nations today to ask \nfor resolute support for our security policy and our \nreintegration programme. The violence in Colombia \nhas received much international media coverage, \nconstant criticism of the Government and little support \nto overcome it. It is time for the international \ncommunity to urgently call on violent groups to make \npeace without any further delay. The Government is as \nfirm in implementing security as it is rigorous in \nrespecting democratic rules, and is open and generous \nin looking for peace. A sincere willingness for peace \nwill not face governmental obstacles to a definitive \nreconciliation. \n The international community must support our \nsecurity policy more decisively. This will bring quicker \nresults from our overcoming violence and seeking \npeace. \n \n \n7 06-52988 \n \n The financing of violent groups by illicit drugs is \none of the fundamental aspects that differentiate those \ngroups from former guerrillas in other Latin American \ncountries. This criminal, bottomless and autonomous \nfinancing is the main obstacle to peace.  \n It grieves me to say that progress in the fight \nagainst illicit drugs has been small compared with the \nsacrifice made by the people of Colombia and the \nGovernment\u2019s willingness to eradicate those drugs. The \nnumber of extradited citizens, the confiscation of illicit \nwealth and the areas sprayed represent enormous \nefforts, but the results are not proportional. For the \nsecond straight year, we have a programme for massive \nmanual eradication, which will mean 70,000 hectares \nof coca destroyed. \n Production and consumption require a global \ncommitment transcending formal declarations, so as to \nincreasingly apply programmes that reflect actions of \nshared responsibility. \n There are successful alternative development \nprojects. A few weeks ago, the United Nations \npositively assessed the forest keeper families \nprogramme, which covers 43,000 rural families that \nhave replaced drug cultivation with protection of the \nforest and the growing of alternative crops. Some, such \nas those in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, offer \necotourism services. According to the United Nations \nOffice on Drugs and Crime, drugs have been \neliminated in 80 per cent of the area of the forest \nkeeper families, covering 2 million hectares. More than \n136,000 hectares of tropical forest have been \nreclaimed. Thanks to payments by the Government, \nthese families have already acquired more than 30,000 \nhectares of productive land. Nevertheless, to protect a \nhigh percentage of the Colombian Amazon jungle and \ntropical forest, we need to reach 120,000 families. That \nis a great budgetary challenge, requiring more general \nand decisive international support. \n The programme halts the cutting down of tropical \nforest and the Amazon jungle, which have suffered the \ndestruction of nearly 2 million hectares because of \ndrugs. I ask the world: why is there not less rhetoric \nand a greater and more effective commitment, so that \nColombia, which is absolutely willing to achieve it, \nmay finally and definitively overcome the scourge of \nillegal drugs? \n We Colombians do not want to be left with efforts \nand sacrifices; we require results. We are willing to \nrevise our strategy and improve it, but we need the \nentire world to get involved with us. I ask the United \nNations for additional efforts to help us find ways to be \neffective. \n We reiterate our enthusiastic commitment to meet \nthe Millennium Development Goals. Social cohesion, \novercoming poverty and building equity are essential \naspirations of our democracy. In 2002 poverty reached \nalmost 60 per cent of the population; in 2005 it was \ndown to 49 per cent. We will do everything possible to \nensure that it does not exceed 35 per cent by 2010 and \nto reach the goal of 15 per cent by 2019, the second \ncentenary of our independence. Fortunately, the Gini \ncoefficient is beginning to show a trend towards \ncorrection in income distribution. \n Our goals for the upcoming four-year period are \nambitious: achieving full coverage in health and basic \neducation and significant progress in basic sanitation \nand providing microcredit for 5 million poor families.  \n We want a modern democracy with security, \nfreedom, social cohesion, transparency and \nindependent institutions. This is our dream; this is what \nwe are fighting for. We want a nation without \nexclusions and without class hatred, with harmony, \nrectitude and prosperity; a nation in permanent \ndemocratic dialogue, with fraternity and without \ninsurmountable antagonisms; a nation integrated into \nmultilateralism, grateful for the efforts of the United \nNations, receptive to the international community\u2019s \nsuggestions and willing to share its experiences and \nimprove its results.

        "file_text": "Please accept \nmy congratulations, Madam, on your election as \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \nsession. I wish you every success. I should also like to \nexpress my sincere thanks to the President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixtieth session for his \ndedicated work and to wish him every success in his \nfuture endeavours. \n The world events that have taken place over the \npast 60 years are reflected more graphically in \nGermany than in almost any other country. Until 1989, \nthe wall and the barbed wire across our country \nsymbolized the division of Europe and the rest of the \nworld into two blocs. Since then, Germany has become \nthe embodiment of the successful overcoming of that \ndivision. \n Both division and the overcoming of division \nhave influenced our view of the world. For 45 years, \npeace in Germany was due largely to the friendship and \nthe political and military protection of partner \ncountries, which took their responsibility seriously. \nThat experience shaped the political outlook of \nGermans. That is why we, too, are now shouldering our \nresponsibility, both in Europe and in other parts of the \nworld. In the context of the United Nations, that means \nthat a reunited Germany believes it has an obligation to \ndo everything it can to support the Organization in \ncreating a more peaceful and more equitable world. \n German soldiers and police officers are taking \npart in numerous peace missions that are either led or \nmandated by the United Nations. In the Western \nBalkans, Germany has provided the largest contingent \nof peacekeeping troops in Kosovo and in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina. Germany is playing a prominent role in \nthe reconstruction of Afghanistan. Germany is leading \nthe European operation in the Democratic Republic of \nthe Congo and is supporting the first free elections \nthere in 40 years. Germany is engaged in the Sudan \nthrough its support for the African Union Mission in \nthe Sudan and the United Nations Mission in the \nSudan. And, at this very moment, German navy vessels \n \n \n29 06-53317 \n \nare on their way to the Lebanese coast, where they will \nreinforce the United Nations peacekeeping force. \nGermany will contribute up to 2,400 troops to that \npeace mission. \n Germany supports a policy of dialogue and the \npeaceful reconciliation of differing interests. We firmly \nbelieve that political conflicts cannot be resolved \nthrough military force or military victories. Peace is \nbrought about by engaging in political dialogue, \nestablishing economic ties and giving people tangible \nhope for the future. If the parties to a conflict are \nunable to overcome political divisions on their own, \nthe international community, represented by the United \nNations, has an obligation to help. That is the guiding \nprinciple of our foreign policy. \n As Minister for Foreign Affairs of a reunited \nGermany, I have been profoundly influenced by \nGerman and European history. On that basis, I have a \nconcrete mandate for German foreign policy: we must \ndo everything in our power to prevent the world from \ndividing once again into hostile blocs. Politicians in \nevery country have a responsibility in that regard. \nEveryone can \u2014 and, I believe, everyone must \u2014 \nmake a contribution. It is my firm conviction that \nanyone who instigates antagonism between people of \ndifferent cultures and religions is not living up to his or \nher responsibility. \n No one should interpret the involvement of \nGermany and its partners in the Balkans, in \nAfghanistan, in the Sudan and in Lebanon as an \naggressive global campaign waged by the West against \nIslam. In a world that has grown closer together than \never before, we do not need exclusion or polarization. \nRather, we need the courage to promote understanding \nand to engage in dialogue. \n In the Middle East, it is crucial, following \nSecurity Council resolution 1701 (2006), on Lebanon, \nthat we seize the opportunity to promote \nunderstanding. I call on all parties to the conflict in the \nregion to act responsibly. Those who want their \nchildren and grandchildren to live in peace instead of \nviolence, in safety instead of fear, in prosperity instead \nof poverty, must have the courage to embark on new \npaths rather than simply cultivating long-standing \nenmities.  \n The principles for a settlement are clear: Israel\u2019s \nright to exist, on the one hand, and the establishment of \na Palestinian State, on the other. Those were the core \nconcerns of the Road Map, to which, I am firmly \nconvinced, we must return. However, if we are to \nensure lasting success, we must do everything we can \nto include everyone involved, even if that seems a \nroundabout way to achieve our goal. Therefore, I hope \nthat we will succeed in persuading Syria to engage in a \nconstructive dialogue. We need stronger engagement \non the part of the international community, particularly \nthe Middle East Quartet. I welcome the Quartet\u2019s \nrecent meeting. \n In Afghanistan, the international community is \ndemonstrating how the principle of responsibility can \nbe put into practice in concrete terms. After 23 years of \ncivil war, political structures are now being developed. \nMillions of refugees have returned to their home \ncountry. Just as important, young people \u2014 including \ngirls \u2014 can go to school again. However, drug \ncultivation and the security situation pose a threat to \nthe progress that has been made, at least in certain \nregions of the country. We, the international \ncommunity cannot allow the successes to date to be \nbrought to naught. \n In the Western Balkans, too, war is a thing of the \npast; I am very pleased to note that that is so. The \npolitical and military commitment of the United \nNations, the United States of America, Russia and the \nEuropean Union has played a key role in this. In \nKosovo, the task now is to ensure that the two parties \nto the conflict take their responsibility for peace and \nstability seriously. A solution to the status of Kosovo, \nwhich has remained unresolved for many years, is \noverdue. Germany staunchly backs the efforts of the \nUnited Nations Special Envoy, President Martti \nAhtisaari. We believe that stability cannot be achieved \nif the will of only the majority population of Kosovo is \nexpressed. Kosovo Serbs must be guaranteed adequate \nprotections as a minority. \n We need only glance at a map of Africa to \nunderstand how important the peace and stability of the \nSudan and the Congo are for the African continent as a \nwhole. I believe that instability and conflicts in Africa \nalso have a direct impact on Europe. For this reason, \ntoo, Germany is supporting the United Nations in its \nefforts to find a solution to the conflicts in those two \ncountries. \n While the United Nations peace mission in \nsouthern Sudan \u2014 the United Nations Mission in the \nSudan (UNMIS) \u2014 has made an effective contribution \n  \n \n06-53317 30 \n \ntowards the implementation of the Peace Agreement \nbetween northern and southern Sudan, peace in Darfur \nis still a long way off. Neither the Sudanese \nGovernment nor rebel groups can be absolved of \nresponsibility for the humanitarian disaster in the west \nof the country. Nevertheless, I am firmly convinced \nthat a lasting solution to the conflict will be possible \nonly if we work with, not against, them. \n As members are aware, over the past few years \nGermany, together with France and Britain, supported \nby the United States of America, Russia and China, has \nbeen intensively seeking a solution to the conflict \nregarding Iran\u2019s nuclear programme. Let me state \nclearly that no one wants to deny Iran the right to use \nnuclear energy peacefully. Nor is isolating Iran the \nobjective of the diplomatic effort. On the contrary, we \nhope that Iran will become a reliable and responsible \npartner in the crisis-stricken Middle East. That is why, \non 6 June, we offered Iran a package aimed at far-\nreaching cooperation. The package includes proposals \nfor closer diplomatic, economic and security \ncooperation, and expressly acknowledges Iran\u2019s right \nto use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. \n However, the international community also \nrightly expects cooperation and transparency from Iran. \nIf Iran were to prove that the suspicions of the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are \nunfounded and if it sent a clear sign that it truly intends \nto use its nuclear programme for peaceful purposes \nonly, that could open the door to a development which \nbenefits the people of Iran and the entire region. \n It is now up to the Government in Tehran to face \nup to its responsibility. The decision in favour of peace \nand stability in the entire Middle East requires courage. \nI call upon Iran to end the current phase of \nprocrastination and give a clear sign of trust so that we \ncan look to the future together and can finally sit down \nat the negotiating table. \n Resolution of the nuclear dispute with Iran is \nurgent. However, the challenges of the proliferation of \nnuclear weapons go far beyond that. We must act now \nif we want to halt the erosion of the non-proliferation \nregime. The next attempt to implement the Treaty on \nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons must not \nfail. \n Not only Iran but also other countries are \nthinking about developing enrichment technology. We \nwill have to develop new instruments if we want to \nprevent such risks from arising. \n I am therefore strongly in favour of not merely \nexchanging ideas on the multilateralization of the fuel \ncycle and transferring responsibility for uranium \nenrichment to the international community, but of \nfurther developing such ideas into concrete options. I \ntherefore appeal for greater efforts to find solutions, \nworking together with the IAEA. \n The conflicts in the Middle East, Afghanistan, the \nWestern Balkans and the Sudan, and the dispute with \nIran, as well as the fight against international terrorism, \nhave one thing in common: in none of those cases is \nthe West taking a hostile stance against Islam. Nor do \nthey involve a clash of civilizations. Rather, they are \nvery diverse conflicts involving diverse interests. \n I believe that there is just one link, albeit a very \ndifferent one: each one of those conflicts can be \nresolved only with a willingness and ability to engage \nin dialogue. That is because dialogue gets everyone \nconcerned involved, engages them and does not allow \nthem to shirk their responsibility for resolving a \nconflict. However, a policy of cooperation and \ndialogue does not mean talking at any cost. Those who \nwant to engage in dialogue must meet some basic \nprerequisites. In my view, these include a readiness to \nbring about a peaceful reconciliation of interests \u2014 \nthat is to say, they must be prepared to renounce \nviolence and respect the position of the other side \u2014 \nand their own position must be consistent and credible. \nIf these prerequisites are not met, then no dialogue \nwith any chance of success can get off the ground. \n I am firmly convinced that a dialogue beyond \ncultural borders can succeed because, despite all of our \ndifferences, we are living in one world. The various \ncultures of the world have more in common than \npolitical rabble-rousers would have us believe. People \neverywhere have the same fundamental interests: they \nwant to live in peace and security, free from poverty. \nThey want good health care and good schools for their \nchildren. No responsible Government would ever want \nto withhold these from its people \u2014 nor should they \never be allowed to try to do so. \n The United Nations and its agencies and \nprogrammes embody this vision \u2014 and it is this vision \nthat makes the United Nations so indispensable. I am \nconvinced that we will need the United Nations more \nthan ever in the coming decades. The number and the \n \n \n31 06-53317 \n \nscale of crises in the world are increasing. That could \nbring about a renaissance of the United Nations even in \ncountries that are sometimes still sceptical about the \nworld Organization. \n The effectiveness of the United Nations, its \nability to act and the confidence it inspires as the \ninternational community\u2019s main multilateral \nOrganization are closely connected. Everyone can see \nhow necessary transparent structures and effective \ninstitutions are for the United Nations. The reform of \nthe United Nations \u2014 the entire Organization, not just \nthe Security Council \u2014 should not, therefore, simply \nremain on the agenda; concrete progress must be made. \n We see the expectations placed on the United \nNations rising. This is especially urgent in the case of \nthe review of mandates, as well as management and \nfinancial reform. Germany pledges to support this \nendeavour, because we must reform if we, as members \nof the international community, wish to remain \neffective. We owe that not only to the United Nations \nbut, above all, to the people in whose name we \nshoulder responsibility together. "

        "file_text": "I \ncome before the General Assembly as the first woman \nto be elected President of Chile, a country that has \nlearned from its history. \n We Chileans are living through difficult times; \nthe Assembly knows this. The learning curve was \ndifficult but productive. From pain hope was born. \nMajor dissent gave way to major consensus. I come \nfrom a country where today the rule of law prevails, \nwhere the rights of persons are respected and \npromoted. It is a democracy that is experiencing \neconomic growth, which in the past 16 years has \nhelped millions of Chileans out of poverty. Chile \nstands with its region and looks at the world. My \npresence here today is a symbol of that Chile, a Chile \nthat is unafraid to look back at the past and is united in \nbuilding its own future. We can say with pride that \ntoday Chile is more free and more fair. As a society we \nhave granted every citizen the basic dignity and respect \nthat he or she deserves. \n The world looks different from the far distant \nsouth, and that is the viewpoint my country wishes to \nbring here, a viewpoint that is optimistic about the \nopportunities of globalization but cautious about its \nrisks. We can and must steer the course of the planet. \nHumans cannot and must not avoid being the \ninstruments of their own advancement. \n We wish to reaffirm our commitment to \ninternational law and institutions. Only through them \nshall we be able to build the fairer and more integrated \nworld of which we dream, where large and small \ncoexist in peace and harmony. The United Nations is a \nspecial instrument in this construction. A year ago we \nagreed on a programme for the reform of the \nOrganization based on development, security and \nhuman rights. This has been called the millennium of \nhope. Let us make that hope a reality and do so from \nhere, from this forum. \n  \n \n06-52879 6 \n \n Development is a responsibility shared by all \nmembers of the international community, including the \ndeveloped countries. Its attainment requires \nimagination and the political will to consolidate the \nworld alliance endorsed by the Millennium \nDeclaration. All this presupposes a more open, \ntransparent and fair commercial and financial system. \nTo our developed friends I say \u201cOpening your markets \nto products from the south is a requirement of justice.\u201d \nThat will represent a huge step forward towards the \nelimination of poverty. Let us therefore redouble our \nefforts to bring the Doha Round to a successful \nconclusion and make progress in integration processes \nat the regional level. \n As an early supporter of the idea of President \nLula of Brazil, Chile joined other countries in the \ninitiative Action against Hunger and Poverty. We have \nintroduced a solidarity tax of $2 on international airline \ntickets, and the funds produced will finance the \nInternational Drug Purchase Facility (UNITAID) \nproject, which will provide millions of quality drugs to \npeople in developing countries suffering from malaria, \ntuberculosis and AIDS. \n The most serious failure of the 2005 Summit was \nits silence on the multilateral disarmament agenda. \nChile bases its multilateral foreign policy on the \nprinciple that collective security is indivisible. We all \nshare a responsibility to preserve peace and \ninternational security. That is why Chile has joined in \nefforts to revitalize the disarmament agenda and move \ntowards prohibition of the use of fissile material for \nmilitary purposes. \n The security of States is linked to the security of \nthe human beings that make up those States, because it \nallows the exercise of freedom. Terrorism negates these \nfreedoms and runs counter to the values that we share. \nAccordingly, we support the advance of United Nations \nreform in the area of counter-terrorism. Terrorism must \nbe combated within democracy. Whenever we restrict \nconstitutional guarantees and yield to the temptation to \nemploy illegal methods to fight terrorism we are \nhanding a victory to its proponents, because it is only \nthen that they succeed in threatening the spirit of our \ndemocracy. \n In a spirit of solidarity we are participating \nactively in the United Nations Stabilization Mission in \nHaiti (MINUSTAH). Chile will continue to support the \nHaitian people, and I appeal from this rostrum to all \ndonor countries to provide the economic and financial \nassistance already pledged. \n The creation of the Peacebuilding Commission \nwas undoubtedly one of the most outstanding \nachievements of the 2005 Summit. Chile has joined \nenthusiastically in the work of the Commission and \nwill endeavour to ensure that its results live up to the \nhopes placed in it by nations. \n My country deplores the serious crisis affecting \nthe Middle East and strongly condemns any armed \naction targeting innocent civilians. Self-defence may \nbe exercised only within the framework of \nproportionality and containment outlined in \ninternational humanitarian law. The delay in the \nSecurity Council\u2019s call for a ceasefire in Lebanon was \nalso inconsistent with the letter and spirit of the \nCharter. The credibility of the Organization requires \nthat all stakeholders do their duty without \ndiscrimination and without subordinating collective \nsecurity to their individual interests. \n Chile supports the deployment of the United \nNations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) with its \nexpanded mandate, and will continue to respond to the \nappeal to meet urgent humanitarian needs in Lebanon \nand Palestine. We urge full implementation of Security \nCouncil resolution 1701 (2006), which calls on the \ninternational community to cooperate in a full \ncessation of hostilities in the Middle East, the \nrestoration of Lebanon\u2019s sovereignty over its territory \nand the guaranteeing of Israel\u2019s security. \n The promotion and defence of human rights and \ndemocracy is the cornerstone of Chile\u2019s foreign policy. \nAs I said at the outset, we have learned a great deal \nfrom our own history. Exactly 30 years ago the General \nAssembly received terrible news: Orlando Letelier, the \nformer Foreign Minister and Defence Minister of \nPresident Allende, had been brutally murdered on the \nstreet in Washington D.C. Representatives were \nhorrified by that crime and today I remember with \nemotion how we felt. I mention that to illustrate how \nwe have learned the lessons of the past. Nothing \njustifies the violation of human rights. Chile rejects \nimpunity. \n I assure all members of our commitment and \nenthusiasm to participate in initiatives designed to \npromote human rights and democracy. We therefore \nwelcome the launching of the United Nations \nDemocracy Fund and the creation of the Human Rights \n \n \n7 06-52879 \n \nCouncil. We very much value the Council\u2019s adoption of \nthe International Convention for the Protection of All \nPersons from Enforced Disappearance. \n The promotion of human rights does not \ncontradict the principle of non-intervention in the \ninternal affairs of States. Chile has been, and will \nremain, in the front line in the defence of human rights. \n The General Assembly must continue United \nNations reform. It must revitalize itself, reform and \nexpand the Security Council, reform the Economic and \nSocial Council and modernize the management of the \nSecretariat and the administrative procedures of the \nOrganization. \n Allow me to reaffirm our hope in the United \nNations. As a woman, a doctor and the political leader \nof a developing country, today I ask that we choose \nlife, affirm justice, promote social justice and make \nthis noble Organization the common and continuing \nresponse to our peoples\u2019 dreams of peace, development \nand dignity.

        "file_text": "The Tongan delegation \njoins others in congratulating you, Madam, on your \nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly. \nLet us reassure you of Tonga\u2019s full support and its \nconfidence that the sixty-first session of the General \nAssembly will be productive and successful under your \nvery able leadership. Full recognition is also in order \nfor the excellent work of your predecessor, His \nExcellency Mr. Jan Eliasson, during the sixtieth session \nof the General Assembly. In the same vein, the Tongan \ndelegation takes this opportunity to commend and \nextend its gratitude to the outgoing Secretary-General, \nHis Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, for his tireless service \nover the past 10 years in the stewardship of the \nOrganization. \n It has been a year since our leaders met at the \nhistoric World Summit in an effort to embrace the \nrealities of the world we live in and to duly reflect \nthose challenges in the work of the Organization. We \nare pleased that there are specific landmarks that attest \nto the fact that some progress has been made in the \nimplementation of the 2005 Outcome Document \n(resolution 60/1). They include the inauguration of the \nPeacebuilding Commission, coupled with the \nestablishment of the Peacebuilding Support Office and \nthe Peacebuilding Fund; the creation of the Human \nRights Council; and the establishment of the Central \nEmergency Response Fund. \n Mr. Chidyausiku (Zimbabwe), Vice-President, \ntook the Chair. \n Tonga also welcomes the adoption of the United \nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution \n60/288), which forms a basis upon which we can build \nour consistent and unequivocal condemnation of \nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations \u2014 \ncommitted by whomever, whenever and for whatever \npurpose \u2014 for terrorism constitutes one of the most \nserious threats to international peace and security. We \nlook forward to the effective implementation of the \nStrategy, as well as to the conclusion of a \ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism \nduring the sixty-first session of the General Assembly. \n Tonga also remains committed to supporting the \nwork of the Counter-Terrorism Committee. We duly \nrecognize the efforts undertaken to consolidate States\u2019 \nreporting requirements. We also wish to acknowledge \nthe cooperation provided by bilateral, regional and \nmultilateral agencies in helping to fulfil international \nand regional commitments to combat transnational \norganized crime and to fight terrorism. \n Tonga shares the call for the full restoration of \nthe role of the General Assembly as the main decision-\nmaking, representative and policy-making body of the \nUnited Nations, in accordance with the provisions of \nthe Charter. That would further enhance the credibility \nof multilateralism and the important need to address \nthe multifaceted and interconnected challenges and \nthreats confronting the world. \n Tonga supports the work pertaining to the \nremainder of the reform mandates, especially as \n  \n \n06-53958 4 \n \nregards Secretariat and management reforms, the \nstrengthening of the Economic and Social Council and \nthe strengthening and streamlining of management in \nthe Organization. \n The important issue of the reform of the Security \nCouncil still remains unresolved, although world \nleaders acknowledged that it was an essential element \nof our overall effort. Tonga supports the call by the \nSecretary-General in his annual report (A/61/1) to find \ncommon ground for action on this fundamental piece \nof overall United Nations reform, as well as his urging \nthat a decision on Council reform be taken sooner \nrather than later in order to ensure that the United \nNations machinery to promote the establishment and \nmaintenance of peace and security will remain relevant \nand credible to meet today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s \nchallenges. Tonga continues to support Japan\u2019s \nassumption of its proper and permanent place in any \nenhanced Council.  \n Tonga commends the contributions of United \nNations peacekeepers in fulfilling the Organization/s \nvital role in helping parties in conflict to end \nhostilities. To the degree that it is able, Tonga is \ncommitted to supporting both international and \nregional peacekeeping efforts, including the current \nRegional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands. \n For many island developing countries, including \nmy own, the development agenda remains a top \npriority. In that regard, the theme of the sixty-first \nsession of the General Assembly, \u201cImplementing a \nglobal partnership for development\u201d, is not only very \npertinent but also very timely. While we reiterate that \nwe take primary responsibility for our own \ndevelopment, we continue to welcome as a necessary \nstep the maintenance and enhancement of support at \nthe regional and international levels to complement our \nnational efforts. That includes the support provided \nunder the Pacific Plan to strengthen regional \ncooperation and integration, which was endorsed by \nPacific leaders in 2005, as well as the implementation \nof the Mauritius Strategy for the Further \nImplementation of the Programme of Action for the \nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing \nStates. \n Tonga looks forward to progress in the work to \nenhance mechanisms to promote coherent United \nNations support to small island developing States \nthrough a strengthened inter-agency consultative \nprocess, the finalization of a strategy for resource \nmobilization and the promotion of partnership \ninitiatives. \n In May of this year, His Majesty\u2019s Government \nratified its Strategic Development Plan 8, entitled \n\u201cLooking to the future, building on the past\u201d, which \nsets out the Government\u2019s road map for the Kingdom\u2019s \nfuture development path for the period 2006-2007 to \n2008-2009. The document was formulated following a \nlengthy and extensive process of consultation with all \nof the relevant stakeholders. It provides due \nrecognition to the fact that the success of the \nimplementation of the Development Plan will require \nthe efforts of both State and non-State actors. \n The President of the General Assembly has \nrightly observed that the recent historic High-level \nDialogue on International Migration and Development \nrevealed the potential and opportunities that \nglobalization presents as a force for improving the \nlives of millions of people. The meeting provided \nTonga, a mature migration-remittance economy, with \nthe opportunity to showcase the important nexus \nbetween migration and development. \n A study recently produced by the World Bank \nconcluded that, for Tonga, recipient household \nmigration and remittances have positive impacts on \nmigrant-sending countries through improved income \ndistribution and poverty alleviation, induced higher \nsavings and stimulated business activities, resulting in \nlarger investments in education. The study also \nhighlighted that improved and restricted, but \norganized, labour mobility can significantly contribute \nto a country\u2019s gross domestic product and to overall \nglobal income. Labour mobility is therefore a potential \nvehicle for achieving our commitment to pro-poor \nstrategies such as the Millennium Development Goals \nand other commitments, and also for achieving national \nsustainable development strategies. \n The suspension of the Doha round of trade talks \nwas disappointing. The failure to conclude the talks \nwill negatively affect global economic prospects and \nthe growth of low-income countries, including Tonga. \nWe join others in urging World Trade Organization \nmember countries to maintain their commitment to the \nrules-based multilateral trading system, preserve \nprogress that has been achieved and to continue with \nthe negotiations. We also continue to urge the donor \ncommunity to move forward with the delivery of aid \n \n \n5 06-53958 \n \nfor trade, independent of the Doha round. Regional \ncooperation on trade-related projects has the potential \nto promote the competitiveness of low-income \ncountries, such as the island economies of the Pacific. \n In October 2005, Tonga\u2019s Legislative Assembly \npassed a motion to establish a National Committee of \nthe Kingdom of Tonga on Political Reform. With the \nsupport of His Majesty\u2019s Government, the Committee \nchaired by His Late Royal Highness Prince \nTu\u2019ipelehake has completed public meetings and \nconsultations throughout Tonga as well as in the \ncountries where the majority of Tongans reside, \nnamely, New Zealand, Australia and the United States \nof America. It is anticipated that the report will be \ndeliberated upon by the Legislative Assembly during \nits 2006 session and by His Majesty\u2019s Government \nwith a view to attaining an appropriate political reform \nagenda that is not only responsive but also responsible \nfor fulfilling the objectives of building national unity \nand promoting the social and economic advancement \nof the people of Tonga.

        "file_text": "The previous session of the \nGeneral Assembly created high expectations for reform \nand comprehensive renewal that would ensure the \ncontinued success and relevance of the United Nations \nwell into the twenty-first century. Thanks to the \ninitiatives launched by the Secretary-General, today we \nhave the Peacebuilding Commission; the Central \nEmergency Response Fund; the recognition of a \ncollective responsibility to protect, where a State fails \nto protect its citizens from genocide and crimes against \nhumanity; and a new Human Rights Council. Lithuania \nis committed to work to ensure that the new Human \nRights Council can strengthen the protection and \npromotion of human rights around the world. \n It is said that State-building is a long and difficult \nprocess. That is precisely why United Nations \nassistance in this area is much needed. The \nPeacebuilding Commission brings renewed hope that \npost-conflict countries can avoid slipping back into \nchaos. But institutions alone do not count if they are \nnot supported by political will. Strong international \ncommitment is necessary in offering hope of a better \nlife wherever nations are struggling to get back on their \nfeet. \n Lithuania\u2019s lead in a Provincial Reconstruction \nTeam in Afghanistan has given us first-hand \nunderstanding of the vital importance of the \nsustainability and continuity of such efforts. However, \nwhether in Afghanistan or elsewhere, our efforts will \nbe successful only to the extent that the nations \nthemselves are fully engaged in post-conflict State-\nbuilding and rational, market-sound economic \ndevelopment. Today, we welcome an increasing Afghan \ncapacity to rebuild the country, and we are encouraged \nby the expansion of the International Security \nAssistance Force area of responsibility. On the other \nhand, the challenges ahead will require ever-increasing \nfocus and further efforts on the ground. \n The tragic events in the Middle East over the past \n12 months have vividly demonstrated the human and \nfinancial costs of inability to reach compromises and \nfinal solutions regarding problems that have divided \nsocieties and poisoned the region for long years. Thus, \nthe effective promotion of a comprehensive peace plan \nin the Middle East is topical as never before. Security \nCouncil resolution 1701 (2006) and major donor \nconferences offer hope for the development of a \nsovereign and strong Lebanon. Let us make this a \nreality by pooling our efforts and contributing to this \ncause today, not tomorrow. The two States of Israel and \nPalestine living side by side in peace is our goal. \n Few security issues are as dramatic as terrorism, \nwith its indiscriminate targeting of civilian lives in an \never-expanding geography. Five years ago, the people \nof this very city suffered a brutal and cold-blooded \nattack on the values of humanity and tolerance that \nforever changed the world as we knew it. It is therefore \nessential that we unite our efforts to ensure that this \nnever happens again. We welcome the Assembly\u2019s \nadoption of the United Nations Global Anti-Terrorism \nStrategy (resolution 60/288), and we call for the \ncompletion of work on a comprehensive convention on \ninternational terrorism as soon as possible and for its \nbeing put into practice. \n To succeed in our fight against terrorism, we \nmust not yield to fears that separate; instead, we must \nbuild on our common humanity. We therefore hope the \nAlliance of Civilizations will become an integral part \nof our interaction, promoting solidarity, inclusion and \nunderstanding and reinforcing the values and principles \nwhich extremists seek to undermine. \n Furthermore, we should redouble our efforts to \ntackle the issue of disarmament and non-proliferation. \nAs we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the \n  \n \n06-53005 8 \n \nchallenges to non-proliferation continue to mount. \nLithuania strongly supports the strengthening of the \neffectiveness and efficiency of the IAEA Safeguards \nSystem. Compliance with the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty and the relevant Security Council \nresolutions is a key to global security. We therefore call \non all States to exercise full compliance in this area, \nvital to our common peace and security. \n At the same time, security, as it is typically \ndefined, has a broader meaning now. We should deal \nwith climate change, energy security and dire water or \nfood shortages with equal attention. \n We must be firm in our common fight against \nterrorism, but we must be just as firm in fighting \npoverty and upholding the dignity of the individual. We \nneed to put the available resources to the best possible \nuse, such as ensuring significant progress in the \nimplementation of the internationally agreed upon \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). \n Lithuania is proud to follow up on these \ncommitments. As a new donor country, we know that it \nwill take time to measure up to the high expectations in \nthe field. We provide increasing amounts of advice and \nassistance, in more and more places. Over the past year \nalone, our development aid has grown by 60 per cent. \nWe are determined to further increase our aid and \ndiversify its geography. We remember what it meant to \nreceive help when we needed it, and we know and \naccept the responsibility to now help others in our turn. \n Only a comprehensive approach can ensure that \nthe inextricable link between security, development, \nand human rights that we all agreed on will translate \ninto a real and positive impact on the lives of countless \nmillions of human beings around the world. \n As we pursue the commitments already \nundertaken, we must look beyond tomorrow to be able \nto empower the United Nations to deal successfully \nwith the challenging diversity of issues and concerns of \nall our nations. \n It is natural that in debating such vital issues as \nthe reform of the United Nations, we, the Member \nStates, have disagreements. However, we should also \nremember that, while we discuss our disagreements \nhere in New York, millions of the poorest are suffering \nfrom degrading starvation, millions of children are \ndying from preventable diseases, and millions of \npeople have nothing to rely on but the United Nations \nto protect them. If we want the United Nations to \neffectively deal with development challenges, counter \nnew deadly threats and restore the value of human life \nto countless people around the world, an ongoing \nchange is a must. \n I therefore urge the United Nations to continue in \nthe vital areas of management reform and mandates \nreview in order to increase the Organization\u2019s \nefficiency and effectiveness for the benefit of all. \n We also urge strengthening of international \nenvironmental governance and  translating the World \nSummit agreement on the collective responsibility to \nprotect into a willingness to act, when such action is \nneeded, and ending impunity for the most serious \ncrimes of concern to the international community. \n A vital element of the United Nations renewal is \nthe issue of Security Council reform. Lithuania has \nconsistently supported reform, in terms of both \nmembership and working methods. Enhancing the \nCouncil\u2019s legitimacy through such reform will enable it \nto improve the discharge of its primary responsibilities \nvis-\u00e0-vis international peace and security. \n A renewed Security Council should give adequate \nvoice and representation to all regions. As a member of \nthe East European Group, Lithuania believes that this \nGroup, too, deserves better representation on the future \nSecurity Council. Our collective experience of \ndramatic and peaceful transformation of our societies \nhas a lot to offer. In this respect, we believe, our Group \ncan offer an excellent candidate for the post of \nSecretary-General. \n Despite its flaws, the United Nations remains the \nonly organization with the potential to embody a truly \nglobal and effective spirit of multilateralism. \nTherefore, whatever we do, we should continue to ask \nourselves: are we, the Member States, doing enough to \nhelp the United Nations fulfil its promise to mankind? \nWe are a world family and we have responsibilities to \none another.

We believe that \nunder her guidance we will continue the reform process \nlaid out in the 2005 World Summit Outcome \n(resolution 60/1). Our warm appreciation also goes to \nMr. Jan Eliasson, President at the sixtieth session, for \nhis inspiring leadership. \n Let me take the opportunity to thank the \nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his brilliant \nopening speech a few days ago (see A/61/PV.3), and \nfor his decade of dedicated work for the United \nNations. Slovenia appreciates the role of the Secretary-\nGeneral in helping to expand our understanding of \npressing issues, such as the protection of civilians and \nthe responsibility to protect. The commitment of the \nSecretary-General to mainstreaming human rights in \nthe work of the Organization and his emphasis on the \nrule of law in international relations and nationally will \nremain a permanent legacy. The report \u201cIn larger \nfreedom\u201d (A/59/2005) contains a fair vision of the \nglobal responsibility that we share and reminds us of \nthe inevitable challenges that lie ahead. \n \n \n25 06-53329 \n \n We live in a tightly interconnected, \ninterdependent and transparent world. It is logical and \nit is right that nations should support and help each \nother. What place in the world is more appropriate for \nthat recommendation than the United Nations? All \nnations and all people should be asking themselves \nhow they can help each other. It appears that assistance \nand contributions from affluent countries are more \neffective. It seems easier for large nations to be great \nnations. Unfortunately, not all nations are large. That is \ntrue of most nations of the world, and it is, of course, \ntrue of my country. \n The implementation of the global partnership for \ndevelopment is a priority of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) to which Slovenia is fully \ncommitted. The new external financial instruments of \nthe European Union as well as the tenth European \nDevelopment Fund open a new chapter in the relations \nof the European Union with developing countries and \nstrengthen Europe\u2019s role as a global partner in \ndevelopment. That is a promising sign of progress in \nthe fulfilment of our commitments under the \nMillennium Declaration. \n In order to contribute in an important way, the \nsmall countries must make a special effort. We can, in \nfact, be effective. Smaller countries rarely threaten or \nendanger other countries. They have knowledge of \nsmall systems and knowledge of minorities within \nlarge systems. They can perform special tasks that \ndemand special qualities and particular capabilities \nsuch as flexibility, adaptability, a spirit of empathy and \ncooperation. They can serve as honest brokers. There \nare a number of successful small and medium-sized \ncountries. They can help each other to assume creative \nand relevant positions as part of the international \ncommunity. \n At the United Nations, we should continue to \nreview the concept of sovereignty. Many fear that the \nerosion of sovereignty provides grounds for interfering \nin State internal affairs. Indeed, the potential for \nmisuse is real. History teaches us that checks and \nbalances are necessary in order to shield right against \nmight. At the same time, the sovereignty of States must \nbe understood in the context of contemporary reality. \nNational borders are no longer an excuse for the \ninternational community to turn a blind eye to \ngenocide, crimes against humanity and other gross \nhuman rights violations. \n Last year, for the first time world leaders \nformally and universally affirmed the concept of the \nresponsibility to protect. The 2005 World Summit \nOutcome (resolution 60/1) provides a detailed \nframework for individual and collective responsibility, \nin areas ranging from prevention and protection to \nrebuilding. We regard the framework as a conceptual \nbreakthrough and wish to stress the need for all \nmembers of the international community, and the \nSecurity Council in particular, to deliver on the \nimplementation of that responsibility in practice. \n Many crises are evolving as we speak, some of \nwhich the international community will try to resolve, \nwhile giving less attention to others. The suffering of \nthe civilian population in Darfur calls for our \nimmediate efforts. We should not allow the tragedy that \noccurred in Rwanda or Bosnia and Herzegovina to be \nrepeated in Darfur or anywhere else. \n Attention to the Western Balkans must not \ndiminish. We are committed to standing by our partners \nin the region in their endeavours to expand their \nrelationship with the European Union and to facilitate \nthe advent of prosperity for their citizens. Kosovo is \nnow approaching an important and possibly sui generis \nstage in the peace process. Finding common ground \nbetween Serbian and Kosovar Albanian positions and \nstriking a political deal will be difficult. We are \nconfident, nevertheless, that all those involved will \nsummon up sufficient courage to take a critical step \nforward and thus enable all ethnic groups in that region \nto coexist peacefully and cooperate. We hope that the \nintegration process in Europe will provide the \nappropriate vehicle for the stabilization of the region. \n The disintegration of rigid systems like those of \nthe Soviet Union and the former Yugoslavia has \nproduced a number of new States and new Members of \nthe United Nations. The process has sometimes been \ncalled Balkanization. But a closer look will reveal that \nmany of the newborn countries, contrary to \nexpectations, have not regressed. Quite the opposite: a \nlot of them have progressed, democratized and \nreintegrated, or have expressed the desire to integrate \nin a different way and have positioned themselves on a \nnew level. Many former republics of the Soviet Union \nand Yugoslavia have thus become, or intend to become, \nmembers of new multinational systems, such as the \nEuropean Union. \n  \n \n06-53329 26 \n \n Occasionally, we still hear expressions of \nhesitation and fear: we should not, they say, sacrifice \nour national interests for the sake of integration. One \nof the problems of the international community today \nis complex relations within multinational, multi-ethnic \nand multicultural systems. The question is how to \nfacilitate the productive coexistence of national, ethnic, \nreligious and other minorities.  \n In the past, in Europe and elsewhere, mighty \ndynasties or nations, driven by the ambition to rule \nover weaker nations and minorities, practised imposed \nintegration. Modern integration no longer rests on \nsubordination; it depends on solidarity and \ncooperation. Modern nations cultivate \ncomplementarity. In the future, the United Nations \nshould encourage new projects and provide an efficient \nframework for the management of religious diversity \nand dialogue between cultures. We could then learn \nfrom countries that had experienced a successful \ntransition from a central and autocratic system to a \ndecentralized and democratic system. Essentially, we \nare concerned with sustained assistance in the \ntransition to democracy and coexistence within multi-\nethnic or multicultural systems. \n I support the idea of the dialogue of cultures. \nHowever, we should be careful not to develop that \nconcept into a clearinghouse for one set of standards. If \nso, failure is a certainty. A dialogue between two sides \neach convinced of the absolute truth of its own \nexistence is impossible. When dealing with subjective \nor intimate concepts like faith, respect and individual \ndignity, we can only hope to encourage debate within \nindividual systems, not between them. In the latter \ncase, one would be imposing one\u2019s truth on the value \nsystem of another. \n Rather, a dialogue of cultures should be a venue \nfor cross-cultural discussion on objective matters like \ndemocratic political systems, sustainable development, \nsecurity and energy. The promotion of dialogue on \nmatters of faith, culture or civilization is an \nindispensable tool to create bridges between different \ncultures.  \n Is there a general clash of civilizations? My own \nanswer is \u201cno\u201d. On the other hand, we should not \nunderestimate local and temporary clashes that may \nserve purposes far from genuine cultural or religious \nissues. There is one welcome and necessary clash: the \nclash of our common and global civilization against \nillegitimate radical groups that strive for power by \nmeans of terror and that abuse religious beliefs and \nethnic bonds for their own particular agendas. We have \nto be aware of this when dealing with such issues in \nour own countries and stand ready to assist each other \nif we are to preserve the universal values of \ncivilization. \n Last year, Slovenia chaired the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe; today, we begin \nour year at the helm of the Board of Governors of the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, and a little more \nthan a year from now we shall assume the presidency \nof the European Union (EU). As a member, and current \nChair, of the Human Security Network, a group of \nnations with diverse regional affiliations, we are \nlooking forward to deepening the understanding of the \nconcept of human security in order to be better \nequipped to overcome the complex problems of the \nmodern world. \n One of the items on the agenda of the Slovenian \nEU presidency will certainly be energy security. To \nfacilitate insight into regional energy and stability \nissues, the international conference entitled Caspian \nOutlook 2008, recently organized in Slovenia under the \nauspices of the Bled Strategic Forum, offered an \ninteresting experience in terms of how such issues can \nbe addressed at the regional level by parties that share \nthe same concern but look at it from different \nperspectives. At the end of the day, all interested \npartners have much to gain from political stability, \nreliable flows of energy and stronger partnerships. \n The Middle East crisis once again calls for the \nfocused attention of the international community. \nAttempts to address this problem in all its complexity \nand with the involvement of many countries should \ncontinue with renewed energy. Slovenia is playing its \npart in contributing to the immediate relief of the \nsituation in Lebanon through its contribution of troops \nto the United Nations peacekeeping force there. \n Slovenia welcomes the progress made towards \nthe implementation of the Convention on the \nProhibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and \nTransfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their \nDestruction. However, there are some aspects of mine \naction on which we should continue to focus: dealing \nwith the universality of the Convention, the clearing of \nminefields and providing assistance to mine victims. \nThrough its International Trust Fund for Demining and \n \n \n27 06-53329 \n \nMine Victims Assistance, Slovenia is striving to \nalleviate the humanitarian threat that anti-personnel \nlandmines still pose to the safety, health and lives of \nlocal civilian populations. \n I am grateful for the opportunity to highlight, in \nfront of this distinguished audience, the importance of \nthe role of small countries. Their orientations, activities \nand possibilities can contribute significantly to \nmultilateralism.  "

        "file_text": "I \nwish to begin by extending my congratulations to \nMs. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \nsession. I also express my country\u2019s high regard for her \npredecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, who succeeded in \nspurring the implementation of United Nations reform.  \n I also pay tribute to the Secretary-General, \nMr. Kofi Annan, for his work at the head of our \nOrganization, as reflected in the body of his \nachievements at the end of his two terms of office. \nThose achievements include the ongoing reform, the \npromotion of multilateralism, the prevention of armed \nconflict, peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance \noperations, the fight against HIV/AIDS and action on \nother fronts, in particular in combating poverty and \nterrorism. \n Here I would like to briefly discuss United \nNations reform. I echo the sentiments of all who have \nreferred here to the pressing need for the United \nNations to adapt to the realities of the world in which \nwe live so that it will be more in tune with current \nconcerns and managed in an effective and transparent \nmanner: an Organization whose Charter recognizes that \nall States, small and large, possess the right to have \ntheir say in the conduct of affairs that are of interest to \nthe international community.  \n Seychelles thus supported the establishment of \nthe Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights \nCouncil, the adoption of the United Nations Global \nCounter-Terrorism Strategy and the resolution on \ndevelopment. We await with great interest the outcome \nof the ongoing reform of the Economic and Social \nCouncil and the Secretariat and its management, and of \nthe revitalization of the General Assembly in keeping \nwith its great authority and enhanced role.  \n We hope that the General Assembly will take an \nactive part in the appointment of the next Secretary-\nGeneral, who, we all agree, should be from Asia and \nwith proven qualities and demonstrated leadership. \nMoreover, the reform of the Security Council is of \nparticular importance in the light of the current \nchallenges to world peace and to the Council\u2019s \ninstitutional legitimacy.  \n Now, let me say a few words on the national \npolicy of Seychelles. My country recently held \nelections in a climate of tranquillity and social \nharmony. Following the election of President Michel, \nand on the basis of the new road map that he has drawn \nfor his administration, Seychelles will place even \ngreater emphasis on ensuring sustainable development \nin all sectors: economic, social, cultural and \nenvironmental. The policies seek to guarantee the best \npossible standard of living for all citizens.  \n Opening up the economy, respecting human \nrights and the rule of law and pursuing the objectives \nof good governance will continue to define the actions \nof our Government. However, we must note that, as the \nWorld Bank and the Commonwealth have highlighted \nin their joint report, over the past five years small \ndeveloping States have seen gross national product \ngrowth rates decline in comparison to those of large, \nlow-income and middle-income countries. Small States \nhave also experienced an increasingly burdensome \nforeign debt. Concerning access to foreign capital, \nthere is a trend in private markets to consider small \n \n \n9 06-53958 \n \nStates to be of high risk, which leads to increased costs \nthat complicate access to those markets. \n In recent years, meetings have been held, \nresolutions have been adopted and statements have \nbeen made followed by further meetings, but with little \nconcrete action and without any satisfactory response \nto our concerns. Seychelles regrets that. The global \ncommunity is made up of 192 States, and more than 80 \nof them are small States. \n Confronted by these structural development \nproblems in the context of a globalized economy, small \nStates rarely have the means and the capacity to \nrespond appropriately to them. In that connection, the \nappeal made by the President of the General Assembly \nfor a global development partnership has never been so \nurgent and critical. The Seychelles hopes that at its \nsixty-first session the Assembly will take a decisive \nstep forward in bringing about such a partnership. \n I should like to conclude my statement by \nreferring to the issues of regional and world peace. \nArmed conflicts are occurring at a pace that shows \nthat, contrary to our hopes, the world remains unstable \nand dangerous. Unfortunately, peace and ceasefire \nagreements do not always lead to a cessation of \nhostilities. Civilian populations, composed mostly of \nwomen and children, continue to be displaced, \nmaltreated and, too often, the victims of crimes and \nmassacres. The situation in Darfur is the most tragic \nillustration. Those who survive do not always have \naccess to humanitarian aid. Today, according to a \nUnited Nations report, even the level of violence facing \nhumanitarian aid teams is unprecedented.  \n We are all aware of the real causes of wars. Sadly, \nsometimes the only way to reach a consensus is to say \nnothing; as the saying goes, diplomacy consists of \nconversations between friends, and only rarely with the \nenemy. That is why the Seychelles joins all those in \nAfrica, the Middle East, Asia and everywhere else who \nhope for a more human, more just and freer world \nwhere peace is the rule, not the exception, and not a \nprivilege but a right. That also applies to those \ncountries \u2014 such as Palestine and Western Sahara \u2014 \nthat hope someday to be able to conduct their affairs as \nthey see fit, in accordance with the relevant United \nNations resolutions. \n Finally, I should like to reaffirm the support of \nthe Seychelles for the work undertaken by the \nPresident of the General Assembly to make the sixty-\nfirst session an instrument for peace and development.

        "file_text": "I would \nlike to start by congratulating Ms. Haya Rashed Al-\nKhalifa on her election to preside over this session and \nto wish her success in achieving the objectives of the \nUnited Nations, which are accepted by all nations of \nthe world, which believe that the Organization was \ncreated to safeguard international peace, human rights, \nand the right of peoples to self-determination. Indeed, \nas President Woodrow Wilson said in his first inaugural \naddress: \n \u201cNowhere else in the world have noble men and \nwomen exhibited in more striking forms the \nbeauty and the energy of sympathy and \nhelpfulness and counsel in their efforts to rectify \nwrong, alleviate suffering, and set the weak in the \nway of strength and hope.\u201d \n I hope, therefore, that this session will promote \ncooperation between nations and peoples in pursuit of \ntheir common interests, namely the principles \nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, which \nform the basis for membership in this Organization. \n We must commend highly the Secretary-General, \nMr. Kofi Annan, for the effective role he has played \nand the considerable efforts he has deployed, as well as \nfor his wise leadership in enhancing the United Nations \nand reinvigorating its role. We also commend him in \nparticular for his efforts in respect of the Arab-Israeli \nconflict, the core of which is the question of Palestine. \n Only a few weeks ago, the fires of war stopped \nraging in Lebanon. Despite the gravity of the losses, \nthe destruction and the tragedy, the international \ncommunity expeditiously, effectively and successfully \nintervened to put an end to the war and to provide \nsupport to the people and the legitimate Government of \nLebanon in order to safeguard its security and \nindependence and to put an end to the era of wars on \nits land. I commend the role played by the international \ncommunity, and I hope that that positive and effective \nintervention will be extended, politically and \npractically, so as to resolve the root causes of all the \nconflicts and wars that have plagued our region for \nmany decades. \n Indeed, I need not reconfirm the fact that, after \nthe experiences of war and suffering that we have been \nthrough, unless the question of Palestine and that of the \ncontinuing occupation of Palestinian and Arab lands \nsince 1967 is resolved, the elements of tension and \nconflagration will keep the conflict alive and leave the \ndoor wide open to all forms of violence, terrorism, \nregional confrontations and global crises. \n It is unfortunate today to see that international \nplans and initiatives, foremost among them the road \nmap, which was endorsed by the United Nations \nSecurity Council, have reached a state of stagnation, \neven regression. Calls for the resumption of \nnegotiations are faced with preconditions. Despair and \nfrustration thrive in the midst of the roar of the \nbulldozers that are preparing for the construction of \nillegal settlements, changes in the demographic nature \nof Jerusalem and erection of an apartheid separation \nwall inside our occupied land and between its various \nparts. They thrive on the continuation of the frightful \nsiege, through military checkpoints that have turned \nour cities and provinces into reservations, on the \ncontinuous saga of killings and assassinations that have \nclaimed hundreds of civilian lives, on the demolitions \nof homes and on the ongoing arrests of more than \n  \n \n06-53005 52 \n \n8,000 Palestinians, including parliamentarians and \ncabinet ministers. Some of the detained have been \nlanguishing for three decades, and their release and \nfreedom are still eagerly awaited by their families and \ntheir people. \n Under such conditions, I can reasonably ask: how \ncan the international community expect extremism to \nretreat or the waves of violence to ebb? How can we \nand all the forces of moderation and peace in our \nregion forcefully intervene and convince our public \nopinion that there is hope on the horizon? Or that the \noption of dialogue, negotiation and international \nlegitimacy \u2014 which is our strategic choice and the \npath which we relentlessly advocate and which we will \nnever abandon \u2014 will be fruitful and has a real chance \nof success? \n Living in the midst of this tragedy, I am not the \nonly one who must answer this fundamental question. \nThe whole international community, particularly \ninfluential Powers, is called upon to provide tangible \nevidence that it will support an unconditional \nresumption of negotiations and provide those \nnegotiations with true international support to ensure \ntheir success through the cessation of settlement \nactivity, collective punishment and separation walls. \nThis would provide a positive atmosphere for \nrelaunching the negotiations and reaching the \nobjectives of a just peace based on a two-State \nsolution, as called for by President George Bush of the \nUnited States of America. Such a solution must be \nbased on international legitimacy, as stressed in the \nArab Peace Initiative, through the establishment of the \nindependent State of Palestine on the 4 June 1967 \nborders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, and in \nreaching a just and agreed solution for the problem of \nthe refugees \u2014 who constitute more than half of our \nPalestinian people \u2014 in accordance with United \nNations General Assembly resolution 194 (III) of \n11 December 1948. \n Lately, we have heard from the Government of \nIsrael that it will abandon its policy of unilateralism \nand one-sided actions. This is encouraging, provided \nthat the alternative is not stagnation or the imposition \nof faits accomplis on the ground, but rather a return to \nthe negotiating table and to reaching a comprehensive \nsolution to all of the permanent status issues in order to \nensure a secure future for our children and theirs. \n Recently, in tandem with all the strands and \npersuasions of the Palestinian political spectrum, I \nhave sought to establish a Government of national \nunity that is consistent with international and Arab \nlegitimacy and that corresponds to the principles \nestablished by the Quartet. Based on our commitment \nto these criteria, I would like to reaffirm that any future \nPalestinian Government will commit to and abide by \nall the agreements that the Palestine Liberation \nOrganization (PLO) and the Palestinian National \nAuthority have committed to in the past, particularly \nthe letters of mutual recognition dated 9 September \n1993 exchanged between the two late, great leaders, \nYasser Arafat and Itzhak Rabin. These two letters \ncontain the mutual recognition by Israel and the PLO, \nthe renunciation of violence and the adoption of \nnegotiations as the path towards reaching a permanent \nsolution leading to the establishment of the \nindependent State of Palestine alongside the State of \nIsrael. \n Any future Government will commit to imposing \nsecurity and order, to ending the phenomenon of \nmultiple militias, lack of discipline or chaos, and will \ncommit to the rule of law, since this is primarily a \nnational Palestinian need. The efforts that we have \nexerted are for the sole purpose of establishing national \nunity that has real substance in order to achieve \nnational Palestinian consensus around our national \nobjectives, which comply with international legitimacy \nand the Arab Peace Initiative and call for peaceful \nmeans for the realization of these objectives. When \nsuch a national consensus is reached and a new \nnational unity Government has been established \naccording to it, it must be viewed as a qualitative \nachievement \u2014  not a step backwards or a limited \nregression from the path to which we have always been \ndeterminedly committed \u2014 even in the face of the \nbleakest of conditions. \n I would like to reiterate that negotiations with \nIsrael have been and will remain under the jurisdiction \nand responsibility of the Palestine Liberation \nOrganization, which I chair. The outcome of these \nnegotiations will be presented to the Palestinian \nNational Council, the highest Palestinian national \nbody, or to a national public referendum. \n What we have achieved in this regard should \nsuffice to lift the unjust siege imposed on our people. \nThat siege has inflicted extensive damage on our \n \n \n53 06-53005 \n \nsociety, our livelihood and the means to our growth and \nprogress. \n Madam President, I come to you bearing the \nwounds of a people who are bleeding on a daily basis. \nWe are a people who seeks normal life, where our \nchildren can go safely to school, where children are \nborn to live, not die; where youth can find honourable \nand decent work that provides them with a dignified \npath to a secure future so that they can be partners in \nformulating their history, rather than be victims to the \ncruelty of history; where women give birth in hospitals, \nnot at the checkpoints of the occupation; where \nfamilies gather in the evening to dream of a new day, a \nday without killing, imprisonment or arrest. \n I simply want tomorrow to be better than today. I \nwant my homeland, Palestine, to be a homeland, rather \nthan a prison \u2014 independent and sovereign, like \nhomelands of all other peoples of this world. I want \nJerusalem to be the point of convergence for the \ndialogue of all prophets and the capital of two States \nliving side by side in peace and equality. \n Thirty-two years ago, from this rostrum, the late \nPresident Yasser Arafat issued his famous and \nresounding call: \u201cDo not let the olive branch fall from \nmy hand\u201d (A/PV.2282, para. 82). I now reiterate that \ncall. Do not let the olive branch fall from my hand. I \nrepeat: do not let the olive branch fall from my hand. "

        "file_text": "First, allow me to express to you, Madam President, \nour congratulations on your election to the presidency \nof the General Assembly at this session. I should also \nlike to convey to you the best wishes of the people and \nGovernment of Peru for a successful stewardship. We \nare ready to work with you for the benefit of the \ninternational community. \n When the Government of President Alan Garc\u00eda \ntook office on 28 July it found a particularly serious \nsocial deficit in the country. More than 13 million \nPeruvians, half our population, live in poverty; \n5 million of them, or 20 per cent of our population, live \nin extreme poverty. Peru is therefore experiencing a \n \n \n21 06-53609 \n \nsituation of deep inequity for a medium-income \ncountry.  \n In order to tackle this reality, the new \nGovernment has placed major emphasis on responsible \nState action, designing an agenda of social inclusion \nbased on promoting investment for job creation. That \nagenda requires that we learn to act with greater \nsolidarity, on the basis of civic values, with due \nattention given to the most vulnerable groups, so that \nthey may fully participate in drawing up public \npolicies. Initial action is aimed at restoring confidence \nin our society as a factor crucial for promoting long-\nterm development and shared growth. In this respect, \nmy Government is working with the social sectors to \ndevelop a culture of duty as one of the main pillars \nsupporting Government policies and the relationship \nbetween society and the State. \n The Government of Peru has made the fight \nagainst poverty a central priority of its Administration. \nIt has also set the guidelines for its external action, in \nwhich it aims to join the other nations of the Latin \nAmerican region in drawing up a development agenda \nto achieve growth with equity and social inclusion. In \nthis context, we reaffirm our conviction of the need to \npromote Latin American integration. For this purpose \nwe are working on strengthening the Andean \nCommunity and building the South American \nCommunity of Nations. \n That is the goal that inspires us, because in order \nto express the common interests of our continent in a \nworld such as today\u2019s we must act together to better \ntackle the challenges of globalization. A Latin America \nwith a united voice will be better placed to tackle its \ncommon problems, such as the marginalization of wide \nsectors of the population, internal imbalances and \nsocial divisions. A more united Latin America can also \nbetter project the values of democracy and pluralism \nthat characterize it today. In this framework, tolerance \nand respect for differences will make it possible to \nstrengthen projects of common interest offering all our \ncitizens true opportunities for development and well-\nbeing. \n One of the challenges that our continent, and in \nparticular the Andean region, must face decisively is \nthe fight against drug trafficking. Peru reaffirms its \nfirm position of combating forcefully and \ncomprehensively the illicit trafficking of drugs, \nemphasizing the principles of multilateralism and \nshared responsibility. To that end, we have been \ncarrying out a careful evaluation of the current state of \ncooperation in the fight against illegal drug trafficking. \nFollowing the principle of shared responsibility, Peru \nhas expressed an interest in holding an anti-drug \nsummit, so that in the Andean area we can give new \nimpetus to the dialogue on cooperation and agree with \nthe United States and the European Union on a single \nconsensus strategy, which would be mutually \nbeneficial for the Andean producer countries and the \nlarge consumer markets. \n Another universal scourge that the international \ncommunity must fight unrelentingly is terrorism. Peru \nreiterates that terrorism, whatever its form or \nmanifestation, or its motivation, is unacceptable and \naccordingly must be condemned and fought. States \nmust show an unequivocal attitude towards terrorism. \nPeru therefore supports the efforts being made in the \nUnited Nations to fight terrorism. Among them, we \nnote the approval of the Global Counter-Terrorism \nStrategy. We reaffirm our conviction that this struggle \ncan and must be carried out with respect for human \nrights and fundamental freedoms. \n In the Millennium Declaration we set ourselves \nthe target of attaining by 2015 various goals in the \nfight against poverty and in the partnership for \ndevelopment, goals which summarize the challenges \nthat countries such as Peru must tackle and overcome \nand the cooperation that developed countries must give \nin assisting development, trade and financing. \nHowever, at the 2005 World Summit we noted that \nprogress in compliance with the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals is somewhat modest, and some \ngoals seem unattainable.  \n In order to comply with the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, the Government of Peru has taken \nimmediate action, including, first, reform of the State \nand the political system to give it more austerity, \nthrough decentralization, administrative simplification \nand moral initiatives; secondly, job creation through \ninvestment and the opportunities that the State must \npromote; thirdly, restoration of labour and social rights \nin order to have a more modern and just society; \nfourthly, policies in favour of women, youth and \nchildren; and, fifthly, civic security to give the \npopulation tranquillity and confidence. None of that \nwill be enough if the markets of developed countries \nremain closed to our products through restrictions. In \n  \n \n06-53609 22 \n \nthis context, we call for the prompt resumption of the \nDoha Round talks in a spirit of compromise. \n My Government\u2019s social policy initiatives will \nmake possible a broader exercise of human rights. I \nrefer in particular to economic, social and cultural \nrights, where shortcomings are evident, and to paying \nparticular attention to the most vulnerable groups.  \n In this respect, during the current session we will \nbe called upon to consider and possibly adopt three \nimportant international instruments on promoting and \nprotecting human rights. The first two are the draft \ndeclaration on the rights of indigenous peoples and the \ndraft international convention on the rights of persons \nwith disabilities. Peru urges every Member State to \nconsider adopting these two instruments, which would \ngive greater protection to millions of people who today \nare victims of marginalization. The third instrument is \nthe draft convention on forced disappearance, which \nwill make it possible to more effectively combat that \nreprehensible practice. \n We are aware of the importance of \nmultilateralism as the ideal context for low- and \nmedium-income countries to take part in the \ninternational arena, as well as helping to find solutions \nto the challenges that the globalized world must face. \nThese challenges result from the current characteristics \nof the international system, in which two opposing \nprocesses coexist. Thus, while the world integrates \nglobally it is becoming more fragmented because of an \nincrease in social inequality, the proliferation of civil \nconflicts and the disintegration of States, so-called \nethnic cleansing, massive violations of human rights, \nthe trafficking of people and arms, environmental \ndegradation, terrorism and international organized \ncrime.  \n These contradictory trends between globalization \nand fragmentation often call into question both the \nability of States to govern and international stability, \nthe major challenges that the international community, \nand in particular the Security Council, must face. \nTherefore, we need a comprehensive and strategic \nvision to make it possible to deal with problems \naffecting international peace and security. It is not only \nmilitary aspects that cause crises. There are also \nstructural factors, such as poverty, social exclusion and \nenvironmental degradation, which are the triggers of \nnational and international instability. \n If the Council does not take this reality into \naccount it will be very difficult to prevent or resolve \nconflicts in a sustainable way, because it will mean \nputting to one side the most important variables. We \ntherefore acknowledge the need to make the \nmultilateral system more flexible, comprehensive and \neffective, in order to tackle the global challenges and \nthreats. But, at the same time, the Security Council\u2019s \nactions must be based on legitimacy, which accords the \nstrictest respect for the values, purposes and principles \nof the Charter and international law. With this \nconviction, Peru is taking part in the Security Council \nin a coherent way and with a constructive spirit. \n Given this premise, it is crucial to strengthen the \ndisarmament and non-proliferation regimes and to find \na peaceful solution to disputes. We supported the \npeacekeeping interventions authorized by the Security \nCouncil, and we will continue those efforts to ensure a \nrenewed collective security system supported and \nrespected by all Member States, in order to tackle \nthreats to international peace and security. It is in this \ncontext that we see Peru\u2019s participation in \npeacekeeping operations in Haiti, Sudan, the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, \nLiberia, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Burundi and Cyprus. This \ninvolves very sensitive matters and arduous \nresponsibilities, but we assume them as a natural \ncorollary to the commitment to international peace and \nsecurity that we made when signing the Charter. We \naffirm our confidence that the Peacebuilding \nCommission will achieve the objective of supporting \nthe reconstruction of countries emerging from conflict.  \n At the same time, we believe that we must step \nup our prevention efforts at the regional and \nsubregional levels, which is why Peru promotes \ncooperative security through mechanisms to strengthen \npeace and security structures, whose development \nincludes the need to prevent arms races between \nneighbouring countries. \n Peru supports reform of the Security Council to \nmake it more effective, transparent and representative. \nIn this process, we favour increasing the number of \nmembers through dialogue and consensus, as part of a \ncomprehensive process of United Nations reform, in \nwhich we have already seen some progress. The road \nahead must be tackled with greater responsibility and \nin a spirit of dialogue and openness. \n \n \n23 06-53609 \n \n I wanted to share these concerns and ideas in \norder to reaffirm that Peru, on the basis of its own \neconomic and social reality and its regional outreach, \nas well as its profound multilateral vocation, wishes to \ncontinue to contribute constructively to security, \ndevelopment and respect for human rights in the world. \nWe are convinced that the United Nations system can, \nwith the help of all, strengthen its central role of \npromoting social progress and raising the standard of \nliving within the broadest concept of freedom, as \nstipulated in the Preamble to the Charter.

        "file_text": "My delegation associates \nitself with the compliments extended to Ms. Haya \nRashed Al-Khalifa, on her election to the presidency of \nthe General Assembly, to her predecessor, His \nExcellency Mr. Jan Eliasson, and to the Secretary-\nGeneral. It would be remiss of us if we did not express \nour delight at the fact that our proceedings are being \nled by a lady President this year. \n We meet in the aftermath of the worst conflict in \nthe Middle East. This conflict has brought untold \nmisery and has resulted in unnecessary loss of life, \ndisplacement of people and wanton destruction of \nproperty. In the midst of all this, the Security Council \nremained pitifully helpless. \n The delay by the Security Council in reacting to \nthe Israel-Lebanon conflict graphically demonstrated \nthe Council\u2019s extreme inadequacy in responding \nurgently, with prompt and decisive action, to \ninternational armed conflicts. It is precisely such \n  \n \n06-53005 12 \n \nfailures that lend credence to the call for reform of the \nUnited Nations, in particular, reform of the Security \nCouncil. In this regard, the well-known position of the \nAfrican Group has never made more sense than it does \nnow. \n The African continent still experiences internal \narmed conflicts. The African Union (AU), without \nusurping the powers of the Security Council, has taken \nthe initiative to resolve some of those conflicts. \nHowever, the African Union\u2019s resources and capacities \nare limited. It is against this background that the \nAfrican Union, through its Peace and Security Council, \nresolved to hand over the Darfur mission to the United \nNations. It is our hope and earnest plea that the current \nmisunderstanding between the United Nations and the \nGovernment of the Sudan will be resolved as a matter \nof urgency. The United Nations, particularly the \nSecurity Council, cannot afford to be a helpless \nspectator to yet another genocide. \n My delegation calls for concerted efforts by the \ninternational community, and by the United Nations in \ncollaboration with the African Union, to find a lasting \nsolution to the crises in Somalia and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. \nWith regard to Somalia, the efforts of the Inter-\nGovernmental Authority on Development to broker an \nagreement between the Transitional Government and \nthe Islamic Courts must be complemented by the \ninternational community, specifically, the United \nNations. There is also an urgent need to lift the arms \nembargo so that the Transitional Government may be \nable to function. \n We congratulate the people of the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo, who, following decades of \nundemocratic rule and civil war, recently exercised \ntheir inalienable right to elect a Government of their \nchoice. It is our hope that with continued assistance \nfrom the United Nations, particularly from United \nNations Organization Mission in the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo, and other partners, the second \nround of elections, scheduled for 29 October 2006, will \nproceed peacefully. \n We likewise commend the people of Burundi on \nthe signing of a peace agreement between the \nGovernment and the Forces nationales de lib\u00e9ration \n(FNL). This should enable them to focus on the \ndevelopment issues of their country.  \n Furthermore, we congratulate the Government of \nthe Republic of Uganda on the initiative aimed at \nfinding a political solution to the protracted war with \nthe Lord\u2019s Resistance Army (LRA). That war has taken \nits toll on the people of Uganda and has contributed to \ninstability in the region. \n We express our solidarity with the peoples of \nPalestine and Western Sahara in their struggle for self-\ndetermination and their quest for everlasting peace. \nSurely, things do not have to deteriorate to the level of \nthe Israel-Lebanon conflict before the international \ncommunity snaps into action in these two volatile \nsituations. \n Following the 2005 World Summit, and in the \ncontext of the reform of the United Nations, my \ndelegation notes with satisfaction the creation of the \nHuman Rights Council, the operationalization of the \nPeacebuilding Commission and the establishment of \nthe Central Emergency Response Fund, among other \nachievements. These are timely events that continue to \nprove the relevance of this Organization in the twenty-\nfirst century. \n My delegation also notes the efficient manner in \nwhich the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian \nAffairs responded in some countries that faced major \nman-made or natural disasters over the past year. That \ncan be attributed to the newly established Central \nEmergency Response Fund. It is our hope that the Fund \nwill continue to live up to the expectations of Member \nStates. \n The United Nations was founded on the \ninterlinked and mutually reinforcing pillars of \ndevelopment, international peace and security and \nhuman rights. The issue of development deserves the \nundivided attention and commitment of Member \nStates, just as do the issues of peace, security and \nhuman rights. Hence the call at the 2005 World Summit \nfor a timely and full realization of development goals \nand objectives agreed upon at major United Nations \nconferences and summits in the economic, social and \nrelated fields. \n My delegation is deeply concerned that Member \nStates were largely divided between the South and the \nNorth regarding how to follow up on the development \nsection of the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document \n(resolution 60/1). We are indeed disheartened that, due \nto a divergence of views on this important issue, the \nGeneral Assembly was not in a position to suggest \nconcrete actions to implement commitments made at \nthe relevant conferences and summits. \n \n \n13 06-53005 \n \n It is past time for the General Assembly to \nsuggest concrete actions on how to, among other \nthings: fulfil the commitments to address the special \nneeds of Africa; seriously address the uneven progress \nmade by the least developed countries, landlocked \ndeveloping countries and small island developing \ncountries in achieving the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs); address issues relating to trade, \nagricultural subsidies and the transfer of vitally needed \nresources to developing countries; and fully implement \nthe global partnership for development as set out in the \nMillennium Declaration, the Monterrey Consensus, the \nJohannesburg Plan of Action and the 2005 World \nSummit Outcome. \n My delegation hopes that at its current session the \nGeneral Assembly will, among other things, finalize all \ndetails regarding the convening of a review conference \non the implementation of the Monterrey Consensus. \nFurthermore, we hope that all stakeholders will \nreaffirm their commitment to the full implementation \nof the outcomes of the recently held high-level \nmeetings on migration and development and on review \nof the implementation of the 2001 Brussels Programme \nof Action for the Least Developed Countries. \n There is definitely an inherent global benefit, for \nall countries, in the pursuit of development cooperation \nbased on genuine partnership and mutually beneficial \narrangements. The realities of globalization, \nliberalization and interdependence have demonstrated \nthe inadequacies of the traditional modes of financing \nfor development, such as official development \nassistance, foreign direct investment, trade and other \nforms of capital flows. \n If all Member States are to achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals by 2015, certain \nmeasures must be undertaken. First, official \ndevelopment assistance must be doubled. It must also \nbe timely, predictable and dependable. Secondly, all \npartnerships with New Partnership for Africa\u2019s \nDevelopment must be linked to the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and other agreed upon \ndevelopment goals and targets. Finally, there must be \ncomplete debt cancellation, not just for the highly \nindebted poor countries, but for the least developed \ncountries as well. \n The suspension of the Doha Development Agenda \nnegotiations was a disquieting development for some \nof our countries. While Africa had on various \noccasions expressed concern on the limited progress \nmade in negotiations on issues of major interest to the \ncontinent, our faith in the negotiations never wavered. \nWe truly believed, and we still do, that there is a \ncommon understanding that trade is the most effective \nroute out of poverty, and that the prosperity and \nsecurity of all nations, rich or poor, strong or weak, are \ndependent on, inter alia, free and fair trade. \n Much has been said about the HIV/AIDS \npandemic. Its consequences are now commonly \nunderstood. Conferences at the highest levels have \nbeen held, subregionally, regionally, continentally and \nglobally. These conferences discussed at length the \nimportance of economic, technological and medical \ndevelopments to subdue and defeat HIV/AIDS in \naffected countries. It is now time for words to be \nfollowed by concrete actions targeting, in particular, \ninfected and affected groups and lowering infection \nprevalence rates. \n My delegation regrets the paralysis that has \nbefallen the United Nations disarmament machinery. \nAlso regrettable is the failure of the 2005 Review \nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons to produce a \nconsensus substantive outcome document. Equally \nregrettable is the absence of a section on non-\nproliferation and disarmament in the 2005 Summit \nOutcome Document. The coup de gr\u00e2ce, however, is \nthe failure to agree on an outcome document of the \n2006 United Nations Conference to Review Progress \nMade in the Implementation of the Programme of \nAction to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit \nTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons In All Its \nAspects, adopted in 2001. \n Thus, Member States should not run away from \nthe blatant truth that, during the sixtieth session of the \nAssembly, the stalemate that, over the past four years, has \ncharacterized negotiations regarding non-proliferation \nand disarmament, finally became abundantly clear to \nall nations. For small arms and light weapons remain \nthe weapons of choice that are indiscriminately used in \nconflicts, as well as in other forms of violence, \nincluding criminal behaviour. Yet they are still so \ncheap and so easily accessible that, in some remote \nvillages, they are exchanged for chickens. \n Terrorism continues to pose the greatest threat to \nhuman security. In this regard, I wish to welcome the \nadoption by the General Assembly of the United \n  \n \n06-53005 14 \n \nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution \n60/288). However, it is unfortunate that the General \nAssembly\u2019s Ad Hoc Committee on International \nTerrorism has still not been able to conclude a \ncomprehensive convention on an international response \nto terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. The \nfact remains that Member States have a moral \nobligation to overcome their long-standing differences \non the definition of terrorism. Failure to agree on a \ndefinition, however, cannot and must not be used as an \nexcuse for not decisively confronting the scourge of \nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. \n Following the adoption of Security Council \nresolution 1696 (2006) on 31 July, and the subsequent \nresponse by the Iranian Authorities, it is our fervent \nhope that all parties to the issue will constructively \nengage in seeking a lasting solution to avert possible \neconomic and diplomatic sanctions and to guarantee \nIran\u2019s peaceful nuclear programme. \n Last but certainly not least, this session marks the \nend of tenure of office for an illustrious son of the \nAfrican soil, a distinguished diplomat and statesman, in \nthe person of His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan. He \nleaves a legacy for this august body which every one of \nus must emulate in the best interests of the peoples we \nrepresent and serve. It is therefore befitting to pay \ntribute to him and to wish him and Mrs. Nane Annan a \nwell-deserved rest and a future filled with happiness. \nHe will, needless to say, be inundated with our calls for \nhis wisdom and advice in the service of mankind.  \n Our standing ovation and the declaration made in \nhonour of His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan during the \nlast African Union Summit held in Banjul, Gambia, \nsaid it all. With typical eloquence, he delivered a few \ndays ago in the Assembly before the world\u2019s leaders a \nrich statement filled with emotion. No wonder that \neven the world leaders accorded him a standing \novation. His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan has run his lap \nwith excellence. He deserves a medal of honour. "

        "file_text": "I stand before the \nAssembly and renew the commitment of the \nGovernment and people of Belize to the principles \nenshrined in the United Nations Charter. We reaffirm \nthe pledge made by the father of the Belizean nation, \nthe Right Honourable George Price, when he said from \nthis rostrum:  \n  \u201cBelize, with the help of God and the \nsupport of its people, will stand upright and will \ndo its duty to help bring peace, stability and \nprosperity to our region and the wider circles of \nour planet Earth.\u201d (A/36/PV.13, para. 143) \n Through you, Sir, we would like to congratulate \nthe President on her election and pledge the support of \nmy delegation for our important work at this session of \nthe General Assembly. \n We express our solidarity with our Secretary-\nGeneral, whose imprint on this institution at this \ncritical time in international affairs will be appreciated \nand remembered through the ages. \n Belize became independent 25 years ago. It was a \ndifferent time then, in 1981. The cold war was being \nwaged. There was a clash of economic philosophies, \nand countries were being forced to circle in one of two \norbits. But many countries did not; we proclaimed our \nnon-alignment and worked to establish a new \ninternational economic order. We sought to create a \nworld which was fairer and more just and which put \npeople at its centre.  \n We never achieved that dream of a new \ninternational economic order. In fact, in 1989, the wall \nthat divided not only a nation, but the entire social and \neconomic order of the world, came tumbling down. \nThe Berlin Wall was torn down nearly two decades \nago, but we have yet to tear down the most important \nwall of all \u2014 the one that separates us into rich States \nand poor States, wealthy and poor, developed and \ndeveloping. \n \n \n7 06-53615 \n \n Almost 15 years ago, we were told that if we tore \ndown barriers to trade, opened up our markets to \nforeign capital and imported goods, and privatized our \nState-owned enterprises, our economies would grow by \nleaps and bounds. We were also told that our partners \nin the developed world would afford us greater access \nto their markets, that our commodities would receive \nfair prices, and that international financiers would \nmake capital readily available for us to borrow. \n The question we now ask is: Are we better off \nhaving adhered to that so-called development cocktail \nprescribed by the Washington Consensus? \n All is not well. In the Caribbean, 30 per cent of \npeople are living in poverty. In Latin America, the \nfigure is an obscene 40.6 per cent. Worse yet, 16.8 per \ncent of the people in Latin America live in extreme \npoverty. Fourteen of the 15 Caribbean countries are \namong the most indebted emerging market countries. \nIn fact, seven are in the top 10, all with debt-to-gross \ndomestic product ratios of about 100 per cent. To quote \nfrom a recent World Bank report: \n \u201cA closer inspection of the data leaves little room \nfor complacency about the world\u2019s progress \nagainst poverty. Indeed, the picture that emerges \nis one of highly uneven progress, with serious \nsetbacks in some regions and time periods. And \nwe find that more people living near $2 per day \nbecame worse off over the period than the \nnumber who gained. Thus the number living \nunder $2 per day rose.\u201d \nIn 2006, now more than ever we need a new \ninternational economic order.  \n In 2001, members of the World Trade \nOrganization (WTO) adopted the Doha Development \nAgenda. The ministerial declaration proudly \nproclaimed:  \n \u201cThe majority of WTO members are developing \ncountries. We seek to place their needs and \ninterests at the heart of the Work Programme \nadopted in this Declaration.\u201d  \nThe WTO sought to design a multilateral trading \nsystem that was to \u201censure that developing countries \nsecure a share in the growth of world trade that was \ncommensurate with the needs of their economic \ndevelopment\u201d. But let me tell members what our \nreality, the Belizean experience with the WTO, has \nbeen. \n Since Doha, a panel set up by the WTO decided \nthat the European Union organization of its sugar \nmarket was incompatible with WTO rules. To solve \nthat problem, Belizean sugar farmers now get paid less \nfor the sugar exported to the European Union. Simply \nput, the WTO has made them worse off. Since Doha, \nthe European Union has liberalized its banana import \nregime. That is supposed to make the regime WTO-\ncompatible. The statistics now show that imports from \nnon-African, Caribbean and Pacific countries into the \nEuropean Union have outstripped imports from the \nCaribbean, and prices paid for bananas have fallen. \n In the five years since Doha, our hopes have been \ndashed, ambitions smashed and the development \ndimension once again ignored. The accord reached at \nDoha has been systematically dismantled with each \nsubsequent meeting, from Canc\u00fan to Hong Kong to \nGeneva. \n We say that there is something inherently wrong \nwith a system that promises development and delivers \nlower prices for exports. We say that there is something \nfundamentally unfair in a system that promises a \ndevelopment agenda and delivers suspended \nnegotiations and less market access to small vulnerable \neconomies. \n It is in such an environment, defined by \nmultilateralism and the primacy of the markets \u2014 \nliberalism writ large \u2014 that small States in the \nCaribbean operate. It is a system in which unknown \npeople sitting in unmarked rooms in Brussels and \nGeneva make decisions that determine how many \nboxes of bananas the Caribbean can export to Europe \nand what price we get paid for our sugar. \n At the end of the day, it is all about social justice \nand social equity. Is something wrong with a picture in \nwhich, of the 6 billion people on planet Earth, 1 billion \nhave more than 80 per cent of world income and \n5 billion have less than 20 per cent? Something is \nradically wrong with that picture. Our common charge \nis to right that imbalance. The fight against poverty \ncannot and will not be won with arms and instruments \nof war. We need a new international economic order in \nwhich the rights of people to jobs and fair wages and to \nfair prices for commodities take precedence over rules \nof trade that are inherently unfair and inequitable. And \nsmall vulnerable economies like ours in the Caribbean \nneed special and differential treatment. Unless we \nwage the fight against poverty, there will be no peace. \n  \n \n06-53615 8 \n \nIn the absence of peace, insecurity prevails. Insecurity \nencourages instability. \n It is no wonder that, at this time, we find \nourselves in retreat, living in a culture of fear and \ndivided by a so-called clash of civilizations. A general \nsense of lost hope is pervasive and the enthusiasm of \nthe new millennium squandered. \n Here at the United Nations, our own concept of \ndialogue among civilizations seems to be fast fading. \nWe must find a way to build a greater sense of security, \nrenew our faith in each other and deconstruct the walls \nthat divide. That can best be accomplished through our \nwork at the United Nations, and my delegation \ncommends our efforts in endorsing an integrated \napproach to addressing the transition from conflict to \nrecovery with the establishment of the Peacebuilding \nCommission. Together with the General Assembly and \nthe Security Council, the Commission should, in the \nspirit of its constitution, help to answer those critical \nquestions related to the maintenance of international \npeace and security and, above all, development. \n In these times, when the rules that govern our \ncollective responsibility to international civility and the \ncomity of nations seem to be eroding along with \nrespect for international law, we must look to our \ninstitutions to restore our common values. \n We are reminded that the primary responsibility \nof the Security Council is the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security. The Charter, in giving \nthat mandate, specifies that the conferral of that \nresponsibility is to ensure prompt and effective action \nwhen required. But as we have seen with the delayed \nreaction to the recent events in Lebanon and the \noccupied Palestinian territories, the Council failed to \ndischarge its mandate. The situation in the Middle East \nnecessitates prompt and effective action. \n We acknowledge that the shortcomings in the \nCouncil\u2019s exercise of its mandate may be attributed to \nits structural imbalances. Those imbalances are not \ninsurmountable and, indeed, call for reform. The \nCouncil must reflect the current geopolitical realities. \nBelize supports comprehensive reform of the Security \nCouncil, including the expansion of membership in \nboth permanent and non-permanent categories, and \nthrough the improvement of its working methods. We \ndetect a momentum for change and we are ready to \nengage as equal partners to that end. \n We now have a Human Rights Council that we \nhope will be vigilant in its work to protect the rights of \nthose unable to protect themselves. We will be truly \ncivilized only when we stop the victimization of the \nweak at the expense of the ideology of the strongest. \n We must bring to an end the violence and death \nof the innocent in Darfur. Our collective conscience is \nstained by the genocide in Darfur. For every innocent \nlife that is lost to conflict and the denial of basic \nhuman rights, we carry the scars of their oppression. \n In Belize, we have started a dialogue on the \nrelevance of small States and the role we must play in \nthe maintenance of international peace and security. I \nhave invoked the idea that, in the global war on \nterrorism, we in the Caribbean and Central America are \nless important because we operate in a culture of peace \nand respect for life, and that because most of us lack \nthe armies to join coalitions, we are seen as unwilling \nor even irrelevant. \n Yet our people feel the same fear as those in \nlarger countries; we suffer the economic effects that \nothers suffer and, dare I say, more so because of our \nvulnerability due to our size. As people at risk, we \nwant to see the billions spent to make war used to bring \nprosperity and hope to those who live in such despair \nthat they can be enticed into the spreading of terror. We \nwill not be dissuaded from our belief that violence and \ndestruction beget war. Only hope and sustainable \ndevelopment can bear peace. \n Today, in our sister Caribbean nation of Haiti, we \nsee the resilience of its people. In the turbulence of the \npast few years, the people of Haiti have refused to \ndespair. Their desire to live in a democratic society \nprevailed when they recently went to the polls to elect \na new Government. We must not suffer Haiti to slide \ninto irrelevance. We all owe Haiti our commitment to \nnurturing its growth by building those institutions \nnecessary for a sustainable nation State. \n At a time when the world has so much wealth that \n$900 billion is being spent on military expenditure and \n$300 billion on agricultural subsidies, but only $60 \nbillion on development assistance, too many of our \npeople remain under the strangulation of poverty, \nrelegated to the dungeons of destitution and social \ninequality. Yet we come to these occasions and speak \nof our strong commitment to preserving the dignity of \nall human beings. We speak of their rights and promise \nto continue to foster dialogue. And when it comes right \n \n \n9 06-53615 \n \ndown to it, where the agreements count most the plight \nof the poor is sacrificed to the bottom line, personal \nwealth and political survival. \n In the Caribbean, we cannot accept that and, \nwhile we applaud the efforts of this Organization and \nthe work that has gone into defining agreed \ndevelopment goals, including addressing the needs of \nour poorest people, the protection of our environment \nand efforts to promote meaningful sustainable \ndevelopment, we must do more. Each child who goes \nto sleep hungry contributes to the shame we must all \nfeel in failing to protect his or her basic rights. Each \nperson who dies of HIV/AIDS is a reflection of our \nlost value for life, and every time the poor die for want \nof food we have failed humanity. \n Twenty-five years ago, as a newly independent \ncountry, Belize was welcomed into the United Nations \nassured of its territorial integrity and its equal place in \nthis community of nations. We earned our rightful \nplace by example and by commitment to this \nOrganization\u2019s highest principles. In return, we \nreceived the solidarity of all. \n Our political independence will remain imperfect \nuntil we find a peaceful and just solution to the \nterritorial claim of Guatemala to Belizean territory. We \nremain committed to finding a solution that respects \nour territorial integrity and honours our sovereignty. \n Membership in the United Nations is an \naffirmation of the will of sovereign peoples. The \nUnited Nations has served as a platform for the \nexpression of that will for many of the nations \nrepresented here today. Let us in turn ensure that the \nUnited Nations remains a beacon of hope for all \npeoples who continue the struggle, such as our brothers \nand sisters in Palestine, Western Sahara, Taiwan and \nthe non-self governing territories. \n We warmly welcome Montenegro to the family of \nnations. \n Our conversation began with my seeking answers \nto the question of the relevance of Belize and other \nsmall States in today\u2019s global order. I find comfort in \nthe winds of change occurring in our Organization, a \nchange that will bring to this sixty-first session of the \nGeneral Assembly a new Secretary-General, and that \nwill continue the process of reform mandated in the \nWorld Summit Outcome. We must, however, make \nchanges relevant to our time and true to our Charter. \n Let us seize this opportunity and face the \nchallenges boldly together. For us in Belize, our minds \nare imbued with the democratic process, our hearts \nbeat with social justice and our souls cherish the treasures of the spirit. "

        "file_text": "I bring to you all warm \ngreetings from the President, Government and people \nof the Republic of Kiribati, on whose behalf I am \nhonoured and privileged to address this Assembly this \nevening. \n Allow me, Sir, to offer my heartiest \ncongratulations to Ms. Al-Khalifa on her election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \nsession. I am confident that under her able stewardship \nthis session will successfully deliver constructive and \nproductive outcomes that will benefit the membership. \nI wish also to offer my congratulations to her \npredecessor for his successful guidance of the work of \nthe Assembly during the past year. \n May I also express to the Secretary-General, \nMr. Kofi Annan, my warmest congratulations on his \nsterling leadership of the Organization during his \ntenure in office. We are grateful for the excellent work \nhe has done in navigating the Organization through the \nchallenges of the past decade. We wish him well in his \nfuture endeavours. \n We continue to be confronted with major \nchallenges. Those challenges affect each of us as \nindividual countries and as members of the \ninternational community. Peace and security remain \nelusive in this world of ours, given the ongoing \nconflicts and the threat of new conflicts around the \nworld. Terrorism continues to plague us, despite the \nbest concerted and collective efforts. Still more needs \nto be done to remove the threat posed by the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. And \nwhile some progress has been made towards addressing \nthe threat posed by the continuing illicit trade in small \narms and light weapons, further work is needed to \neliminate that threat. \n For the least developed countries and the small \nisland developing States, the challenges of economic \ndevelopment remain at the forefront of our agendas. \nMarginalization in the global economy is a feature \ncommon to many least developed countries and small \nisland developing States. The record high price of oil \nhas done little to ease the burden on our small \neconomies. \n In Kiribati, our remoteness and insularity, narrow \neconomic base, small population size and high \npopulation growth rates are factors with which we must \ncontend. We must also deal with the HIV/AIDS \npandemic and tuberculosis, among other diseases, \n  \n \n06-52737 50 \n \nwhich require the diversion of the already meagre \nresources at our disposal to finance development. \n With those daunting challenges looming, we are \nforced to operate in an environment of uncertainty. I \nsay \u201cuncertainty\u201d, because our very survival as a nation \nand as a people with a distinct culture and way of life \nis being threatened by global warming and sea-level \nrise. \n These are challenges that we, as individual \ncountries and as Members of this collective body, need \nto continue to work together to address. In this \nincreasingly interdependent world of ours, ripples \nemanating from one part will ultimately reach out to \ntouch the shores of others. \n Kiribati consists of low-lying coral atolls and is \nparticularly vulnerable to the impact of global warming \nand sea-level rise. For countries such as ours, global \nwarming and sea-level rise are critical security issues. \nWhile we welcome the support that has been \nforthcoming in developing adaptation strategies to \nthese phenomena, there is a limit to the extent to which \nwe can adapt. Rising sea levels will affect our \ngroundwater supply and gradually erode whatever land \nis available on our 33 islands. Yes, we could always \nmove inland to avoid the rising sea levels. But, given \nthe narrowness of our islands, if we move inland too \nfar, we risk falling into either the lagoon or the ocean. \n We will continue to call on the international \ncommunity to agree on a unified global response to \nthese phenomena. We will continue to work with like-\nminded countries in pushing the case for such a \nresponse. We have been disappointed at the lack of \nconsensus on these critical environmental issues. \nIndeed, we deplore the notion that economic growth \nshould take precedence over environmental issues \nwhen the quest for such growth threatens the very \nsurvival of some Members of the Organization. \n Kiribati is a strong supporter of environmental \nconservation efforts. In that regard, we have announced \nthe establishment of the Phoenix Islands Protected \nArea, which is recognized as the third largest marine \nprotected area in the world. We are pleased to have \nbeen able to contribute to global environmental \nconservation efforts through the Protected Area. We are \nprepared to work with those willing and able to ensure \nits sustainability. \n We note the progress that has been made with \nregard to reforming the United Nations. \nUnderstandably, we would have liked to see greater \nprogress made by now, but we fully recognize the need \nfor more discussions on the various relevant issues. \n Indeed, that is multilateralism in practice. The \ndebate on unilateralism versus multilateralism in world \naffairs continues unabated. We see multilateralism in \nfull play in the debate on United Nations reform. We \nconsider that to be a reflection of the healthy interest \nthat each Member country has in the Organization. \nIndeed, in this day and age, multilateralism would \nseem to be a more appropriate approach than \nunilateralism. \n Consensus has yet to be reached on reform of the \nSecurity Council. We note with interest the report of \nthe Working Group. While acknowledging the very \nstrong interest in the issues raised and the need to forge \na consensus, we believe that perhaps there is also a \nneed to consider how much more time will be required \nto move this forward. \n Our position on the issue remains unchanged: \nthose Member States that are major contributors to \nUnited Nations programmes \u2014 especially with regard \nto the maintenance of global peace and security \u2014 \nshould be accorded permanent membership of the \nSecurity Council. In our view, Japan, as such a \nMember State, qualifies for permanent membership. \n Regional cooperation in the Pacific has been \neffective. In the recent past, we have had a number of \nexamples of success in regional cooperative efforts. \nThe Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon \nIslands has made substantial contributions to securing \npeace and law and order in that country. Kiribati is \npleased to have been able to contribute civilian police \npersonnel to the Mission. We will continue to support \nits work as long as the people and the Government of \nthe Solomon Islands wish it to continue. \n The Pacific Regional Assistance to Nauru \nprogramme has made positive contributions to Nauru. \nIn view of the historical ties between our two \ncountries, we have worked closely with Nauru on a \nbilateral basis and remain committed to considering \nother options through which we can extend our \ncollaboration. \n \n \n51 06-52737 \n \n Our leaders will be meeting next month to \ndiscuss, among other things, progress on the Pacific \nPlan. We are satisfied with the initial progress. The \nsuccess or lack thereof of the Pacific Plan will depend \non a number of factors, including the political \ncommitment of each member country to the Plan and \nthe Plan\u2019s ability to deliver tangible benefits over and \nabove what is available, on a bilateral basis, to its \nmembership. \n We extend a warm welcome to the Republic of \nMontenegro, which joined the Organization as a \nMember this year. Montenegro\u2019s membership brings to \n192 the total United Nations membership. The \ncontinuing desire on the part of many to join the \nOrganization attests to the value and continued \nrelevance of the United Nations. \n Therefore, I note with much disappointment and \nregret that the desire of the 23 million people of \nTaiwan to join this Organization of ours continues to \nbe rejected, despite Taiwan\u2019s demonstrated ability, \nwillingness and commitment to contribute to \ninternational collaborative efforts in the pursuit of \nglobal peace and security. In recent years, there has \nbeen much talk of good governance, of democratizing  \n \nnations. Should we not also talk about adopting a \npolicy of good governance in our multilateral \norganizations? Should we also not talk about \ndemocratizing our multilateral organizations? We \ndeplore the sad state of affairs in which a nation of 23 \nmillion people is deliberately exempt from \nparticipation as an equal member of the international \ncommunity. \n The President of the General Assembly has our \nfull support as she carries out the duties of her office. \nWe commit ourselves to working closely with her as \nwe collectively seek to address the challenges facing \nus. \n Allow me to close by conveying to all members \nof the General Assembly our traditional blessing: to \nmauri, to raoi ao to tabomoa \u2014 health, peace and \nprosperity.

        "file_text": "I wish to offer you my \ncongratulations, Madam President, on your election to \nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nfirst session. Your experience in international affairs is \nthe best guarantee of the success of your term. At the \nsame time I express to your predecessor, Mr. Jan \nEliasson, our sincere thanks for his effective and \n  \n \n06-52879 16 \n \nbalanced leadership of the sixtieth session. My special \nappreciation goes also to Kofi Annan for having \ndedicated his life to the Organization, particularly in \nthe past 10 years as Secretary-General, leading it \nthrough difficult challenges and laying the groundwork \nfor its reform. Thank you, Kofi. \n It was in this city on 11 September five years ago \nthat the dramatic realization was forced upon us of just \nhow dangerous the world has become. On that day we \nknew that the new millennium would hold \nunpredictable and complex threats extending beyond \nnational borders; global threats against which notions \nof protection inside national borders are illusory; \nasymmetrical threats that are difficult to counter \neffectively with the instruments previously used to \nsettle conflicts. \n Terrorism and weapons of mass destruction have \nchanged traditional society and its values. They have \nrendered obsolete systems of collective defence and \nsecurity based on deterrence. The old solutions to the \nworld\u2019s problems \u2014 the logic of balance and \nhegemony \u2014 are no longer enough to guarantee \nstability and security. These new threats add a new \nelement to a list that includes regional conflicts in the \nMiddle East, Asia and Africa; pandemics; problems of \ndevelopment and the gap between North and South; \nhuman rights abuses; mass migrations; and issues \nconcerning energy and the environment. These are \nphenomena that it is also impossible to resolve without \na collective assumption of responsibility. \n If we wish to govern these phenomena we need to \nbe equal to their dimensions. No country, however \nstrong and powerful, can take on such complex \nchallenges single-handedly. Global threats demand a \nglobal response. In the final analysis, this means \ncollective partnership. To have chosen as the theme of \nthe sixty-first session \u201cImplementing a global \npartnership for development\u201d was thus particularly \nappropriate. Without collective action by the countries \nin the northern and southern hemispheres, international \norganizations and institutions, the public and private \nsector and civil society, it will be impossible to achieve \nthe goals we have set. \n First and foremost we need to reinvigorate \nmultilateralism, by which I mean above all restoring \nthe central, fundamental role of the United Nations. \nThe recent experience in Lebanon and the \nstrengthening of the United Nations Interim Force in \nLebanon (UNIFIL) is one example of how the United \nNations can regain its crucial importance in the \nresolution of international controversies. Above all, it \ndemonstrates \u2014 and this is the key point \u2014 that if the \nstakeholders are willing to confer upon the United \nNations a strong, central role, the Organization is well \nable to fulfil it. \n In Lebanon we are still at square one, and much \nremains to be done. To underestimate the risk of this \nmission would be a serious mistake. We must, \nhowever, be pleased with how the United Nations, its \nMember States and \u2014 allow me to add \u2014 the \nEuropean Union have addressed a situation that only \ntwo months ago risked getting out of hand, but which \ntoday presents a series of opportunities for the Middle \nEast as a whole. We should be pleased to have set up a \nmission that represents the entire international \ncommunity, a tangible expression of the very global \npartnership that we are discussing today. For, while it \nis true that Europe provides the backbone of UNIFIL, \nit cannot carry out its mission effectively without the \ncontributions of China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, \nRussia, Turkey and the many other non-European \ncountries participating. \n The question we must ask at this point is this: \nwhat do we need to do in order to continue the work \njust begun in Lebanon? More generally, in view of the \ncrises and emergencies that surround us, what does the \nUnited Nations need in order to fulfil the principles of \nthe Charter? It needs two things: first, quick \ncompletion of the reforms, and, secondly, the strong \nand unconditional support of its Members. \n On the issue of reform, last year, after an intense \nseries of negotiations, a moment of summary allowed \nus to lay the groundwork for giving the United Nations \na more incisive role, to the benefit of the international \ncommunity. The Peacebuilding Commission is the first \nmajor result, because it highlights the indestructible \nbond between development, security and human rights. \nA priority commitment to human rights and their \nsafeguarding should be the goal of any country that \nwishes to lend greater ethical authority to its foreign \npolicy. The results achieved by the reform on this \npoint, through the establishment of the new Human \nRights Council, are still being examined. The other \nsignificant outcome is the affirmation of the principle \nof the responsibility to protect, so that the international \ncommunity will no longer be indifferent to acts of \ngenocide. \n \n \n17 06-52879 \n \n But it is on the General Assembly and the \nSecurity Council that we must focus our attention, by \nrestoring the central role of the General Assembly as \nthe main decision-making, representative and policy-\nmaking body of the United Nations; and by renewing \nefforts to reform the Security Council, in terms both of \nits working methods and its composition. In the current \nsituation Member States thus need to send a strong \npolitical signal that will help us to begin a new chapter \nand open the way to an innovative approach. \n In other words, we need to enter a period of \nnegotiation which has thus far eluded us, a period in \nwhich, rather than seeking to impose positions and \nmodels, we can undertake a true comparison of \npositions for the purpose of achieving solutions that are \nnot divisive but, rather, enable the widest possible \nconsensus. But a word of caution: everything is \nnegotiable except for the ownership of the \nOrganization by the Member States, by all of us, an \nownership that represents the true pillar on which \nUnited Nations multilateralism must rest. \n Another way for the United Nations to regain the \nforcefulness and credibility it needs to fulfil its mission \nis by strengthening the role of its great regional \nstakeholders. I am thinking first of the European \nUnion, because if Europe is stronger the United \nNations will be stronger. The world and the United \nNations do not need a Europe that hesitates. Rather, \nthey need a Europe that is able to play its part in \nmeeting the challenges that await us. Europe, in turn, \nmust become more aware that only by contributing to \nthe resolution of global tensions can it give greater \nsecurity and prosperity to its citizens. \n The conditions for performing this role are there. \nThe numbers alone make the European Union a global \nactor \u2014 25 countries with a total population of more \nthan 450 million, representing one fourth of the world\u2019s \ngross domestic product and every month allocating \n\u20ac500 million to third countries. Yet these numbers do \nnot correspond to a comparable ability for the \nEuropean Union to make a difference outside its own \nborders. \n In the work of the Assembly and its various \ncommittees, the European Union is becoming a key \nactor. At every debate and on every resolution its \nposition represents a point of reference in shaping the \nattitudes of the other regional groups. Our goal should \nbe to acquire a similar ability within the Security \nCouncil. It may be a slow process, which will have to \ntake into account points of resistance and stubborn \nlegacies, but it should be pursued with determination. \nOnly if Europe wields a more incisive influence on the \nissues of peace and security can it be considered a true \nglobal actor. The Balkan tragedies in the early 1990s \nwere the result of an absent Europe. But when it is \npresent, and when it is united, Europe can make the \ndifference. That is what we are seeing in the Lebanese \ncrisis. During the sixty-first session of the General \nAssembly, and in the course of its biennium in the \nSecurity Council, Italy will make a special effort to \nincrease the commitment and role of the European \nUnion at the United Nations. \n Our aim is to make the Organization more \neffective in the areas and on the issues in which, by \nhistory and vocation, it can provide the most added \nvalue. The proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction, in particular nuclear weapons, has to be \nseen today in the context, above all, of the negotiation \nunder way with Iran. But it is our duty to look further \nahead and to strive, all together, to consolidate the \ngeneral non-proliferation system. That principle will \ninspire the action of Italy when it enters the Security \nCouncil. \n With regard to the Iranian nuclear file, we are \nready to make our contribution to a negotiated solution \nthat promotes regional security and stability. \n In the Middle East, as I mentioned earlier, we \nneed to seize our opportunities and openings , aware \nthat there will be no peace until the Palestinian \nquestion has been resolved, with an independent, \nsovereign, vital and contiguous Palestinian state next to \nthe state of Israel, and both within secure and \ninternationally recognized borders. \n That grave regional crisis should not lead us to \nforget Africa \u2014 long suffering, prey to ongoing crises, \nand even poorer than it was two decades ago. The \nsituation in Darfur is critical. We cannot stand by and \nwatch, for the simple reason that time has run out. We \nneed to act quickly and strive for a gradual assumption \nof responsibility by the United Nations, in compliance \nwith the decisions of the Security Council. The \nsituation in the Horn of Africa is also a source of \nconcern. Here a strong commitment is required from \nthe Security Council, where, starting on 1 January \n2007, Italy will make its contribution also, on the basis \nof its experience in the region. When I speak of Africa, \n  \n \n06-52879 18 \n \nI mean primarily the gap between the northern and \nsouthern hemispheres, the phenomenon at the root of \nalmost all the ills afflicting our era. It is that gap, \nabove all, that causes the massive migratory flows that \nwe cannot ignore and that we must address with \nrealism, responsibility, equanimity, and especially \nsolidarity. \n In the Mediterranean we are working with our \npartners to address immigration on the basis of those \nprinciples, and seeking to facilitate legal flows and to \ncounter both the illegal flows and the parties that profit \nfrom them, seeking to facilitate the integration into our \ncountries of those who have immigrated legally, filled \nwith hope and the desire to work. \n But there is another dangerous gap that risks \nleaving an even deeper gash in the world. I am \nreferring to what until a few years ago was called a \nclash of civilizations and religions between the \nChristian and Islamic worlds. I refuse to believe that \nsuch a clash exists. Extremists and fanatics do exist, \nbut civilizations and religions were made for the sake \nof dialogue, exchange and mutual enrichment. We can \npromote, and we want to promote, this relationship by \nbuilding new policies to bring us closer to the countries \non the southern shores of the Mediterranean, with the \ngoal of making that sea a basin of peace and \nharmonious coexistence among diverse civilizations \nand religions. \n Let me return to the central issue of this session, \nthe global partnership for development, in order to \nclarify one point. There is a risk that the reinvigoration \nof multilateralism, United Nations reform, and a \ncollective commitment to the various theatres of crisis \nwill produce no lasting effect unless development \nissues are treated as priorities. It is up to the United \nNations as the driving force, the glue of solidarity \namong peoples, and the fullest expression of \nmultilateralism, to keep development at the top of the \ninternational agenda. For it is in the connection \nbetween security, solidarity and development that the \nadded value of the United Nations lies, in the full \nawareness that there can be no peace without \ndevelopment and no development without peace. \n It is not enough to enunciate at this rostrum, as \nspeakers have been doing for six years now, the words \n\u201cMillennium Development Goals\u201d. We must get to \nwork and carry them out, starting with the adoption of \nthe financial, trade, technological and environmental \nsteps required and aiming for a very specific, ambitious \ngoal that responds above all to a moral duty: to \nguarantee a dignified life for every human being. \n I wish to conclude with a few considerations on \nthe fundamental principles and values that inspire our \naction when we deal with multilateralism, the search \nfor peace, security and development, and north-south \nrelations. All these issues coalesce in a defence of life \nand struggle against all forms of hatred, violence, \ndiscrimination and marginalization, undeniable values \nthat, together with democratic principles, are the \nfoundations of coexistence among peoples and should \ninspire the action of the world\u2019s nations. Today, sadly, \nthese values are still denied and trampled upon, as if \nwe had learned nothing from the horrors of the past. \nWe cannot sit by watching indifferently in the face of \nbarbarous acts. We are for peace and solidarity. We are \nagainst the death penalty, injustice and human \nsuffering. That is something we must always \nremember, especially on the eve of major decisions. \nThat is what is expected of us from those who \nsacrificed their lives for peace, for a righteous cause, \nfor an ideal, to defend freedom, the same freedom that \nwe enjoy every day in a democracy.

        "file_text": "On behalf of \nmy Government, I wish to congratulate Ms. Al-Khalifa \non her election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-first session. We are confident \nthat under her guidance and leadership, this session \nwill be productive and will attain the goals set. I assure \nher of my delegation\u2019s full cooperation. \n I would also like to take this opportunity to \nexpress my country\u2019s appreciation to the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the valuable work he has \nperformed during the 10 years of his mandate, which is \nnow drawing to a close. \n Mr. Annan has made an indelible mark on the \nhistory of the United Nations by paying special \nattention to the most pertinent problems affecting our \nplanet, especially the African continent. In particular, \nAngola praises the role which Mr. Annan has played \nduring the most critical phase of the Organization\u2019s \nhistory. I trust that the next Secretary-General will find \nin Mr. Kofi Annan\u2019s legacy an impressive reference for \nthe reinforcement of the Organization\u2019s capacity to \ndeal with the principal problems facing humanity. \n The aspirations to stability, security and social \njustice of the peoples represented in this Assembly \ncontinue to be unfulfilled. The persisting armed \nviolence in some States and the meagre results in the \nfight against world poverty have been contributing to \nthis picture; consequently, these make up the chief \nchallenges facing the United Nations. \n With regard to the new tendencies towards \nviolence, we see something new. It is more \nindiscriminate; it emerges not only from inter-State or \ninternal conflicts, but rather, and increasingly, it arises \nfrom actions that seek to alter the way of life of \nsocieties through intimidation and the brutal \ndestruction of human lives. \n In recent times alone, over a dozen countries in \nfour continents have been severely affected by acts of \nterror, which have become the most direct and \nimmediate threat to international peace and security. In \nspite of political or ideological differences, the \ninternational community has, in general terms, \ndemonstrated firmness and unity in the fight against \nacts of terror. We are of the view that this form of \ncollective action must continue to be the most \nappropriate way of dealing with threats to international \nsecurity, including terrorism. \n Poverty indexes around the world are also a \ncontributing factor to the bleak present-day \ninternational situation. Half of the world\u2019s population, \nor three billion people, continue to live on less than \ntwo dollars a day; 640 million people are without \nappropriate housing; 400 million people do not have \naccess to drinking water; and 270 million people lack \nmedical assistance. Close to one billion people have \nentered the twenty-first century illiterate and with little \nhope of emerging from spiritual and material poverty. \n Africa is the continent most affected by this \nscourge, and not even the potential for economic \ngrowth of some of our countries permits us to hope that \nthe poverty indexes will be drastically reduced. \n Notwithstanding this unwelcome picture, in \nrecent times, we have seen significant progress in the \narea of peace and security, democracy and respect for \nhuman rights. For instance, the resolution through \ndialogue of the Angolan internal conflict, which was \namong the longest-running conflicts in Africa, \nconstitutes one of the more significant success stories \nin this regard. Recently, the Angolan Government \nopted for the same path of dialogue and negotiation in \norder to extend the peace process to the territory of \nCabinda, where some insecurity persisted. \n The establishment of peace in Angola was the \nsupreme objective of a sensible and principled political \nprocess led by President Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos, \nwhose goals were: to liberate, together with some \nforces in our region, the people of southern Africa from \nthe dominance of oppressor regimes; to settle the \nconflicts in Central Africa through negotiation; to \nextinguish the threat that some States represented to \ntheir neighbours; and, finally, to economically develop \nand integrate the region. \n The fruits of this political endeavour are visible \ntoday: the people of the region, who before were under \noppressive regimes, now live in freedom and have built \ndemocratic societies. With Angola\u2019s support, one State \nin Central Africa settled its internal conflict, and, once \n  \n \n06-53005 50 \n \nfree, its people took charge of their destiny and \nrecovered their sense of peace and stability. Another \nState in Central Africa overthrew the dictatorship that \nhad oppressed its people and had created a permanent \nfocus of regional tension by acting as a source of \ninstability for neighbouring countries. Today, the \npeople of that country are engaged in building a new \ndemocratic society by means of transparent elections \nand national reconciliation. \n Now that peace has been achieved, one of the \nfundamental objectives of the Government of Angola is \nthe complete elimination of factors of conflict. We \nhave prioritized the pursuit of political reforms with a \nview to the consolidation of a democratic regime and a \nrighteous State, aware that these constitute \nprerequisites for the maintenance of peace, political \nstability, respect for citizens\u2019 rights and economic \ndevelopment. This is a serious commitment which my \nGovernment will not forsake, the main objective being \nthe regular holding of elections. \n The next electoral process is at an advanced stage \nof preparation, and voter registration will begin next \nNovember. My Government is creating all the \nnecessary conditions to make the next elections \ntransparent and credible, so that their results are \naccepted by all the parties, and so that they constitute a \nstep on the road to prosperity. Therefore, the \norganization of the next elections is going ahead surely \nand firmly. \n Other priorities are the reintegration of the \ndisplaced population, refugees and former combatants, \nas well as the rehabilitation of the economy and the \nreduction of poverty. These areas have registered \nimportant progress. In only four years of peace, \nroughly 4.5 million displaced persons and more than \n400,000 refugees have been resettled. Nearly 200,000 \nformer combatants and members of their families have \nbeen socially and productively reintegrated; and \ncountless infrastructures that were destroyed by the \nconflict are also being rehabilitated. \n The national economy is characterized by a solid \nmacroeconomic stability resulting from a coherent \nmonetary and budgetary policy. It is among the fastest-\ngrowing economies in the world. For 2006 and future \nyears, we foresee continuous, vigorous economic \ngrowth, of the order of 20 per cent. \n In social terms, the results over the last four years \nare also encouraging. Poverty has been reduced from \nover 80 per cent to 56 per cent. With the ongoing \nimplementation of poverty reduction programmes and \nsubstantial investment in capital goods, we foresee a \ngradual improvement of social well-being and \nemployment indexes in the short term. The global \nadvances which my country has achieved in four years \nof peace are evidence that its people can look to the \nnew Angola with real hope. The international \ncommunity can count on Angola as a dependable \npartner. \n In the area of peace, important progress has been \nmade in other parts of the African continent. The \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, a neighbour and \nbrother of Angola, is steadily approaching a situation \nof normality, which is likely to contribute to the \nlessening of tensions in Central Africa and in the Great \nLakes region. Recently, and for the first time in its \nhistory, the people of this country exercised their right \nto freely choose their legitimate representatives. Such \nan act marks a crucial stage in the process of \ndemocratic transition and the consolidation of internal \nstability. It was made possible by the support of the \ninternational community, particularly of Angola, which \nsupplied $30 million and some logistical means for the \nelectoral process. \n Angola has always stood by the Congolese people \nand always will. It contributed to the cessation of the \ninternal conflict that devastated the country and is \ncurrently contributing to building the capacity of the \nCongolese institutions charged with maintaining \ninternal peace, security and order. It is now up to the \nCongolese parties to demonstrate that they are truly \ncommitted to peace and democracy. We want to believe \nthat they will not frustrate the expectations of their \npeople and of the international community and that \nthey will respect the verdict of the ballot box. \n The situation in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire remains volatile. \nThe Ivorian people continue to be the principal victims \nof a conflict that is jeopardizing the country\u2019s future. \nAngola associates itself with the efforts of the \ninternational community to reach a definitive and \npeaceful resolution of the conflict in that country. \n In the Middle East, the continuing violence is \nrendering ineffective any blueprints for peace aimed at \nresolving the conflict between Israel and Palestine. \nAngola supports the right to existence of all States in \nthe area as well as their right to live in peace with their \nneighbours. It is important to return to a process aimed \n \n \n51 06-53005 \n \nat the peaceful resolution of the conflict \u2014 a process \nbased on the road map for peace \u2014 in order to arrive at \na comprehensive solution leading to regional \nstabilization. \n Angola hopes that the people of Iraq and of \nAfghanistan will be able, in the short term, to fulfil \ntheir aspirations to live free from violence and from \ntension, and that those countries will be respected as \nsovereign and genuine States. \n In conclusion, we would like to reiterate our \ndesire that the process of reform of the United Nations, \nmainly of the Security Council, be accelerated. The \ncurrent composition of that organ is anachronistic and \nfails to reflect the contemporary structures of the \ninternational community. \n In the context of United Nations reform, we wish \nto stress the importance of the recent creation of the \nPeacebuilding Commission and of the Human Rights \nCouncil. I would like in that respect to express my \ngratitude to all Members of the United Nations for the \ntrust they placed in my country, which is to preside \nover the Peacebuilding Commission during its first \nyears of existence.

        "file_text": "It gives me pleasure, on behalf of \nthe delegation of the United Arab Emirates, to extend \nto you, Madam President, and to your fraternal country, \nthe Kingdom of Bahrain, our heartfelt congratulations \non your election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-first session. We are confident \nthat your wide experience will enable you to deal \nwisely and competently with the issues on our agenda, \nand we wish you every success. We also take this \nopportunity to commend your predecessor, Mr. Jan \nEliasson, for the skilful manner in which he managed \nthe work of the sixtieth session, and to thank Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan for his outstanding efforts, which \nhave significantly contributed to strengthening the role \nof this international organization in addressing the \nchallenges the world has faced during his term of \noffice.  \n In spite of all the expectations that we hoped \nwould be fulfilled in the areas of establishing peace \nand collective security, development, strengthening \nhuman rights and the rule of law, and reform of the \nUnited Nations, we meet today amid extremely serious \nsecurity, political and economic conditions that have \nresulted in increasing poverty and epidemics and have \nprevented the sustainable development mechanisms \nfrom achieving the desired development goals of the \n2005 Summit. Instead of intensifying our efforts to \nstrengthen international relations and enhance positive \ninvestment in economic globalization, we had to direct \nour efforts towards finding temporary solutions for the \ngrave security threats facing our world today in many \nregions. \n The major weakness demonstrated by the \nperformance of some bodies of this international \norganization, especially in those entrusted with \nmaintaining international peace and security, requires a \nreconsideration of the ways to reform its main \n  \n \n06-52879 28 \n \nstructures and working methods, particularly for the \nSecurity Council. Most recent events have proved its \ninability to take the immediate and effective measures \nneeded to stop acts of aggression and to end \noccupation. \n Therefore, as we study the proposals by the \nSecretary-General for developing the work of the \nOrganization, we must ensure that reform is based on \nthe principles of equality among States in rights and \nduties in order to ensure that developing and small \ncountries are increasingly and effectively represented \nin the Security Council in accordance with the \nprinciple of equitable geographical distribution. It is \nalso necessary to strengthen the working methods of \nthe Security Council to ensure that it does not infringe \nupon the competencies of the Secretariat, the General \nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council, so \nthat the performance and effectiveness of those bodies \ncan be strengthened and increased. \n The United Arab Emirates \u2014 which collaborates \nwith the sisterly countries of the Gulf Cooperation \nCouncil (GCC), the League of Arab States and other \ngroups in supporting all possible diplomatic and \nmediation efforts aimed at containing the hotbeds of \ntension and conflicts in the Middle East region, \nincluding the Arabian Gulf \u2014 reiterates the importance \nof resolving differences through peaceful means and of \nstrengthening confidence-building measures based on \nthe principle of respect for the sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity of States and non-interference in \ntheir internal affairs. All this falls under our common \nresponsibility to maintain the requirements of regional \nand international peace, security and stability.  \n Therefore, we ask the Islamic Republic of Iran to \ndemonstrate its goodwill towards finding a just and \nlasting settlement for its occupation of the three United \nArab Emirates islands, Greater and Lesser Tunb and \nAbu Musa, by responding to our country\u2019s repeated \ninitiatives, which were endorsed by the Arab Gulf \nCooperation Council, the Council of the League of \nArab States and the international community. Those \ninitiatives call for initiating direct and serious \nnegotiations on this issue or referring it to the \nInternational Court of Justice for legal arbitration. \n We support the right of countries to use nuclear \nenergy for peaceful purposes under the safeguards of \nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). We \noptimistically look forward to continuing the Iranian-\nEuropean talks on Iran\u2019s nuclear question in order to \nreach a lasting and peaceful settlement and to ensure \nthat the safety and security of the peoples and countries \nof the region are not exposed to any threat, danger or \nunnecessary new confrontations.  \n We also stress that the international community \nmust deal with this question with utmost transparency \nso as to ensure the implementation of all relevant \nresolutions of the United Nations, in particular those \ncalling for the establishment of a zone free from \nweapons of mass destruction, including nuclear \nweapons, in the Middle East and the Arabian Gulf. \nThat makes it incumbent upon Israel to accede to the \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \nand to subject all of its nuclear facilities to the IAEA \nsafeguards regime. \n The United Arab Emirates supports the political \nprocess in Iraq and efforts for its reconstruction, and \nhopes that the efforts of the Iraqi Government will lead \nto achieving national unity, consolidating security and \nstability in Iraq, and implementing the \nrecommendations of the Abu Dhabi Declaration and \nthe New York conference on the International Compact \nfor the Reconstruction of Iraq. \n We also reaffirm our full support for all regional \nand international measures to combat terrorism in all \nits forms and manifestations, as it constitutes a grave \nthreat to the security and sovereignty of States and \ncauses unjustified depletion of civilian lives and \nproperties. We also support international efforts aimed \nat convening an international conference to define this \nphenomenon, address its causes and set the standards \nfor differentiating between terrorism and the right of \npeople to self-determination.  \n As we all strive to create a suitable environment \nfor promoting dialogue among civilizations and \nstrengthening religious tolerance, we heard with regret \nand surprise the recent statements by Pope Benedict \nXVI, which gave an opportunity to the extremists to \ndeepen the gap of intolerance and to raise doubts about \nthe intentions of others. That makes it incumbent on us \nto avoid repeating such statements in future in order to \npromote further understanding between religions and \ncivilizations. \n We are deeply concerned at the continued \ninability of the international community to solve the \nPalestinian question and establish peace in the Middle \nEast. That has encouraged Israel to continue its \noccupation of the Palestinian territories, the Sheba\u2019a \nfarms in Lebanon and the Syrian Golan, and to repeat \nits aggressions on various levels. Therefore, we urge \nthe United Nations to respond today to the recent \n \n \n29 06-52879 \n \ninitiative of the League of Arab States, which calls \nupon the international organization to play an effective \nrole in reviving the peace process in the Middle East \nand resume direct negotiations on all tracks, in \naccordance with resolutions of international legitimacy \nand the Arab Peace Initiative.  \n We also affirm that consolidation of peace and \nstability in the Middle East region cannot be achieved \nthrough military power or the continued and deliberate \ndestruction of the infrastructure in the Palestinian \nterritories and in Lebanon, but through compelling \nIsrael to ensure its full compliance with international \nresolutions, including the resumption of negotiations \nwith the Palestinian Authority and the release of \nPalestinian funds and the thousands of Palestinian \ndetainees and prisoners. Israel is further requested to \nopen the crossing points to secure delivery of \nemergency humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian \npeople, to remove settlements and the separation wall \nand to withdraw fully from all the Palestinian \nterritories occupied since 1967, including East \nJerusalem, so that the establishment of an independent \nPalestinian State, with Al-Quds al-Sharif as its capital, \ncan be declared. \n We welcome the considerable efforts by the \nLebanese Government to extend its control throughout \nits national territories, with the support of the United \nNations Interim Force in Lebanon. In this regard we \ndemand that the international community intensify its \npressures on Israel to compel it to fulfil its legal \nobligations, as provided in Security Council resolution \n1701 (2006), including its full respect for Lebanon\u2019s \nsovereignty and territorial integrity, handing over maps \nof landmines and entering into negotiations on the \nexchange of prisoners. We also affirm the importance \nof doubling the international assistance directed to the \nreconstruction of Lebanon. \n As for the Sudan \u2014 and following up the \ncircumstances relating to Security Council resolution \n1706 (2006) \u2014 we had hoped that the Sudan would \nhave been given sufficient time to resolve the Darfur \nquestion internally. We declare our support for the \nefforts of the Sudanese Government to find a lasting \nsolution to this question. We hope that the United \nNations and the African Union will continue their \npositive role in this regard, in conformity with the Arab \nLeague\u2019s efforts, in order to maintain the sovereignty, \nterritorial integrity and independence of the Sudan.  \n We also call for strengthening of the efforts and \nendeavours to reconcile political differences and \ndisputes in regions such as Somalia, Afghanistan, other \nAfrican countries and troubled regions of the world in \norder to contain tensions and conflicts in those regions \nand assist their peoples to realize their aspirations \ntowards permanent peace, stability and prosperity.  \n The United Arab Emirates, which incorporated \nthe Millennium Development Goals in its national \ndevelopment policy and has come a long way in the \nprocess of achieving economic and human \ndevelopment, has extended generous assistance to \nmany poor and affected countries. In this regard, the \nUnited Arab Emirates would like to stress that with the \nongoing problems of poverty, infectious diseases and \nunemployment, in addition to other economic, social \nand environmental problems, the international \ncommunity must develop a firm and effective \ninternational mechanism that ensures a continuous flow \nof assistance to developing countries so as to enable \nthem to improve their living conditions and build their \nnational economies.  \n It is incumbent upon the advanced States, \nespecially the Group of Eight, to fulfil their \ncommitments as agreed at international conferences, \nespecially in easing the onerous commercial conditions \nimposed on developing countries\u2019 trade, on their efforts \nto attract foreign capital and investment and on their \nuse of advanced technology for peaceful purposes, in \norder to avoid marginalizing those countries and to \nensure better participation for them in international \ntrade. \n Finally, we hope that our deliberations on the \nagenda items during this session will have a positive \noutcome that will contribute to addressing the critical \nissues we face today, and that they will enhance our \ncommon efforts to create a world based on the \nprinciples of the rule of law, justice, tolerance and \npeace.

        "file_text": "I \nwould like to begin by congratulating the Republic of \nMontenegro on its recent accession to the United \nNations Organization. We fully understand the \nchallenges that country faces and wish it every success \nin the establishment of a secure and prosperous State. \n I wish to express our highest appreciation to the \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixtieth \nsession, Mr. Jan Eliasson, for his enthusiastic \ndedication and skilful leadership during the past year. \nWe now sincerely look forward to working with the \nPresident of the General Assembly at this session, \nSheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, and I pledge her \nLatvia\u2019s full support. I also congratulate her on being \nonly the third woman ever to preside over the General \nAssembly. \n A year ago, we marked the sixtieth anniversary of \nthe United Nations by setting out a far-reaching reform \nplan to bring the Organization closer to the needs of \nthe twenty-first century. While the United Nations \nspectrum of peacekeeping, humanitarian and human \nrights operations has increased significantly in recent \nyears, the United Nations must continue to step up its \nactivities if it is to meet the urgent needs of millions of \npeople throughout the world. \n The current situation presents us with great \nchallenges at the global level that require us to act with \nurgency and coordination. We will be able to attain the \nMillennium Development Goals and reduce the \ncrushing poverty that is debilitating the lives of billions \nof people across this planet only if we pool our \nresources and redouble our efforts. We need to pursue \nour campaign against well-known scourges that include \n  \n \n06-52737 24 \n \ncontagious disease and the destruction of the global \nenvironment. \n(spoke in English) \n We can take satisfaction in noting that a number \nof serious and meaningful measures have already been \ntaken to alleviate the plight of the world\u2019s poor. Those \nimportant steps must be followed up by continued \nmeasures to help the world\u2019s poorest nations become \nmore self-sufficient. At the same time, the developing \ncountries must do their utmost to implement the \npractices of good governance, strengthen their \ninstitutions and abide by the rule of law. \n It is worth emphasizing that the United Nations \nhas been an effective instrument in those countries \nwhere the political will has existed to cooperate fully \nwith the United Nations programmes and proposals for \nalleviating the plight of the poor. At the same time, the \nefficiency of United Nations operations has also been \ncalled into question, and not without reason. More \ninnovative approaches need to be deployed for \nalleviating poverty and reaching set development \nobjectives. Among those, we should look more to the \neffective use of information, communication and \nmodern technologies. \n I well remember the excitement at the \nMillennium Summit in 2000, when we adopted the \nMillennium Declaration. Progress towards reaching the \nMillennium Development Goals, alas, is still \nunacceptably slow. The statistics on infant mortality \nand maternal health, among others, remain particularly \ndistressing. Millions of our fellow human beings have \nno access to clean drinking water, let alone more \nsophisticated comforts. We cannot remain indifferent \nwhen so much needs to be done. \n In many parts of the world, the misery brought on \nby poverty is compounded by such debilitating and \nmortal diseases as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and \nmalaria. While much has already been achieved to \ncontrol the spread of those afflictions, further \npartnerships need to be developed with other \nstakeholders, including those in the private sector. \n Only a few days ago, the States Members of the \nUnited Nations concluded a High-level Dialogue on \nInternational Migration and Development. The \ndramatic increase of illegal migration in recent years \nhas placed great stress on the international system for \nprotecting refugees and asylum-seekers. The activities \nof the Office of the United Nations High \nCommissioner for Refugees on migration issues should \nbe coordinated with regional cooperation efforts in \norder to become more effective. \n We have had the great misfortune to see terrorism \ncontinue as a threat to international peace and security. \nI welcome, therefore, the recent agreement on a Global \nCounter-Terrorism Strategy and urge the United \nNations Member States to intensify their efforts to \nreach a consensus on a comprehensive anti-terrorism \nconvention. \n We have failed to make any substantial progress \nover the past year in the area of disarmament and the \nnon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. That \nis a fundamental issue for global peace and security \nand I encourage all United Nations Member States to \ndemonstrate their willingness to move forward at a \nfaster pace. \n The United Nations also needs to provide a \nprompt and effective response when armed conflicts \narise. We must strive to make United Nations \npeacekeeping a more effective and accepted instrument \nof collective security. Too often in the past, the United \nNations has been unable to prevent genocide and \nlasting bloodshed \u2014 in the Congo, in Rwanda, in the \nformer Yugoslavia and now in the Darfur region of the \nSudan. During the past 10 years, the operational \nactivity of the United Nations in peacekeeping has \nquadrupled, but that may still not be enough. The \ndemand for rapid action cannot be met through United \nNations mechanisms alone, but requires a more \neffective partnership between the United Nations and \nregional organizations. \n The most recent example of the need for a \nconcerted peacekeeping effort is the tragic sequence of \nevents in Israel and Lebanon this past summer. \nPeacekeeping can facilitate solutions, but not impose \nthem. In Iraq and in Afghanistan, as well as in the \ncontinuing conflict between the Israelis and the \nPalestinians, there will be no durable peace until all \nparties renounce the use of violence to achieve political \naims. A long-lasting settlement requires the political \nwill of all parties in the region to negotiate a viable \ncompromise in good faith, where a secure State of \nIsrael coexists side by side with an independent State \nof Palestine. \n Currently, the United Nations is uniquely \npositioned to take a leading role in peacebuilding. We \n \n \n25 06-52737 \n \nexpect the recently established Peacebuilding \nCommission to help those countries that are emerging \nfrom conflict not to be drawn back into it, and hope \nthat the Commission will serve to promote the post-\nconflict reconstruction and long-term development of \nregions that have suffered from warfare. \n Along with the promotion of peace and security \nand the alleviation of poverty, the protection of human \nrights is one of the main missions of the United \nNations. The recent creation of the Human Rights \nCouncil will hopefully enable the United Nations to \nrespond more promptly and effectively in situations \nwhere human rights come under threat. The Council \nneeds to provide real leadership to restore trust in the \nUnited Nations as a guardian, defender and promoter \nof that universal value. \n However, the effectiveness of the Human Rights \nCouncil depends entirely on the political will and \nconduct of the Member States. We must work together \nto ensure that this new institution, in which we have \nplaced such high hopes, truly serves the purpose for \nwhich it was created. \n During this session, we will face the difficult task \nof furthering the reform of the United Nations. We \nhave to accept the fact that none of the United Nations \nMember States will be able to attain absolutely \neverything they desire from the reform process. At no \npoint should any Members think of negotiations for \nthese necessary reforms as a zero-sum game in which \nsome will be losers and some winners. It is possible to \narrive at solutions that constitute a win-win situation \nfor everybody. It takes hard work and a lot of patience, \nbut it can be done. \n It is natural for different countries to have \ndifferent priorities and different threat perceptions. \nThat is a fact of life. It is precisely for that reason that \nwe need the United Nations as a central meeting place \nwhere our common interests can be determined and our \ncommon plans hammered out in an inclusive and \ndemocratic manner. The ongoing reforms of the United \nNations are needed for the benefit and advantage of us \nall, without exception. \n The international agreements that are reached \nwithin the United Nations bear a unique legitimacy, \nmoral weight and political authority. Yet it is no secret \nthat in an Organization with nearly 200 Members, the \ndecision-making process can be protracted. \nNevertheless, despite the painstakingly slow pace of \nUnited Nations reform to date, there has been some \nnotable progress during the past year. It is vital for the \nUnited Nations to continue striving for more trust and \ngoodwill among all our nations, for we simply cannot \nafford to do otherwise. \n There is general agreement that the time has \ncome for a serious overhaul of the United Nations \nmanagement system. An effective Secretariat is crucial \nfor the United Nations system\u2019s ability to adapt to \nevolving challenges. So far, only the initial steps have \nbeen taken in transforming the United Nations into a \nmore efficient and accountable Organization. The time \nhas come for meaningful changes, and I hope that we \nwill establish tangible results during this sixty-first \nsession. \n Mandate review is another essential element of \nthe reform process where our aspirations have been \nhigher than the result achieved. Only a fraction of the \nnumerous mandates have been classified and the \nquestion of what to do with them is still pending. We \nneed to move ahead energetically, bearing in mind that \nthis is not a blind cost-cutting exercise but an ongoing \nprocess of feedback needed to improve the \neffectiveness and quality of the Organization\u2019s work. \nRational use of resources and cost-efficiency will allow \nus to do more with the resources at the command of the \nUnited Nations, without any duplication of effort. \n There has been a growing feeling among United \nNations Member States of the need for a revitalized \nand more effective General Assembly. I welcome the \nregular meetings among the Presidents of the General \nAssembly, the Security Council and the Economic and \nSocial Council with the aim of achieving maximum \ncomplementarity among those principal organs. The \nCharter of the United Nations provides us with the \nfundamental guidelines for our work, and we should be \nguided by it in a spirit of cooperation, not rivalry. It is \nself-defeating, unproductive and wasteful to invest \ntime and effort in a competition among the main bodies \nof the United Nations. Only by rising above such \ninternal divisions can the United Nations hope to truly \nfulfil the leading role that it has to play in order to \nserve the needs of the world community as a whole. \n We must also not neglect the reform of the \nSecurity Council, which needs to be more \nrepresentative of the state of the world in 2006. While \nthis matter should not overshadow the rest of the \nreform process, neither can it be indefinitely \n  \n \n06-52737 26 \n \npostponed. Progress on this issue needs to be made, for \nit would invigorate and give added impetus to the \noverall reform process. The Security Council has a \ncentral role to play in maintaining international peace \nand security. If it is to function as a truly effective \norgan, then it must attain both a stronger capacity and a \ngreater willingness to act in the face of international \ncrises and tensions and it must find ways of responding \nmore rapidly at the outbreak of armed conflicts. \n At this sixty-first session of the General \nAssembly, we must make every effort to make progress \nin adjusting the United Nations to the needs and \nchallenges of our times. This session will be the last \nunder the stewardship of Secretary-General Kofi \nAnnan. During his mandate, Mr. Annan has exhibited \noutstanding leadership in setting the agenda and \nestablishing a clear vision of the goals of the United \nNations. I therefore take this opportunity to thank him \nfor his tireless dedication to the United Nations and for \nframing and initiating the much-needed reform \nprocess. His successor will inherit a vast and complex \nagenda which can only be tackled with maximum \ncooperation and flexibility from all Member States. \n The United Nations requires a Secretary-General \nwho will be willing to listen to and to respect the views \nof all, but who will also have the personal courage to \npush for the necessary, but possibly unpopular, \ndecisions that are needed for the good of the \nOrganization as a whole. A Secretary-General must be \nendowed with leadership, vision, fairness and \nobjectivity. He or she must be a true citizen of the \nworld who can feel the pulse of humanity. He or she \nmust have the passion and commitment to spare no \neffort in facing up to the most demanding of \nchallenges. \n Today, the United Nations is at a crossroads and \nfaces a choice: to address the challenges of the twenty-\nfirst century through the combined efforts of all its \nMember States, or to gradually lose its influence in the \ninternational community. \n As many here are aware, I recently announced my \ndecision to submit my candidacy for the position of \nSecretary-General. I highly appreciate the confidence \nplaced in me by the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi \nAnnan, when he appointed me Special Envoy on \nUnited Nations Reform. I am personally committed to \naddressing the challenges posed by United Nations \nreform and to promoting human rights, freedom and \ndemocracy, including gender equality. While women \nrepresent half of the world\u2019s population, no woman has \never been at the helm of this Organization. I believe \nthat the time has come for a woman to be considered a \nserious candidate for the position of Secretary-General. \n It so happens that, as a result of historical events \nin the twentieth century, no Secretary-General has ever \ncome from Eastern Europe. Yet that region has a \nwealth of experience to share about its ability to effect \nradical change and achieve progress in a remarkably \nbrief period of time. \n Nevertheless, the principle of regional rotation \nshould not be the principal or sole factor in the \nselection of a candidate. While I deeply respect the \ncandidates who have already been nominated from one \npart of the world, the selection procedure should not \nrestrict the rights and opportunities of potential \ncandidates from any other part of the world. I hope that \nthe choice made by the Security Council and the \nGeneral Assembly will be based solely on the \ncandidate\u2019s qualifications, personal qualities and \nvision. \n The world needs a strong United Nations, and we \nas leaders need to build bridges of understanding if we \nare to make the United Nations as strong as it needs to \nbe. We need to keep alive the main goal of the founders \nof the United Nations, who were determined \u201cto save \nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war\u201d. We \nowe it to our children, who will inherit this planet, to \nsave them also from the scourges of terrorism, of \nhunger and of disease. \n Because of my own personal experience as a \nchild of war and a refugee, having known fear, cold, \nloss and hunger in my time, I urge world leaders to \nsave every child that we can from such experiences. \nOur common goal is to extend worldwide the peace, \nfreedom and prosperity that so many nations have \nalready achieved. It can be done; it must be done. But \nit is something that we can achieve only by all of us \nworking together. "

        "file_text": "First \nand foremost, Madam President, on behalf of my \ndelegation and on my own behalf, permit me to convey \nto you our heartfelt congratulations on your \noutstanding election to the presidency of the sixty-first \nsession of the General Assembly. We are certain that \ndue to your qualities, talent and experience, you will \nlead us satisfactorily in our work. Our congratulations \nare also directed to your predecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson \nand his team, whose dedication and fervour have \nenabled us to accomplish an enormous amount of work \nthat has been appreciated by all and was carried out \nwithin an especially troubling international context.  \n In addition, we would like to pay a well-deserved \ntribute to His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, the \nSecretary-General of our Organization, whose \nextremely important role in promoting the \nimplementation of our ideals will be engraved in the \nannals of our Organization. \n We have unceasingly, before this same Assembly, \ncondemned all forms of violence and intolerance, \nespecially in its most terrible manifestation that has \nbeen most visible in our time \u2014 terrorism. We have \ncommitted ourselves to respect the United Nations \nCharter, which was created precisely to save \n \n \n33 06-53323 \n \nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war and to \nmaintain international peace and security. \n Our responsibility requires that we work together \nin order to eliminate the major scourges that threaten \nhumanity. With regard to fighting terrorism, I reiterate \nthat my country has signed and ratified most of the \ninternational instruments pertaining to that scourge, \nand that it is cooperating with different countries and \nrelevant United Nations institutions in order to \ncontinue that fight. Furthermore, along with terrorism, \nthe past year has seen alarming situations in many \nyoung States that are victims of war and serious armed \nconflicts, taking place throughout the world, and that \ncause instability and challenge the efforts made by \nthose States to establish democratic institutions and \nfoster socio-economic progress for their peoples.  \n As far as my country is concerned, despite \nattempts to destabilize and anti-constitutional seizures \nof power \u2014 problems that it continues to experience \u2014 \nwe organized free and transparent presidential elections \nfor 3 May 2006, in which the Chadian people renewed \ntheir confidence in His Excellency President Idriss \nDeby Itno. Subsequently, a political dialogue took \nplace from 28 July to 2 August 2006 in N\u2019Djamena. \nThere, 54 out of the 78 legally recognized political \nparties took part in that important forum, whose \nconclusions will, undoubtedly, lay the foundation for \nthe consolidation of the rule of law and the \nstrengthening of the democratic process in our country. \n It would be an illusion to think that my country \nwill enjoy the necessary stability, without difficulties, \nneeded to consolidate the democratic rule of law, if it \ncontinues to suffer the pernicious effects of the Darfur \ncrisis. We have just normalized our relations with the \nSudan, after we had been compelled to break off \ndiplomatic relations because of the subversive plotting \nagainst us in connection with Darfur. We hope to renew \nthe bonds of friendship and good neighbourliness with \nthat fraternal country that we have had in the past.  \n Nevertheless, we continue to be concerned about \nthe Darfur crisis, which threatens not just our security, \nbut also that of the entire subregion. The Darfur \nconflict has caused enormous harm to Chad and the \nChadian people since it began in 2003, including a lack \nof security, economic loss and environmental \ndestruction. Incursions of the Janjaweed into Chadian \nterritory brought the fighting in Darfur into the eastern \npart of Chad, resulting in the displacement of more \nthan 50,000 Chadians, the deaths of hundreds and the \nplundering of thousands of heads of livestock, among \nother problems. \n Chad was the first country to receive and assist \nrefugees from Darfur \u2014 more than 300,000 \u2014 before \nthe international community intervened. In addition to \nthose refugees, we have an increasing number of \nCentral African refugees. Central Africa is, after Chad, \nthe next biggest victim of the Darfur crisis, which risks \nspreading \u2014 if we are not careful \u2014 throughout the \nentire subregion of Central Africa. \n In that connection, we welcome the extension to \nthe end of December 2006 of the African Union \nmission in Darfur. It is better than nothing. \nNevertheless, faced with the difficulties of the \nGovernment of the Sudan and the African Union in \ncontaining the crisis, we reaffirm our position that is \nwell known and not new. The United Nations must take \nover from the African Union, pursuant to Security \nCouncil resolution 1706 (2006). We say that in \nfriendship with our Sudanese brothers, while \nrespecting their sovereignty. Our position should in no \nway be construed as hostile to the fraternal \nGovernment of the Sudan. It has nothing to do with \nwhat some are calling an international conspiracy \nagainst the Sudan. It is based simply on common sense \nand is aimed at providing assistance to the innocent \nvictims of the war. Furthermore, Chad has more to gain \nthan any other country from the restoration of peace to \nDarfur, if only because that would enable the hundreds \nof thousands of Sudanese refugees located on our \nterritory to return to their country and thus put an end \nto the sacrifices being made by the Chadian host \npopulation. \n Furthermore, we are finding it difficult to ensure \nthe security of the refugee camps, which, as they are \nopen and located not very far from the border, are used \nby some Sudanese rebels as safe havens, resupply \nstations and recruiting grounds. That is why we had \nhoped that international forces would be sent to the \neastern part of the country to help us to secure the \nrefugee camps and guarantee their neutrality, as well as \nto ensure the security of the common border and to \nprevent the crisis in Darfur from spilling over. \n At this time of rapid globalization, which many \nthought would be inclusive and beneficial, the gap \nbetween rich and poor countries is growing. Despite \nthe efforts being made by our States \u2014 which are \n  \n \n06-53323 34 \n \nweakened and subjected to abusive constraints by \ninternational institutions and other partners \u2014 the \nintegration of our economies within the globalization \nprocess aimed at achieving harmonious and sustainable \ndevelopment still seems remote, while the current rules \nand regulations of the market economy undermine the \ncompetitiveness of our economies. How can our beset \ncountries achieve the Millennium Development Goals \ngiven our ongoing lack of income, the heavy debt \nburden and the scourges of HIV/AIDS and malaria? \n My country had a disagreement with the World \nBank following our revision of Law 001 pertaining to \noil revenues. We are therefore pleased with the fruitful \ndialogue that we have had with the Bank, which has \nled to a mutually acceptable compromise and to the \nresumption of our cooperation with that great \ninstitution.  \n In the same vein, with regard to the defence of \nour interests so that our people can benefit from the \nnatural resources of our country, it should be pointed \nout to the international community that there has been \na recent deterioration in our relationship with two \nmembers of the oil consortium that is active in our \ncountry because they have refused to pay a profits tax \nto the Chadian authorities. Furthermore, we have \nexpressed the outrage of the people of Chad at the fact \nthat they benefit from only 12.5 per cent of the fees \nassociated with the exploitation of their oil resources. \nWe have denounced the fact that three years of the sale \nof our oil yielded us only $588 million, while the oil \ncompanies amassed $5 billion. We ask that justice be \ndone. Indeed, we demand our legitimate right to \nparticipate directly in the production and marketing of \nour resources. If we cannot, the sovereign rights of our \ncountry will be trampled underfoot, its objective of \npoverty reduction will come to naught and our dream \nof economic and social progress will remain an \nillusion. \n Beyond our own problems, we are concerned \nabout conflict situations elsewhere on the continent and \nin other parts of the world. We welcome the efforts \nmade within the African Union and the United Nations \nto find lasting solutions, and we express our readiness \nto provide assistance to the extent possible.  \n For example, we believe that the national \nreconciliation process in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is on the right \ntrack, although some minor problems have been \nencountered. We note that both the African Union and \nthe United Nations are playing a major role there. All \nIvorian political stakeholders must acknowledge the \npain and suffering of the people and understand that \nthere are limits to the patience of the members of \ninternational community. They must make a \ndetermined effort to put an end to the conflict \u2014 a \nconflict that has had grave consequences for the \nstability of the subregion. \n In the Middle East, including Palestine, we were \nappalled and outraged by the recent events that took \nplace in southern Lebanon, resulting in the massive \ndestruction of the infrastructure of the country and the \nloss of life among civilians. We hope that the \nprovisions of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) \nwill be respected with a view to a favourable outcome.  \n We also remain concerned about the continuing \ndeterioration of the situation in the Palestinian \nterritories, especially the Gaza Strip and the West \nBank. We call on the international community to \ninvolve itself more fully in the resolution of the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict, which has for too long been a \nsource of instability in that region. \n Anti-personnel landmines and unexploded \nordnance are a legacy of armed conflict, and my \ncountry continues to pay a high price for armed \nconflicts and other wars conducted on its territory. As a \nState party to the Ottawa Convention, it is in the \nprocess of destroying them in cooperation with friendly \ncountries, international organizations and non-\ngovernmental organizations and I would like to take \nthis opportunity to thank them for their ongoing \nsupport. I request those friendly countries and \ninstitutions to continue to provide assistance so that the \nprogramme to combat those deadly devices can be \nstrengthened. \n The structures of our Organization are neither fair \nnor democratic. In this regard, my country continues to \nalign itself with the African position with regard to the \nrestructuring of the United Nations, including the \nexpansion of the Security Council, with a view to \nensuring equitable representation for all regions of the \nworld. The reforms undertaken in the past year, \nespecially in the framework of the implementation of \nthe recommendations and decisions of the 2005 \nSummit, have the unswerving support of my country, \nwhich is looking forward with interest to the outcome \nof the various consultations currently under way.

        "file_text": "I \nwish to convey Papua New Guinea\u2019s congratulations to \nyou, Madam President, on your election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \nsession. I assure you of my country\u2019s full cooperation \nduring your presidency. We compliment your \npredecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, for his stewardship of \nour work during his tenure. We also congratulate him \non his appointment as Sweden\u2019s Foreign Minister and \nwish him well. \n On 10 October 1975, 24 days after Papua New \nGuinea attained political independence, I stood at this \nvery rostrum and addressed the Assembly with a lot of \nhope and expectations. Like many developing countries \ncoming out from the colonial yoke, Papua New Guinea \ncommitted itself to the principles and purposes of the \nUnited Nations. I said: \u201cI state our fundamental \ncommitment to the maintenance of peace throughout \nour world and our undertaking to uphold the principles \nof the Charter of the United Nations Organization.\u201d \n We believed that the United Nations was the most \nappropriate body to achieve our aspirations of \nmeaningful economic development, respect for our \nsovereignty and the attainment of a peaceful and secure \nworld. The harsh reality today is that these aspirations \nremain largely unfulfilled for many of us. Our record \nwill indicate lost opportunities to realize the promise of \na better world. \n Our world today is marked by an inequitable \nglobal trading order and a hostile security environment. \nWanton globalization and unfettered trade \nliberalization are affecting many of us in ways that are \ndetrimental to the livelihood of our people. Unilateral \nactions by the big and powerful to resolve disputes are \nno longer incidental, but are the order of the day. We \nnote the increasing incidence of human atrocities, \ngenocides, wars, poverty, terrorism, the emergence of \nHIV/AIDS, and an increase in malaria and \ntuberculosis. Our streets and communities are littered \nwith small arms and light weapons. The smuggling of \ndrugs and humans and other illegal activities are on the \nrise. Environmental degradation and climate change \ncontinue unabated. We must confront these issues \nurgently. To complement efforts in other forums, Papua \nNew Guinea, with other countries of the Pacific region, \nhas agreed to pool its limited resources under the \nPacific plan to address these issues. \n Papua New Guinea continues to believe that the \nUnited Nations offers the best hope for its Member \nStates to address these ongoing concerns and other \nemerging challenges facing humanity today. In this \nregard, my country supports the ongoing United \nNations reform initiatives that seek to make its \n \n \n21 06-52879 \n \noperations more effective and responsive. We must \nensure that its collective security mandates and \nfunctions, and its various organizations, are \nstrengthened and not weakened. We are pleased to note \nthe establishment of the Human Rights Council and \nPeacebuilding Commission. Papua New Guinea \nbelieves in a revitalized General Assembly whose role \nand authority reflect its broad membership. We must \npress on with the reform of the Security Council with \ncourage and boldness so that it reflects the political and \neconomic realities of today. An expanded Security \nCouncil must be more democratic and transparent. Its \nmembership must include developing countries, while \nmaintaining geographic balance and representation. \n Global trade today is characterized more by the \nunfair practices of those already holding decided \nadvantages than by the opportunities it offers to \ndeveloping countries such as Papua New Guinea. Our \nefforts to develop a more equitable trading order are \nhampered by the reluctance of our developed partners \nto open their economies and engage in genuine \ndevelopment discussions. Adding insult to injury, many \nof our developed partners have yet to meet the targets \nthey agreed with respect to Official Development \nAssistance. \n While we appreciate the efforts of some of our \ndeveloped partners to ease the burden of debt under the \nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, we are \ndisappointed that many of them have not shown the \nsame leadership on the Doha Development Round, \nleading to its collapse. We are calling for developing \ncountries to join us in framing a new and true \ndevelopment round. We must exercise leadership rather \nthan passively allowing others to chart our future. \n Despite these difficulties, Papua New Guinea is \npursuing economic development programmes that are \nbased on an export-driven economic growth strategy. \nAt the heart of this policy objective is the focus on \nrural development. We have developed a five-year \nmedium-term development strategy and aligned it with \nthe Millennium Development Goals. Achieving those \ngoals by 2015 is a tremendous challenge for Papua \nNew Guinea but we have taken the first step in \nproviding budget funding for its implementation. We \ncall for the support of the United Nations system and \nother genuine development partners to meet these vital \ncommitments. \n As a result of better policy coordination, stricter \nimplementation of structural reform and prudent \nfinancial and economic management, Papua New \nGuinea has attained macroeconomic and fiscal \nstability. Our economy is growing, interest rates have \nfallen, and the exchange rate has been stabilized. Our \nforeign exchange reserves are at an all-time high. We \nare using these gains to reinvest in productive sectors \nof our economy and in delivering services to our \npeople. Development partners must play a supportive \nrole to sustain these gains. This can be done through \nfair trade opportunities, equitable markets, increased \nforeign investment, transfer of technology, capacity-\nbuilding and providing quality overseas development \nassistance. \n I now turn to an issue about which my country \nfeels strongly, that of climate change and sea-level rise. \nFor us this is not academic, it is reality. Small islands \nand low-lying atolls in Papua New Guinea and the \nPacific region are being submerged by rising sea \nlevels. As I speak, my own people are being resettled \nto higher ground. Papua New Guinea\u2019s strong position \non the environment is drawn from the preamble to our \nnational Constitution, which states: \n \u201cWe declare our fourth goal to be for Papua New \nGuinea\u2019s natural resources and environment to be \nconserved and used for the collective benefit of \nus all, and be replenished for the benefit of future \ngenerations.\u201d \nThat constitutional imperative underpins my country\u2019s \nwhole approach to sustainable development objectives, \nincluding those contained in the Johannesburg Plan of \nImplementation and the Mauritius Strategy. \n Environmental degradation is occurring at a \nfrightening pace. Scientific studies suggest that climate \nchange is causing increasing incidences of \nenvironmental catastrophes such as hurricanes, \ntsunamis, landslides and flash floods. Our planet is in \ndistress. As co-inhabitants of this world we must all \nequally share responsibility to address the root causes \nof this problem. We urge industrialized countries to \nreduce their greenhouse gas emissions. We call upon \nthose that have not yet done so to accede to and ratify \nthe Kyoto Protocol. \n Papua New Guinea is prepared to play its part to \nprotect and conserve the world\u2019s tropical rainforest \nwith the aim of stabilizing the earth\u2019s climate. The \nfindings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \n  \n \n06-52879 22 \n \nChange suggest that an estimated 20 per cent to 25 per \ncent of annual global emissions were generated \nthrough land-use change, primarily from the \ndegradation of forest resources. In this context it is \ncrucial for us to protect the tropical rainforests through \nsustainable and fair market-based incentives. \n The dilemma is that for some of us the forestry \nsector is a major revenue earner, a provider of much-\nneeded employment, a facilitator of important \ninfrastructure projects, and a catalyst for the provision \nof basic services in rural areas. The present incentives \noffered by international markets for agriculture, \nforestry and emissions reductions are inadequate. \nThese are perverse incentives from the standpoint of \nthe environment. Papua New Guinea, along with Costa \nRica, has formed a new Coalition for Rainforest \nNations that includes many other countries in Africa, \nAsia, Latin America and the Pacific. Together we are \npursuing an initiative to access global carbon markets \nand to support efforts to reduce rates of deforestation. \nSimply put, this approach seeks to recognize the \ncontribution of resource owners to conserving and \nprotecting rainforests for the benefit of mankind. We \ninvite more nations to join our efforts to create new \nmarkets and reform outmoded market and regulatory \nmechanisms. That is necessary if we are to contribute \nmore effectively towards environmental sustainability, \neconomic development, climate stability and poverty \nreduction. \n The initiative on deforestation is part of a broader \nagenda being pursued by my Government to implement \nthe Millennium Development Goal to ensure \nenvironmental sustainability. We are convinced that by \nimplementing the seventh goal we will harness our \nability to achieve environmentally and socially \nsustainable economic growth. Many times developing \ncountries are drawn into false promises of international \ninvestment. Often we find our natural resources \nexploited, leaving us with neither the resource nor the \nmoney. We will not allow this to continue. We want \nwealth from our natural resources to remain within our \nnations to fuel our economic growth. \n The threat of HIV/AIDS is real in many of our \ncountries and has serious implications for social and \neconomic development. In Papua New Guinea my \nGovernment has passed HIV/AIDS legislation, \nunderpinned by a comprehensive HIV/AIDS policy \nframework. To ensure close scrutiny I have vested my \ndepartment with the responsibility of overseeing \nimplementation. In addition, I have appointed a special \nminister to assist me in providing political leadership \non this particular issue. But our experience suggests \nthat national action alone is not enough. It requires a \nconcerted global response. This is a war that must be \nwaged on all fronts and by all countries. We thank the \nUnited Nations and its related agencies for their efforts \nto address this issue. We also applaud the bold \nleadership of former United States President Mr. Bill \nClinton and of Mr. Bill Gates in this regard. \n Of equal importance are the battles against \nmalaria, tuberculosis and other preventable diseases. \nWhile we, as a global community, have focused on \nHIV/AIDS and bird flu, this has diluted our attention to \nmalaria, which remains the biggest killer disease in my \ncountry. I call upon our development partners to \nsupport Papua New Guinea and other countries in \nmaintaining perspective on these challenges. \n Terrorism in all its forms and manifestations is a \nserious threat to international peace and security. It \nmust be condemned irrespective of who perpetrates it. \nAll countries and peoples of the world have a serious \nresponsibility to stand united and fight this evil. \nHowever, Papua New Guinea is concerned about the \nerosion of the international community\u2019s moral \nauthority to address this issue. It is unhelpful to our \ncredibility if certain of our members choose to address \nthis issue in flagrant violation of international norms \nand universally agreed conventions. As with other \ncross-border challenges, Member States will require \nthe support of the United Nations and development \npartners with capacity-building and other necessary \nresources to effectively fight global terrorism. \n The conflict in the Middle East, despite various \nUnited Nations resolutions, remains unresolved. Papua \nNew Guinea appeals to all parties to the conflict, \nincluding those Powers with the capacity to influence a \npositive outcome, to make the hard concessions \nnecessary for a peaceful resolution of this long-\nstanding issue. The recent confrontation in Lebanon \nresulted in the loss of innocent lives and massive \ndestruction to infrastructure. Papua New Guinea \nappeals for restraint by all parties and urges that full \nuse be made of the dispute settlement procedures of the \nUnited Nations. Comprehensive and lasting solutions \nmust be found to the issues that led to the conflict. \nNeighbouring countries and the international \ncommunity as a whole can make positive contributions \nby shepherding a process that allows for genuine \n \n \n23 06-52879 \n \ndialogue to take place. We commend the United \nNations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and \nEuropean countries such as France, Italy and Germany \nand others that are contributing troops to maintain the \nceasefire. \n Papua New Guinea is extremely concerned about \nthe proliferation among States of nuclear, chemical, \nbiological and other weapons of mass destruction. We \ncontinue to maintain that there is no real justification \nfor the retention and further development of these \ninstruments of war. We call upon all countries to ratify \nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and other \nrelated treaties to reduce the threat to international \npeace and security by weapons of mass destruction. \nSadly, we were reminded by the Secretary-General \nyesterday of the apathy that surrounds actions on non-\nproliferation and disarmament. \n The work of the United Nations Special \nCommittee on Decolonization remains unfinished. We \nstill have 16 non-self-governing territories, some in the \nPacific, that are yet to exercise their right to self-\ndetermination. The referendum in Tokelau \ndemonstrated a true spirit of cooperation between \nTokelau and New Zealand. We congratulate both \nGovernments and assure the people of Tokelau of our \nrespect for their decision to remain in free association \nwith New Zealand. \n I conclude by saying that the world has changed \nin ways that not only provide opportunities, but also \noffer more complex challenges for Members of the \nUnited Nations. The emergence of a trend over the \nyears to try to resolve these challenges outside the \nprinciples and framework prescribed by the United \nNations has resulted in a world worse than the founders \nof the Organization envisaged. We must renew our \ncommitment and faith in the United Nations and seek \nto reform it in ways that reflect the realities of today. \n At this juncture I take the opportunity to pay a \nspecial tribute to the outgoing Secretary-General, \nMr. Kofi Annan, for his outstanding contribution to the \nUnited Nations and the world. We wish him well. As \nthis is likely to be the last General Assembly session in \nwhich I take part, I take this opportunity to thank all \nthose who have contributed in one way or another in \nsupport of Papua New Guinea since independence. \nWhen I brought my nation to take its seat in this \nAssembly 31 years ago I said, and I reaffirm today, that \nwithin the limits of our resources Papua New Guinea \nwill play an active and positive role in the United \nNations.

        "file_text": "Allow me to begin by congratulating the \n192nd Member State, Montenegro, upon its accession \nto membership of the United Nations. \n On 5 November, elections will be held in \nNicaragua to elect its new Government. This session is \ntherefore occurring at an appropriate moment for \ntaking stock, before our own people and before the \npeoples of the United Nations, of the Nicaragua that \ncould be achieved if the work carried out during the \nfive-year term of the current President Enrique Bola\u00f1os \nGeyer is continued. \n It has been our lot to fight tirelessly for a value \nwhich was recently consolidated in its universal \ndimension: the defence of democracy, which includes \nas essential components the rule of law, the balance of \npowers, the strengthening of State institutions and \ncombating corruption.  \n Nicaragua has not travelled this difficult road \nalone. A new collective spirit has been present which \nhas assisted its efforts, making it possible to overcome \nand punish corruption. Thanks to this same collective \nsolidarity it was also possible to counter the partisan \ndivision of the State and the still-latent attempts to \nbreak with the cardinal rule of separation and \nindependence of the public authorities. I must mention \nhere that whenever anti-democratic forces sought to \nbreak with the constitutional order, they encountered \nthe joint response of the people of Nicaragua, the \nprivate business sector, organized civil society and the \ninternational community. \n Our first words of thanks go to all those \nGovernments and organizations that, through their \nsupport, helped to protect in Nicaragua the principles \nof freedom and democracy that have today emerged as \nthe new basic values of a renewed international society. \n We thank our brother countries of the region and \nthe Secretary-General of the Central American \nIntegration System, the Secretary-General of the \nOrganization of American States (OAS) and his Special \nEnvoy in Nicaragua, the Member States of OAS, the \nRio Group, the Andean Community of Nations, the \nIbero-American Summit, the Caribbean Community \nand Common Market, Japan, the United States of \nAmerica and the European Union. \n But the time devoted to defending democracy has \nnot prevented us from working to achieve the goals of \ndevelopment, law and order, security and stability. \n Between 2002 and 2005, a period of barely four \nyears, tax revenues increased more than three-fold, \nwhich clearly demonstrates the confidence of our \ncitizens in their Government and also reflects the \ntransparency of our public administration. This \nincrease is continuing at the same pace in 2006. At \ntheir annual meeting concluded the day before \nyesterday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and \nthe World Bank stated that tax earnings in Nicaragua \n \n \n43 06-53323 \n \nhad been strong, with an increase in revenues that bore \nwitness to the success of the fiscal policy and reforms \nimplemented by the Government. \n On the economic front, we have achieved radical \nchange: there is an economic upturn, and we are \nregaining the confidence of the international \ncommunity.  \n Through transparency and good governance, the \ncompletion point of the Heavily Indebted Poor \nCountries (HIPC) Debt Initiative was reached. A year \nago, we were selected to receive the support of the \nGroup of Eight, as well as forgiveness of the \nmultilateral debt owed to the IMF, the World Bank and, \nvery shortly, the Inter-American Development Bank, \namounting to a reduction of approximately $800 \nmillion in our foreign debt. These two initiatives mean \nthat over 85 per cent of our foreign debt has been \nforgiven. Nicaragua can now concentrate on reducing \nits domestic debt, which resulted from the fraudulent \ncollapse of banks that occurred five and a half years \nago.  \n It was President Bola\u00f1os Geyer who, in \nDecember 2001, spoke of the need for a trade \nagreement, what turned into the Central American Free \nTrade Agreement, between the countries of Central \nAmerica, the Dominican Republic and the United \nStates. This Agreement came into force in March 2006, \nopening up a new era of opportunity for our region. As \na result of this treaty, the volume of exports from \nNicaragua to the United States has increased by 20 per \ncent during the eight months it has been in existence. \n We have achieved three consecutive years of \neconomic growth on the basis of private investment. \nSince President Bola\u00f1os took office, direct foreign \ninvestment has led to the opening of a new company \nevery month in the tax-free zones, and total exports \nhave increased by 100 per cent in less than five years.  \n We have succeeded in turning tourism into a new \nengine of the economy on account of the revenues it \ngenerates, and for the first time it has become the \ngreatest source of foreign currency earnings in our \ntrade balance. Nicaragua is ranked third among the 10 \nmust-visit destinations, according to the prestigious \nLonely Planet travel guide. Similarly, Nicaragua has \nbeen classified by the World Tourism Organization as \none of the best emerging markets at the world level and \nthe best kept secret for retirees and for real estate \ndevelopment. We are considered to be the country that \nhas made the greatest progress on the economic \nfreedom front. For its part, the World Bank report, \n\u201cDoing Business\u201d, places Nicaragua in 67th place \nworldwide and states that it has the best business \nclimate in Central America and one of the best in the \nhemisphere. We are one of the safest countries in the \nhemisphere. Our murder rate is less than half the world \naverage. \n I am proud to say that we are now experiencing a \nnew political, economic and social reality. Keeping his \ncampaign promise, President Bola\u00f1os has virtually \ndoubled the salary of primary and secondary school \nteachers and has doubled in absolute terms the budget \nallocated to post-secondary education. \n In the area of health, the infant mortality rate fell \nfrom 35 per 1,000 live births in 2001 to 31 in 2006. \nThe mortality rate for children under the age of 5 fell \nfrom 45 in 2001 to 40 in 2006, and the maternal \nmortality rate fell from 96.6 per 100,000 in 2003 to 83 \nin 2006. Immunization coverage increased between \n2004 and 2006 by over 10 per cent. \n We are developing a State policy for our \nemigrants, with a view to guaranteeing that they have \nfull enjoyment of their political, social and civil rights, \nproviding them with legal advice and with the \nprotection to which the Constitution entitles them. We \nare doing all we can to defend their rights in any \ncountry where they may be found. That is the least we \ncan do to repay the sacrifice they make in sending back \nremittances to improve the economic situation of their \nfamilies. These remittances are equivalent to almost \n50 per cent of our goods exports.  \n The Assembly will recall that President Reagan, \nwhen addressing the Soviet Premier on the subject of \nthe Berlin Wall, said: \u201cTear down that wall\u201d. The \nPresident of the Dominican Republic, Mr. Leonel \nFern\u00e1ndez Reyna, once observed that in a globalized \nworld where there is free movement of capital, goods \nand services, it is the human beings who do not enjoy \nfreedom of movement of labour. \n Thanks to the special law on migratory incentives \nfor Nicaraguans living abroad, nationals who have \nlived for at least five years outside the country can \ncome home with their household effects, their car and \ntheir work tools.  \n The results we have achieved in protecting our \nnationals abroad are substantial and have been \n  \n \n06-53323 44 \n \nrecognized by the international community. At the \nbeginning of this month, the United States Under \nSecretary for Democracy and Global Affairs brought to \nthe attention of the international community the efforts \nmade by Nicaragua through its diplomatic \nestablishment to protect, assist and repatriate \nNicaraguans who are the victims of human trafficking. \nWe have built the material, human and technological \ninfrastructure that will gradually generate a new \npolitical culture strengthened by the values of \ndemocracy.  \n Nicaragua does not see its future as being \nseparate from that of Central America. This is why we \nare endeavouring to form a customs union and to \nfurther the integration process in all directions and at \nall levels, because this is the best way for a region \nwhich deserves prosperity and development to move \nforward. \n Very soon, we shall start talks on an association \nagreement between the European Union and Central \nAmerica, which will include a free trade agreement. It \nis an initiative that embodies the vision of two regions \nwhich, from different continents, view the future with \nsimilar values and institutions and common aspirations. \n The Nicaraguan proposal to limit arms at the \nregional level has made substantial progress in matters \nrelating to the submission of inventories of weapons, \narmed forces and public security personnel and in the \ngeneration of confidence-building measures. \n According to the International Institute for \nStrategic Studies, per capita expenditure by Nicaragua \non defence is $5.2 per year. In the list of 132 countries \nstudied, Nicaragua is third among the countries which \nspent least on defence. \n Nicaragua was the first independent country in \nthe history of the United Nations to benefit from the \npresence of electoral observers. This time, too, \nNicaragua will comply with the sacred duty of holding \nfree and transparent elections which reflect the \nsovereign will of the people. On 5 November, the \nNicaraguan people will have to decide between the \ncaudillismo of the past and a future devoted to \ndevelopment, between corruption and transparency. We \nare sure that the international community will help us \nthrough this process by extending to us unwavering \nsupport at this critical moment of reaffirmation of \ndemocracy by a nation which has defended its right to \nfreedom with its life. \n The fate of our individual States is closely linked \nwith that of our international system. The current world \nsituation is testing the response capacity of our \ninternational system as a whole.  \n The problems faced by mankind are increasingly \ncomplex and tragic and call for our involvement to \nensure that they are promptly and effectively dealt \nwith. The recent crisis in the Middle East, the \nsituations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the tensions in Iran, \nthe problems arising in the Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of Korea, the social and political conflicts \nbeing experienced in Haiti, the situation in Darfur and \nthe threats of international terrorism demonstrate that \nneither the appeals of Secretary-General Kofi Annan \nnor the proposals to reform the United Nations system \ncan be put off.  \n The United Nations must be reformed to provide \na ready, efficient and effective response to the immense \nthreats to world peace that also extend to the \nenvironment and health. Nicaragua maintains the \nposition that these reforms should be comprehensive in \nnature since that is the only way of overcoming \nbureaucratic problems that stand in the way of prompt \nimplementation of the resolutions of the General \nAssembly. \n The reform process should cover the Secretariat, \nthe General Assembly and the Economic and Social \nCouncil, as well as the Security Council. The \nmembership of the Security Council should better \nreflect current geopolitical realities, allowing for a \nmore equitable and democratic representation of \ndeveloping countries in both permanent and non-\npermanent categories. This expansion should serve to \nenhance multilateralism, strengthening the capacity to \nrespond to world threats and challenges with a Council \nthat has more authority, representativity and \neffectiveness.  \n In 2003, the Government of Nicaragua arranged \nthe nomination and recognition of the R\u00edo San Juan \u2014 \nNicaragua Biosphere Reserve in the Programme on \nMan and the Biosphere of the United Nations \nEducation, Scientific and Cultural Organization \n(UNESCO) \u2014 recognition which was approved on \n15 September of that year, when it became part of the \nWorld Network of Biosphere Reserves. This reserve \nwas added to the Bosawas Biosphere Reserve, which, \nat 2 million hectares, covers 14 per cent of our national \nterritory and is the largest continuous forested area in \n \n \n45 06-53323 \n \nCentral America. In early 2006, President Bola\u00f1os \nestablished a preserve for 10 years, banning the export \nof six forest species in danger of extinction.  \n Nicaragua also restates from this podium its \nsupport for the cause of the Republic of China in \nTaiwan, which should achieve the legitimate \nrepresentation of its 23 million inhabitants. It also calls \nfor renewed and proactive efforts by the United \nNations to maintain peace in East Asia. \n We launch a humanitarian appeal for the freeing \nof the kidnapped persons in the Far and Middle East, \nand worldwide. The States Members of the United \nNations have a duty, both individually and collectively, \nto protect the world population against any action that \nseeks to harm the life or dignity of any human being, \nfrom the time of conception to the time of death, or to \nundermine his or her aspiration to live in a democratic \nenvironment and to take advantage of opportunities for \ndevelopment. We should devote our best efforts to \ngiving effect to this mandate. "

        "file_text": "I would like to \nexpress my deepest appreciation and most sincere \ngratitude to the Secretary-General, His Excellency \nMr. Kofi Annan, for the invaluable work and tireless \ndedication with which he led this Organization into the \ntwenty-first century. The Secretary-General has led the \nUnited Nations well and he will be remembered with \npraise for it. May I use this opportunity also to state \nour full support to his successor, who will have to deal \nwith the difficult challenges the United Nations is \ngoing to face. \n Before proceeding to my remarks, I would like to \npoint out that Slovakia fully subscribes to the statement \ndelivered earlier by the President of Finland on behalf \nof the European Union. \n It gives me great pleasure to address the General \nAssembly today, even more so as it is the first time I \nam speaking from this rostrum as the Prime Minister of \nSlovakia. My Government \u2014 formed only three \nmonths ago \u2014 is committed to a foreign policy that \nemphasizes effective multilateralism and promotes \ndemocracy, international peace and security, greater \nrespect for human rights \u2014 including the rights of \npersons belonging to national and other minorities \u2014 \nrule of law, social equity and environmental protection. \nWe are focused on building a social state where \neconomic growth goes along with the growth of the \nstandard of living of the people.  \n All of us know that the United Nations is once \nagain at a crossroads, as we face the historic test of \nmultilateralism. The humanitarian disaster in Sudan, \nrecent conflict in Lebanon, continuing dispute over the \nIranian nuclear programme, violence in East Timor, \nincreasing military activity in Afghanistan and \nSomalia, along with the negative developments in other \nconflict regions, remind us that we live in a world of \nevolving threats and challenges. \n Modern threats could not have been anticipated \nwhen the United Nations was founded in 1945. In fact, \nthe United Nations is challenged, as never before, to \ndeal with ethnic and other inter-State conflicts, weak \nand failed States, genocide and ethnic cleansing, \ncomplex humanitarian disasters and poverty, along \nwith threats of nuclear terrorism, transnational \norganized crime, infectious diseases and environmental \ndegradation. The major challenges of today cannot be \nmanaged by sovereign States acting alone. Hence, the \nkey challenge for all of us is to learn how to \ncollectively manage the complex issues of the world of \ntoday and how to ensure the relevance of the United \nNations and its leadership in the process. \n Slovakia, as a smaller country, is a strong \nbeliever in multilateralism. Our present experience as \nan elected member of the Security Council fully proves \nthat only through effective multilateral action can the \nworld community successfully address modern threats \nand resolve current conflicts. But \u2014 and I underline \nthat \u201cbut\u201d \u2014 as long as the international community, \nacting through the United Nations, is unable to take \n  \n \n06-53005 18 \n \ndecisive action to protect populations from genocide, \nwar crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against \nhumanity, as in the case of Rwanda or Darfur, as long \nas the United Nations ignores regressive developments \nand violations of human rights in some parts of the \nworld, as long as it is unable to fight terrorism more \neffectively and intervene in situations that do not yet \npose a threat to international peace and security but \nhave the potential to swiftly reach that stage, respect \nfor the United Nations will decline in the eyes of our \ncitizens.  \n Slovakia is, therefore, a strong supporter of \nUnited Nations reform. We must continue building on \nwhat has been achieved so far, including the \nestablishment of the Peacebuilding Commission, \nadoption of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and \nprogress in management reform. We need to focus on \nreducing tensions between developed and developing \ncountries and on building consensus regarding the \nfuture direction of reforms. It is unrealistic to expect \nthat all States will share and promote a single version \nof United Nations reform. But we have to overcome \nthe zero-sum mentality and continue with the reform \ndebate, with a view to achieving mutual concessions \nand compromises on specific issues. \n We particularly welcome the creation of the \nHuman Rights Council as a step towards realizing the \nidea of three equal councils embodying three equal \npillars of the United Nations. But we ought to be \ncautious and avoid slipping back into the old habits \nthat made its predecessor so dysfunctional.  \n Revitalization of the General Assembly, \nenhancement of the role of the Economic and Social \nCouncil and reform of the Security Council remain \nunfinished business. The reform of the Council should, \nfirst and foremost, address the issue of increasing its \ncapacity to act preventively and to take decisive action \nearly enough to prevent conflicts. The Security Council \nmust become more representative, more effective and \nmore transparent.  \n For its part, Slovakia is ready to engage \nconstructively in meaningful negotiations to achieve \nthose goals. Slovakia, as the co-chair of the ad hoc \ncommittee on mandate review in the Security Council, \nis working hard together with our partners to achieve \ntangible results in the near future. We hope that visible \nprogress of the process within the Security Council can \ninspire other United Nations bodies. \n Slovakia is concerned about the current situation \nin the Middle East, in particular in Lebanon and the \nPalestinian territories. We firmly believe that there is \nno military solution to the Middle East conflict. The \nonly way to achieve a comprehensive and lasting \nsettlement is through peaceful negotiations and full \nimplementation of all relevant Security Council \nresolutions, as well as the principles defined by the \nQuartet. Also, only through negotiations and further \ndiplomatic efforts can we fulfil the vision of two \ndemocratic States, Israel and Palestine, living side-by-\nside in peace and security. New efforts must be \nundertaken to revive the peace process based on full \nrespect for principles defined by the Quartet in the \nadopted road map. \n Another source of our deep concern is the \nalarming security and humanitarian situation in Darfur, \nwhich continues to deteriorate in spite of numerous \nefforts of the Security Council, the African Union, the \nUnited Nations Secretary-General and the international \ncommunity at large. We are talking here about a \nhumanitarian disaster of large scale; we, therefore, \nurgently need to intensify our efforts and break the \nlong-lasting cycle of violence. \n In particular, we need to make sure that the \nGovernment of National Unity of Sudan finally gives \nits consent to the planned transition to a United \nNations-led operation in Darfur. The concept of \n\u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d adopted at last year\u2019s World \nSummit applies to all Member States and to all \nGovernments. When peaceful means prove inadequate \nand national authorities are failing to protect their own \ncitizens, the international community has the \nresponsibility to act collectively through the Security \nCouncil to prevent another Rwanda or Srebrenica. \n As a matter of priority, Slovakia has been closely \nfollowing developments in the Western Balkans. Our \ninvolvement there is based on the principles of \ntransparency and impartiality. Our priority is to \nstrengthen the stability of the region and to support the \nprocesses of democratization and integration.  \n As for the issue of the future of Kosovo, we \ncontinue to believe that it is important to seek a \nsettlement through direct talks and dialogue and \ncompromise, from both Belgrade and Pristina. Only a \nsolution that reflects the concerns of all parties \ninvolved and provides for the rights of members of all \ncommunities, notably the Kosovo Serbs, can ensure \n \n \n19 06-53005 \n \nlasting security and stability in the region. The Kosovo \nissue is truly a sui generis case.  \n We are also deeply concerned about the nuclear \nprogramme of Iran and the proliferation risk it presents \nto international peace and security. We urge the Iranian \nauthorities to respond positively to the proposed \npackage of incentives and to suspend its uranium \nenrichment activities. For our part, we are ready to \ncontinue the dialogue with Iran in a constructive and \nopen fashion. However, Iran, like any other Member of \nthe United Nations, must comply with Security Council \nresolutions and with all relevant decisions of the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and must \nfully cooperate with them.  \n The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \nand related delivery systems technology continues to \nthreaten global security. This is a serious challenge, \nand we must face it with all responsibility. It requires \njoint multilateral efforts and a common and effective \nresponse. In May of this year, Secretary-General Kofi \nAnnan told the Conference on Disarmament that the \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \n(NPT) regime, faces \u201ca twin crisis, of compliance and \nof confidence\u201d. With regret, we have to acknowledge \nthat he was absolutely right. \n We should work together to overcome deadly \nlinks like that between armament and proliferation and \nto create a progress-friendly atmosphere. We need to \nrestore confidence through compliance with all \nrelevant obligations and commitments. As the \nChairman of the Security Council Committee \nestablished pursuant to Council resolution 1540 (2004), \nSlovakia tries to facilitate the process of the full \nimplementation of all measures to prevent the \nformation of a nexus between the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction and terrorism. We hope \nthat agreement on the Committee\u2019s programme of work \nwill be reached as soon as possible.  \n We also preside over the Conference on \nDisarmament, and we are working to intensify efforts \nto reverse the process of repeated failure during the \nrecent period and undertake constructive dialogue, \nwhich would bring about long-expected results. Our \naim is to help revitalize the Conference and give new \nbreath to that single multilateral disarmament-\nnegotiating forum of the international community. \n In conclusion, I would like to draw attention to an \nissue which is increasingly important in shaping \ninternational programmes for development assistance, \nthe promotion of democracy, security cooperation and \npost-conflict peacebuilding. I am referring to security-\nsector reform. Slovakia seeks to stimulate a broad \ndiscussion on the role of security-sector reform in the \nUnited Nations context, with a view to increasing \nunderstanding of the topic and suggesting possible \noptions for the development of a comprehensive and \ncoherent approach. Our wish is to give an impetus to \ndeveloping a comprehensive policy framework that \nwould guide United Nations security-sector reform \nprogrammes and projects in a coherent, consistent and \nsustainable way.  \n As Mr. Jan Eliasson stressed in his remarkable \nspeech at the conclusion of the sixtieth session of the \nGeneral Assembly (see A/60/PV.100), the test of \nwhether we have re-established the United Nations and \ninternational cooperation as the best way to manage \nour global affairs did not occur in the past year, but it \nwill occur in the years ahead. \n My wish is that all of us will pass the test and \ncreate a United Nations that can live up to the \nexpectations and aspirations of our peoples.

        "file_text": "I extend to you, Madam, the \ncongratulations and best wishes of the Government and \nthe people of the Fiji Islands. The General Assembly is \nto be commended for accepting your candidature to \nbecome the third woman to assume the post of \nPresident of the Assembly. That recognizes the critical \nrole that women play in the development of humanity \nin our global village. We assure you of the support of \nmy Government during your tenure.  \n We also extend our gratitude to your predecessor, \nHis Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson, for his tireless efforts \nin the United Nations reform process, to which he has \napplied his personal skills and knowledge. While much \nis still to be resolved, his contributions thus far to the \nreform process have started the ball rolling. It is up to \nus to maintain the momentum. \n Fiji, its Government and its people wish to \nhonour and express our appreciation to the outgoing \nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan. \nHis tireless efforts to promote peace and reconciliation \nin the world are well recognized. Ghana should be \njustly proud of its son. As a nation of the developing \nworld, we are just as proud that he has been able to \nproject our hopes \u2014 most prominently, in the \ndevelopment agenda of the Organization. We respect \nhis achievements in leading the United Nations during \nhis tenure of office. His service to peoples around the \nworld, and the patience, courage and determination that \nhe has demonstrated daily in facing the world, despite \nthe barbs and criticisms thrown his way, are \ncommendable. We ask him to accept our deepest \ngratitude and profound appreciation for all that he has \ndone. We extend best wishes for the future to him and \nto his family. \n On this occasion, following our successful \ngeneral elections held in May of this year, I am pleased \nto be able to report to the Assembly that all \ninternational observers who attended the holding of the \ngeneral elections in Fiji have concluded that the result \nwas democratic and a fair reflection of the popular will \nof the people.  \n The rebuilding of our nation after the disaster that \nstruck us in 2000 is going very well indeed. It was \nstrengthened following the formation of the multiparty \nGovernment in accordance with the requirements of \nour Constitution. We now have a Cabinet comprising \nministers drawn from the majority Soqosoqo Duavata \nni Lewenivanua (SDL) Party and the Fiji Labour Party, \nas the party that qualified to be invited to be \nrepresented in Cabinet. We also have ministers drawn \nfrom the independent members of our elected House of \nRepresentatives. This means that, for the first time in \nits history, Fiji has a cabinet that is truly representative \nof its multi-ethnic communities. \n Ministers from the two major races in the country \nand those from the minority groups are working well \ntogether in collaborative and consultative decision-\nmaking. We are united by the common purpose of \ntaking our country forward, for the benefit of every \ncitizen. \n Mr. Mu\u00f1oz (Chile), Vice-President, took the \nChair. \n This multi-ethnic arrangement for good \ngovernance has received overwhelming approval and \nsupport from all our communities. It has given our \ncountry reasons to be optimistic. People from all races \nnow feel more confident and secure about their future. \nWe believe that forming a multi-ethnic Government \nthat is representative of our different communities, and \nmaking it work, is the approach that has eluded us for a \nlong time, but one which will ensure long-term peace \nand stability in Fiji. That new form of inclusive \nGovernment is also underpinning our drive for \ncontinued improvements in Fiji\u2019s economic \nperformance. \n The plea from Fiji is for the United Nations \nMember countries to strengthen their joint resolve to \n \n \n5 06-53615 \n \noppose terrorism everywhere in the world. Fiji is \ncommitted to a world in which peace and prosperity \nare the cornerstones of all societies and communities. \nWe consider it an honour to serve the cause of peace \nunder the banners of the United Nations and other \npeacekeeping arrangements, including that under the \nPacific Islands Forum.  \n Where there are potential internal crises and \ndisorder, we support the Secretary-General\u2019s concept of \nconflict prevention. However, where the United \nNations mandates intervention for peace, we are ready \nto contribute. Peacekeeping personnel from Fiji are \nworking in Iraq, Kosovo, Liberia, the Sinai, the \nSolomon Islands, the Sudan and Timor-Leste. We \nwould like to thank the United Nations and all those \ncountries that have assisted Fiji in honouring its \ncommitment to international peace and security. We \nwelcome the intention of other countries to assist us in \nthat matter. We do so with humility, knowing that there \nis more peace to keep and to build in the world today, \nand that we have acquired competence to offer to \nhumanity. \n Peace and security initiatives have undergone a \nnumber of reviews recently to benefit peacekeeping \noperations. Fiji notes the creation of the peace \nstabilization force in Lebanon and the consultative \nprocess that preceded it as an example of an existing \norganization\u2019s being tailored to suit a given situation. \nWe should not be afraid to make changes for the better. \nThe best practices derived from Bougainville and the \nSolomon Islands are examples that can be utilized \nelsewhere. \n The Peacebuilding Commission was established \nprimarily to ensure that countries that have emerged \nfrom conflict do not regress to their status quo ante. \nFiji commends that initiative and appeals for \neveryone\u2019s support. I welcome the support given to Fiji \nas an inaugural member of the Peacebuilding \nCommission. \n We in the Pacific remain committed to ensuring \nthat our region remains one of permanent peace and \nstability. Next month, Fiji will host the meeting of the \nleaders of the Pacific Islands Forum. The finalization \nof the Pacific Plan will be the main focus of the \nmeeting. The Plan provides a framework for \ncooperation and mutual assistance in development, \ngood governance and long-term peace and security. We \ncommend those countries from outside our region that \nhave pledged to work and to assist us in the \nimplementation of the Plan. \n The Pacific Islands Forum leaders welcomed \ntheir summit meetings earlier this year with China, \nJapan and France. We commend them for their \ndevelopment support and their leadership in promoting \nlasting peace in the region. We maintain that those \ninitiatives ought to be sustained and can be ensured by \nengaging all parties in constructive dialogue. \n The United Nations is renowned for addressing \nand finding resolutions for the problems of the small \nand marginalized. Fiji is a small island developing \nState with a highly vulnerable economy. Our economy \nis open and is over 70 per cent dependent on export \ntrade to earn foreign exchange to meet its development \nneeds. \n We find that the multilateral trading rules \nemanating from the World Trade Organization (WTO) \nare not fair or equitable, given our development status, \ngeography and size. WTO proposals that have tended \ntowards a one-size-fits-all approach have not fully \nbenefited from an honest and creative application of \nthe special and differential treatment clauses of the \nWTO. They have not effectively addressed the \nmultiplicity of problems we are facing. They serve \nonly the interests of countries that are developed, big \nand already established traders globally and, of course, \nare already well off. The fact that those proposals are \nformulated with little regard for our concerns has \nmanifested itself in widening disparity, greater \nmarginalization and worsening global poverty. \n However, we do not advocate the removal of the \nmultilateral trading arrangement. We just need to make \nit better. The suspension of the WTO talks on the Doha \nDevelopment Agenda has further deepened our \nconcerns regarding the need for the multilateral trading \nrules to show some flexibility so that the development \nconcerns of countries like Fiji can be addressed in the \ncurrent round of negotiations. We call on the \nmembership of the United Nations to work towards an \nearly resumption of the suspended WTO talks. There is \nfar too much at stake for all of us, and especially for \nthe small islands developing States like Fiji. \n We acknowledge the importance of the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights and other international \ninstruments in the promotion of human rights. We note \nthat they are concerned primarily with protecting the \nrights of individuals. Fiji, like other Pacific Islands \n  \n \n06-53615 6 \n \nindigenous communities, welcomes the decision to \nbring the draft declaration on the rights of indigenous \npeoples to this Assembly for discussion and adoption. \nThat instrument is vitally important to the recognition \nand acceptance of the right of indigenous peoples to \nself-determination and of their right to survival as \nethnically and culturally distinct peoples. \n On the international convention on the protection \nand promotion of the rights and dignity of persons with \ndisabilities, Fiji, like others, has recognized the special \nneeds of persons with disabilities and has already \nenacted the relevant legislation and subsequently \nestablished the Fiji National Council of Disabled \nPersons. A national policy on disability for 2006-2016, \na requirement of the act, is currently being finalized. \nFiji strongly supports the international convention and \nwould be in favour of its adoption. \n Fiji acknowledges the vital role women play in \ndevelopment. To ensure women\u2019s active participation \nin all facets of development, the monitoring of the \nrights of women contained in the Beijing Platform of \nAction has to be reinforced. One effective way to do so \nis to ensure that domestic policies and legislation are in \nplace to drive gender mainstreaming. That must be a \npriority target for us all. \n Improving world security must be accompanied \nby appropriate reforms in our Organization. A goal of \nthe current reform of the United Nations is the need to \nensure that the voices of small and vulnerable countries \nlike Fiji are given equal treatment in the membership \nof this global body. \n One of the goals of the United Nations reforms is \nto achieve democratization. Without that, it will remain \nan Organization driven by sectarian interests, where \nmight is right and moral and ethical considerations fall \nby the wayside. We must not be deterred from the \nmomentous task we have set for ourselves. The \noutcome of our concerted and committed effort in \nthose reforms will be a just and stronger Organization, \nbetter prepared to address the world\u2019s multiplicity of \nchallenges. \n A lot has been achieved since we last met in \nplenary. New challenges have emerged. However, there \nare still far too many people whose needs and voices \nare still crying out to be heard. The United Nations \nremains a beacon of hope for them. Those cries ought \nto be listened to and people empowered so that they \ncan firmly and confidently take charge of their own \ndestiny. We must all undertake to assist and participate \nin the work of the United Nations, commensurate, of \ncourse, with our respective size and economic \nstanding. "

        "file_text": "Permit me to begin by \ncongratulating Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed \nAl-Khalifa on her well deserved election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \nsession. This is an important milestone on the gender \nagenda of the United Nations. I wish her great success \nand assure her of Tanzania\u2019s full support and \ncooperation as she discharges her duties.  \n I would also like to commend her predecessor, \nHis Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson, for his able \nstewardship of the Assembly\u2019s sixtieth session. Under \nhis leadership, Tanzania was privileged to co-chair, \nwith Denmark, negotiations that led to the \noperationalization of the Peacebuilding Commission. \n \n \n15 06-52885 \n \n I stand before this Assembly as the fourth \nPresident of my country, Tanzania, following another \nsuccessful democratic election last year. This is the \nthird smooth transition of power in Tanzania. I took \nover from my eminent predecessor in office, His \nExcellency Benjamin William Mkapa, who has \nremained active both at home and abroad. He remains \nmy useful and wise counsel, as does his predecessor \nHis Excellency Ali Hassan Mwinyi. Among the many \nfunctions that former President Mkapa continues to \ndischarge for our country and the human family as a \nwhole is his membership in the Secretary-General\u2019s \nHigh-level Panel on System-Wide Coherence, which is \nan important task on our agenda for the reform of the \nUnited Nations. \n Such was the success of the previous \nadministration that I can only come before you with \none central message \u2014 a message of policy continuity, \nnationally, regionally and internationally. \n We will continue the efforts of the previous \nadministration to promote peace, stability and national \nunity. In addition, we shall redouble our efforts to \nuphold and strengthen good democratic governance, \nrespect for human rights and the rule of law, and \nintensify the fight against corruption. We feel greatly \nhonoured in this regard that the Global Organization of \nParliamentarians Against Corruption decided to hold \nits second global conference in Arusha in two days\u2019 \ntime, in recognition and support of our efforts. \n Tanzania also made impressive economic strides, \nmaking it one of the fastest growing economies in \nAfrica. I intend to sustain and enhance that record with \ngreater zeal, vigour and speed. \n Similarly, Tanzania has emerged as one of the \nbest-practice cases in terms of ownership of the \ndevelopment agenda and the harmonization and \ncoordination of development assistance. I will advance \nthis policy and practice during my tenure in the hope \nthat it will contribute to the realization of the theme of \nthis General Assembly: the implementation of a global \npartnership for development. \n In view of this record, and given our political and \nmacro-economic stability and political will, Tanzania is \nnow well poised to accelerate the pace towards the \nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals. For \nthis to happen, however, we need international support \nto upgrade our infrastructure and build capacity for \nvalue-addition processes and human resource \ndevelopment. Fortunately, the framework for such \ninternational support already exists, for example \nthrough the Monterrey Consensus. I believe Tanzania \nhas lived up to its commitment under the Global \nCompact for development. I now call upon our \ndevelopment partners to do likewise. \n Cognizant of the role of the private sector as the \nengine of growth in Tanzania, we have implemented \nfar-reaching policies and institutional reforms geared \nto creating an environment conducive to the thriving of \nprivate business. \n The World Bank\u2019s \u201cDoing Business 2007\u201d report \nrecognizes Tanzania as one of the top-ten best \nreforming countries in the world. That means that \nTanzania has again fulfilled its commitments under the \nGlobal Compact. We therefore call upon our \ndevelopment partners to buttress our efforts and assist \nthe private sector in responding positively. \n The success of whatever we try to do nationally \ndepends critically on a peaceful neighbourhood. For \ntoo long, Tanzania has suffered from the consequences \nof conflict and instability in the Great Lakes region, \nincluding hosting hundreds of thousands of refugees \nand the destruction of infrastructure and the \nenvironment, and in terms of time and resources \ndeployed in facilitating conflict resolution. For this \nreason, Tanzania will continue to play its part in the \nquest for peace, security, stability and development in \nthe Great Lakes region. \n Significant progress has been achieved in the \npolitical and security situation in the Great Lakes \nregion. We appreciate the support of the United \nNations and other partners in the regional peace \nprocesses. Tanzania welcomes and commends the \nGovernment of Burundi and the Parti pour la lib\u00e9ration \ndu peuple hutu-Forces nationales de lib\u00e9ration rebel \ngroup for finally signing the ceasefire agreement. We \nare humbled that we could be given an opportunity to \nmake our contribution. We promise to continue to be \nuseful in whatever way may be required.  \n Likewise, I commend the Government, the major \npolitical actors and the people of the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo for holding the long-awaited \nelections. We urge that the forthcoming second round \nof elections be conducted in a free, fair and peaceful \nmanner. Tanzania, as Chair of the Southern African \nDevelopment Community Organ on Politics, Defence \nand Security, will play its role in support of this \n  \n \n06-52885 16 \n \nprocess. As a friendly neighbour, we will endeavour to \nbe as useful as is necessary.  \n Moreover, Tanzania, as current chair of the \nInitiative for Peace and Security in the Great Lakes \nRegion, will continue to work closely with other \nmembers to ensure a successful Second International \nConference on the Great Lakes Region later this year \nin Nairobi. \n I wish to put on record our sincere gratitude to \nthe Group of Friends of the Great Lakes Region for \ntheir support. I appeal to them and the international \ncommunity to remain engaged with this process. \n Peace seems to have eluded the world. Reports of \nwars and violent conflicts are headline news in most of \nour media. Unfortunately Africa, the poorest of the \ncontinents, has had an unfair share of conflict. Like \nother delegates, we express our concern for the security \nand humanitarian situation in Darfur, and call for \ncontinued engagement at the regional level and by the \ninternational community. Likewise, we are deeply \nconcerned about the situation in Somalia, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire \nand elsewhere on the continent. \n The continuing impasse on the issue of the \nWestern Sahara is unfortunate. After 31 years, it is high \ntime that the United Nations redouble its efforts to \nresolve this matter. The United Nations resolved the \nquestion of East Timor, which has a lot of similarities \nto that of the Saharans. The people of Western Sahara \ndeserve no less from their United Nations. I believe it \ncould be done if all parties played their part \nappropriately. \n Turning to the situation in the Middle East, I am \npleased to see the ceasefire between Israel and \nLebanon holding, and troop contributing countries \nresponding positively in reinforcing the United Nations \nInterim Force in Lebanon. \n The 34-day war in Lebanon took international \nattention away from the plight of the Palestinian \npeople. The lack of progress towards a negotiated two-\nState solution and the decline in confidence in the \npeace process are worrying developments. We call \nupon the Quartet, and encourage bilateral and other \nmultilateral initiatives, to revive the peace process laid \ndown in the road map. A just, viable, lasting and \ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East can come only \nthrough negotiations, and no other way. \n Tanzania welcomes and applauds the adoption by \nthe General Assembly of a comprehensive Global \nCounter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288). It is \nour expectation that the differences that arose during \nthe negotiations will not stand in the way of the \nStrategy\u2019s implementation. After experiencing a major \nterrorist attack on our soil in 1998, Tanzania has \nalways repeated its resolve to cooperate with others to \ncombat terrorism in all its manifestations. The threat of \nterrorism is global and complex; it demands our \ncollective efforts and an adaptive strategy to contain it. \nThank God we already have that strategy \u2014 let us \nimplement it.  \n Tanzania has always stood for the sovereign \nequality of nations and for the primacy of \nmultilateralism in global governance and in addressing \nglobal issues. We have always cherished and stood for \nthe central role of the United Nations in global affairs. \nWe promise to continue to be faithful and responsible \nmembers of the United Nations. It is now our intention \nto participate more actively in United Nations \npeacekeeping missions and operations. \n We have always believed that the United Nations \nof today has to reflect, in its structure, policies, \nprogrammes and activities, the realities of the world of \ntoday, not that of sixty years ago. The United Nations \nhas to move with the changing times and aspirations of \nits membership. I want to reaffirm Tanzania\u2019s \ncontinued commitment to these urgent and legitimate \ndemands. We are very much committed to the reform \nagenda of the United Nations, especially reform of the \nSecurity Council to make it more representative and \nmore responsive to changing realities. \n Tanzania\u2019s term as a non-permanent member of \nthe Security Council will end in three months. I would \nlike to thank all members for having accorded my \ncountry the honour of serving in that very important \nUnited Nations organ. We thank our fellow Council \nmembers for their cooperation and support during our \nterm of office. As we prepare to leave the Council, we \nare gratified that we were able to organize a special \nCouncil meeting to discuss the situation in the Great \nLakes region at which useful conclusions and decisions \nwere made. \n As we prepare to leave the Council, we are also \ngratified that we have taken note of the feeling in the \nCouncil of the need to reform that body. Let us pluck \nup courage and take the bull by the horns.  \n \n \n17 06-52885 \n \n Allow me to pay special tribute to our outgoing, \nillustrious Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan \u2014 a \ngreat internationalist and a great statesman. We \ncongratulate him for a job well done and for his able \nleadership during a particularly difficult period for the \nworld, for the United Nations and for him, personally. \nHe will be remembered as one who challenged the \nOrganization to live up to the true promise of \nmultilateralism, through delivering collective security, \npursuing fundamental human rights and the rule of law \nand promoting human development. We thank him and \nwish him the best of luck on his retirement. I hope that \nhe will be given time to retire. "

        "file_text": "Let me first of all \ncongratulate Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her \nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-first session. I am confident that, with her \nwealth of experience, she will guide our deliberations \neffectively. I wish also to thank her predecessor, \nMr. Jan Eliasson of Sweden, for the manner in which \nhe presided over the high-level segment of the General \nAssembly at its sixtieth session. \n Let me also pay tribute to Secretary-General Kofi \nAnnan for his leadership of our Organization. His 10-\nyear tenure has been marked by fundamental changes. \nThe United Nations has witnessed major reforms \ngeared at creating a more efficient and effective \ninstitution. We are confident that he will leave behind a \nmore vibrant Organization capable of meeting the \nchallenges of our time. \n As a firm supporter of multilateralism, Uganda \nbelieves that the Assembly is the most appropriate \nforum for addressing issues of global concern. A great \nnumber of important decisions have been taken by the \nAssembly. Landmark agreements have been reached \nand important commitments undertaken by members of \nthe Assembly. \n In spite of all these efforts, threats to global peace \nand security and to human dignity are more serious \n \n \n49 06-52885 \n \nthan ever before. This situation obtains today because \nwe have yet to start addressing the real root causes of \nthe problems facing us. My delegation believes that \nensuring global peace will continue to be an uphill task \nfor us as long as the majority in developing countries \nand elsewhere in the world continue to suffer the \nindignity of poverty and deprivation while we continue \nto think that it is business as usual.  \n We must ask ourselves why a large number of \ninternational problems that are high on the agenda of \nthe United Nations are occurring in the developing part \nof the world. These are real issues that affect the daily \nlives of peoples, and they require urgent solutions \nwhich have been to date been far too slow in coming. \n The onus is on the Assembly to ensure that what \nwe agree upon or commit ourselves to doing is done in \na timely manner. The Millennium Declaration that we \nadopted here 6 years ago (resolution 55/2) remains an \nimportant milestone because it introduced a new \nparadigm shift from emphasis on statement of \ncommitments to action. However, there have been \nsome obstacles to the achievement of the goals we set \nfor ourselves.  \n In areas where progress has been made, due \ncredit must be given. In that regard, Uganda welcomes \nthe establishment of the Human Rights Council to \nwork alongside the Security Council and the Economic \nand Social Council. We are also pleased that action was \npromptly taken to create the Peacebuilding \nCommission as an important intergovernmental \nmechanism to assist countries in transition from war to \ndurable peace. We welcome those as important \ncontributions to the reform agenda of the United \nNations. \n While commendable progress has been achieved \nin other areas of reform, great frustration remains over \nthe reform and expansion of the Security Council. In \nmy delegation\u2019s view, the expansion of the Security \nCouncil is the most important facet of United Nations \nreform with regard to the maintenance of global peace \nand security. \n It is now a truism that the Security Council does \nnot reflect today\u2019s geopolitical realities, but only the \nbalance of power that prevailed in the 1940s. Africa is \nthe only continent with no permanent member on the \nSecurity Council, despite its size and population. That \nis why Africa is demanding at least two permanent \nseats on the Council. We acknowledge that the \nexistence of the veto is an anachronism, but as long as \nit exists we should demand it, because do not want to \njoin as second-class members, with no veto. \n Lack of agreement on how to move the \ndevelopment agenda forward is one of our major \nconcerns. It is unacceptable for big sections of the \nglobal community to continue living on less than one \ndollar per day while we have the capacity and the \nmeans to pull them out of that abject poverty. We must \naddress that problem as a matter of urgency. One way \nof doing so is to live by our own commitments, as \nreflected, for example, in the Monterrey Consensus, \nthe Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and the \nBrussels Plan of Action, et cetera, et cetera. We must \nput in place measurable benchmarks to realize those \ngoals.  \n It is disappointing to see that very little progress \nhas been made to date on official development \nassistance, on foreign direct investments, on debts, or \neven on market access. The stalled conclusion of the \nWorld Trade Organization development agenda is a \ncase in point. The Doha Development Round was \nlaunched as a process that would eventually give \ndeveloping countries a fair chance to compete in the \nworld marketplace. It was expected to restore the \nmomentum of the open market while giving genuine \npriority to the concerns and interests of developing \ncountries. Five years down the road, we have not \nagreed on opening up markets or eliminating \ndiscriminative subsidies. \n My delegation strongly feels that part of that \nfailure is attributable to the multilateral system\u2019s lack \nof good global governance, poor coordination and lack \nof coherence. As the United Nations has a \nresponsibility to identify the causes hindering the \nachievement of the internationally agreed development \ngoals, including the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs), the Organization is the right body to track \nimplementation of commitments undertaken by \ndevelopment partners. An effective mechanism should \nbe devised for doing that. \n Uganda calls on the international community, and \nthe United Nations in particular, to explore new and \nmore effective ways of promoting consensus on issues \nof vital importance to the peace, security and \nprosperity of our global community. In that regard, we \nwould like to welcome and encourage the holding of \n  \n \n06-52885 50 \n \nthe high-level events that have been organized \nalongside this session.  \n The High-level Dialogue on International \nMigration and Development held last week has \nproduced important outcomes that are going to be \nvaluable in the formulation of policies on international \nmigration and development. In the same light, the \nconvening of the High-level Meeting on the midterm \ncomprehensive global review of the implementation of \nthe Programme of Action for the Least Developed \nCountries is a welcome decision as it will feed into the \nmidterm review. \n With regard to Africa\u2019s development, the New \nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development \u2014 NEPAD \u2014 is \nthe key framework for action. We continue to urge \ndevelopment partners to support Africa\u2019s efforts by \ncontributing positively and effectively to the \nimplementation of that regional development strategy. \nOf the United Nations system in particular we request \nthat the funding that comes from United Nations \ndevelopment systems should focus on Africa\u2019s \npriorities as determined by the partner States, while \ncare should be taken to avoid diversion of development \nresources to other donor-driven activities. \n I would like now to briefly turn my attention to \nthe situation in our region. Uganda\u2019s security and \ndevelopment is directly interlinked with developments \nin the Great Lakes region. We are therefore fully \ncommitted to the realization of peace and security, and \nhave continued to play a key role in the search for \ndurable peace and security in our region.  \n We welcome the positive developments in the \nsouthern Sudan following the signing of the \nComprehensive Peace Agreement. We fully support the \ndemocratic process being pursued in the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo. We call upon all parties \ninvolved to have full confidence in the process so that \nit can be successfully completed. The regional \ninitiative on Burundi under Uganda\u2019s chairmanship has \nmade steady progress, and we have full confidence in \nits success.  \n Uganda also wishes to appeal to the international \ncommunity, especially our development partners, to \nsupport the peace initiatives in the region by \ncontributing generously to the success of the \nInternational Conference on the Great Lakes Region, \ninitiated by the United Nations in collaboration with \nthe African Union. \n With regard to Somalia, we call for international \nsupport for the Transitional Federal Government. We \ncall on the Security Council to support the \nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) \npeace process and the partial lifting of the arms \nembargo to enable deployment of the IGAD Peace \nSupport Mission to Somalia and the African Union \nforces. \n At the national level, in Uganda there is an \norganization called the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army (LRA), \na terrorist group with no political agenda, which has \nfor a number of years unleashed terror on the \npopulation of northern Uganda, killing and maiming \npeople and abducting children for training as killers \nand use as sex slaves. The LRA has now been defeated \nand its remnants have fled to Garamba Park in the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. The Government \nof Uganda has now entered into peace talks with the \nLRA under the mediation of the Government of \nsouthern Sudan with a view to restoring peace and \nstability. \n After a careful analysis of the situation, the \nGovernment of Uganda decided to take the painful \ndecision to offer amnesty to the LRA top leadership, in \norder to facilitate the peace talks. That decision was \npainful in the sense that we do not condone or tolerate \nimpunity whatsoever. However, we are convinced that \nthe alternative traditional justice system that we intend \nto apply is an equitable solution and should be given a \nchance. We call on the international community to \nsupport the process that we have embarked on. We are \ndetermined to resolve the conflict peacefully. Peace is \nwhat our people want, and it is peace that we are \ndetermined to give them. "

        "file_text": "First of all, Madam, I would like to \ncongratulate you on your election to preside over our \nwork during the General Assembly\u2019s sixty-first session. \nThis is a tribute not only to your qualities, but also to \nthe dedication of your country, because it shows the \nrecognition of Bahrain\u2019s attachment to the principles \nand actions pursued by the United Nations. This is \nwhy, on behalf of the Cape Verde delegation and in my \nown name, I would like to assure you of our \ncooperation. \n The rapid changes in the modern world are a \npermanent challenge to the United Nations capacity to \npreserve the centrality of its role in the promotion of \ndevelopment, peace, security and human rights. These \nchanges involve challenges, opportunities and \nconstraints that we must properly manage in order to \ncreate the more balanced, democratic and peaceful \nworld order to which we all aspire. \n To confront these challenges, the United Nations \nmust commit itself unambiguously to modernizing and \nreforming its activities. Being the product of its \nMember States, the Organization must be granted the \nresources that are commensurate with its mandate. \n Following the decisions and recommendations \nadopted at the 2005 World Summit, relevant important \nmeasures have been adopted. I am particularly grateful \nfor the establishment of the Human Rights Council, the \nPeacebuilding Commission, the Central Emergency \nResponse fund, the Optional Protocol to the \nConvention on the Safety of United Nations and \nAssociated Personnel, resolutions on development and \nthe United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. \nIn this connection, I would like to express my \ncountry\u2019s gratitude to Mr. Jan Eliasson for his dynamic \nand efficient guidance of the work of the Assembly\u2019s \nsixtieth session. \n Reform of the United Nations will not be \ncomplete unless we reform the Security Council, the \nEconomic and Social Council, the Secretariat and \nmanagement, indispensable components in our \nOrganization\u2019s efforts to adapt to today\u2019s realities. We \nmust move ahead with an open and flexible attitude, \nwithout jeopardizing the principles of equity and \njustice. \n At the internal institutional level, in order for \nreform to be understood and supported by all the \nparties concerned, it must be carried out in an \ninclusive, harmonious and streamlined manner. Cape \nVerde has agreed to host a pilot project known as the \nJoint Office Mechanism, a procedure with a common \nframework for United Nations programmes, agencies \nand funds, the final objective of which is to enhance \nthe efficiency of operational activities by rationalizing \nstructures and resources and creating synergy at the \ntechnical and budgetary levels. The complexity of this \nexperiment and its implications in streamlining \noperations with the structures on which the JOM \ndepends in New York will call for adjustments in \npolicies, instruments and practices and a permanent \ndialogue with Governments. \n \n \n21 06-53952 \n \n I am gratified at the selection of the topic of our \ndebate: \u201cImplementing a global partnership for \ndevelopment\u201d. This topic could not be more timely, as \nmany people around the world do not yet enjoy the \nfundamental human right to live in dignity, without \nhaving to worry about poverty or fear. The Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) remain empty words for \nthese people.  \n It is deplorable that, despite all scientific progress \nin our time, underdevelopment continues to be the \ndaily reality for so many men, women and children on \nthe planet. While it is up to national leaders to bear the \nprime responsibility, we cannot underline enough the \nimportance of a global partnership to restore equity in \nthese situations and create the foundations for \ndevelopment that is more in line with the MDGs. \n In that context, the international community \nshould genuinely fulfil its commitments with respect to \nofficial development assistance and should establish \nthe conditions for a fairer and more equitable \ninternational trading system that would take property \naccount of small, vulnerable economies, including \nthose of island States. \n In the specific case of Africa, I welcome the \nvarious initiatives that have been announced, while \nurging the international community to give our \ncontinent a more consistent form of support \u2014 one that \nis more consistent with the MDGs and the positive \nmomentum created by the emergence of new African \nleaders who are working to promote development, \ndemocracy, peace and political and social stability. \n Debt reduction, access to direct investment, \nimproving the financing modalities for development \nand innovative financing efforts are measures that \ncould encourage and support national policy \nadjustment efforts through improvement of the \nmanagement of resources. Consistent with the \ninternational agenda, initiatives related to external debt \nshould also be extended to medium-low-income \ncountries. \n Only two weeks ago, in this very forum, during \nthe High-level Meeting on the midterm comprehensive \nglobal review of the implementation of the Brussels \nProgramme of Action for the Least Developed \nCountries, the Cape Verde delegation stated that \nirrefutable progress had been achieved, but this should \nnot mask the problems and shortcomings that still \nexist. \n In general, we see a mixed record in the \nimplementation of that instrument; this reflects the \nmajor constraints that all these countries face in trying \nto reverse the heavy dynamic of underdevelopment. \n In the specific case of Cape Verde, thanks to \nefforts at the national level, with the support of the \ninternational community, social and economic \nindicators have improved markedly during the \ncountry\u2019s 30 years of independence. Considerable \nprogress has been achieved in education and health and \nin reform of the financial and fiscal sectors and of the \nState administration. At the political level, reform has \nmade possible the setting-up of a democratic system \nand the emergence of a cultural and political climate of \ntolerance and power-sharing. These results provided \nthe basis for the General Assembly\u2019s decision to \ngraduate Cape Verde from the category of least \ndeveloped countries in 2008. \n Cape Verde is aware that to consolidate these \nefforts requires a sustained financial effort that it \ncannot make on its own. Let us recall that Cape Verde \nis a small island country without natural resources and \nexposed to permanent drought and external shocks. In \naddition, its economic vulnerability outweighs the two \nother criteria required for graduation from the category \nof least developed country. The Government accepted \nthis new challenge fully convinced that it is primarily \nresponsible for drafting and implementing the best \npossible development model in the interests of the \npeople of Cape Verde. That is why it has decided to \npursue dialogue with its bilateral and multilateral \npartners in order to ensure smooth transition, in \naccordance with the resolution adopted by the General \nAssembly. \n In many ways, the success of this pioneering step \nlargely depends on support from the United Nations \nsystem and the broader international community. The \ntransition support group that has been created has the \nresponsibility of helping us to clarify the goals and \nmodalities of graduation and to set in motion a new \npartnership for creating a new and more agile \neconomic momentum that will make us less vulnerable. \n Climate change and environmental degradation \nhave harmful effects on ecosystems, especially in small \nisland developing States such as Cape Verde. The \ninternational community must provide strong support \nfor the effective implementation of the Mauritius \nStrategy for the Further Implementation of the \n  \n \n06-53952 22 \n \nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development \nof Small Island Developing States. \n The deadlock in negotiations on disarmament \nissues, transnational organized crime, clandestine \nimmigration and its human, political, social, cultural \nand economic impact, endemic diseases such as \nmalaria and tuberculosis and the rapid expansion of \nHIV/AIDS are causes of deep concern, particularly in \nsmall, poor countries. Here again, the international \ncommunity must act together and quickly. \n Terrorism continues to threaten international \npeace and stability. Cape Verde, which has signed the \nmain legal instruments to combat terrorism, supports \nthe United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy \n(resolution 60/288) launched at the beginning of the \ncurrent session of the General Assembly. The Strategy \nsends a clear message about the determination of the \nUnited Nations to address the root causes of this \nscourge and combat it in all its forms and \nmanifestations. We are convinced that it will contribute \nto removing the difficulties surrounding negotiations \non an international counter-terrorism convention. \n While there are unresolved conflicts, others are \nbreaking out in various places, constantly vying for \nattention and action by the international community. \nThe situation in the Middle East has recently escalated \nwith the confrontation between Lebanon and Israel. \nThis has led to unspeakable human suffering and \ntremendous material damage in both countries and \nthroughout the region. No one can remain indifferent in \nthe face of this conflict, which has continued far too \nlong, 60 years, and which remains a major cause \u2014 \nindeed, the epicentre \u2014 of international instability. \n Cape Verde supports the idea of a comprehensive \nstrategy, the only viable key to which would be the \npeaceful settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \nSecurity Council resolution 1701 (2006) contains \nimportant provisions that could serve as a basis for \nsuch a strategy. Cape Verde urges all the parties \nconcerned to resume dialogue and negotiations. The \ninternational community, in particular the United \nNations, must strive to create conditions for restoring \nconfidence and establishing lasting peace, which are \npreconditions for economic integration and the \npromotion of intercultural dialogue in the region. \n In Africa, while renewed hope accompanies the \npeacebuilding process in Burundi, Liberia, Sierra \nLeone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the \npersistence of other sources of tension risks \ncompromising development efforts and perpetrating \nhuman tragedy. That is the case in Darfur, where the \nsituation remains fragile and where disagreement \namong certain parties to the conflict greatly risks \ncompromising the Peace Agreement signed at Abuja in \nMay 2006. Cape Verde endorses the recommendations \nand appeals issued by the African Union Peace and \nSecurity Council at its recent New York meeting, held \nat the margins of the General Assembly, on the \nsituation in Darfur. We hail the international \ncommunity and the African Union for their efforts to \nresolve the crisis, and we encourage them to continue. \nAt the same time, we call upon the parties concerned to \nmake greater efforts at dialogue and find a peaceful \nsolution to the crisis. \n I would like to end where I started, speaking of \nthe central role of the United Nations in the \ndemocratization of international relations and in the \npromotion of development, peace and human rights. \nAllow me to express the appreciation of Cape Verde to \nMr. Kofi Annan for his outstanding work over the past \n10 years, which has made it possible for the \nOrganization to leave its mark on the course of \nmultilateralism. His work does him credit and it is also \nto the credit of Africa. As he prepares to leave the post \nof Secretary-General, we wish him every success in his \nfuture endeavours.  "

        "file_text": "Madam President, allow me today to pay a special \ntribute to Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of our \nOrganization, for the important role he has played over \nthe past ten years in upholding the lofty principles and \nvalues on which this Organization was founded. \nDuring the same period, Mr. Annan dealt with many \ntrying international situations with profound wisdom \nand clear vision. It is our hope that the candidate \nelected for this important international post during this \nsession will display the same wisdom and vision. \n The sixty-first session meets against the backdrop \nof a complex international situation and unfortunate \ninternational events that have uncovered many \ncontradictions in the work of this Organization. Those \ncontradictions require us to study in depth the extent to \nwhich the United Nations has succeeded in \nstrengthening international understanding and \nconsensus when dealing with the threats and challenges \nthat face humanity. The current complex situation and \nrecent events make it incumbent upon us to draw on \npast experience to strengthen the role of the \nOrganization in achieving the noble purposes and \nprinciples for which it was founded. \n The negotiations preceding the adoption of the \n2005 Summit Outcome Document and the subsequent \nnegotiations on its implementation have made it clear \nthat the visions of the North and the South with regard \nto the future of the United Nations and the nature of its \n \n \n41 06-53005 \n \nrole in the current and coming phases have become \nmore divergent than before. That was manifest in a \nnumber of attitudes that have left visible marks on the \ninternational environment. \n There is a widening gap between, on the one \nhand, those who pay the larger share of the budget of \nthe Organization and believe that their contributions \nentitle them to a larger say in the conduct of its work, \nand on the other hand the developing countries, which \npay their fair share as established by the methodology \nand criteria adopted by the General Assembly and \nbelieve that the Organization must remain the \ninternational forum of democracy, equality and good \ngovernance on the international level, as embodied in \nthe principle of \u201cone State, one vote\u201d. \n Some States, with increasing insistence, believe \nthat the Security Council must hold the fate of the \nOrganization in its hands, taking precedence over its \nother main organs. Those States are robbing the others \nof most of their competencies and deal with them in \nany way they see fit, without oversight, even if that \nleads to the failure of the Council to discharge its \nresponsibilities to prevent the killing of the innocent or \nthe perpetration of crimes of genocide and other crimes \nagainst humanity.  \n This insistence by a small number of States runs \ncounter to the view of the majority of Member States, \nwhich believe that the General Assembly is the \ninclusive democratic forum that brings the Members of \nthe Organization together. It is the Assembly that \nmandated the Council to bear the responsibility for the \nmaintenance of international peace and security. The \nAssembly alone has the right of oversight and review \nof the work of all the organs of the Organization. \nIndeed, the Assembly has the right to withdraw the \nprerogatives of the Security Council, should it fail to \ndischarge its charter-mandated responsibilities or if the \nnarrow political interests of one of the parties to a \nconflict prevent the Council from fulfilling its task. \n This is a time when the international arena has \nwitnessed a growing tendency to misuse official \ndevelopment assistance (ODA) by imposing conditions \non the national priorities of developing countries \nwithout any regard to the agreements reached in the \nrelevant United Nations conferences and summits. At \nthe same time, the overwhelming majority continues to \nbelieve that development is a human right and that \ndevelopment assistance, along with the transfer of \ntechnology, is an obligation for developed countries. \n Last year was the sixtieth anniversary of the \ntragedies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Astonishingly, \nsome States continue to believe that their might and \ndominance are based on their \u2014 and their allies\u2019 \u2014 \ncontinued possession of nuclear arsenals. These States \nbelieve in the need to exercise strict control and \nsupervision of other States and to apply restrictions on \nthe use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. At the \nsame time, the great majority of Member States believe \nthat their commitment under the Treaty on the  \nNon-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) not to \nproduce nuclear weapons was made on the basis of a \ncorresponding commitment by the nuclear-weapons \nStates to eliminate nuclear weapons under international \nsupervision within a specific time frame and to achieve \nthe universality of the Treaty. Not only does the \nmaintenance of the existing nuclear arsenals jeopardize \nthe credibility of the NPT, it also threatens humanity \nwith total destruction and annihilation. \n Our peoples have a keen interest in the \nachievement of a larger measure of democracy, human \nrights and political reform. However, we now can see \nthat some seek to impose these concepts by military \nforce, based on their assumption that their principles, \nvalues and cultures are superior and stronger and thus \nworthy of being imposed on others. At the same time, \nthe overwhelming majority believe that democracy and \nhuman rights are based on culture-specific values and \nstandards that emanate from their respective societies. \nThey simply cannot be imposed from outside. \n Notwithstanding the increase in the number of \nvictims of terrorist operations, there is an increased \ntendency to deal with terrorism through military force \nalone, while ignoring its root causes. Some have made \nit their mission to rid the world of the evils of terrorism \nas they themselves define it. They ignore the \ninternational collective work to conclude a \ncomprehensive convention on terrorism and to \nimplement effectively the General Assembly Global \nCounter-Terrorism Strategy in a manner that strikes a \nbalance between the respective roles of the General \nAssembly and the Security Council. \n Last, but not least, the negotiations on the reform \nof the Organization have proven that some believe that \nthe international collective security regime was \nestablished to enable those who posses the military \n  \n \n06-53005 42 \n \nmight to impose political settlements under \ninternational protection. While the great majority \nbelieves that the lessons of history, most recently in \nLebanon, have proven that military might cannot and \nwill not impose a political settlement. Such settlements \nmust be reached through negotiations alone. \n The aforementioned are some of the main \nelements that set our positions farther apart during the \npast year. We must take these elements as a basis for \ndetermining the premise of our work during this \nsession. We must develop a clear understanding of the \nstrengths and weaknesses of the performance of our \nOrganization. Together, we should chart the course \naimed at upholding the values of democracy, justice \nand respect for law in international relations. We must \nmove resolutely towards the consolidation of those \nvalues in the international community, in view of the \nfact that they constitute the real, solid foundations of \ninternational peace and security. \n With the same constructive spirit that prevailed in \nour work last year, together with a balanced mixture of \nrealism and ambition, and without the imposition of \nimpractical time frames or the acceptance of temporary \nmeasures, we must proceed towards the achievement of \nfurther reform and the strengthening of the \neffectiveness of the United Nations. We must commit \nto preserving both the principle of consensus and the \nintergovernmental character of the Organization. \n Together, we must work to increase the ability of \nthe collective security regime to deal swiftly with \ninternational problems. We must stand up to the \narrogance of power of some so that we can protect the \nrights and future of other countries and peoples. We \nmust also face resolutely any attempts to impose \ntemporary solutions through unilateral actions or \nmilitary solutions that might result in transient \nvictories that lack justice and a comprehensive vision. \nSuch actions only scratch the surface of the problems \nwithout delving into the root causes. They lead to the \nexacerbation of problems by fanning the flames of \nhatred and rejection. This, in turn, feeds terrorism and \nextremism and leads those who despair of the justice of \nthe international system to rebel against the will of the \ninternational community. \n Despite Egypt\u2019s repeated warnings against \nfollowing the path of escalation and confrontation, the \nhuge loss of life and property incurred as a result of the \nwar between Israel and Lebanon has gone beyond all \nlimits. Lebanon has suffered the total devastation of its \ninfrastructure and the indiscriminate killing of \nhundreds of innocent civilians, including children, as \nthe result of actions that contravene the United Nations \nCharter and the basic rules of international law and \nrelevant international humanitarian law. And, despite \nthe fact that the Israeli war against Lebanon caused \nuntold devastation, it has proven that military might, \nhowever great, will never be able to impose a political \nsolution. It has also proven that the solution lies in \nending the occupation and in negotiating a just political \nsettlement that will eliminate the feelings of enmity \nand replace them with relations of cooperation and \npeaceful coexistence. \n Undoubtedly, Security Council resolution 1701 \n(2006), after having been amended to take into \nconsideration the Arab point of view, thanks to the \nefforts of the Arab delegation mandated by the League \nof Arab States to New York, is a step in the right \ndirection. However, this step will remain incomplete \nand will not enjoy the success required unless it deals \nwith the core of the problem in the region \u2014 namely, \nthe Arab Israeli conflict. \n The Arab-Israeli conflict has squandered the \nresources and lives of the people of the Middle East for \nmany decades. In it, political, historical and religious \ndimensions have fermented into a combustible mix that \ncarries the seeds of a conflagration that could go \nbeyond the region and reflect negatively on stability \nand relations between the various cultures and faiths in \nthe world. Hence the importance for all of us, citizens \nof the region and members of the international \ncommunity, to act in concert to reach an immediate, \njust and comprehensive solution to this conflict. \n In its endeavours to achieve comprehensive peace \nbetween the Arab world and Israel, Egypt precedes \nfrom a realistic vision of the events on the ground. In \nthis context, Egypt is exerting efforts to improve the \nsecurity situation between the Palestinians and the \nIsraelis through direct engagement with both parties, \nwith the aim of calming the situation, putting an end to \nall acts of violence, killing and destruction and \nencouraging confidence-building measures between the \nPalestinians and the Israelis aimed at resuming \ndialogue and negotiations. At the same time, Egypt \nseeks to resume progress on the three tracks of the \nsettlement of the Arab Israeli conflict. This is the main \nobjective of the peace process, which has regrettably \nbeen stalled for years. The deterioration in the security \n \n \n43 06-53005 \n \nsituation must not make us lose sight of that objective. \nExperience has proven time and again that the success \nof security measures will remain limited and fragile if \nthey are not made part of a wider political framework \nthat would ensure the basic rights of the parties and \nencourage them to make the difficult decisions \nnecessary for the improvement of the security \nsituation. \n The Quartet has drawn up a road map for peace. \nIt was accepted by the parties and the States of the \nregion. It was endorsed by resolution 1515 (2003) of \nthe Security Council. It was hoped that it would \nconstitute the political framework to which I referred \nearlier. However, this did not happen, for reasons that I \nwill not list here. Yet, the road map remains a \ncornerstone for the achievement of peace in the region, \nsince it establishes the principles of peaceful co-\nexistence between Israel and Palestine and determines \nthe general parameters of the final settlement between \nIsrael, Palestine, Syria and Lebanon \u2014 namely, an end \nto the occupation that started in 1967, implementation \nof the international resolutions on the Arab-Israeli \nconflict, and implementation of the Arab peace \ninitiative that would ensure security, peace and \nrecognition for Israel by its Arab neighbours in return \nfor Israel\u2019s ending its occupation of the Arab territories \nand working out acceptable solutions for other pending \nissues. There is now a need to build upon this \ncornerstone in order to create an effective political \nframework that would move the parties towards the \nobjective desired by the international community as a \nwhole \u2014 namely, the establishment of a \ncomprehensive peace that would put an end to \noccupation and strife in this part of the world. \n Egypt has closely followed the developments in \nthe Darfur crisis since its inception. It is one of the \ntroop- contributing countries to the African Union \nobserver mission in Darfur. Egypt participated actively \nin the Abuja talks and has provided humanitarian \nassistance to the people of Darfur. \n There is no doubt that the international \ncommunity bears a major share of the responsibility for \nreaching a swift and just solution to that problem. In \nour opinion, efforts must focus on creating conditions \nconducive to the success of the Darfur Peace \nAgreement as the political framework agreed upon by \nthe main parties. That will require the launching and \nstrengthening of the Darfur-Darfur dialogue in order to \ncreate a consensus on the Peace Agreement and to \nconvince the parties that have not yet signed it to do \nso. In addition, there is a need to encourage the \nSudanese Government to carry out its commitments on \nthe development and reconstruction of the Darfur \nregion. \n If the United Nations is to continue to play the \nrole entrusted to it, we must display a sense of \ncollective responsibility based on a strong resolve to \nmake the Organization an inclusive framework for \ncommon international efforts to deal promptly and \neffectively with regional and global issues and \nproblems.  The call to disseminate democratic practices \nand good governance among the States of the world \nwill be heeded only if coupled with the clear \ncommitment of all States to applying those concepts in \na multilateral framework and at the international level. \nIt will be valid only if accompanied by a reaffirmation \nof the principles of partnership, the sharing of burdens \nand responsibilities, equality of rights and duties, and, \nabove all, participation on an equal footing in defining \noptions and in decision-making at the international \nlevel. \n Let us work together to strengthen the principles \nof democracy in an international multilateral setting. \nLet us make dialogue and mutual respect the language \nof our discourse. Let us give lofty human ideals and the \ncommon good precedence over narrow selfish interests. \nLet us cast aside our differences and be real partners. \n In conclusion, allow me to convey our sincere \ncongratulations to you, Madam, on your assumption of \nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nfirst session. We are confident that, as the first Arab \nwoman to assume that high position, you will meet \nwith resounding success. In that respect, allow us also \nto express our sincere appreciation and gratitude to \nyour predecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixtieth session, for his skilful \nleadership of our work.

This is all the more remarkable given \nthat, for much of his stewardship, the United Nations \nhas been confronted with some of the most difficult \ninternational crises of its existence.  \n New Zealand is committed to multilateralism. \nThis is not some act of faith, but a commitment to a \nmultilateralism that really delivers. We need to be \nprepared to work diligently for the good of the global \ncommunity. \n The United Nations is passing through a period of \nchallenge to its relevance and effectiveness. It has \n \n \n19 06-53323 \n \nconfronted serious political and security shocks \u2014 \nfresh hostilities in the Middle East, the tragic and \nworsening situation in Darfur, and, in our own region, \ninstability in Timor-Leste. \n Last year, world leaders agreed to an ambitious \nreform agenda based on the three pillars of peace and \nsecurity, development and human rights. Progress has \nbeen made, but this is no time to rest. We must press \non, for much remains to be done. \n The challenge of development has never been \nhigher on the international agenda. Never before has \nthe commitment to eradicating poverty been so critical. \nBut increasing aid levels will not be enough; we must \nbecome more effective. We need to make sure that \nevery dollar we spend makes a positive difference. \nThat means addressing the key threats to our \nsuccess \u2014 poor governance, corruption and gender \ninequality. We need to secure fairer international \ntrading relationships, and we must work on all of those \ntogether. \n The theme of this year\u2019s general debate is the \nimplementation of a global partnership for \ndevelopment. For New Zealand, collective action is \nimperative. We need participation, ownership and \nresponsibility from recipient countries. We seek \nharmonization with larger contributors to align and \ncombine our contributions. We seek partnership with \nmultilateral development agencies in our campaign to \neradicate poverty, and we endorse the efforts of the \nUnited Nations and those agencies to coordinate better, \ncountry by country. \n New Zealand, as members are aware, has a \nrelationship with the Pacific that is based on history, \nculture and economic and social linkages. Our bonds \nwith Pacific States are an important dimension of our \nother relationships. We want nothing less than \neducated, healthy, well-governed, economically \nprosperous and safe communities. \n In the Auckland Declaration of 2004, Pacific \nleaders committed themselves to a \u201cregion that is \nrespected for the quality of its governance, the \nsustainable management of its resources, the full \nobservance of democratic values and for its defence \nand promotion of human rights\u201d. These are ambitious \ngoals, and translating them into reality means hard \nwork by all Pacific countries. That is a challenge that \nNew Zealand accepts. \n In facing that challenge, we confront economic, \nenvironmental, governance, development and security \nissues. Markets are distant. Climate change is a reality. \nPolitical instability does not help. Threats from \ncommunicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS and \npandemic influenza must be managed. \n The Pacific accounts for almost one quarter of the \nsurface of the world \u2014 an area bigger than Europe and \nthe Middle East combined. Its strategic significance \npresents opportunity and challenge. New Zealand is \ndetermined to seek out the benefits of that significance \nand guard against the threats, among which I include, \nsadly, cheque-book diplomacy. \n Across the Pacific, we have learned that regional \nproblems require regional solutions. Last year, Pacific \nIsland Forum leaders adopted the Pacific Plan for \nregional cooperation. Through that plan we will \nstrengthen regional cooperation where it can most \nmake a difference, and we will use it to promote the \nfour goals of the Pacific Islands Forum: sustainable \ndevelopment, economic growth, security and good \ngovernance. \n At the same time, we do not forget that our \nregional endeavours depend on strong international \nframeworks. The Framework Convention on Climate \nChange is an essential example. Another example is the \nUnited Nations Fish Stocks Agreement on the \nconservation and management of straddling and highly \nmigratory fish stocks. \n We are proud of our achievements in regional \nfisheries management. The Western and Central Pacific \nFisheries Commission, with its headquarters in \nPohnpei, manages the region\u2019s migratory fish species. \nWe are in the midst of developing new regional \narrangements for non-migratory fish stocks. \n These mechanisms are central to the region\u2019s \nability to ensure the sustainable management of its \nmost important natural resources. They are at the \nleading edge in establishing best-practice management \nnorms. \n There have been profound political and security \nshocks over the past year \u2014 in the Middle East and in \nDarfur, as well as instability in Timor-Leste \u2014 those \nand more are testing the United Nations system. \n It is a sad reality that the situation in the Middle \nEast has been on the agenda of the United Nations for \n60 years, ever since its inception. The lack of sustained \n  \n \n06-53323 20 \n \npolitical will to see through more than a handful of \ndecisions on the Middle East has undermined \nconfidence. It has contributed to an unstable \nenvironment where extremism, injustice and despair \nflourish. \n These issues must be tackled with a new resolve, \nusing the international multilateral system as a tool for \npeace and progress. The international response to the \nSecurity Council\u2019s call for an expanded United Nations \nInterim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) shows that the \ninternational community can react to conflict and \nprovide basic stabilization. But such responses are \ndoomed to failure unless the underlying political and \nsecurity issues are addressed. It is therefore imperative \nto relaunch the Middle East peace process covering all \nissues, on the basis of the relevant Security Council \nresolutions. \n The Organization\u2019s efforts to introduce a United \nNations force into Darfur is being cynically thwarted \nby the Government of the Sudan. That is simply \nunconscionable. The Government of the Sudan must, in \nthe name of basic humanity, accept the need for a \nUnited Nations force as the best chance for the security \nof the people of Darfur. \n New and fragile States face enormous challenges. \nRecent unrest in Timor-Leste demonstrates that fact. \nNew Zealand responded quickly to Timor-Leste\u2019s \nneeds with a military and police contribution to help \nrestore stability. The regional response has been swift \nand robust. The United Nations played an important \nrole in facilitating Timor-Leste\u2019s independence, and it \nis clear the United Nations will continue to be involved \nin Timor-Leste for many years to come. The \ndeployment of a substantial United Nations police \nforce is vital if peace and stability is to be maintained \neven in the medium term. The nature of the expanded \nUnited Nations mission in Timor-Leste reflects the \ndeep and broad engagement required to build a lasting \npeace. Timor-Leste encapsulates the principle that \npeace and security cannot be separated from economic \ndevelopment, social reconciliation and the protection \nof basic human rights. The Security Council\u2019s mandate \nfor Timor-Leste endorses that truth. \n New Zealand fully supported the renewed focus \non human rights at last year\u2019s World Summit. We \nstrongly campaigned for the new Human Rights \nCouncil, and we worked hard to bring it into being. We \nhave high ambitions for it and will follow its activities \nclosely. It must remain strong, focused and effective. It \nmust be able to deal swiftly with emerging situations of \nhuman rights concern, in a balanced way, with \nscrupulous attention to verifiable facts. It must be \naspirational, inspirational and practical. Its working \nmethods must be transparent and inclusive. Above all, \nthere must be genuine political will to make it work. \n A few weeks ago, encouraged all the way by \nenergetic non-governmental organizations, Member \nStates agreed on the first new comprehensive human \nrights instrument of the twenty-first century: a draft \nconvention relating to persons with disabilities. We are \nproud in New Zealand of the role we played in those \nnegotiations on the text. The draft convention stands to \nmake a real difference to the lives of approximately \n650 million of the world\u2019s most disadvantaged citizens. \n New Zealand is also conscious of the \ndisadvantages faced by indigenous peoples in many \nparts of the world. We were closely engaged in the \nlengthy negotiations towards a declaration on the rights \nof indigenous peoples. We had hoped that the \ndeclaration would be a new standard of achievement \nfor Governments that could be implemented to really \nimprove the lives of indigenous peoples. Therefore, we \nare disappointed that that was not to be so. The draft \ndeclaration that emerged with less than conclusive \nsupport from the Human Rights Council is deeply \nflawed and represents a lost opportunity for the world\u2019s \nindigenous peoples. \n At the beginning of his term, the Secretary-\nGeneral set an important goal for the United Nations: \nto perfect \u201cthe triangle of development, freedom and \npeace\u201d (A/51/PV.88, p. 13). The Secretary-General\u2019s \nwords still ring true today. We have travelled only part \nof the journey towards that goal. Considering our \nachievements over the past year, we can be satisfied \nwith progress made in setting up the Human Rights \nCouncil and the Peacebuilding Commission. The \nchallenge now is to make those two new bodies truly \neffective. The welcome adoption of the United Nations \nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288) \nreminds us of the efforts we must continue to make at \nregional and national levels. \n New Zealand wants to see continuing reform high \non the list of priorities for the sixty-first session in \norder to ensure that the United Nations can be as \nresponsive as possible to the needs of Member States, \n \n \n21 06-53323 \n \nand efficient in getting the best from the resources \navailable to it. \n Sixty years ago, New Zealand had high hopes for \nthe United Nations. In 2006, we still do. New Zealand \nis a country that engages with the United Nations with \nno hidden agenda. What we say is what we mean. We \nengage with no other or hidden agenda. But those that \ndo so pervert and weaken this Organization.  \n In 2006, at this meeting, New Zealand declares \nthat we will continue to put our efforts behind the \nprinciples and policies that will make the United \nNations strong.

        "file_text": "Today, I am honoured as I \ncongratulate you, Madam President, on your election \nas the first Arab woman to ever preside over this body, \nhoping that this heralds a new era of better \nunderstanding of women\u2019s aspirations and Arab causes. \n I would also like to thank the Secretary-General, \nMr. Kofi Annan, for all that he has done for Lebanon \nand for the cause of peace in the region and the world \nas a whole. \n I stand before the Assembly representing a \nterribly scarred country, a country whose ordeal is well \nknown to members \u2014 my ravaged country, Lebanon. \nFrom 12 July through 14 August, my country was \nsubjected to a barbarous aggression and to a rarely seen \ncampaign of savage dismemberment, when hundreds of \nfighter jets emptied their loads of heavy and banned \nbombs, targeting mostly civilians, killing and maiming \nthousands, and destroying everything that made \nLebanon a viable State. Obviously, this was a \npremeditated Israeli \u201csentence\u201d to destroy my country \nand everything it stood for, it having been blessed and \ntermed by His Holiness Pope John Paul II a \u201cunique \nmessage to humanity,\u201d that we can live together. This \naggression became even more cruel when it won the \ntacit approbation of certain great powers. \n Regrettably, the Security Council looked \npowerless in its attempts to stop the slaughter of \nLebanon\u2019s children and protect the peace in Lebanon \nand the Middle East. It took over a month and \nnumerous calls for an immediate ceasefire for all those \nconcerned to finally force a mere cessation of \nhostilities, which is yet to become a formal and final \nceasefire. \n It becomes self-evident for us to question the \ncredibility of the United Nations in light of the \nSecretary-General\u2019s acknowledgment that the delays in \nadopting Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) did \nindeed harm its credibility. Moreover, we cannot but \nhave serious doubts as to this Organization\u2019s ability to \nsafeguard world peace when its resolutions are \nsubjected to the vagaries of a very few world powers. \n Today I ask: How many children, like the one in \nthe photograph that I am holding up, will die because \nnobody does anything for them? How many children \nwas this evil, vengeful machine of destruction \nsupposed to have killed, before the world community \ndecided to respond in defence of a \u201crightful\u201d cause? \nAllow us to ask these questions, as we are filled with a \ndeep sense of grief, when scores of our fallen citizens \nare still beneath the rubble. \n Let me reassure the Assembly that this savagery \ndid not weaken our people\u2019s resolve nor shake its \nresilience as it rallied around its army and Government \nand embraced its national resistance, whose men faced \noccupation forces with epic valour, preventing their \nadvance, and presenting Lebanon with yet another \nvictory, in the name of justice and dignity. \n While we stand under the United Nations \numbrella to warn the world of the dire consequences \nwe shall all face when the very foundations of this \nworld body are shaken, it is also time to ask Israel, \nwhich owes its very existence to a United Nations \nresolution, to finally abide by past and recent \nresolutions. \n As of 14 August this year, Lebanon has once \nagain, without a shadow of a doubt, reasserted the fact \nthat it is a nation that respects its commitments, while \nit implements international resolutions and proceeds to \ndeploy 15,000 Lebanese army soldiers on the border \nbetween Lebanon and Israel \u2014 while Israel continues \nits daily breaches of Security Council resolution 1701 \n(2006), having imposed a humiliating siege on \nLebanon, and refusing to withdraw from the Lebanese \nterritory in the Shaba\u2019a farms sector, whose liberation \nremains Lebanon\u2019s sacred right and duty. To this day, \nIsrael continues to treat the people of Lebanon as \nhostages, kidnapping at will scores of its citizens, in a \nflagrant breach of that resolution. \n Finally, Israel refuses to surrender to the United \nNations the maps showing thousands of mines it left \nbehind on Lebanese territory, while the case and fate of \nLebanon\u2019s prisoners in Israel remains very ambiguous, \nand no clear resolution of their ordeal is addressed \nanywhere. \n Today, for the sake of peace, the world \ncommunity is called upon to save Security Council \nresolution 1701 (2006) from oblivion, a fate that \ncharacterized scores of previous resolutions. \n \n \n9 06-52988 \n \n Here, on behalf of a grateful country, I solemnly \nsalute the fallen soldiers of peace who will hence share \ntheir obituary with that of our brave army soldiers and \nof our valiant resistance fighters, victims of prohibited \nweaponry, first tested by Israel on our soil and subject \nto an international investigation. We are hopeful that \nthis time the world community will allow the \ninvestigation to reach its natural conclusion. This will \nconstitute a clear indictment of Israel for its recurring \nviolations of international conventions and the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. \n We also hope that the United States will not \nresort to its unfailing veto, thus allowing for the \nindictment of Israel\u2019s actions in sympathy for the \nthousands of innocent civilians who were killed and \nmaimed by the \u201csmart\u201d, cluster and phosphorus bombs, \nand those laced with depleted uranium. \n Inspired by the principles and treaties of the \nUnited Nations, Lebanon retains the right of action to \nprosecute Israel before the competent bodies, most \nnotably this Assembly, or the International Criminal \nCourt, and to request the appropriate reparations for all \nthe catastrophes Israel has inflicted on Lebanon. \n I ask the Assembly today to stand by my country, \nas that will be recorded as a just and rightful stance. I \nalso call upon it to differentiate between he who \ndefends his country against Israeli aggression and \noccupation, and who strives to liberate his countrymen \nfrom decades of unlawful imprisonment, and those \nelements that perpetrate acts of wanton slaughter \nagainst their countrymen and others equally. I remind \nthe Assembly that Lebanon\u2019s experience with the \nscourge of terror goes back a long way, and has taken a \nvery heavy toll on its armed forces. \n The most recent aggression against Lebanon has \nleft this small country terribly scarred, afflicted with \nthousands of dead and wounded, and a toll of \ndestruction including several thousand housing units \nand hundreds of bridges, ports, airports and factories. \nAnd my message is: the will of our people to live and \nmove forward has proved to be much stronger than \ndefeat and despair. In record time, the people of \nLebanon launched a campaign of reconstruction, made \neven more successful by instant comforting gestures of \ngoodwill from many friends, at home and abroad. With \nsuch overwhelming support and assistance Lebanon \nwill beat all the odds by achieving a stellar rebirth, \nthereby scoring another point in favour of humanity. \n There is ample talk today of the need to reach a \npermanent and comprehensive peace in the Middle \nEast, which Lebanon has stressed for decades. \nHowever, we are quick to point out that no such peace \ncan be achieved in the Middle East without addressing \nthe root cause of instability there, namely, the Arab-\nIsraeli dispute and its core issue, Palestine. \n Despite the horrid events in Lebanon, a window \nof opportunity has presented itself, and it should be \nfully exploited in order to reinvigorate the Middle East \npeace initiative, founded on the Arab peace initiative \nadopted during the Beirut Arab Summit of 2002. \n The Arab peace initiative remains the suitable \nmeans to achieve a permanent, comprehensive and just \npeace, because it simply calls for the implementation \nof all United Nations resolutions as they pertain to the \nwithdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab lands, and \nfor the return of Palestinian refugees to their homes. \nOnly such a settlement will be capable of affording \nLebanon and the neighbouring countries the stability \nand security they long for and will give Israel a sense \nof security \u2014 something it has failed to obtain through \nsheer force and aggression. Moreover, this should put \nan end to the haemorrhage in the Palestinian territories \nand foster moderation where despair has bred \nextremism and violence, most notably in Iraq, where it \nis vital for all of us to help that tortured Arab nation \npreserve its territorial integrity and the unity of its \npeople. \n Today there is incessant talk of a new Middle \nEast as a harbinger of better things to come, and this \nprompts us to ask the following question. Is what we \nhave witnessed in Lebanon and continue to see in \nPalestine and Iraq conducive to an environment of \npeace and tranquillity? Is this much heralded new \nMiddle East attainable only through widespread strife, \nunimaginable bloodshed, sedition and oppression? \n Our conception of a new Middle East is one that \nis coherent with United Nations resolutions, and that is \nin concurrence with the principles of justice and right \nas stipulated in those resolutions. Our idea of a new \nMiddle East is one where a comprehensive peace \nsettlement becomes reality, guaranteeing the rights of \nall; where Palestinian refugees return home, as \nstipulated in resolution 194 (III), which comes long \nbefore Security Council resolution 1701 (2006), and \ntherefore are not resettled in host countries; and where \nprisoners return to their loved ones. \n  \n \n06-52988 10 \n \n This is the only way to attain a stable Middle \nEast. All else will plunge our region into further \nupheaval and bloodshed. \n Should our conception of peace in the Middle \nEast become reality, I assure the Assembly that the \nneed for conferences, studies and discussions of \nterrorism will become moot. Should this happen in \ntandem with serious attempts to combat poverty and \nsustain acceptable levels of development in areas of \nneed, this will certainly dry up the pools where \nterrorism draws its human and financial support. \n I have recently read one of your statements, \nMadam President, in which you emphasize that \noverhauling the United Nations will be one of your top \npriorities. I commend you for that position, because no \none appreciates the need for world peace more than the \npeople of the Middle East, as we recognize that the \npreservation of world peace requires a United Nations \ncapable of taking decisions and competent to see them \nthrough. \n Here, I would like to reiterate what I said from \nthis very rostrum only last year: \n \u201cThe core values of a democratic and just world \nare best served by enhancing the capabilities of \nthe United Nations and its instruments, and by \nreinforcing in-house democratic values.\u201d \n(A/60/PV.13, p.1)  \nI believed that this institution should remain a \nsanctuary of world consciousness and \u201cthe primary \ndefender of such human values as freedom, justice and \npeace.\u201d (ibid) \n Perhaps the reforms that have been carried out so \nfar, such as the establishment of a Human Rights \nCouncil and the Peacebuilding Commission, will \nconstitute the necessary incentives for achieving a \nUnited Nations capable of safeguarding right and \njustice. \n Taking into consideration current trends in world \naffairs, I propose to the General Assembly the creation \nof a commission leading to laying the foundations of a \ncharter of the rights of nations, a charter equal in \nimportance to the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights, a charter imposing on Member States \u2014 all \nStates \u2014 a code of conduct founded on the principles \nof justice and the rule of law. \n I come here from a country riddled with scars, \nrising from the rubble and ashes of aggression, to \nspeak of justice. I do not pretend to pontificate from \nthe helm of a tank. Lebanon remains a peace-loving \nnation, and it extends its hand to all those who share its \npeaceful vision, founded on a just settlement and \nextracting as such the seeds of oppression and \nviolence. We trust that the forces of good will prevail \nin the end, because its flames burn in the heart of the \nrighteous and because the sounds of jubilation will \nundoubtedly prevail over the beating of war drums and \nthe sibilating of hate and violence.

        "file_text": "For more than a year now, Kyrgyzstan has \nbeen experiencing a new stage in its historical \ndevelopment. Today, our leaders are doing their utmost \nto further strengthen our country\u2019s democratic and \nmarket reforms. The unswerving policy we have \nadopted in order to build a democratic society based on \nlaws and a well-developed national economy will lay a \nsolid foundation for a stable political situation. We \nhave committed ourselves to ensuring all the \nconditions necessary for the sustainable development \nof Kyrgyzstan\u2019s economy and the enhancement of our \npeople\u2019s well-being. \n At the 2005 World Summit, the President of the \nKyrgyz Republic, Mr. Kurmanbek Bakiev, reaffirmed \nour full commitment to the universal goals and targets \nset out in the Millennium Declaration. All the \nnecessary legislative measures have been adopted in \nour country to protect social well-being and to support \nthe most vulnerable sectors of the population. That will \nhelp significantly to reduce our poverty level. \n In 2005 alone, despite the existing difficulties, \nsocial expenditures constituted more than 43 per cent \n \n \n39 06-53323 \n \nof the Republic\u2019s budget. As a result, as stated in the \nreport of the Secretary-General on the integration of \ncountries with economies in transition into the world \neconomy, Kyrgyzstan has reduced the scale of poverty \nin the country. \n I would also like to point out that the situation \ntoday in the Kyrgyz Republic is characterized by \nopenness in the economy, macro-economic stability, a \nliberal currency and visa regime, and the free \nmovement of capital and labour. We also enjoy the \nadvantages of membership in the World Trade \nOrganization. \n As I have already pointed out, my country has \nrepeatedly and actively shown its commitment to its \ninternational obligations in the area of the protection of \nfundamental rights and freedoms. Today, the Kyrgyz \nRepublic adheres to all the basic universal international \ninstruments with a human dimension and continues to \ncarry out those provisions responsibly. Further \ndemocratization of the society and the encouragement \nof human rights remain the priorities for our domestic \npolicy. This is why our Head of State has initiated \nreform in law enforcement and judicial bodies, as well \nas constitutional reform in order to improve the \nbalance of power. I would like to point out, in \nparticular, that a very active role is being played by \npolitical parties and civil society in this process, \nthereby ensuring the genuine involvement of broad \nmasses of the population in the adoption of important \nState decisions. \n A month ago, the Office of the United Nations \nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights decided to \nestablish a Regional Office in Bishkek, the capital of \nthe Kyrgyz Republic. We regard this move as \nindicating a strong recognition of our efforts towards \nstrengthening democratic principles and encouraging \nhuman rights and freedom of speech in the country. \n The Kyrgyz Republic has ratified the United \nNations Convention against Corruption and has \ndevised a State strategy to combat this scourge. It has \nestablished a national agency to combat corruption and \na financial intelligence service. I am certain that in our \ncountry, where effective governance is being practiced \nand where human rights are being observed, there will \nbe a better chance of avoiding conflict and overcoming \nobstacles to development. It is no secret that, at this \ndifficult time in human development, with its \nincreasing global, regional and civilizational problems, \nwe all feel the presence of moral and psychological \nmalaise in many parts of the world. \n In order to attain harmony on our planet, all of us \nneed to humanize our societies and give pride of place \nto moral and spiritual values. As our forebears have \nsaid, when people unite in spirit, they can move \nmountains. Today, we are all witnessing global change. \nThere are new issues, new tasks that require innovative \napproaches to solve them. In this regard, the Kyrgyz \nRepublic proposes the formulation of yet another \nMillennium Goal \u2014 goal 9 \u2014 which should focus on \ndynamic development of the local community. Success \ncould be guaranteed through improving the system of \ngovernance, democratization of local self-governance, \nthe elimination of corruption and the involvement in \ngovernance of representatives of various social and \nethnic groups. We base this on the principle that a \nstrong local community means a stable State. A stable \nState means a stable region. And a stable region means \na secure world. \n It is well known that security and development \nare indivisible. We cannot ensure development, if we \ndo not ensure security. We will not achieve global \nsecurity unless we support development and eliminate \npoverty. As the Millennium Project report has pointed \nout, there are many factors underlying extreme poverty, \nfirst and foremost being that of an unfavourable \ngeographical situation. \n In this connection, I would like to devote special \nattention to mountainous areas, which are our planet\u2019s \nbasic source of drinking water. We are grateful for the \nsupport of the United Nations Member States in \nadopting General Assembly resolution 60/198 on \nsustainable mountain development at the Assembly\u2019s \nsixtieth session. I am certain that this will enable \nmountain countries to take serious steps towards \nsolving social, economic and environmental problems. \n Pursuant to the decisions of the Bishkek \nMountain Platform, which was adopted in 2002 at the \nBishkek Global Mountain Summit, we propose that a \nsecond mountain summit be convened in 2007, with a \nview to taking stock of the international community\u2019s \nactivities relating to sustainable mountain development \nover the past five years. This initiative has already \nreceived support from the United Nations Development \nProgramme Administrator, Kemal Dervish, and the \nDirector-General of UNESCO, Mr. Ko\u00efchiro Matsuura, \nwho proposed that we call the second summit \u201cBishkek \n  \n \n06-53323 40 \n \nPlus Five\u201d. I would like to take this opportunity to \ninvite all States to take part in this important \ninternational forum. We hope the international \ncommunity will support our initiative. \n Commitment to a policy of disarmament and \npreventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction \nis one of the major fundamental principles of the \nforeign policy of the peace-loving Kyrgyz Republic. \nProof of this policy was the signing on 8 September \n2006 in Kazakhstan of an agreement on a nuclear-\nweapon-free zone in Central Asia. We regard this as a \njoint contribution of the States of the region to global \nsecurity and to freeing humankind from the threat of \nlethal weapons. At present, non-nuclear zones are \nbecoming an important element in multilateral \nmechanisms to counter nuclear terrorism. The issue is \nmore timely than ever, bearing in mind the existing \nthreat of the use of weapons of mass destruction by \nterrorist organizations. \n In this connection, from this lofty rostrum of the \nAssembly Hall, I would like to appeal to United \nNations Member States to support the draft resolution \non a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia, which \nwill be put forward at the current session of the \nAssembly\u2019s First Committee. One of the distinguishing \nfeatures of our nuclear-free zone is its environmental \naspect. States in the region have suffered more than \nmost from the negative impact of nuclear programmes \nand testing. Human radiation, radiation of our territory \nand the dangers posed by uranium tailings are proof of \nthis. \n Existing regional environmental problems are \nbeing worsened by global warming, drought and soil \ndegradation. This year the Kyrgyz Republic chairs the \nInternational Fund for Saving the Aral Sea. The \nproblem of the Aral Sea has today taken on the scope \nof a global environmental disaster that, to various \nextents, has influenced natural processes throughout \nthe world. In this connection, we call upon the \ninternational community to consolidate efforts for the \nimplementation of programmes and projects to save the \nAral Sea. \n I would like to express our gratitude to the \nSecretary-General for his comprehensive report on the \nwork of the Organization (document A/61/1). With his \nusual leadership skills, he has clearly set forth in the \nreport the activities of the Organization during 2005. \nWe fully share his view that globalization has become \none of the predominant factors of the last decade. We \nmust see to it that the United Nations strengthens its \npositive aspects. With the active participation of our \nOrganization, globalization must become an instrument \nto ensure sustainable development and reduce the gap \nbetween rich and poor, overcome discrimination in \neconomic relations and enhance the well-being of our \npeoples. \n Unfortunately, along with globalization there has \nbeen an increase in the spread of such threats and \nchallenges as international crime, the illicit trade in \ndrugs and weapons, epidemic disease and \nenvironmental degradation. The Government of \nKyrgyzstan has been taking decisive steps to combat \nthese negative phenomena. They are especially felt in \nour region, bearing in mind the difficult situation in \nAfghanistan. \n I am convinced that effectively countering these \nthreats is possible only on the basis of a worldwide \nexpansion of regional and international cooperation, \ninvolving organizations that have the necessary \ncapacities and that are successfully operating to that \nend at the present time. In this respect, the Kyrgyz \nRepublic is taking an active part in the work of the \nShanghai Cooperation Organization and the Collective \nSecurity Treaty Organization. Today, as President of \nSCO, Kyrgyzstan will do its utmost to strengthen it \nfurther as a reliable guarantor of security and stability \nin the region. \n Speaking last year from this high rostrum, \nPresident Kurmanbek Bakiev of the Kyrgyz Republic \nstated that the sixtieth session of the General Assembly \nmust be remembered as one of reform. Today, we can \nassert that the 60th anniversary session was indeed one \nof reform. We established the Peacebuilding \nCommission and the Human Rights Council and \ncreated the Central Emergency Response Fund. We \nreformed the Secretariat and adopted a Global Counter-\nTerrorism Strategy. \n And yet, a number of key tasks remain to be \ncarried out. The Kyrgyz Republic agrees that there is a \nneed to step up the activities of the General Assembly \nand to strengthen the role of the Economic and Social \nCouncil in attaining critical development goals.  \n United Nations reform will not be complete \nwithout Security Council reform. We advocate \nenhanced efforts to seek solutions in the interests of all \nmembers of the international community. Kyrgyzstan \n \n \n41 06-53323 \n \njoins in the appeal of Member States to expand \npermanent and non-permanent membership of the \nCouncil, which would reflect the realities of our times \nand promote the effectiveness of our work. \n We believe that if the United Nations activities \nare to be consistent and effective, we must keep up \nwith the times and adapt to events as they take place in \nthe course of human development. The United Nations \nmust be oriented towards achieving concrete results \nand meeting the pressing needs of the peoples of our \nplanet. "

        "file_text": "The delegation of \nthe Republic of Sierra Leone would like to \ncongratulate the President on her assumption of the \nresponsibility for directing the work of the sixty-first \nsession of the General Assembly. It is our pleasure to \nreaffirm our confidence in her ability to run the \nAssembly, as well as to pledge our unflinching support \nand cooperation during her tenure. \n Let me also take this opportunity to pay special \ntribute to her predecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, for his \ncommitment and diplomatic skill, which enabled him \neffectively to manage the Assembly and help the \nreform process to achieve some major successes during \nhis presidency.  \n A year ago, the heads of Member States of the \nUnited Nations declared their commitment to the \nreform of the Organization, in order to reflect its \nexperience in the course of 60 years of existence and \nits ever-expanding role within the context of the \nrealities of the current world order. The process has, \nunderstandably, been painfully slow, because of the \nmultiplicity of competing national interests. While my \ndelegation appreciates the progress made so far, \nparticularly in the form of the establishment of the \nHuman Rights Council and the Peacebuilding \nCommission, we are unhappy about the sluggish pace \nof Security Council reform, a matter that is close to the \nheart of Africa.  \n As a Member State deeply committed to the \nAfrican position on United Nations reform, my \ndelegation would like to urge the reform of the \nSecurity Council to move faster so that our continent \ncan take its rightful place in the United Nations organ \nthat is responsible for the maintenance of international \npeace and security. Obviously, the Security Council \ncan never be the just, democratic and representative \nbody that it should be if Africa, with 53 Member States \nin the United Nations, does not have permanent \nrepresentation proportional to its size. \n As a least developed country (LDC) emerging \nfrom a devastating conflict, we are also concerned that \ndevelopment has not been treated with the prominence \nand urgency it deserves in the reform process, \nconsidering its cause-and-effect relationship with \nconflict and human rights. That relationship was \nsuccinctly recognized in one of the outcomes of last \nyear\u2019s High-level Plenary Meeting of the General \nAssembly, which stated that our nations and peoples \ncould not enjoy development without security, nor \nwould they enjoy security in the absence of \ndevelopment, and they would not enjoy either without \nrespect for human rights. The need, therefore, to \nsupport development programmes \u2014 including the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the New \nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development \u2014 as the \nfoundation for peace and security cannot be \noveremphasized. \n We are particularly happy about the establishment \nof the Human Rights Council, whose operation, we \nhope, will be above the weaknesses that demoralized \nthe former Human Rights Commission. We call on all \nMember States, in particular the Council\u2019s founding \nmembers, to set and maintain standards that will justify \nthe optimism that the new Council will refrain from \npractices that discredited the Human Rights \nCommission. \n Of particular interest to us as a post-conflict \ncountry, however, is the Peacebuilding Commission, \nwhose mandate is to support the recovery of societies \nemerging from conflict. We thank the Commission for \nchoosing Sierra Leone as one of two countries where it \nwill begin operation. We assure the Commission of our \nfullest support and cooperation. As it will soon \ndiscover, if it has not yet done so, we have already \nembarked on the path of peacebuilding and \nconsolidation, having carefully formulated policies and \nactivities aimed at achieving lasting peace, security and \nstability, which are the critical requirements for \nmeaningful development. \n We have developed a poverty reduction strategy \npaper that has attracted support from a number of \ndonor agencies and friendly countries. We have \nproduced a peace-consolidation strategy paper, which \nis to be presented to the Peacebuilding Commission for \nsupport in addressing some of the challenges facing \nour country in the areas of governance and security \nprior to the forthcoming presidential and parliamentary \nelections in 2007. \n For the Peacebuilding Commission to be able to \nwork in Sierra Leone on the basis of concrete, first-\nhand information, we have extended an invitation to \nthe Commission to visit Sierra Leone. We are looking \nforward to receiving the Commission in Sierra Leone. \n The United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone \ncompleted its peacekeeping mandate and closed down \nat the end of 2005. But the United Nations did not \n  \n \n06-53005 24 \n \nleave behind a complete vacuum, it left the United \nNations Integrated Office for Sierra Leone (UNIOSIL) \nto support our post-conflict recovery programme. We \nthank the United Nations for its continued support and \nassure the Organization that its contribution will not be \nin vain. We have no doubt that the combined efforts of \nthe Peacebuilding Commission, UNIOSIL and the \nGovernment will achieve the desired objective of \npeace, security and development in the country. \n The people of Sierra Leone are proud of their role \nin resolving their own conflict, as well as of their \nsuccesses in the democratic process. We had a highly \nsuccessful democratic election in 2002, barely five \nmonths after the end of the conflict. That was followed \nby local government elections as part of a governance \ndecentralization process. Our second post-conflict \npresidential and parliamentary elections, which will \nmark a transition in leadership, are scheduled to be \nheld around this time next year. Sierra Leone cannot \nafford having that watershed election go wrong, but we \nneed assistance to carry it out properly. I therefore \nappeal to the United Nations, the European Union, \nother members of the international community and our \nbilateral friends to continue to help us, both financially \nand technically, to make the elections another \nmilestone achievement in Sierra Leone\u2019s peace and \ndemocracy processes. \n The people of Sierra Leone are conscious of the \nfact that the peace they now enjoy is a product of the \nsupport of, and cooperation with, the United Nations \nand the international community. At this stage in our \nhistory, the country is faced with three sets of \nchallenges as a nation: we must rectify the \naccumulated errors of past policies; we must repair the \ndamage and heal the scars left by the conflict; and we \nmust chart an appropriate path for the development of \nour small country in the twenty-first century. We have \nthe natural resources to be able to do that. With time, \nour human resources will also measure up. Above all, \nat this time we need the sustained engagement of \ninternational partners. That is why we are seeking to \nexpand and reinforce our partnerships with the external \nworld \u2014 partnerships that can support us now, and \nremain with us as we pursue a longer-term agenda for \nsustainable development. \n Finally, we are in a conflict-ridden region and the \npeace in Sierra Leone cannot be sustained in isolation. \nWe therefore urge the United Nations to continue its \nefforts to pursue durable peace in the West African \nsubregion.

        "file_text": "First, on \nbehalf of our delegation, I warmly congratulate the \nPresident on her election to preside over this session, \nwhich encourages the Government of Togo in its \ncommitment to value the role of women in our society. \nTogo remains convinced that the specific insights of \nwomen in the management of national or international \naffairs will make a big contribution to giving a more \nunited and human face to relations between peoples \nand nations. The President can rest assured that as she \ndoes her inspiring job Togo will continue to support \nher unstintingly.  \n I also pay a merited tribute to the President\u2019s \npredecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, whose competence, \nmoderation, sense of compromise and character earned \nhim the respect and esteem of all during the last \nsession.  \n In addition, I pay particular tribute to the \nSecretary-General, and express to him our sincere \ngratitude for his tireless efforts for peace, democracy \nand development. We appreciate his commitment and \nhis bold proposals to ensure substantial and fair reform \nof the United Nations. \n In our quest for peace, security and socio-\neconomic development Togo has just reached a critical \nstage in its history, with the signing on 20 August of \nthe Comprehensive Political Agreement at the end of \nan open, constructive and inclusive dialogue. When the \nHead of State took the initiative to resume the political \ndialogue we were aware that our current stage of social \nand political development would not allow us to deal \nwith all matters of discord or eliminate all political and \ninstitutional problems. It was necessary first to \nstrengthen the dynamic of national mobilization and \nsocial cohesion by promoting a policy of openness, \ncalm and national reconciliation.  \n The desired results have largely been achieved, \nwith the effective and active participation of all the \nmajor political participants in the dialogue. Everyone \nwas able to speak freely on the substantive problems \nthat were feeding the persistent feeling of crisis. The \nfrank and responsible discussions, and the conclusions \nreached, enable us to establish bolder conditions for \nreform and lay the foundations for a new covenant for \nthe republic and for national harmony.  \n The conclusions of the national dialogue favour \nthe holding of free and democratic elections. \nAdditionally, the resolution of the dialogue regarding \nthe need to re-examine the role and mission of the \narmy and the other security services allows us to \nanticipate an unprecedented strengthening of measures \nto maintain public order and provide more security for \nthe activities of political parties and various other \norganizations, as well as the electoral processes.  \n After the social dialogue \u2014 involving employers, \nunions and the Government, and a number of bold \nmeasures aimed at youth and workers of all \ncategories \u2014 a milestone will be reached with the \nholding of free legislative elections, pluralist and \ntransparent, in the very near future. Togo will then \nhave satisfied all the commitments made to the \nEuropean Union on 14 April 2004 in Brussels.  \n In an attempt to give every opportunity for \nnational harmony, implement the conclusions of the \npolitical dialogue and establish sustainable democracy, \na broad-based Government of National Unity was \nestablished on 20 September 2006. All sections of the \nTogolese people, in their political, social and regional \ndiversity, are represented in it. All the changes under \nway in Togolese society were made possible by the \nsupport of the international community, the maturity of \nthe people of Togo and, of course, the sense of \ncompromise of the political class.  \n We are very grateful to all our international \npartners who assisted us during this process of \npeacebuilding in our country. Our appreciation goes in \nparticular to the Economic Community of West African \nStates (ECOWAS), the African Union, the European \n  \n \n06-53609 24 \n \nUnion, the International Organization of la \nFrancophonie, France, Germany, the United States of \nAmerica and all African heads of State, who have \nalways been very attentive to what we have had to say. \nI wish also, and very particularly, to express to the \nFacilitator, Mr. Blaise Compaor\u00e9, President of Burkina \nFaso, the gratitude of our entire Government and \npeople for his critical role in the conclusion and \nsigning of the Comprehensive Political Agreement. \n Consolidating peace in Togo and the success of \nour democratization process remain closely linked to \nthe stability of the regional and international \nenvironment. Therefore, Togo continues to be \nconcerned about the situation in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. Given \nthe many preconditions for organizing elections in that \nneighbouring country, there must be concern, from any \npoint of view, about the fulfilment of the mission for \nwhich the United Nations is responsible. We hope that \nthe resolution of those preconditions will permit the \nholding of free and democratic elections leading \nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire to sustainable peace.  \n Similarly, with regard to the region of Darfur and \nSomalia, in the absence of a much more vigorous \nvoluntary mobilization by the international community \nto end the cycle of violence and the tragedy of the \npeoples concerned, peace will not come soon to that \npart of Africa. \n In other parts of the world, the continuing \ndevelopments in both Iraq and the Middle East are a \nmajor source of concern for the Government of Togo. \nTogo firmly believes it is high time that the people of \nIraq were reconciled and that the international \ncommunity provided all the necessary support for their \nGovernment to help it complete the reconciliation \nprocess. It should be emphasized that the countries of \nthe subregion have an important role to play in the \nquest for peace in Iraq. \n The tragedy that unfolded in Lebanon weighs on \nour conscience. Togo welcomes the Security Council\u2019s \nadoption of resolution 1701 (2006), whose effective \nimplementation will permit the return of peace to the \ncountry.  \n At the heart of the Middle East conflict is the \nthorny question of Palestine. Sustainable peace in the \nregion requires an end to the continuous cycle of \nviolence and a climate of confidence, which would \nmake possible talks to create a Palestinian State \nalongside the State of Israel, the two of them \ncoexisting within secure and internationally recognized \nborders. \n While the resolution of crises and conflicts \nremains at the heart of our concerns, everything must \nbe done to consolidate peace in countries emerging \nfrom conflicts, or countries which, after great efforts, \nhave succeeded in their democratization process. \nTherefore, the Peacebuilding Commission must play a \nvital role in African countries emerging from conflicts. \nWe are pleased that it is already considering the \nsituation in Burundi and Sierra Leone. It must also help \nLiberia to strengthen its regained peace and make sure \nthat Guinea-Bissau does not sink into violence. \nSimilarly, while we welcome the holding of legislative \nand presidential elections in the Democratic Republic \nof the Congo, Togo calls on the international \ncommunity to pay sustained attention to that country so \nas to assist it until its still fragile process is completed. \n Disarmament efforts by the international \ncommunity are still far from producing the desired \nresults. On the Korean peninsula the nuclear question \nis still unresolved, and there is a need for a \nstrengthening of mutual confidence among the States \nconcerned. Therefore, my country firmly supports \nevery effort to resolve the region\u2019s security questions \npeacefully. We believe also that the question of the \nnuclear programme of the Islamic Republic of Iran \ncannot be resolved without negotiations between the \ninterested parties, and we call on them to create \nconditions conducive to such talks. It would not be \nwise to stop the country, by whatever means, \ndeveloping a nuclear programme, essentially peaceful, \nfor its fundamental research needs and the socio-\neconomic development of its population. \n With respect to small arms and light weapons, \nTogo regrets that the international community was \nunable to successfully conclude the July 2006 New \nYork United Nations Conference to Review Progress \nMade in the Implementation of the Programme of \nAction to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit \nTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its \nAspects, adopted in 2001. The failure of that \nConference is not encouraging for regional and \nsubregional initiatives. At the same time, the adoption \nin June this year of the ECOWAS Convention on Small \nArms and Light Weapons, Their Ammunition and \nOther Related Materials is very much part of \nstrengthening confidence-building measures among \nStates in the subregion. It is to be hoped that at this \n \n \n25 06-53609 \n \nsession the General Assembly will seriously examine \nthe question of the proliferation of small arms and light \nweapons, which are a destabilizing factor for African \nStates in particular, and a threat to the peace and \nsecurity of people in general.  \n I should also like to emphasize the importance of \nour collective responsibility to counter terrorism and \nhuman rights violations. The reply of the international \ncommunity to terrorism should be appropriate and \nshould correspond to the expectations of peoples who \nonly wish to live in a world free from fear. The General \nAssembly\u2019s adoption of the Global Counter-Terrorism \nStrategy is to be welcomed. We hope that the Human \nRights Council will contribute to strengthening the \ncapacity of States to promote and protect human rights \nby developing and implementing appropriate strategies \nand programmes. Accordingly, on 10 July the \nGovernment concluded an agreement on establishing \nan office of the United Nations High Commissioner for \nHuman Rights in Togo.  \n The current state of the world \u2014 characterized by \na considerable increase in United Nations membership, \nfrom 51 Member States in 1945 to 192 in 2006, the \nemergence of new Powers, the persistence of certain \nconflicts and especially the frequent paralysis in the \nSecurity Council \u2014 requires that the United Nations be \nreformed as soon as possible, as the September 2005 \nWorld Summit recommended. While the objective of \nreform is to make the Organization more effective and \nefficient, we must not lose sight of the fact that a \ncentral, urgent factor is Security Council reform. If that \nis not included, the reform will be unfinished business. \n Decisions related to economic development and \nthe elimination of poverty adopted by the September \n2005 World Summit have rekindled hope about the will \nof the rich industrialized countries to assist the \ncountries of the South to promote sustainable \ndevelopment for their peoples. Implementation of the \ncommitments made would permit achievement of the \ngoals. Therefore, the countries of the South ask the \ncountries of the North to commit themselves not only \nto keep their promises to make a genuine contribution \nto reducing poverty by 50 per cent by 2015, but finally \nto eradicate it.  \n As the Assembly is well aware, the support of the \nrich industrialized countries will enable us to \nconsolidate the efforts that the countries of the South \ncontinue to make, efforts which have allowed us to \nimprove macroeconomic management by tackling \ninflation and consolidating a balanced budget. \nHowever, the global incidence of extreme poverty has \nnot declined, especially in the less developed countries, \nwhere combating poverty is still a very difficult task. \n The situation that I have just described is \nexacerbated by factors that the developing countries \nhave not been able to master. They include, to mention \njust a few: the external debt, deterioration in the terms \nof trade, the weakness of official development \nassistance, and environmental degradation. Moreover, \nthe HIV/AIDS pandemic presents a major challenge to \ngrowth and economic development. Major conferences \norganized under United Nations auspices are slow to \nyield results. The status review of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, held in September 2005, and the \nfailure of the Doha Round and the midterm review of \nthe Brussels Programme of Action for Least Developed \nCountries for the Decade 2001-2010, held on 18 and \n19 September, have shown that there are still barriers \nto implementing the commitments made. \n It is therefore regrettable that development \npartners have not always honoured their official \ndevelopment commitments to the least developed \ncountries. Nevertheless, promises made recently, in \nparticular by the G-8 Summit in 2005, regarding an \nincrease in assistance and debt relief, have given us \nreason for some optimism. Additionally, access to \nmarkets and the gradual elimination of agricultural \nsubsidies by all countries simultaneously, on dates set \nby the World Trade Organization, would contribute to \nthe development of poor countries, since agriculture is \nthe basis of the existence of hundreds of millions of \npeople in the least developed countries. For Togo it is \nessential that progress be made in resolving questions \nrelating to cotton, in particular, questions that remain \nvital for many developing countries. \n My country welcomes the High-level Dialogue on \nInternational Migration and Development, held on 14 \nand 15 September, during which the General Assembly \ndealt with the multiple aspects of international \nmigration. We must do more in-depth thinking on ways \nto stem the tide of the massive and hazardous exodus \nto northern countries. An arsenal of repressive \nmeasures alone will not resolve a situation that is \nbecoming more and more like a scourge.  \n In conclusion, I emphasize that if we are faithful \nto our common destiny and our worldwide partnership \n  \n \n06-53609 26 \n \nbased on solidarity we can realize the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. Therefore, the countries of both \nthe North and the South must honour their \ncommitments, thus contributing to ending the suffering \nof millions of disinherited people throughout the world \nand to promoting international peace and security.

        "file_text": "First of all, I wish to \ncongratulate Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-first session. We are convinced that her vast \nexperience in international relations and able \nleadership will lead this session to a successful \nconclusion.  \n I would also like to pay tribute to her \npredecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, who led the last session \nof the General Assembly most ably and successfully. \n I would also like to take this opportunity to \nexpress our deep appreciation to Secretary-General \nKofi Annan, whose stewardship of this Organization \nover the past 10 years has brought many positive and \nremarkable changes to the world body. His tireless and \ndedicated service to the international community will \nbe indelibly etched in our collective memory. \n The reform of the United Nations to meet the new \nchallenges of our times is an ongoing process that \nneeds to be assessed continuously. While we have \nachieved tangible progress in some areas, such as the \nestablishment of the Human Rights Council and the \nPeacebuilding Commission, progress has yet to be \nmade in other areas. The success of the reform of the \nUnited Nations must be judged in terms of its effective \nresponse to the contemporary needs of Member States, \nin particular those of the developing countries, which \nform the majority of the membership. While many \nStates, including the developing countries, struggle to \nprotect and advance the principles and practices of \nmultilateralism, the tendency towards unilateralism \nremains strong. That unhealthy tendency can in no way \ngain ascendancy if the United Nations is to remain \nviable. \n Attempts by some strong and powerful States to \nimpose their will on developing countries in pursuit of \ntheir political agenda create an environment of hostility \nin the international community. To our dismay and \nfrustration, there has been glaring abuse of the mandate \n  \n \n06-53615 10 \n \nentrusted to the Security Council by Member States by \nunjustly placing the situation of my country on the \nagenda of the Security Council and by alleging that it \nposes a threat to regional peace and security. Nothing \ncould be further from the truth. Myanmar has done \nnothing that can undermine the peace and security of \nany country, let alone regional or international peace \nand security. Myanmar has close and cordial relations \nwith all its five neighbours and other countries in the \nregion. \n The founders of the United Nations did not intend \nthe world body to become a forum in which some \nMembers with political and economic clout could gang \nup against a Member State and label it as what it is not. \nWe therefore urge all Member States to resist attempts \nby those powerful States to influence the Security \nCouncil to take action against a Member State that in \nno way poses any threat to international peace and \nsecurity. \n Regarding Security Council reform, Myanmar is \nin favour of the expansion of the Security Council in \nboth the permanent and non-permanent categories. The \nexpanded Security Council must also reflect today\u2019s \npolitical and economic realities. However, the fact that \nwe have not made substantial progress on the \nexpansion of the Council demonstrates the sensitive \nand complex nature of the issue. It is extremely \nimportant that this issue not become divisive among \nthe United Nations membership. Dialogue and \nconsultations must continue to seek a solution \nacceptable to the overwhelming majority of the \nmembership. \n It is encouraging that the first session of the \nHuman Rights Council was successfully held in \nGeneva in June and that the Council is now working in \nfull swing to quickly become an effectively functioning \nhuman rights body. Myanmar\u2019s active participation at \nthe highest level in that session is a reflection of our \ncommitment to further strengthening the United \nNations human rights machinery.  \n It is, however, important that the principle of \nimpartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity be \nscrupulously observed in the work of the Council. \nAlthough we want the Council to become an effective \ntool in the strengthening of the United Nations human \nrights machinery, we are not giving it carte blanche. It \nis through the observation of the aforementioned \nprinciples \u2014 through dialogue, cooperation and non-\npoliticization of human rights issues \u2014 that the \nCouncil is to function. It is incumbent not only on the \nmembers of the Council, but also on all of us, to ensure \nthat the Council does not deviate from the direction in \nwhich we expect it to head. \n Terrorism continues to defy the attempts of the \ninternational community to eliminate it, raising its ugly \nhead again in Mumbai and elsewhere very recently. We \nare of the view that it is only through the involvement \nof every community of people that we can be \nforewarned in time of the impending onslaught of \nterrorist acts. Myanmar fully supports the international \nefforts to eliminate terrorism.  \n A daunting challenge facing the international \ncommunity is the horrendous crime of human \ntrafficking, which the Secretary-General aptly refers to \nas one of the most reprehensible violations of human \nrights. Despite the efforts of the international \ncommunity to tackle that issue over the past decade, it \ncontinues to grow, with serious national and \ninternational implications for the Governments \nconcerned. Human trafficking is a serious international \nissue and we believe that it requires a coordinated and \ncooperative response by the entire international \ncommunity to address the issue. \n Myanmar is a State party to the United Nations \nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime and \nits supplementary Protocols to Prevent, Suppress and \nPunish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and \nChildren and against the Smuggling of Migrants by \nLand, Sea and Air. I would like to stress that Myanmar \nregards combating trafficking in persons as a national \ntask. We are making relentless efforts in that regard. \n Myanmar has designated HIV/AIDS, malaria and \ntuberculosis as diseases of national concern. In 1989, \nwe set up a high-level multisectoral national AIDS \ncommittee. We have been cooperating with the United \nNations and, in 2001, our national AIDS programme \nand the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS \n(UNAIDS) drew up a joint programme of action \ncovering education, prevention, cure and rehabilitation \nto effectively address the challenge. As a result, we \nhave been able not only to level the HIV/AIDS \ninfection rate, but to reduce it. We are also serving on \nthe UNAIDS Programme Coordinating Board, enabling \nus to address the issue at both the national and \ninternational levels. \n \n \n11 06-53615 \n \n Narcotic drugs continue to be one of the threats \nfacing us today. As the Government of Myanmar \nregards the eradication of narcotic drugs as a national \nresponsibility, it has striven relentlessly to eradicate \nsuch drugs by 2014. Our determined efforts on all \nfronts have resulted in a substantial decrease in opium \nproduction. I would like to reiterate here that Myanmar \nwill step up its efforts, in close cooperation with \nfriendly countries and international organizations, until \nwe achieve our goal. \n Cooperation with the United Nations is a \ncornerstone of Myanmar\u2019s foreign policy. Our track \nrecord has proven that Myanmar has invariably \nextended its cooperation to the United Nations. \nMyanmar has been implementing a national \ndevelopment plan with the aim of accelerating growth, \nachieving equitable and balanced development, and \nreducing the socio-economic development gap between \nrural and urban areas of the country. The national \ndevelopment plan addresses the major aspects of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). We have \nmade significant progress towards achieving the MDGs \nby 2015, particularly in such areas as health, education, \nsustainable access to safe drinking water, and access to \nimproved sanitation. In implementing the MDGs, we \nare primarily relying on our national resources. In that \nregard, we are also receiving valuable assistance and \ncooperation from the United Nations agencies \nconcerned. \n Finally, I wish to apprise the Assembly of the \npolitical developments in my country. We have been \nsteadfastly implementing the seven-step road map for \ntransition to democracy, announced in August 2003. \nThe National Convention, which was adjourned on \n31 January 2006, will resume its session on 10 October \nand continue to discuss the basic principles for the \ndrafting of an enduring constitution. I wish to stress \nthat the process of transforming the country into a \ndemocratic State will move ahead systematically in \naccordance with the road map. \n Before concluding, I would like to reaffirm our \ncommitment to working together in upholding the \nprinciples enunciated in the Charter of the United \nNations and in strengthening the role of the United \nNations to respond to the challenges of the twenty-first \ncentury.

He \nlived in exile in my country for some years and built a \nnew life for his family. \n But when Afghanistan was liberated from the \nTaliban in the wake of 9/11, Mr. Taniwal returned to \nhelp rebuild his homeland. He worked for the \nbetterment of his fellow Afghans by adopting a \nforward-looking model of public administration, far \nremoved from the Taliban narrative of rule by fear. For \nhis trouble, the Taliban had him killed. His nephew \ndied alongside him. A few days later, compounding \natrocity upon atrocity, a second suicide bomber \nattacked Mr. Taniwal\u2019s funeral ceremony, killing and \ninjuring many more people. \n The task of rebuilding Afghanistan, in the face of \nsuch atrocities, is demanding great sacrifices on the \npart of tens of thousands of brave men and women. It \nis a country in which many of the great challenges of \nour time intersect: how to free its cities, towns and \nvillages from the daily threat of violence; how to \nensure that an extremist ideology never again \nsubjugates the country\u2019s institutions; and how to create \nthe conditions for stability and good governance so \nnecessary to economic renewal and so crucial if its \npeople are to escape poverty and oppression. \n Afghanistan represents a fundamental test for \neach of us. If we are not resolute and steadfast in \nsupporting Afghanistan against the scourge of \nterrorism, and if we are not prepared collectively to \nstand up against the extremists, we will deliver to \ncoming generations a weak international system and a \nfar less secure and stable world. \n Iraq is another of the front lines in this battle. I \nacknowledge here the divided views of United Nations \nMember States over the military action against the \nregime of Saddam Hussein in 2003, yet today there is a \nvery clear choice that should unite us all. \n The extremists have chosen to make Iraq a \nbattleground. Osama bin Laden has said that Iraq is \n\u201cfor you or for us to win\u201d. We know what will come of \nIraq if it is won by the extremists. As in Afghanistan, \nwe must all commit to securing its future. Iraq is not \nAmerica\u2019s burden alone, and Afghanistan is not \nNATO\u2019s burden alone, because if terrorism prevailed, \nthe consequences would be catastrophic for each of us, \nwherever we may live. \n This struggle will be protracted. Our challenge is \nnot just to keep our citizens safe from terrorist attack; \nit is also to defeat an ideology that allows for no ideas \nor belief systems other than its own. It is imperative we \nsee this ideology clearly for what it is: a mindset every \nbit as brutal and uncompromising as its totalitarian \npredecessors in centuries past. It is an ideology that \n  \n \n06-53005 34 \n \ndirectly challenges the principles and values of \nmodernity \u2014 the flourishing of open markets, open \nsocieties and open minds. To defeat this evil, we must \nharness the collective strength of the international \ncommunity. \n I welcome the recent agreement on the United \nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, but I am \ndisappointed that the Strategy\u2019s illustrative list of \nconditions conducive to the spread of terrorism did not \ninclude extremist ideologies. \n Ms. Grabar-Kitarovic (Croatia), Vice-President, \ntook the Chair. \n We need to do much more. States should \nconclude a comprehensive convention on international \nterrorism. That would demonstrate an unambiguous \ncommitment, ensuring that all terrorist acts are \ncriminalized in international law. It is disappointing \nthat the United Nations still cannot agree on the scope \nof such a convention. \n More disturbingly, some countries continue to \nsponsor terrorist groups to promote their own political \nagendas. In the Middle East, it is essential that all \ncountries, including Iran and Syria, use their influence \nover organizations such as Hezbollah to stop terrorist \nassaults, including those directed at the State of Israel. \nAny viable resolution of the conflict must include \nHezbollah\u2019s disarmament, its renunciation of violence \nand a recognition of Israel\u2019s right to exist in peace. \n In all of this, the United Nations has a role to \nplay. But, as I have said before in this Hall, the United \nNations is not the answer to all the problems of the \nworld. Where the United Nations cannot act, individual \nStates must. Our membership in the United Nations \ndoes not absolve any of us from the responsibility to \nshow leadership and to pursue practical solutions. \n Too often in the world of politics, the temptation \nis for Governments to strike an attitude and then leave \nthe substantive action for another day, or to offload the \nresponsibility onto others. We can make solemn \npledges \u2014 as we should, and we do \u2014 to work much \nharder to assist developing nations in confronting the \nravages of poverty and disease. We can sign high-\nminded manifestos to protect our environment from the \nrisk of climate change. Alongside global security, these \nare two issues crucial to our collective future. But so \nmuch of the talk is mere artifice unless backed up by \nresolute, practical and well-constructed policy \nresponses. \n In Australia\u2019s region, practical and effective \ncooperation has exemplified the counter-terrorism \nresponse. A regional training centre jointly established \nby Indonesia and Australia is helping South-East Asian \nlaw enforcement agencies develop the capabilities they \nneed to destroy terrorist networks. Other recent \ninitiatives, such as interfaith dialogues, are promoting \ntolerance and mutual understanding. \n Practical and effective cooperation has also been \nthe hallmark of our commitment to East Timor. \nAustralian Defence Force personnel and police worked \nwith their counterparts from New Zealand, Malaysia \nand Portugal to restore order after the April riots. We \nremain ready to continue to provide a significant \n\u201cgreen helmet\u201d military contingent in East Timor to \ncomplement the United Nations police force mandated \nunder Security Council resolution 1704 (2006). \n Elsewhere in our region, Australia has joined in a \npartnership with 14 other Pacific countries in a \nRegional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands \n(RAMSI). RAMSI is not just about restoring law and \norder; some 150 advisers are working with the \nSolomon Islands Government, helping to stabilize \nfinances, revitalize the public service and strengthen \nthe justice and prison systems. None of these tasks is \neasy, and much more remains to be done, but the hard \nwork has begun, and we are making headway. \n In contrast, the tragedy of Darfur poses a \ngrievous challenge to the international community. \nDarfur is a litmus test of the responsibility of the \nUnited Nations to help people who desperately need its \nprotection. It is a test of the most basic principles of \ncivilization. We all know this. We also know it is a test \nthat, so far, the United Nations has failed. \n In this Hall last year, we assumed a solemn \nresponsibility to protect those who have no means of \nprotecting themselves. The United Nations itself must \nnow redouble its efforts to try to prevent any further \nbloodshed in Darfur, which has already claimed well in \nexcess of 200,000 lives and brought about the \ndisplacement of millions of persons. The United \nNations must keep its promise to the people of Darfur. \nIt is no less than they should expect and no less than \nwe would demand. \n \n \n35 06-53005 \n \n The desperation of Darfur reminds us also of the \nimmense challenges of development. Members of the \nUnited Nations have recognized this through the \nMillennium Development Goals. Aid is important, and \nlast year Australia committed itself to doubling our \nannual aid budget to about $4 billion a year by 2010. \nAustralia has recently sharpened the focus of our \ndevelopment assistance programme on supporting good \ngovernance, basic social services and security in \ndeveloping countries. In the South Pacific, we will \nsponsor new programmes to train people in technical \nand entrepreneurial skills.  \n But increasing aid and reducing debt burdens \nalone will not reduce poverty. Economic growth is \ncentral to poverty alleviation. The World Bank \nestimates that the number of people living on less than \n$2 a day in East Asia fell by around 280 million \nbetween 2001 and 2005. The policies and actions of \ndeveloping countries in creating an enabling \nenvironment for economic growth are fundamental to \nadvances on this front. Likewise, free and open trade \nand investment are pivotal. The failure of the Doha \nRound of multilateral trade talks would be a cruel \nrebuff to the world\u2019s poor. The World Bank estimates \nthat a strong outcome of the Round could lift an \nadditional 32 million people out of poverty by 2015. \n We cannot underpin sustainable economic \ndevelopment without protecting the environment on \nwhich we depend. Biodiversity loss, land clearing, \ndeforestation and climate change present threats to the \ncommon good that can best be overcome through \ncollective action. \n But collective action entails much more than \nadopting resolutions and signing treaties. Fine words \nand high aspirations may give us a sense that we are \nacting to stop environmental degradation, but they are \nof little benefit unless backed by practical action. \nDomestic implementation of environmental \ncommitments has not been sufficient, and the gap \nbetween words and action remains too wide. \n Climate change is an area where we must move \nbeyond blind faith in a single multilateral approach. \nThe great challenge is to address climate change \nwithout jeopardizing economic growth, particularly in \ndeveloping countries. We need to work towards a more \ninclusive and effective international approach to \nclimate change. The existing efforts are not enough; we \nneed to bring forward new ideas, not constrained by \nideology.  \n The focus of the Asia-Pacific Partnership on \nClean Development and Climate is the development \nand transfer of cleaner energy-generating technologies. \nThe Partnership brings together Australia, the United \nStates, Japan, China, India and the Republic of Korea. \nTogether, those countries account for about half of the \nworld\u2019s gross domestic product, population, energy use \nand greenhouse gas emissions. The aim of the \nPartnership is to bring developed and developing \ncountries together with the private sector to deploy \ntechnologies \u2014 be they renewable energy or carbon \nstorage \u2014 to help reduce the dangers of climate \nchange, while not stalling economic growth and \ndevelopment. \n Effective international action on the great global \nchallenges of our time requires more than resolutions \nat the United Nations. It requires the exercise of strong \nleadership by individual nations. It requires proactive \npolicy, not political posturing or personal abuse from \nthis rostrum. It requires a rigorous search for sound and \npractical long-term solutions. \n As Members of the United Nations, we have \npledged to unite our strengths to maintain international \npeace and security. But, equally, we cannot abrogate to \nthe United Nations the responsibility that we have, as \nindividual States, for security and good governance \nwithin our borders and within our regions. History will \njudge us harshly if we do not shoulder that \nresponsibility. "

        "file_text": "Five years after the \ndestruction of the Twin Towers and just a few days \nafter the commemoration of that terrible tragedy, I \nwould like to extend my deepest sympathy to the \npeople of this great city, which serves as mankind\u2019s \nmeeting point. \n Last year, I stressed our collective responsibility \nto protect tolerance from intolerance. I spoke of \nfreedom of expression and freedom of religion. Today I \nshould like to revisit that theme. But, in addition, I will \ndiscuss the relationship between fighting terrorism and \nrespecting human rights, the search for peace in the \nMiddle East and reform of the United Nations. \nMoreover, I will renew my call for intensified \ndialogue. Only dialogue at all levels of society leads to \nmore knowledge about one another \u2014 and often to \nmore mutual understanding. \n The threat of terrorism has not subsided. To fully \nunderstand the nature of the challenge we face, we \nhave to ask ourselves what terrorists are aiming for. \nThey aspire to undermine a society based on \ndemocracy, fundamental freedoms, human rights and \nthe quest for progress. In their view, there is no place \nfor the principles and tenets of our free society. \nInstead, they try by means of terror and violence to \nimpose their views of the world on others. \n As to the means used by terrorists, there can be \nno doubt that large-scale and systematic terrorist acts \nqualify as crimes against humanity under international \nlaw. While civilized societies uphold international legal \nand moral standards in defending themselves, terrorists \ncompletely reject the central principles of international \nlaw. Our campaign against this threat must be fought \nwith great determination by all of us. Indiscriminate \nviolence must be countered by the collective will to \ndefend our values, in order to protect our civilization \nand human dignity. \n In order for this campaign to be successful in the \nlong run, we must also place great emphasis on \ndevelopment, fair trade and dialogue. Unlike those who \nhave prospects for a better life through access to \neducation and jobs, people without prospects and \nwithout a voice are more easily lured by the siren call \nof hatred. To deal with that issue is one of the core \nmissions of the United Nations. We \u2014 all nations of \nthe United Nations \u2014 have a collective responsibility \nto give people a future and a voice so that they can \nimprove their lives. \n Extremists cleverly seek to exploit the freedom of \nopen societies with the aim of destroying that very \nfreedom. This confronts us with a dilemma: do we \nclose our societies in self-defence, thus becoming more \nlike the evil we face, or do we remain open societies \nand accept a certain degree of vulnerability? Anti-\nterrorism measures can be effective only if adopted \nwithin the context of the human rights commitments \nwe have undertaken. Ultimately, our defence should \nnot come at the expense of the very values upon which \nour societies are founded. Our citizens must be able to \ndistinguish between the societies in which they lead \nproductive lives and the terrorist movements for which \nhuman life has little value. I am happy with the \nagreement we reached on the United Nations Global \nCounter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288). But \nnow, we must see to its implementation. It is also in \nour collective interest to conclude a terrorism \nconvention as well. \n The need for interfaith and intercultural dialogue \nis as great as ever. During and after the so-called \ncartoon crisis, I engaged in discussions with colleagues \nand the media in Asia and the Middle East. We talked \nabout freedom of expression and freedom of religion, \nand I discovered that such personal efforts are crucial \nin finding common ground. One of the initiatives we \nhave taken is to host the annual Asia-Europe Meeting \nconference on interfaith dialogue in Amsterdam in \n2008. \n For any interfaith dialogue to be meaningful, \nrespect for diversity is a precondition. In our view, all \nof the world\u2019s nationalities, religions and beliefs \nshould live side by side, united by a tradition of \npluralism, democracy and the rule of law. According to \ninternational instruments to which we all subscribe, \nrespect for diversity means, for example, freedom of \nreligion and belief. That includes the freedom to adhere \nto any religion, or to no religion at all. In my country \n\u2014 and in many others as well \u2014 an individual is free \nto be a Christian, Muslim, Jew or Hindu or to adhere to \nany other belief. This philosophy includes the right to \nchange one\u2019s belief, as the Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights clearly states. \n  \n \n06-53005 32 \n \n We believe that the separation of Church and \nState and the independence of the courts are the best \nguarantees that nobody has the power to impose his or \nher beliefs on others. Freedom of religion and freedom \nof expression are two sides of the same coin. Does this \nmean that people can say whatever they want? No. The \nright to free speech does not entitle a person to insult \nothers. But restrictions on the freedom of expression \nmust never go further than what is necessary within a \ndemocratic society. In individual cases where freedom \nof expression conflicts with legitimate restrictions, it is \nup to the courts, not the Government, to decide which \nprinciple should prevail. \n Peace in the Middle East would reinforce a global \nspirit of dialogue. We have reason to be optimistic. \nSecurity Council resolution 1701 (2006) ended \nhostilities between Hizbollah and Israel, unfortunately \nonly after many innocent civilians had lost their lives. I \ncommend the Secretary-General for his tireless efforts \nto promote the resolution\u2019s effective implementation. \n The renewed United Nations Interim Force in \nLebanon (UNIFIL) is an important symbol of hope. \nPeacekeepers of different religious and cultural \nbackgrounds are working together under the sky-blue \nbanner of the United Nations, as they have been doing \nin the Great Lakes region in Africa and will hopefully \nsoon be doing in Darfur, the Sudan. I am proud of the \nfact that several States members of the European \nUnion, together with Turkey, China and Indonesia, \nprovide the backbone of UNIFIL. The Netherlands is \nactively considering contributing to UNIFIL\u2019s maritime \ncomponent. Practical implementation will depend on \nthe cooperation of all parties and countries in the \nregion, and beyond, including Syria and Iran. I call \nupon them to act in accordance with Security Council \nresolution 1701 (2006). \n Regional peace also requires resolution of the \nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict and the Israeli-Syrian \ndispute. I call upon all parties involved to seize the \npolitical momentum created by Council resolution \n1701 (2006) and engage in serious dialogue. The \nQuartet could, at the request of the Security Council, \noutline a comprehensive Middle East settlement. \n In this world, we need the United Nations to \nmanage change, rather than lag behind. We need to \nrenew and reinvigorate the United Nations. Last year\u2019s \nSummit was devoted to that very task. We have made \nsubstantial progress since then, but more needs to be \ndone. My country\u2019s vision of an effective United \nNations includes less fragmentation, more \nconcentration and more synergy. We need a United \nNations that cuts red tape, rather than one that creates \nmore bureaucracy. For example, in an interdependent \nworld, it makes no sense to have 38 different United \nNations humanitarian and development agencies. That \nis why we have suggested one office, one programme, \none representative and one financial mechanism at the \ncountry level. \n My vision of the United Nations encompasses a \nPeacebuilding Commission that focuses on critical \npeacebuilding needs and a Human Rights Council that \nis the single most authoritative voice on human rights. \nIt is a United Nations led by a Secretary-General with \ngreater authority to determine the optimal use of \nhuman and other resources than is the case at present. \n As an active Member of the United Nations, the \nNetherlands will continue to contribute to the best of \nits ability to turn this vision into reality. The \nNetherlands does not just preach; it delivers. For more \nthan 60 years, ever since the foundation of the United \nNations, we have provided means, ideas and people. \nAnd, of course, we remain committed to its cause. \n Security Council reform is a difficult part of the \noverall United Nations reform agenda. A pragmatic \napproach would be to opt for a temporary solution that \ncould be modified after, say, 10 years. The world is \ndynamic and the Security Council\u2019s composition \nshould reflect this. The geopolitical realities of today \nmight not necessarily be the geopolitical realities of \ntomorrow. \n We should focus on the longer-term gains we all \nbenefit from, rather than on short-term progress at the \nexpense of others. Let us work to make the United \nNations operate in a less antagonistic way. We have \nsuccessfully tried this approach in the Group of Friends \nfor the Reform of the United Nations, in which \ndifferent countries, including the Netherlands, engage \nin constructive debate to arrive at solutions that are \nacceptable to all. \n The United Nations is beset by problems that \nrequire major reforms. We are united by the \nopportunities and challenges of our time. In promoting \npeace and stability, in debating human rights issues, or \nin combating extreme poverty, we are compelled to \nwork together and to coordinate our actions. Let us \nadopt a twenty-first-century mentality to address \n \n \n33 06-53005 \n \ntwenty-first-century problems. Now is the time to align \nour agendas and shoulder our responsibilities together. \nA strong United Nations strengthens us all. \n Finally, I would like to express my deepest \nappreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for the \ncommitment and determination he has shown in pursuit \nof a better world, with a United Nations that works \neffectively for the security, safety and well-being of \npeople everywhere. Even the rocks of which he spoke \nseemed a light burden under his stewardship. We \ncommend him for achieving tangible results in the area \nof crisis management and conflict prevention and for \nfurthering the Millennium Development Goals. \nSecretary-General Annan\u2019s personal performance has \nbrought hope and optimism to the hearts of citizens all \nover the world.

        "file_text": "On behalf of President Tommy \nE. Remengesau, Jr., and the people of Palau, I offer my \ncongratulations to the President on his election. I \nassure him and all Member States that the United \nNations will have my Government\u2019s full cooperation \nand support in the coming year. \n Our existential challenge is climate change. To \nquote the text prepared for the President\u2019s address at \nthe opening of this session, we \u201ccannot accept, under \nany circumstance, proposals for mandatory emissions \nreduction targets that take for granted sacrificing the \nhomelands of entire peoples\u201d. We must reach an \nagreement on a set of quantified emission reduction \ntargets for the second commitment period of the Kyoto \nProtocol. These targets must reflect the urgency of the \ncircumstances.  \n The post-2012 regime must address mitigating \nthe impacts of climate change on small island \ndeveloping States. As the text of the President\u2019s \nopening address states, Member States \u201cmust be guided \nby a single consideration: saving those small island \nStates that today live in danger of disappearing entirely \nas nations\u201d. Never before in all history has the \ndisappearance of whole nations been such a real \npossibility. As we noted in Niue, Palau and the \nmembers of the Pacific Islands Forum are deeply \nconcerned about the growing threat that climate change \nposes not only to our sustainable development, but in \nfact to our future survival. This is a security matter that \nhas gone unaddressed. \n  \n \n08-51845 30 \n \n It is for this reason that the Pacific Small Island \nDeveloping States submitted a draft resolution at the \nsixty-second session of the General Assembly \nrequesting that the Security Council honour the Charter \nof the United Nations and actively continue its \nconsideration of the security implications of climate \nchange. We were gratified by the positive response \nfrom the international community and thank our many \nco-sponsors for their support. We will reintroduce our \nresolution in the sixty-third session and look forward to \nAssembly action this fall. \n In the meantime, we cannot wait. While Palau \ncontributes little to greenhouse gas emissions, we are \ntaking significant steps to reduce our reliance on fossil \nfuel, despite the detrimental economic consequences to \nus. The number of projects on energy efficiency and \nrenewable energy has been increased, and we thank our \ndonor partners for their support. We appreciate the \nsupport of Italy and Austria in supporting development \ncooperation with respect to energy for sustainable \ndevelopment. We also thank the European Union for \ntheir ongoing assistance in the area of renewable \nenergy. \n We sincerely hope that Taiwan will be able to \nparticipate in the specialized agencies of the United \nNations. The Republic of China\u2019s meaningful \nparticipation in those agencies, such as the World \nHealth Organization and the International Civil \nAviation Organization, would help promote peace and \ncooperation in the Asia-Pacific region, enhance \nimportant dialogue and help all peoples. \n The oceans that surround Palau are the backbone \nof our nation\u2019s existence and are integral to our \ncontinued viability as an independent nation. At the \nsixty-first session we banded together to protect \nvulnerable marine ecosystems from deep sea bottom \ntrawling, a destructive fishing practice responsible for \n95 per cent of the worldwide damage to seamounts. We \ncongratulate the South Pacific Regional Fisheries \nManagement Organisation for adopting interim \nmeasures that are a substantial step towards eliminating \nbottom trawling. We urge all other regional fisheries \nmanagement organizations and flag States to follow \nthis example, and we remind everyone that the \ndeadline to take action, 31 December 2008, is fast \napproaching. \n Palau has been active on the issue of bottom \ntrawling because of its effects on ocean ecosystems. \nThe North Pacific is home to some of the world\u2019s best \nremaining fisheries. Their diversity is a key reason for \nthe Micronesia Challenge, whereby the countries and \nterritories of Micronesia joined together to conserve 30 \nper cent of near-shore marine resources and 20 per cent \nof land resources by the year 2020.  \n This project is the first of its kind in the world. It \ncovers 6.7 million square miles of ocean and helps to \nprotect 10 per cent of the world\u2019s coral reefs, including \nmore than 60 threatened species. We thank the General \nAssembly for its recognition of this programme at its \nsixty-second session, in resolution 62/215 on oceans \nand law of the sea and thank our development partners, \nincluding Turkey, the Global Environment Fund, the \nNature Conservancy and Conservation International for \ntheir support. \n Since Palau joined the United Nations in 1994, \nwe have highlighted our concern that the Organization \nhas no presence in our country. We were pleased \ntherefore when the United Nations Development \nProgramme, the United Nations Population Fund and \nthe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund announced that \neight new joint offices would open in Pacific island \ncountries, including Palau. We welcome that historic \naccomplishment and await the opening ceremony. \n Palau is an active participant in the efforts of the \ninternational community to combat terrorism and has \nmade every effort to improve its anti-terrorism \ncapacity. We have met with the Counter-Terrorism \nCommittee Executive Directorate to advance our \nrequests for assistance, particularly in the area of \ncombating money-laundering and terrorism financing. \nUnfortunately, the efforts of the Directorate have been \ninsufficient. Our experience has been that the capacity-\nbuilding efforts of the United Nations have focused on \nhelping countries draft and adopt legislation. That is an \nexcellent first step, but an insufficient one, as the best-\ndesigned legislation is meaningless without \nenforcement.  \n We hope that, during the sixty-third session of the \nGeneral Assembly, the United Nations will take the \nnext step and help smaller countries that have the drive \nbut not the means to operationalize the laws and \nregulations they have in place to fight terrorism. We \nurge the establishment of a voluntary trust fund that \nwould allow small States to develop effective counter-\nterrorism initiatives. We thank the United States and \n \n \n31 08-51845 \n \nAustralia for the counter-terrorism assistance they have \ngiven us. \n Urgent attention should be paid to Security \nCouncil reform. Without it, there can be no genuine \nUnited Nations reform. Japan has demonstrated its \nconcern for and commitment to Palau and all its Pacific \nneighbours, and should be a permanent member of the \nCouncil. Likewise, India, the world\u2019s largest \ndemocracy, is a developing nation with a deep sense of \ninvolvement in Palau and the rest of the Pacific. We \nhave supported and continue to support the principles \nof the draft resolution proposed by the Group of Four \ncountries. \n We have worked very hard to change the dates for \nsubmission to the Commission on the Limits of the \nContinental Shelf. The new submission regime will \nallow developing countries to preserve our claims to \nthe resources contained in our extended continental \nshelf. Though that extension of time for submission is \nwelcome, it is only half the battle. We still need the \nresources and the technical expertise necessary to make \na full submission, and we request the assistance of the \ninternational community in helping us to achieve that \ngoal. \n Palau was the last country to emerge from the \nUnited Nations trusteeship system. The United Nations \nhelped to return our sovereignty after four colonial \nadministrations. We are thus particularly proud to \nadvance the objectives of this unique institution and \nlook forward to working together to achieve them \nduring this session of the General Assembly. In \nclosing, let me thank the Assembly in my country\u2019s \nnative language: Kom Kmal Mesulang."

        "file_text": "At the outset, I wish to extend our \nsincere congratulations to Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann on his election as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-third session. I would also like to \ntake the opportunity to pay tribute to the President of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-second session, \nMr. Srgjan Kerim, for his able leadership during his \npast term. \n For Turkey, the United Nations Charter reflects \nthe common aspirations and conscience of humanity. \nThe United Nations provides a political and moral \ncompass for our endeavours towards a just \ninternational order \u2014 a better order that will prevent \nnew conflicts, ensure that human rights are upheld and \nlead to more equitable and sustainable distribution of \nprosperity. \n In this framework, we believe that the most \npressing task before the international community is to \nbridge, as quickly as possible, the enormous gap \nbetween the wealthiest and the least fortunate. We have \ncertainly made considerable progress in that direction, \nincluding towards meeting the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals; however, our common fight \nagainst poverty, illiteracy, epidemic diseases, child \nmortality and climate change is still far from over. On \nthe contrary, volatile fuel prices, the food crisis and the \nglobal economic slowdown have brought about an even \n \n \n21 08-51570 \n \nmore challenging development and security \nenvironment. Under such circumstances, the fight \nagainst terrorism, racism, xenophobia and all forms of \nreligious discrimination and extremism takes on \nparticular importance. \n We must indeed remain extremely vigilant \nagainst the risk of further alienation between different \ncultures and religions. In that respect, we regard the \nAlliance of Civilizations initiative, which we \ncosponsored with Spain under the auspices of the \nUnited Nations Secretary-General, as an important \ninstrument that can help us avoid such a dangerous \ntrack. \n Turkey will continue to be a leading country in \nfurther advancing the goals of this initiative which \nenjoys worldwide backing, including from the \nEuropean Union and the Organization of the Islamic \nConference. We hope that the Group of Friends of the \nAlliance of Civilizations, which now consists of \n14 international organizations and 76 countries \nrepresenting different regions ranging from Latin \nAmerica to Africa and Asia, will keep growing. In this \nvein, we look forward to hosting the second Forum \nmeeting of the Alliance of Civilizations in Istanbul \nnext April. \n As I said, a top priority issue on our agenda is the \nneed to address the problems of the developing world. \nThere is no question that developing countries should \nget all the assistance they need to achieve sustainable \ndevelopment. They must be supported under a renewed \nglobal development agenda and through increased \nforeign investments and enhanced trade facilities. For \nits part, Turkey is trying to contribute to this \nendeavour, first and foremost through increased \ndevelopment assistance. Turkey also provides special \nfacilities for development, health, education and \nagricultural projects in various parts of the world. As a \nresult of such fast-growing aid programmes, Turkey is \nnow recognized as an emerging donor country by the \ninternational community. \n The United Nations Ministerial Conference of the \nLeast Developed Countries which Turkey hosted in \nIstanbul last year has clearly demonstrated our \ncommitment to humanitarian and development \nassistance. We have now offered to host the Fourth \nMinisterial Conference. Similarly, the first-ever \nTurkey-Africa Cooperation Summit held in Istanbul \nlast month provided an important opportunity to \nexplore new avenues of cooperation with the African \ncontinent. \n Turkey is also committed to combating global \nwarming, which has serious implications for the entire \nworld, but more so for the developing countries. \nDriven by that conviction, we are taking active part in \nnegotiations to shape our new global climate change \nagreement, which will replace the Kyoto Protocol. \n Turkey also pays special attention to the global \nwater crisis. In that regard, we hope that the Fifth \nWorld Water Forum which we will host in Istanbul next \nMarch will inspire new thinking and concrete action on \nthis important question. \n If I may now turn to the political issues besetting \nour region, I am pleased to note that Turkey has been \nactively contributing to the advancement of peace by \nfacilitating dialogue. We have also been working hard \nto build a sense of co-ownership of regional issues \namong our neighbours through a series of regional \ncooperation initiatives. Encouraged by its strong \nregional ties, Turkey has launched another initiative \ndesigned to prevent further conflict in the recently \ntraumatized South Caucasus. In that regard, I believe \nthat the Caucasus Stability and Cooperation Platform \nproposed by Turkey could be an instrumental \nframework for building a climate of confidence in the \nregion that will allow discussion of our common \nproblems in a democratic setting. \n In the light of impressions from my visits to our \nneighbours Armenia and Azerbaijan and those of Prime \nMinister Erdogan to the Russian Federation and \nGeorgia, all parties concerned seem receptive to the \nidea; we hope they will give it a chance to work. I \nsincerely believe that a positive perspective thus \ncreated will help to solve frozen conflicts, including \noccupied Nagorno-Karabakh, on the basis of respect \nfor the principle of territorial integrity. No doubt, such \na perspective will also help improve the bilateral ties \nbetween the countries of the region.  \n The President returned to the Chair. \n It is also well past time to settle the conflicts of \nthe Middle East, at the core of which lies the \nPalestinian question. Turkey actively supports all \nendeavours to bring about a lasting solution to that \ncentral problem and alleviate the plight of the \nPalestinian people. Turkey is also making every effort \nto help advance the Syrian and Lebanese tracks. One \n  \n \n08-51570 22 \n \nrecent example is the indirect peace talks that Syria \nand Israel started under Turkey\u2019s auspices this past \nMay in Istanbul.  \n In Iraq, too, Turkey stands firmly with the Iraqi \npeople and Government. Besides our bilateral efforts, I \nam particularly pleased to see that the Neighbouring \nCountries process, which I initiated five years ago, is \nfunctioning well. If the international community\u2019s \nefforts are to succeed, the Iraqi people need to settle \ntheir differences through dialogue and compromise on \ncontroversial issues, among them the final status of \nKirkuk.  \n Afghanistan is another country where Turkey is \ninvesting heavily in the future of a nation with which \nwe have special historical ties. Turkey will continue to \ncontribute to the security of the Afghan people and to \ntheir reconstruction efforts. We will also continue our \ninitiatives to create an atmosphere conducive to \nregional ownership and cooperation, in particular \nbetween Pakistan and Afghanistan. That is equally vital \nfor the common struggle against terrorism and for the \nstability of the region.  \n Finally, an urgent and peaceful settlement of the \nquestion of Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, in conformity \nwith International Atomic Energy Agency norms and \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \nobligations and respecting the right to the peaceful use \nof nuclear energy, remains high on Turkey\u2019s active \ndiplomatic agenda.  \n I am convinced that would-be solutions to \nindividual conflicts in the Middle East will be \nsustainable only if we adopt a comprehensive approach \nbased on a positive vision for the future. That is why I \ninvite all the parties to give serious consideration to the \nlongstanding idea of collective arrangements for \nconflict prevention and resolution that would promote \nregional security and stability by building confidence, \nfacilitating political dialogue and encouraging \neconomic and cultural cooperation in the Middle East.  \n Turkey gives full backing to diplomatic efforts \ntowards a political settlement in Cyprus. The solution \nlies in the establishment of a new partnership State \ncomposed of two constituent States of equal status. The \nprocess towards that goal should be based on the \nUnited Nations parameters of bi-zonality and the \npolitical equality of the two sides. We welcome and \nfirmly support the comprehensive settlement \nnegotiations recently started between the two leaders \nunder the good offices of the Secretary-General.  \n At the same time, I believe that efforts to end the \nunfair isolation of the Turkish Cypriots who voted \ncourageously in favour of the Comprehensive \nSettlement of the Cyprus Problem in 2004 \u2014 a plan \nthat was unfortunately rejected by the other side \u2014 are \nlong overdue.  \n Before concluding, I would like to stress the \nindispensable nature of the United Nations in resolving \nall those matters. Indeed, without an effective and \nfunctional world body, it is impossible to realize the \nhopes and expectations of our nations. That is why we \nattach the utmost importance to reforming and further \nstrengthening the United Nations system as a whole. It \nis also why Turkey is constantly stepping up its \nengagement in and contributions to all aspects of the \nUnited Nations agenda, ranging from development and \npeacekeeping to human rights.  \n It is also with that sense of responsibility that \nTurkey has decided to put forth its candidature for a \nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council for 2009 \nand 2010. Turkey has not been represented in the \nCouncil for nearly half a century, and we believe that \nthe main tenets of our foreign policy, together with our \neconomic, social and cultural attributes, will allow us \nto bring added value to the work of the Council. I hope \nthat the General Assembly, with its valuable support, \nwill do us the honour of granting Turkey the \nopportunity to do so.  "

        "file_text": "I am honoured by this \nopportunity to address the General Assembly at its \nsixty-third session. This great institution plays a vital \nrole in the development process of its members and \nremains the global organization best situated to address \nthe world\u2019s pressing needs and to help find solutions \nfor them. So, it is with pleasure that I use this occasion \nto make the following remarks on a few challenging \nissues of vital significance confronting Micronesia \ntoday. \n I must first congratulate His Excellency \nMr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann on his election to the \npresidency of the Assembly. He has my delegation\u2019s \nadmiration and full support. In the same vein, I \ncommend the dedication and stewardship of Mr. Srgjan \nKerim, President of the Assembly at its sixty-second \nsession. \n I wish to offer my greetings to our able Secretary-\nGeneral and to express the best wishes of my \nGovernment as he continues to lead the Organization \nthrough the difficult challenges ahead. \n The General Assembly is meeting at a time of \nunusual uncertainties surrounding the global economy. \nThe world financial situation and the double threat \nposed by the fuel and food crises impose additional \nstrain on all of us and negatively impact our efforts to \nachieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \nand our pursuit of sustainable development. The \nsecurity of our island countries remains under threat by \nthe effects of climate change. \n The fuel crisis is a major challenge to the \nMembers of this Organization. There are few countries \nin this world that are left unscathed by the worldwide \nfuel crises. Too often, I am afraid, those most affected \nby the crisis are those Members of the United Nations \nthat can least afford an effective response. More often \nthan not, they are the small island developing States \nthat are also the most vulnerable Members of this \nOrganization. \n The developed countries may have room to \nrespond to the worsening energy crisis without \njeopardizing other development programmes. But for \nus in Micronesia, we are painfully aware of the strong \n  \n \n08-51851 2 \n \nand adverse impacts on everything from government \noperations to the effect on individual households and \nfamilies. \n In a very real sense, the lingering global energy \ncrisis has transformed the energy debate and \nhighlighted the world\u2019s dependence on fossil fuel. \nPower outages in our state centres have become a \nregular phenomenon affecting our medical facilities, \nschools, businesses and everyday government \noperations, including services to our remote outer \nislands, which are reachable only by ships. These \nsetbacks are the result of our inability to procure fuel at \na reasonable cost. While we recognize that fossil fuel \nwill, in the medium term, remain a necessity, the \ncurrent energy crisis strengthens Micronesia\u2019s resolve \nto call for the acceleration of the development of \ntechnologies for renewable and affordable sources of \nenergy. Micronesia recognizes that special assistance \nfrom the international community and financial \ninstitutions in the area of renewable energy is \nnecessary to achieve this goal. We are grateful to our \nfriends that have over time generously extended \nassistance to that end. \n The General Assembly, by its own resolutions, \nrecognizes everyone\u2019s right to food. On a global scale, \nthat right is being threatened as the world faces a \nsevere food crisis. Already, the cost of imported \nfoodstuffs has increased considerably, and my \nGovernment and people are thus faced with yet another \ndevelopment challenge \u2014 one that has already been \nexacerbated by the energy crisis. The cost of rice, one \nof the main imported foodstuffs, which has become a \nmain staple in my people\u2019s diet, is no longer \naffordable. My Government, in responding to the food \ncrisis, has encouraged the people to increase the local \nproduction of our own crops. But that cannot be \nachieved without the support and cooperation of our \ndevelopment partners and the United Nations system. \n The nexus between food security and climate \nchange cannot be overlooked. In Micronesia, farmlands \nand inhabitants occupy the low-lying fringes and \nislands barely a few metres above sea level. Taro \npatches, which provided the main staple of our people \nfor centuries, are now under threat by sea level rise. \nAlready, many islands have experienced inundation of \ntheir taro patches and fields of other food crops by salt \nwater, resulting in decreased crop production. \n Of equal importance to our self-sufficiency and in \nmeeting some of our nutritional needs is the bounty of \nour ocean. The ocean is of fundamental importance to \nMicronesia, as we rely heavily on it. The ocean \nsustains us, and its resources enrich us. At a time when \nthe world food market is deeply affected by the food \ncrisis, Micronesians are increasingly dependent on the \nbounty of the sea to provide for their food and for their \neconomic development. It is therefore of paramount \nimportance that we continue to conserve and manage \nsustainably the use of our marine and fisheries \nresources. But collateral catches and discards in \ncommercial fisheries remain a concern to us. For \nMicronesians, these are critical resources that are of \ncultural importance, and our people depend upon them \nfor their subsistence living. The international \ncommunity must help us find ways to minimize and \neliminate this wasteful use of resources. \n Equally damaging to fish stocks is the incidence \nof illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. \nThis practice continues to deprive our people of their \nfood resources, while the illegal operators continue to \nreap and enjoy the rewards from this activity without \nany accountability. The major consumer and market \noutlets must reduce this illegal activity if we are to \neffectively eliminate this abhorrent and unsustainable \npractice. \n The world\u2019s financial turbulence, as evidenced by \nthe current delicate situation in the host country, is \nanother matter of concern. While the situation \nemanates from the bigger economies, all of us are at \nrisk, as we are all part of the globalized economy. We \nencourage the developed countries not to use this as a \nconvenient excuse to reverse their gains in reaching the \nagreed target of 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic \nproduct for official development assistance. \n My delegation is encouraged by the spirit and \ndetermination of the Members of the United Nations to \nbring Security Council reform a step closer to reality. \nOur task remains difficult, but we are encouraged by \nthe recent decision of the General Assembly and look \nforward to the beginning of the process of \nintergovernmental negotiations. Among other things, \nwe reiterate our support for the expansion of both \nmembership categories and reaffirm our long-standing \nview that Japan and India, from the Asian Group, \nshould become permanent members of a reformed \nSecurity Council. We also renew our support for \nGermany, from Western Europe. \n \n \n3 08-51851 \n \n In the attainment of the international \ndevelopment goals, there is no single issue that \npresents such an enormous challenge to small island \ndeveloping States, such as the Federated States of \nMicronesia, than that of climate change. Micronesia is \nespecially concerned about climate change and the \ngrave threat of sea-level rise, which can literally wash \naway our islands and culture. Three recent articles have \nbeen published in the prestigious science journal \nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, \naddressing the tipping points for abrupt climate \nchange, including sea-level rise. \n A tipping point is a point of no return beyond \nwhich an element of the climate system abruptly tips \ninto a new state, with a profound impact on the planet. \nExamples include tipping points for the melting of \nglaciers and snow pack from the Tibetan Plateau \u2014 the \nheadwaters of most of the rivers in Asia \u2014 and the \ndisintegration of the Greenland and West Antarctica ice \nsheets, which will cause metres of sea-level rise. \n The news is startling. Simply put, it means that \nthe planet is in peril \u2014 and the islands and low-lying \nStates are, of course, in peril. But we cannot afford to \nbe paralysed. We must undertake an aggressive \nprogramme of fast-track mitigation strategies, starting \nwith those that are already justified by their strong \nco-benefits. This includes the strategy Micronesia \npromoted last year and again this year to strengthen the \nMontreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the \nOzone Layer. Our strategy can play a strong role in \nprotecting the climate system as well as the \nstratospheric ozone layer. \n Let me make one final suggestion. Tipping points \nfor abrupt climate change have been called the shadow \nthat haunts climate negotiations. This issue is a shadow \nbecause it has never been squarely addressed by the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). \n The global debate on climate change is \npredominantly framed from a sustainable development \nperspective. We could not agree more with that focus. \nBut Micronesia is convinced that, while sustainable \ndevelopment is of paramount importance, we must also \nbe assured of our security and our territorial integrity. \nWe must approach climate change from a holistic \nperspective rather than limiting it to the dimensions of \nsustainable development, to humanitarian or technical \nissues, or to economic or environmental issues. \nClimate change also has an impact on our human \nrights. It has an impact on international peace and on \nour own security and territorial integrity, and on our \nvery existence as inhabitants of very small and \nvulnerable island nations. \n Experts have warned that climate change is also a \nthreat to international peace and security. Yet, instead \nof addressing the issue squarely, the United Nations \nseems to be more concerned about turf and \nencroachment, as if it were wrong to admit that \nterritorial integrity, national stability and security \nmight be threatened by the impact of climate change, \nand that human conflicts might also arise as a direct or \nindirect result of climate change. Just as the IPCC \nreports, the Stern Review report and the 2007 Human \nDevelopment Report inform the negotiations in the \ncontext of the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change, a report analysing the potential \nimpact of climate change on international peace and \nsecurity should provide additional reasons for urgent \nand adequate climate change mitigation actions. \n Our future \u2014 our environment \u2014 is at stake. Our \nculture and our human rights are at stake. But we must \nnot lose hope, because the entire world is represented \nhere. The time to act is now, not later. "

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Government and people of the \nDominican Republic, I am pleased to extend our \nwarmest congratulations to the President of the General \nAssembly, Father Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann of the \nsister Republic of Nicaragua, on his recent election. We \nalso take this opportunity to greet our fellow Member \nStates in this General Assembly.  \n Eight years ago, in this same place, \nrepresentatives of 189 countries undertook a crucial \ncommitment, possibly one of the most transcendental \ncommitments that such a large number of nations ever \nmade. They agreed on the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs). In the year 2000, it was believed \u2014 \nand this is still the case today \u2014 that the objectives \nestablished at that time would go down in the common \nhistory of humankind as the bravest ethical decision \never taken in the face of extreme poverty, the shame of \ngeneralized injustice and the heartbreaking tragedy of \nsocial inequity. It was an agenda of work and \ndedication that required a large dose of political will, \nactions laid out in conformity with the goals to be \nreached, a reorganization of budgetary priorities and a \n \n \n21 08-51749 \n \ngreater flow of aid resources and support for \ndevelopment.  \n We did not undertake the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals in vague terms. We did not couch \nthe Millennium Declaration in abstract and \ngrandiloquent concepts lacking in substance. Quite the \ncontrary, we analysed with the greatest possible rigour \nthe situation that we wanted to correct. We measured \nwith mathematical precision its overwhelming scope \nand the magnitude of the political and financial effort \nthat its reversal would require.  \n We committed to the MDGs with such supreme \nresponsibility that we even set a date for their \nachievement: the year 2015. Now we are halfway to \nthat date, and we face the disheartening situation of an \ninternational landscape full of obstacles to overcome if \nwe are to conclude what we set out to do in the year \n2000. We knew there would be difficulties. We \nrecognized that we would have to overcome immense \nobstacles, and we had identified every type of major \nchallenge that would await us in the quest to carry out \nour plans.  \n In the Dominican Republic, we have been able to \nachieve some progress towards the achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals. Since 1991, we have \nreduced by more than half the percentage of five-year-\nold children who are underweight for their age. We \nhave also made progress in achieving our goals related \nto health development and have the spread of \nHIV/AIDS under control.  \n However, we now know that over and above the \nlimited progress achieved, not just by the Dominican \nRepublic but by developing countries on all continents, \nmore than half a million women still die every year \nfrom complications of pregnancy and childbirth that \ncould be treated and prevented. We now know that, \nunless an extraordinary effort is made from now on, \ninstead of reaching the goal of reducing by half the \nproportion of children of low birth weight, their \nnumber will grow to over 30 million. We also know \nthat in 2006, the number of deaths caused by AIDS \nrose to almost 3 million and that the preventive \nmeasures against that ominous pandemic remain \ngrossly insufficient. Also disheartening is the fact that \nmore than 600 million people will not have better \nhealth services than the ones they currently have access \nto.  \n Now, at the same time that this is occurring, the \nrichest nations, which committed to providing \nextraordinary official development assistance in order \nto achieve the Millennium Development Goals, have in \ngeneral fallen short in carrying out their pledges. Only \nfive of those nations \u2014 Norway, Sweden, the \nNetherlands, Denmark and Luxembourg \u2014 have \nhonoured their commitments, making contributions \nequal to and in some cases greater than the 0.7 per cent \nof their gross national income established as \nappropriate by this world Organization.  \n Nonetheless, we can be sure that, in order to \nachieve the Millennium Development Goals, we will \nnow require a financial rescue plan from the \ninternational community \u2014 in a sort of bailout, as it is \nreferred to nowadays. According to studies by the \nWorld Bank, a yearly average of approximately \n$50 billion in foreign aid would be needed to achieve \nthe Millennium Development Goals. That is to say that \nachieving the goals of improving the quality of life and \ndignity in the living conditions of the poorest nations \nof the world would require an international economic \nfinancing plan as bold and as urgent as that currently \nbeing undertaken to save Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, \nBear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, AIG and other financial \ninstitutions. In other words, over the next seven years, \nuntil 2015, the date established for the achievement of \nthe Millennium Development Goals, according to the \ncriteria of the World Bank, we would need $350 billion \nof foreign aid. That represents half of the amount that \nis being debated at this very moment in the United \nStates Congress to save from bankruptcy the financial \nbusinesses of Wall Street responsible for their own \nfailures.  \n The people of the world affected by hunger and \nmisery are crying out to the international community to \nlend the same urgent attention to the resolution of their \nplight that has been given to efforts to rescue banking \ninstitutions on the brink of collapse. We cannot \nentertain the idea that rescuing the dignity of the \nworld\u2019s poor is less important or urgent as rescuing the \ninstitutions operating in the world\u2019s most important \nfinancial centre.  \n We would like it to be clear that we have not \ncome here to condemn anyone. We have not come to \npoint a finger at any friendly nation that is a Member \nof the United Nations family. Rather, we wish to sound \nthe alarm and be a voice that troubles the conscience \nand calls for a solution to a problem that affects all \n  \n \n08-51749 22 \n \npoor nations and is socially unjust and ethically \nunacceptable.  \n We would like to use this forum, however, to \nhighlight other factors that hinder the achievement of \nthe Millennium Development Goals and the progress of \nour nations. Such is the case, for example, of the \nunregulated speculation in the buying and selling of \nfutures contracts for oil and food. There is no way to \nhide the fact that, without regulation, the futures \nmarkets are mechanisms that lend themselves through \nexcessive speculation, fraud and manipulation to a \ndistortion of the fundamental principles of economic \nactivity. We do not question the fact that, with respect \nto the determination of oil prices, supply has not \nincreased significantly while demand has increased; \nthat there has been insufficient investment in new \nrefineries in recent years; that there are geopolitical \ntensions in various parts of the world, or that the \nUnited States dollar has decreased in value. All of that \nis true.  \n What we do question, however, is the fact, that in \njust 12 months, the price of a barrel of oil rose from \n$70 to almost $150. In July, we were stupefied to see \nthe price of a barrel of oil rise $10 in a single day. Just \ntwo days ago, while we were here in New York, we \nsaw with great perplexity an increase of not just \n$10 but $25 per barrel in a single day. How can we \nexplain that? Is it that suddenly, in just one day, the \nwhole world increased its demand so abruptly, or did \nthe world\u2019s oil wells unexpectedly disappear? \n In reality, there is but one explanation: excessive \nspeculation in the futures markets. It is \nincomprehensible that some can sell something they do \nnot have while others can buy what they do not expect \nto receive. However, that is what has been happening \nrecently, in the clearest example of so-called casino \ncapitalism. \n In just five years, hundreds of billions of dollars \nhave entered the commodities futures markets, largely \ndirected towards energy, while prices shot up by more \nthan 200 per cent between July 2003 and July 2008. \nThat has occurred not just with a few commodities, but \nwith every single one of the 25 products on the world \nmarket index for commodities. In the past five years, \nthe price of wheat has gone up by 177 per cent, soy by \n196 per cent and corn by 214 per cent.  \n Nevertheless, we must reiterate here that what \nhas the greatest impact on the achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals is skyrocketing oil \nprices. In the Dominican Republic, our oil bill has \nrisen from $1.667 billion in 2004 to a projected \n$6.5 billion this year. That represents a difference of \nalmost 500 per cent. With that difference of $5 billion, \nthe Dominican Republic could have financed every \npublic investment laid out in the cost analyses of the \nMillennium Development Goals from 2008 to 2015. \n The world does not aspire to be a gambling den. \nThe world does not want continuous manipulation or \npermanent fraud in regard to factors that have a \ndecisive effect on the quality of life. The world, in fact, \nhas very simple aspirations: to live in conditions of \nsocial justice and equity, with the creation of \nopportunities so that every human being can develop \nhis or her creative potential, both material and \nspiritual. \n For the achievement of such noble objectives, the \nStates that have committed themselves to realizing the \nMDGs as an agenda of true and genuine social \ntransformation turn to the United Nations system with \noptimism and hope that it can correct and make up for \nexisting distortions. \n We trust that with so many intelligent persons \nmeeting here, working towards a better life for all of \nhumankind, important solutions will be brought to the \ntable with the same speed, urgency and interest that are \nbeing shown in drawing up rescue plans for bankrupt \nbanks during these turbulent times in the world of \nfinance.

        "file_text": "I should like to begin by \ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election to the \npresidency and wishing you every success in the \nmonths ahead. I pledge my country\u2019s fullest \ncooperation and support in the discharge of your duties \nand responsibilities. I must also extend my sincere \nappreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \neffective leadership in promoting global peace, security \nand development. \n Last year, this Assembly declared and honoured \nthe opening of Ethiopia\u2019s third millennium. We \nappreciate that honour. It provided a tangible \nfoundation for the renaissance of Ethiopia, most \nrecently symbolized by the re-erection of the Obelisk \nof Axum, brought back from Italy to the land of its \norigin, where it was carved 17 centuries ago. We are \ngrateful to the Italian Government for that right and \nbold decision. \n A central element of our millennium celebrations \nhas been the initiation of numerous development \nactivities for the war on poverty and our commitment \nto attain the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \nAs the Secretary-General has noted, progress towards \nthe MDGs in Africa has been uneven. It is indeed \nalarming that no country is likely to reach all the \nMDGs by 2015. We are at the moment at the midway \nmark and we all recognize that we are behind schedule. \nWe hope that the high-level event on the MDGs has \n \n \n5 08-53141 \n \nachieved its objective of creating global awareness and \nrenewed commitment, with particular focus on Africa. \n I concur with the Secretary-General that we are \nfacing a development emergency. In that regard, \ndecisive and timely action must be taken by developed \nand developing countries alike to live up to their \ncommitments to the Millennium Development Goals. \nFood insecurity could undermine core democratic \nvalues and ruin national development efforts. \nGovernments should therefore take the lead and work \ntogether in the economic sector to resolve the current \nglobal food crisis. \n The Monterrey Consensus on financing for \ndevelopment, integrating aid, debt relief, market \naccess, good governance and foreign direct investment \nis a litmus test for the success of global partnerships. \nWe call on the developed countries to honour their \ncommitment to devote 0.7 per cent of their gross \nnational income to overseas development assistance. \n The Millennium Development Goals provide the \ncritical minimum for our survival as a nation and the \nbasis for the profound transformation in which we are \ncurrently engaged. Ethiopia\u2019s priorities remain the \neradication of poverty, sustainable development and \nensuring good governance, democracy and respect for \nhuman rights. Those are not a choice, but a necessity \nfor our survival as a nation. We have laid the \nfoundations for continued growth and democratization, \nbuilding democratic institutions from the grass roots \nand providing the necessary political space for \nresponsible democratization. \n Our average of 10 per cent growth over the last \nfive years is continuing despite the setbacks of recent \nmonths. We continue protecting poverty-targeted \noutlays and increasing capital expenditure on \ninfrastructure, education, health and pro-poor sectors. \nFor the first time in its history, Ethiopia is making real \nand meaningful economic progress. It is the fastest \ngrowing non-oil economy in Africa. \n Ethiopia is both landlocked and one of the least \ndeveloped countries. Accordingly, we attach great \nimportance to the full implementation of both the \nBrussels and the Almaty Programmes of Action. While \nwe appreciate all external assistance, we are equally \nconscious of the need for predictable, strong and \nenduring partnerships for mutual benefit. We need \neconomic relations that no longer penalize poor \ncountries and ones that provide greater flexibility in \ndevelopment aid, the transfer of capital and the \nremoval of excessive indebtedness. \n The objectives of the Millennium Development \nGoals make it clear that global affluence and welfare \nare inseparable and that prosperity cannot coexist with \nabject poverty. In the context of the present world \ntrading system, we urge realistic preferential terms of \ntrade, especially to least developed countries, including \nquota- and duty-free market access for all their goods \nand services. \n Ethiopia has consistently helped to promote peace \nand stability in our region. We have no doubt that \nsustainable development will be possible only with \ndurable peace and security. Those form the very \nfoundation of our subregional organization, the \nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD). \nAs the current Chair of IGAD, Ethiopia is determined \nto ensure that its revitalization will become a reality, \nenhance regional integration and promote peace, \nsecurity and development. \n We know the dangers of continued conflict in our \nregion. That is indeed why we have committed \nourselves to peace in Somalia ever since we helped \norganize the first broad-based peace conference in \n1992. We have consistently supported all efforts to \nbring about an effective Government in that country. In \nthat regard, we are encouraged by the latest positive \npolitical developments in Somalia. The Djibouti \nAgreement and the Addis Ababa road map open the \nway for further progress in the peace process. We now \nlook forward to the planned IGAD summit in Nairobi \nearly next month to help Somalia\u2019s leaders do more for \nnational reconciliation. \n At the same time, we urge the Security Council to \ndischarge its responsibility by deploying a \npeacekeeping mission to Somalia as soon as possible or \nat least by allocating the necessary resources to \nstrengthen the African Union Mission to Somalia \n(AMISOM). We commend the deployment of troops \nfrom Uganda and Burundi to AMISOM. It is never too \nlate for others to follow their example. \n Ethiopia appreciates the progress made in the \nimplementation of the Comprehensive Peace \nAgreement in the Sudan. We urge the parties to do \nmore in overcoming the challenges facing them. \nHowever, we must emphasize that the international \ncommunity should also bear its shared responsibility in \nthat regard. Ethiopia fully supports the African Union \n  \n \n08-53141 6 \n \nposition on Darfur and the handling of the International \nCriminal Court-Sudan issue. \n Ethiopia stands firmly committed to resolving all \noutstanding issues with Eritrea through peaceful, \npolitical, legal and diplomatic means. \n Terrorism is a scourge that impedes peace and \ndevelopment in any part of the world. As its occurrence \nin any form threatens global security as a whole, \nEthiopia believes that it should be addressed \ncollectively. In that regard, we attach great significance \nto the ability of dialogue among civilizations to build a \nculture of tolerance that will enable us to create closer \nunderstanding among nations \u2014 all nations. \n Ethiopia remains committed to the United \nNations reform process and its revitalization. They are \ncritical to the credibility of the United Nations and the \nfuture of multilateralism. As a founding Member of the \nUnited Nations, Ethiopia will always remain loyal to \nits purpose and principles. \n The United Nations is the custodian of \nmultilateral diplomacy. At no time since the Second \nWorld War have multilateralism and genuine \ncooperation been as critical as they are today. That is \nwhy we need the United Nations as never before. It is a \nbody that remains vital to the future of us all, \ndeveloping and developed countries alike. "

        "file_text": "It is my great \npleasure to greet my dear friend Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann, President of the General Assembly. I wish \nyou much success in your mission. \n The present session of the General Assembly is \nbeing held at a particularly serious time. An often \npredicted economic and financial crisis is now today\u2019s \nharsh reality. Because of the responsibility of \nspeculators, entire peoples are suffering anguish in the \nwake of successive financial disasters that threaten the \nworld\u2019s economy. Indispensable interventions by State \nauthorities have defied market fundamentalists and \nshown that this is a time for political decisions. Only \ndecisive action by Governments \u2014 particularly those \nof countries at the epicentre of the crisis \u2014 will be able \nto rein in the disorder that has spread through the \nworld\u2019s financial sector, with perverse effects on the \ndaily lives of millions of people. The lack of rules \nfavours adventurers and opportunists, to the detriment \nof real companies and workers.  \n The great Brazilian economist Celso Furtado said \nthat we must not always allow speculators\u2019 profits to be \nprivatized while their losses are invariably socialized. \nWe must not allow the burden of the boundless greed \nof a few to be shouldered by all. The economy is too \nserious a matter to be left in the hands of speculators. \nEthics must also apply to the economy. \n A crisis of such magnitude will not be overcome \nthrough palliative measures. Mechanisms for both \nprevention and control are needed to ensure full \ntransparency for international finance. Today\u2019s \nsupranational economic institutions have neither the \nauthority nor the workable instruments that they need \nto control the anarchy of speculation. We must rebuild \nthem on entirely new foundations. \n The global nature of this crisis means that the \nsolutions we adopt must also be global and must be \ndecided upon in legitimate and trusted multilateral \nforums, without coercion. The United Nations, as the \nworld\u2019s largest multilateral arena, must call for a \nvigorous response to the weighty threats that we all \nface. \n Yet there are other, equally serious matters facing \nthe world today. One of them is the food crisis, which \nafflicts more than a billion human beings. The energy \ncrisis is also growing worse every day, as will the risks \nto world trade if we fail to achieve an agreement at the \n \n \n7 08-51570 \n \nDoha Round; another is the unrestrained degradation of \nthe environment, which lies behind so many natural \ncalamities whose victims are overwhelmingly the poor. \n The fall of the Berlin Wall was expected to open \nup possibilities for building a world of peace, free from \nthe stigmas of the cold war. However, it is sad to see \nother walls going up so quickly.  \n Many of those who preach the free circulation of \ncommodities and capital continue to fight the free \nmovement of men and women, using nationalistic and \neven racist arguments that evoke unpleasant memories \nand fears of times that we thought were behind us.  \n A supposedly \u201cpopulist nationalism\u201d, which some \nforces seek to identify and criticize in the South, is \nbeing unabashedly promoted in the developed \ncountries. The financial, food, energy, environmental \nand migration crises, to say nothing of threats to peace \nin several regions of the world, reveal that the \nmultilateral system must be overhauled to meet the \nchallenges of the twenty-first century. \n Gradually, countries are moving beyond old \nconformist alignments with traditional centres. That \nnew attitude, however, does not imply a \nconfrontational stance. Simply by using direct dialogue \nwithout intermediation by major powers, developing \ncountries have stepped into new roles in designing a \nmultipolar world, with examples such as India, Brazil \nand South Africa (IBSA), the G-20, the summits \nbetween South America and Africa and between South \nAmerica and the Arab countries and the BRIC \ncountries \u2014 Brazil, Russian Federation, India and \nChina. \n A new political, economic and trade geography is \nbeing built in today\u2019s world. While navigators in the \npast would look to the North Star, today we are trying \nto find our way by looking at multiple dimensions of \nour planet. Now we often find our North Star in the \nSouth. On my continent, the Union of South American \nNations (UNASUR) was created last May, as the first \ntreaty \u2014 after 200 years of independence \u2014 that \nbrings together all South American countries. This new \npolitical union will coordinate the region\u2019s countries in \nterms of infrastructure, energy, social policies, \ncomplementary production mechanisms, finance and \ndefence. \n Meeting in Santiago, Chile, just over a week ago, \nthe Presidents of South America demonstrated \nUNASUR\u2019s ability to respond quickly and effectively \nto complex situations, such as the one in our sister \nnation, Bolivia. We supported its legitimately-elected \nGovernment, its democratic institutions and its \nterritorial integrity and we issued a call for dialogue as \na path to peace and prosperity for the people of \nBolivia. \n Next December, in the state of Bahia, Brazil will \nhost the first summit of all of the countries of Latin \nAmerica and the Caribbean on integration and \ndevelopment. This will be a high-level meeting under \nno umbrella, based on Latin America\u2019s and the \nCaribbean\u2019s own perspectives. All these efforts in the \nmultilateral sphere are complemented by my country\u2019s \nsolidarity initiatives with poorer nations, particularly in \nAfrica. \n I also wish to emphasize our commitment to \nHaiti, where we command troops of the United Nations \nStabilization Mission in Haiti and are helping to restore \npeace. I reiterate my appeal for the solidarity of \ndeveloped countries with Haiti, since implementation \nhas fallen far short of the many promises. \n The strength of values must prevail over the \nvalue of strength. Only legitimate and effective \ninstruments can assure collective security. The United \nNations has spent 15 years discussing the reform of its \nSecurity Council. Today\u2019s structure has been frozen for \nsix decades and does not match the challenges of \ntoday\u2019s world. Its distorted form of representation \nstands between us and the multilateral world to which \nwe aspire. Therefore, I am much encouraged by the \nGeneral Assembly\u2019s decision to launch negotiations in \nthe near future on the reform of the Security Council. \n It is multilateralism that must also guide us \ntoward solutions to the complex problems of global \nwarming, based on the principle of common but \ndifferentiated responsibilities. Brazil has not shirked its \nresponsibilities. Our energy matrix is increasingly \nclean. Today\u2019s food and energy crises are deeply \nintertwined. The inflation of food prices is affected not \nonly by climatic factors and speculation in agricultural \ncommodities; it is also driven by rising oil prices \nwhich affect the prices of fertilizers and transportation. \nAttempts to tie high food prices to the distribution of \nbiofuels do not stand up to an objective analysis of \nreality. \n Brazil\u2019s experience demonstrates \u2014 and this \ncould be the case for countries similar to ours \u2014 that \n  \n \n08-51570 8 \n \nsugar-cane ethanol and biodiesel production reduce our \ndependency on fossil fuels, create jobs, regenerate \ndegraded land and are fully compatible with expanding \nfood production. We wish to intensify all aspects of \nthat discussion at the world conference on energy and \nbiofuels which we will be holding in November 2008, \nin the city of Sao Paulo. \n My obsession with the hunger problem explains \nmy ongoing efforts, along with other world leaders, to \nreach a positive conclusion to the Doha Round. We are \nstill pushing for an agreement to reduce scandalous \nfarm subsidies in rich countries. A successful Doha \nRound will have a very positive impact on food \nproduction, particularly in developing and poor \ncountries. \n Four years ago, along with several world leaders, \nI launched the Action Against Hunger and Poverty here \nin New York. Our proposal, then and now, is to adopt \ninnovative funding mechanisms. The International \nDrug Purchase Facility is one early result of that \ninitiative, helping to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and \nmalaria in several African countries. But it is not \nenough. We still have a long way to go if we want \nhumanity to actually achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. \n In December 2008, we will commemorate the \nsixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights, paying a tribute that will go far beyond \nmere formalities. That document expresses inalienable \ncommitments that challenge us all. As Governments, \nwe must do more than support the Declaration with \nrhetoric. We are called upon to fight for the values \nproclaimed six decades ago and to make them a reality \nin each country and around the world. \n Today\u2019s Brazil is very different from what it was \nin 2003, when I became President of my country and \nstood for the first time before the General Assembly. \nOur Government and society have taken decisive steps \nto transform the lives of Brazilians, creating nearly 10 \nmillion formal jobs, distributing income and wealth, \nimproving public services, lifting 9 million people out \nof extreme poverty, and bringing another 20 million \ninto the middle class. All this has occurred in an \nenvironment of strong growth, economic stability, \nlower external vulnerability and, above all, a stronger \ndemocracy with the intense participation of our people. \n In the year when we commemorate the \none-hundredth birthday of the great Brazilian Josu\u00e9 de \nCastro \u2014 the first Director-General of the Food and \nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations and a \npioneer in the studies concerning the problem of \nhunger in the world \u2014 it is worthwhile to reread his \nwarning: \u201cIt is no longer possible to sit back and let a \nregion go hungry without the entire world suffering the \nconsequences.\u201d \n I am proud to state that Brazil is overcoming \nhunger and poverty. I reiterate the optimism that I \nexpressed here five years ago. We are much greater \nthan the crises that threaten us. We have the heart, the \nright-mindedness and the will to overcome any \nadversity. More than ever, that is the spirit of \nBrazilians. "

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset, Sir, to express my \ncountry\u2019s heartfelt congratulations to you on your \nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-third session. We are confident that your \nexperience and wisdom will crown our work with \nsuccess and will result in further progress on the many \nimportant issues on the Assembly\u2019s agenda. \n I would like also to express my appreciation to \nyour predecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, for the efforts he \nmade during his presidency of the General Assembly at \nits previous session. Our thanks go also to \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his persistent \nefforts to implement United Nations resolutions and \nrealize the purposes of the Charter. \n Humanity faces many problems and serious \nchallenges, which, no matter how great, would not be \nimpossible to resolve if we evinced the necessary \npolitical will and made concerted efforts to overcome \nthem. My country recognizes that peace, security and \nstability constitute the cornerstone of progress and \ndevelopment, especially in Africa. It has therefore \nmade all possible efforts to resolve disputes in Africa, \nas was the case in Chad, the Central African Republic \nand the Sudan. My country has also contributed, along \nwith other African countries and pursuant to \nresolutions of the African Union Peace and Security \nCouncil, towards putting an end to the insurgency in \nthe island of Anjouan in the Union of the Comoros. \n United Nations reform remains a matter of \nprimary importance to the international community. \nReform has indeed become a necessity dictated by the \ncurrent dynamics in the international arena. However, \nwhile we commend the efforts of the Open-ended \nWorking Group on Security Council Reform, which \nwas chaired by the President of the General Assembly \nduring its previous session, we feel that the process has \nbeen extremely slow because of broad differences \nbetween the various groups. Nonetheless, we welcome \nthe consensus reached on the recommendations of the \nOpen-ended Working Group at the end of the sixty-\nsecond session (decision 62/557). However, we believe \nthat genuine United Nations reform is reform which \nplaces decision-making power in the hands of the \nGeneral Assembly, the world parliament, while \ntransforming the Security Council into an executive \nbody that enforces the Assembly\u2019s decisions. We can \nthus surmount the veto obstacle which has \nconcentrated international decision-making power in \nthe five permanent members of the Council. \n My country therefore calls for the convening of a \nhigh-level General Assembly meeting on United \nNations reform, to be held in a European country so \nthat all world leaders can attend. In that context, we \nwish to emphasize that Africa, which is the only \ncontinent with no permanent representation on the \nSecurity Council despite the fact that it represents more \n \n \n33 08-53135 \n \nthan one fourth of the total membership of the United \nNations, deserves permanent membership on an equal \nfooting with other geographical regions. That \nrepresentation should be given to the African Union \nrather than to any one of its members. \n We have reached the midpoint of the period set \nfor the achievement of the Millennium Development \nGoals. We express our concern regarding the inability \nof many developing countries and least developed \ncountries, especially in Africa, to achieve the Goals, \nwe affirm that it is imperative for the international \ncommunity to fulfil its commitments in the field of \ndevelopment assistance, address problems related to \nthe international trade system, make the World Trade \nOrganization more effective, and facilitate the \naccession to membership of that organization by \ndeveloping countries. \n In that regard, we welcomed the convening of the \nhigh-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly on \n22 September 2008, on the theme of Africa\u2019s \ndevelopment needs. We support the political \ndeclaration adopted at the meeting (resolution 63/1). \nWe also welcomed the high-level event on the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), held on \n25 September 2008. Furthermore, we look forward to \nthe international follow-up conference on financing for \ndevelopment to review the implementation of the \nMonterrey Consensus, to be held in Doha and we hope \nthat the Conference will achieve its desired goals. \n In that context, my country has contributed to the \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \nthrough its proposed \u201cQadhafi Road\u201d across the desert, \nwhich will connect the northern parts of the African \ncontinent with the western and southern parts. It will \nbe an important artery that will enhance trade among \nthe continent\u2019s countries. \n Corruption, bribery, money-laundering and the \nsmuggling of funds from illegal sources are among the \nmajor factors which hamper development and the \nachievement of the MDGs in developing countries, \nespecially in Africa. Huge damage is inflicted on \ndeveloping countries as a result of the smuggling of \nfunds across borders, which deprives those countries of \nthe benefits of those funds, which are deposited in \nforeign banks. As the General Assembly has \nemphasized in its decisions, those funds should be \nreturned to countries of origin. I must also note that \nthere are safe havens that have always been associated \nwith banking confidentiality, to the point where they \nhave become known as corridors for criminal money-\nlaundering and safe havens for stolen funds and \nplundered wealth. \n It is no longer acceptable to remain silent on \nthose safe havens, whose financial institutions provide \nprotection for money generated from corruption and \ncrime. Those funds are often used by terrorist groups \nand organized crime gangs to threaten the security and \nstability of States. \n My country was among the first States to \nhighlight the food crisis. The High-Level Conference \non Food Security, held in Rome in June, was a \nresponsible response from world leaders to the food \ncrisis and the unprecedented increases in the prices of \nfood, basic commodities and energy. I would like in \nthat respect to thank the Secretary-General of the \nUnited Nations and the Director-General of the Food \nand Agriculture Organization for their efforts in that \nfield.  \n To confront that problem, my country has \nadopted development projects and programmes which \naim to achieve food security through improved \ninvestment in the agricultural sector and through \nsupport for farmers. In the African sphere, my country \nhas allocated $5 billion to finance several development \nprojects in order to achieve food security in a number \nof Sahelo-Saharan African States. It is also in the \nprocess of financing seven additional projects in \nAfrican countries. \n The food crisis has been a topic of personal \nconcern for our brother Muammar al-Qadhafi, the \nLeader of the Revolution, who in June, at the tenth \nsession of the summit conference of the Community of \nSahelo-Saharan States, held in Benin, presented his \ninitiative for the provision of food and the mitigation \nof the hunger crisis in Africa. The initiative is based on \nthe establishment of a self-sustaining mechanism and \nthe harnessing of modern machinery and technology to \nreclaim lands and farm vast areas in Africa, through the \nlaunching of a green campaign. The campaign will \nmake it possible to farm vast areas of land in the \nSahelo-Saharan States by mechanized means instead of \ntraditional methods. \n Developed countries can help Africa find a \nsolution to the food crisis by increasing agricultural \ndevelopment assistance and investment in projects such \nas hydroelectric dams and development projects in lake \n  \n \n08-53135 34 \n \nareas, such as Lake Chad. Such investments will make \na great contribution to agricultural development on the \nAfrican continent. \n Climate change and its negative impact will \nhamper the development efforts of many developing \ncountries and will undermine their development gains. \nLibya is among the States affected by climate change, \nas it is located in an arid/semi-arid geographical area, \nand most of its territory is desert. Libya also suffers \nfrom desertification and water scarcity. Libya has made \npersistent efforts to address these challenges, including \nthrough the Great Man-Made River Project network, \nwhich is intended to overcome the problems of \ndesertification and drought. \n Confronting climate change requires an effective \nand well coordinated international effort, based on the \nprinciple of common but differentiated responsibility \nagreed upon in the Rio Conference. From that \nperspective, we call for accelerated efforts to reach a \ncomprehensive international agreement to address the \nroot causes of climate change and to provide \nadaptation measures to developing countries. \n We believe in the purposes of the United Nations \nCharter, which calls for the establishment of a world in \nwhich peace and security prevail. The elimination of \nweapons of mass destruction is an essential factor in \nbuilding confidence and promoting world peace, \nstability and security, and my country has voluntarily \nrelinquished all its programmes to develop \ninternationally prohibited weapons of mass destruction, \nwhile emphasizing the right to use atomic energy for \npeaceful purposes. But we strongly oppose the use of \ndouble standards on the issue of nuclear \nnon-proliferation. We condemn any discrimination \nbetween one State and another in this respect and call \nfor making the Middle East a region free from all \nweapons of mass destruction. \n The Ottawa Convention on anti-personnel mines \nshould be reviewed to reflect the concerns of many \ncountries, such as requiring States that lay landmines to \nremove them and to address the inflicted damage, \nincluding by providing treatment and compensation for \nthe injured and by rehabilitating the damaged \nenvironment. \n Terrorism remains a matter of concern for all \nmembers of the international community. Despite all \nthe measures taken to combat terrorism, thanks to \ninternational cooperation under the United Nations \numbrella, this issue still poses a challenge to the \ninternational community and is an obstacle to the \nachievement of development, security and stability in \nmany parts of the world. \n Eradicating this phenomenon requires the \nadoption of a specific definition of terrorism. Terrorism \nmust not be confused with the legitimate right of \npeoples to resist foreign occupation and claim their \nright to freedom, independence and self-determination. \nFurthermore, associating terrorism with any specific \nreligion, nationality or culture is bound to inflame \nconflict among civilizations, religions and cultures. \nSuch a situation is untenable and is incompatible with \nthe goal of international relations based on mutual \nrespect among States, cultures and systems of \ngovernment. In this regard, we wish to point out that \npolicies and practices of foreign occupation based on \nviolations of human rights guaranteed by all \ninternational instruments and conventions constitute \none of the worst forms of terrorism in our modern \nworld. \n The United Nations Convention relating to the \nStatus of Refugees, adopted in 1951, provides an ideal \ndefinition of refugee status, in addition to the definition \nincluded in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human \nRights. It is therefore regrettable that some States use \nthis concept to camouflage their intentions regarding \nother States. Under the pretext of fostering democracy \nand respect for human rights, which is a noble goal, \nthose countries have opened the door of political \nasylum to all seekers, including thieves, smugglers of \ntheir countries\u2019 wealth, fugitives from prosecution and \nterrorists, enabling them to continue their subversive \nactivities against their home countries. My country \nbelieves that it is of paramount importance to establish \ninternational criteria and controls governing political \nasylum, while carefully observing human rights. We \nalso believe that such criteria and controls would have \na positive impact on the fight against corruption and \nterrorism while promoting democracy and preventing \narmed conflict. \n The Palestinian people are still suffering under \nthe Israeli occupation, which has lasted for more than \n60 years, subjecting Palestinians to the worst forms of \noccupation and destruction directed against civilians. \nThe achievement of peace and stability in the area is \nimpeded by the unjust siege imposed by the Israeli \noccupation forces on 1.5 million Palestinians in the \nGaza Strip and the continuation of settlement activities \n \n \n35 08-53135 \n \non occupied Palestinian territory, ignoring and \ndeliberately breaching the principles of international \nhumanitarian law and the principles of human rights, \ncoupled with policies of home demolition, land \nconfiscation, the displacement of populations and the \nintensification of arrests. \n Indeed, peace and stability in the area can only be \nattained through the return of all Palestinian refugees \nto their homeland and the establishment of a \ndemocratic State on the land of Palestine in which \nArabs and Jews can live, enjoying full rights and \nobligations, as our brother, the Leader of the \nRevolution, proposed in his recent book. \n My country has always emphasized that there can \nbe no comprehensive peace in the Middle East unless \nthe Israeli occupation of the Syrian Golan and the \nLebanese territories is ended. In this framework, we \nreiterate our call to the international community to \ndemand and enforce the withdrawal of Israeli \noccupation forces from all occupied Arab lands and to \nensure that their rightful owners are compensated for \ndamages suffered as a consequence of that occupation. \n My country welcomes the tangible improvement \nin the security situation in Iraq and believes that \nstability in that fraternal country depends on the \nachievement of genuine national reconciliation which \nwould overcome sectarian and religious differences \nand lead to the withdrawal of foreign forces. \n We express our deep concern at the situation in \nSomalia. My country is of the opinion that the \ninternational community should expeditiously dispatch \nforces to that country, in coordination with the African \nUnion, to protect civilians and humanitarian workers \nand to assist in the implementation of the Djibouti \nAgreement, in order to put an end to the long suffering \nof the Somali people.

        "file_text": "This session of the General \nAssembly is taking place at a time when the \ninternational community is faced with formidable \nchallenges and threats of a much more complex nature. \nGlobal problems ranging from poverty, violence, \ninequality and disparity, terrorism, natural disasters and \nother acute problems have been further impeded by the \ncurrent global financial, food and energy crisis. As we \nlive in an increasingly globalized and interdependent \nworld the solutions demand our concerted action. \n The main theme of this session, namely, the \nimpact of the global food crisis on poverty and hunger \nin the world, is most timely. Steep increases in staple \nfood prices lead to a global food crisis. Today millions \nof vulnerable people in poor countries who were \nprobably making ends meet, face even greater \nchallenges. It is a tragic setback that more than \n75 million additional people have been driven into \nhunger and poverty because of the food crisis. The \neconomic challenges posed by soaring food prices are \ndaunting. They take a toll on inflation rates, breed \neconomic protectionism, and further impede economic \ndevelopment for developing nations. Those countries \nalso had to cope with consequent macroeconomic \nimplications concerning the nexus between food price \nincreases and the overall inflation rate.  \n The Government of Mongolia, having recognized \nthe urgent need to address the food crisis, took the \nnecessary actions at both policy and practical levels to \nreduce its severe impact on the vulnerable strata of its \npopulation. My Government has designated this year as \nthe year for food supply and safety and aims to achieve \nthree main objectives: promoting food production to \nreduce the country\u2019s dependence on imported goods; \n \n \n43 08-51839 \n \nraising public awareness about food quality; and \nensuring safe food production and processing in the \ncountry.  \n In pursuit of the first objective I launched at the \nbeginning of this year the third national crop \nrehabilitation drive, or campaign to reclaim virgin \nlands, to revive domestic agricultural production. As a \nresult of that nationwide campaign Mongolia is \nexpected to ensure self-sufficiency in major staple food \nproducts by 2010.  \n Countries throughout the world find themselves \nintimately affected by oil price hikes. In our case the \nsituation is aggravated by the fact that the surge in \nimported petroleum prices tends to be followed by \noverall price increases. Coal remains the primary \nenergy source used for electricity and heating in many \ncountries. The use of inefficient coal-burning \ntechnology causes air pollution, impacting negatively \non the population\u2019s health and the environment. \nTherefore, research, development and deployment of \nclean coal technology are indeed top energy priorities \nfor coal-producing countries such as Mongolia.  \n The most effective way to mitigate these factors \nis to improve energy efficiency and pursue energy \ndiversification. In this regard, Mongolia commends the \nefforts of Member States and international \norganizations in research and development and the \ndeployment and transfer of innovative energy \ntechnologies such as renewable sources, cleaner and \nlower carbon technologies and nuclear power. These \nefforts are crucial as we seek to reduce our dependence \non fossil fuels. Ensuring energy security is a challenge \nthat requires a comprehensive solution both nationally \nand internationally. No country in the world is \nendowed with or has developed all possible energy \nsources, so every country has a vested interest in \nenergy cooperation and has something to contribute to \nit.  \n Mongolia gives special priority to energy \ncooperation in our region. An institutional foundation \nfor such cooperation has already been laid with regular \nsessions of the Senior Officials Committee on Energy \nCooperation in North-East Asia. The first session of the \nCommittee, hosted by the Mongolian Government in \nNovember 2005, established the Intergovernmental \nCollaborative Mechanism on Energy Cooperation in \nNorth-East Asia.  \n The Tavan Tolgoi, Mongolia\u2019s huge coal coking \nproject has an important role to play in such \nsubregional cooperation. Such subregional cooperation \nin the energy sector, combined with ongoing efforts to \nspur the implementation of the Greater Tumen River \nInitiative, could be conducive to furthering the \nprospect for economic integration in North-East Asia, \none of the most dynamic and diverse regions of the \nworld. \n Since the adoption of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) in 2000, we have passed \nthe midpoint in our efforts to implement them. \nProgress on MDG implementation around the globe \nreveals a sharply contrasting picture. Some countries \nfind themselves in more advanced stages of \nachievement, while others are still lagging far behind \non all or many important Goals. Thus, there is an \nurgent need to foster an effective global cooperation \naimed at assisting off-track countries in their efforts to \nreach the relevant targets by 2015. In this regard, my \ndelegation looks forward to tomorrow\u2019s high-level \ndiscussion to come up with bold and specific \ncommitments to action. \n With rich deposits of coal, copper, gold, \nmolybdenum and uranium, most of them still largely \nuntapped, Mongolia indeed has an unprecedented \nopportunity to embark upon the path of rapid economic \ngrowth and sustainable development \u2014 if we are able \nto overcome the partisan divisions which have in our \nrecent past all too often obstructed our onward \nmovement. It is with this in mind that the two main \npolitical parties, in an unprecedented move, set aside \ntheir long-standing differences and formed a unity \nGovernment only a few days ago, following the fifth \ndemocratic general elections, of 29 June.  \n The result of the elections, concluded to have \nbeen free and fair by more than 80 observers from \nmore than 20 countries, gave an undeniable majority to \nmy party, the Mongolian People\u2019s Revolutionary Party \n(MPRP) with 45 out of the total of 76 seats in \nparliament. However, in the face of the pressing need \nto forge a national consensus on major development \nissues, the MPRP has decided voluntarily to give away \nits right to unilaterally form its own Government and \nhas concluded an agreement with the Mongolian \nDemocratic Party. Our two parties\u2019 historic decision to \nwork hand in hand is testimony to our commitment to \nthe well-being and prosperity of the people of \nMongolia. \n  \n \n08-51839 44 \n \n I call it the fourth historic choice of my people \nover the last 100 years, following the declaration of \nindependence in 1911, the abolition of feudalism in \n1921-1924 and the embrace of democracy in 1990. I \nam most confident that this unity will greatly \ncontribute to pulling our efforts together to collectively \nsucceed in achieving the MDGs by 2015 and our \nMDG-based comprehensive national development \nstrategy by 2021, thus substantially improving the \nliving standards of our people and upgrading Mongolia \nto a middle-income country. \n In our globalized world, no nation can achieve its \ngoals all on its own. That includes Mongolia. \nConstructive engagement in world affairs through \nmultilateral cooperation mechanisms, with the United \nNations at the centre, and deeper integration into the \nworld economy will thus continue to be the cornerstone \nof Mongolia\u2019s foreign policy. I understand all too well \nthat the existence of a stable, peaceful and prosperous \n  \nworld is a condition for the fulfilment of my \nGovernment\u2019s \u2014 or any other Government\u2019s \u2014 \npromise to its people.  \n With this in mind, I wish to reaffirm Mongolia\u2019s \nstrong resolve to continue its active engagement in the \nwork of the United Nations and other multilateral \norganizations and processes, and our commitment to \nthe world Organization as a central coordinating \ninstrument of the common efforts of the family of \nnations to address the complex challenges of our times.

Those efforts are designed to deepen \nunderstanding and awareness of climate change and to \nimprove weather forecasting in order to save lives and \nproperty, to discourage human practices that are \ndetrimental to the environment and to educate people \nto live in harmony with it.  \n More than ever before, however, we are called \nupon to intensify and double our efforts and joint \ncooperation in order to deal with such circumstances in \na constructive and practical way. We must support \npurposeful scientific research aimed at finding creative \nmeans, policies and plans to guarantee a stable and \nsustainable environment while taking into account \nphysical evidence related to climatic cycles and \nenvironmental change through the ages. We hope that \nthe fourteenth climate change Conference, to be held in \nCopenhagen next year, will produce practical and \nuseful recommendations that meet our hopes and \naspirations. \n Economic development and trade among nations \nhave helped build bridges of communication based on \nmutual benefits and common interests. The current \ntrade system, however, is in dire need of a vision and \nsystems that keep pace with economic transformations \nand with emerging economic entities in order to \nmaintain the balance of the global economy and to \ncater to the needs of developing countries. \n Large industrial countries need to lift trade \nrestrictions on the exports of developing countries and \nto share with them modern technologies, effective \nmarketing mechanisms, and educational and scientific \nframeworks that guarantee meaningful human \ndevelopment everywhere. The World Trade \nOrganization (WTO) should play a more effective role \ntowards the removal of trade restrictions and the \napplication of appropriate policies so as to create a \nfreer trade environment. \n While we welcome the invitation by the Director-\nGeneral of the WTO, Mr. Pascal Lamy, to hold another \nround of trade negotiations in the context of the Doha \nDevelopment Agenda, we would like to emphasize that \nsuch negotiations should rely on WTO rules that are \nrooted in equity and justice. \n Everyone knows that the Palestinians are \nsuffering the repercussions of tragic human \ncircumstances that have deprived them of their right to \na life of dignity. The harsh Israeli policies of closures, \nthe erection of checkpoints and the perpetuation of \nsettlement activities make the daily lives of \nPalestinians very difficult. Those practices also \nundermine efforts and initiatives to achieve peace and \nstability. Indeed, they call into question the credibility \n A/63/PV.13\n \n21 08-53122 \n \nof Israel\u2019s desire to seek a real solution to end the \nconflict. \n We urge the international community to step up \nits efforts to make Israel shoulder its responsibilities, in \nview of the importance and inevitability of peace as the \nonly option for joint and harmonious coexistence \nbetween all peoples of the region. It has become clear \nthat there can be no peace without the restoration of the \nlegitimate rights of the Palestinian people, foremost of \nwhich is their right to live safely on their land and in \ntheir independent State, side by side with Israel and \nwithin internationally recognized boundaries. \n Our commitment to peace is strategic and \nfundamental. Ensuring peace is a collective \nresponsibility of the international community that \nshould be forcefully and selflessly shouldered, \nregardless of the difficulties encountered. On that \nbasis, the Sultanate of Oman, in the context of its \nfriendly relations and cooperation with many countries, \nis ever eager to promote long-term relations as a \nfundamental pillar of joint efforts in support of peace, \nsecurity, dialogue, mutual understanding and harmony. \n The progress made towards Lebanese \nreconciliation is an achievement that invites optimism. \nWhile we praise the efforts made by the State of Qatar \nand all other Arab States, as well as by the League of \nArab States, we call upon all Lebanese parties to \nimplement the Doha Agreement in order to safeguard \nthe higher interests of the brotherly Lebanese people. \nWe also welcome the visit to Syria by Lebanese \nPresident Michel Sleiman and its positive outcome, \nincluding the agreement to establish diplomatic ties \nbetween the two countries. \n With regard to the situation in Iraq, we note with \nsatisfaction the relative improvements in the country\u2019s \nsecurity conditions. We hope that the situation will \ncontinue to improve until stability prevails throughout \nIraq. We also hope for continued efforts by the Iraqi \nGovernment and all political forces to reach a \ncomprehensive national understanding that can unite \nall sectors of Iraqi society and restore harmony and \nconcord to its national and social fabric. \n As for the situation in the Sudanese region of \nDarfur, we welcome the steps being taken by the \nSudanese Government, in cooperation with the African \nUnion and the League of Arab States, to establish \npeace and stability in the region. We therefore call \nupon the international community to support those \nefforts in order to help build a national consensus \namong all brotherly Sudanese citizens. \n From this rostrum, we reiterate our call to all \nSomali parties to cease fighting and to refrain from any \nactions that could hamper sound diplomatic efforts. We \nalso hope that all parties will abide by the agreement \nreached in Djibouti on 9 June 2008. \n In addition, we call for continued consultations \nbetween the Islamic Republic of Iran and other States \non the Iranian nuclear issue. We hope that those efforts \nwill result in an agreement that upholds Iran\u2019s right to \nuse nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, while \neliminating the concerns of a number of States \nregarding the Iranian nuclear programme. \n The Games of the XXIX Olympiad, hosted by the \nfriendly People\u2019s Republic of China in Beijing, were \nunique in terms of their organization, which definitely \nmade that international sports event a great success. \nThe Games have enriched human civilization in all of \nits beautiful cultural diversity. We wish to take this \nopportunity to express our best wishes for the next \nOlympic Games, which will be hosted by the United \nKingdom in London in 2012, as well as our hope that \nthey will continue to contribute to human and cultural \ncoexistence among all nations. \n The progress that has already been made in the \nfield of collaborative international endeavours \nencourages us to make further collective efforts to \naddress the challenges facing us and to protect the \npeoples of the world from their political, economic and \nsocial repercussions. We also wish to emphasize the \nimportance of a joint commitment to the establishment \nof justice and the rule of law. Governments must \nshoulder their responsibilities in a spirit of positive \ncooperation, understanding and mutual respect, which \nare basic principles of international peace and security. \n In closing, I wish the President of the General \nAssembly the best of luck in leading the present \nsession to a successful conclusion. I should like to \nreaffirm the support of the Sultanate of Oman for \nefforts to ensure the welfare of all nations and future \ngenerations. We hope that all of this will be achieved in \nan atmosphere of cooperation, harmony and love. "

Let us not forget that if we are \ngathered here today, it is because following one of the \nmost terrible tragedies that humankind has ever known, \nthere were men and women of good will who were \ndetermined that in the future no one could ever say, \nwhen faced with misfortune: \u201cThere is nothing we can \n \n \n13 08-51570 \n \ndo.\u201d That is why we are here, because those who went \nbefore us did not renounce their responsibility. Europe \nbelieves that today, our duty is to act and to refuse to \nsubmit.  \n We can wait no longer. We are beginning to \ngauge the tragic consequences of having already \nwaited too long. We cannot wait to achieve peace, to \nend the tragedy in Darfur. We cannot wait to fight \nterrorism, to avert the food crisis that condemns so \nmany human beings to die of hunger. We cannot wait \nto prepare for the post-petroleum world, to fight global \nwarming, to save the oceans, to put an end to monetary, \nsocial and ecological dumping. We cannot wait to bring \nethics to financial capitalism.  \n For too long we have all been resigned to being \npowerless. For too long we have retreated before the \nneed to give to the globalized world institutions that \nwill enable it to be regulated. \n The world of the twenty-first century cannot be \ngoverned with the institutions of the twentieth century. \nWe are a century behind. Let today\u2019s major Powers and \nthe Powers of tomorrow unite to shoulder together the \nresponsibilities their influence gives them in world \naffairs.  \n To all those who are hesitant, I wish to say that \nenlarging the Security Council and the G-8 is not just a \nmatter of fairness, it is also a question of effectiveness. \nWe can no longer wait to turn the G-8 into the G14 and \nto bring in China, India, South Africa, Mexico and \nBrazil. Italy is proposing a major step in that direction \nat the next summit, which it will host, and Italy is \nright. \n Let us act to make our international institutions \nmore representative, because if they are more \nrepresentative they will be stronger, more effective and \nmore respected. A new world is emerging not only \nthrough all our successes, but also through all the \ncrises besetting the planet. However, we cannot receive \nthat new world passively, we must build it. \n Let us learn to manage together the most acute \ncrises that no one, not even the most powerful among \nus, can resolve alone. I am convinced that it is the duty \nof the heads of State and Government of the countries \nmost directly concerned to meet before the end of the \nyear to examine together the lessons of the most \nserious financial crisis the world has experienced since \nthat of the 1930s. Who would understand it if the \nworld\u2019s major economies should fail to take the time to \nmeet to discuss what we must do together and the \nlessons we must draw from what has happened? \n Let us rebuild together a regulated capitalism, in \nwhich entire swathes of financial activity are not left to \nthe sole judgement of market operators; in which banks \ndo their job; which is to finance economic development \nrather than to fuel speculation; in which rules of \nprudence apply to all and serve to avert and soften \nshocks instead of exacerbating them; in which the \ncredit agencies are controlled and punished when \nnecessary; in which transparency of transactions \nreplaces such opacity that today it is difficult to \nunderstand what is happening; and in which modes of \nremuneration do not drive people to take unreasonable \nrisks. It is my duty to say that those who jeopardize \npeople\u2019s savings should be punished and at last face up \nto their responsibilities. We will succeed in that on the \ncondition that we work together. \n In our globalized world, the fate of each is linked \nto that of all others. The negotiations on climate \nchange, begun in Bali, will conclude in Copenhagen \nnext year. Whatever our particular interests, we do not \nhave the right to fail. \n Europe will adopt an unprecedented raft of \nmeasures on energy and climate in December. Europe \ndoes not wish to teach lessons; it wishes to set an \nexample. Europe also wishes to set the example by \nacting to bring about peace. It did so in Georgia. It did \nso with the Union for the Mediterranean. Because for \nover half a century Europe has undertaken to stop the \nendless cycle of war, vengeance and hate that has \nperiodically taken it to the edge of the precipice, it \ndoes not want war. It does not want a war of \ncivilizations. It does not want a war of religion. It does \nnot want a cold war.  \n Europe wants peace, and because it wants peace \nit says to Russia that it wants links of solidarity with \nthat country, that it wants to build a shared future, and \nthat it wants to be Russia\u2019s partner. Why not build a \ncontinent-wide common economic space that would \nunite Russia and Europe? However, Europe also says \nto Russia with the same sincerity that it cannot \ncompromise on the principle of the sovereignty and \nindependence of States, their territorial integrity or \nrespect for international law. Europe\u2019s message to all \nStates is that it cannot accept the use of force to settle a \ndispute. \n  \n \n08-51570 14 \n \n Europe says to Iran that it respects that country, \nthat Iran has the right to civil nuclear energy and that it \nwill explore all avenues of dialogue. However, it says \nto Iran with the same sincerity that it cannot accept a \nnuclear-armed Iran that would endanger the peace and \nstability of the whole region. Nor can Europe \ntolerate \u2014 and I say this solemnly \u2014 Iran calling for \nthe destruction of the State of Israel. \n Europe says to Israel that it is its friend and that it \nwill let no one threaten its existence. Europe says to \nIsrael that it will always be at its side in the fight \nagainst terrorism, but with the same sincerity says to \ntelling Israel that there will be no peace until there is a \nviable Palestinian State with recognized borders. \n Europe says to Afghanistan that it will continue \nto stand by it and that it will not permit barbarians \nallied with Al-Qaida again to take an entire people \nhostage and to turn an entire country into a terrorist \nbase.  \n Europe says to Somalia that it will help it, with \nthe support of the United Nations, to combat the \nscourge of piracy off its coasts. Until all States join \ntogether to establish a maritime police force, we cannot \nallow some hundreds of pirates to threaten the free \npassage of ships throughout the world. \n Europe says to Africa that it is committed to \nco-development, that it wishes to be Africa\u2019s privileged \npartner, and that it has a common destiny with Africa \nand a profound sense of solidarity. Europe says to \nAfrica that it has its place among the permanent \nmembers of the Security Council and in the enlarged \nG-8. How can one ever hope to settle the great issues \nof the world while ignoring Africa, South America or a \nlarge part of Asia? Europe believes in the African \nrenaissance, which is under way and, first and \nforemost, is in the hands of the Africans, particularly \nthose of African youth, which is the youth of the world. \n Essentially, what brings us here together in this \nforum, where everyone must listen to the others and \nthereby show them a form of respect, is something \nmore basic even than democracy. What brings us \ntogether is respect for the dignity of all just as they are, \nand for diversity of their opinions, cultures and beliefs. \nHuman dignity is a universal value. What we must \npromote everywhere is respect for that diversity, which \nis the surest guarantor of peace and human fraternity \nand the surest antidote to intolerance, hatred, violence, \nobscurantism and fanaticism. \n That is what Europe wants: peoples united in \nrespect, understanding and solidarity; peoples united \nthroughout the world working together for the great \ncommon cause of safeguarding of humanity. Time is at \na premium; the world cannot wait. "

        "file_text": "It is my \ngreat pleasure, Sir, to convey to you the heartfelt \ncongratulations of the delegation of Mali upon your \nelection to the presidency of the sixty-third session of \nthe General Assembly, and to assure you of our full \nsupport. I should like also to hail Secretary-General \nBan Ki-moon for his devotion and commitment to our \nOrganization. \n The sixty-third session of the General Assembly \nis opening with the timely theme of the impact of the \nglobal food crisis on poverty and hunger throughout \nthe world. Indeed, it takes place in a difficult \ninternational context, one marked by the conjunction of \nfood and energy crises. This situation is of concern to \nmy delegation, as it is a potential source of generalized \nsocial and political instability. \n What can we do? In Mali, we have granted the \nhighest priority to the fight against poverty and the \nhigh cost of living. In this respect, the Government has \nundertaken a series of measures to stem the effects of \nthe present crisis through, inter alia, a temporary \nsuspension of import duties and taxes on basic \nfoodstuffs, such as rice, wheat flour, oil and milk, as \n A/63/PV.13\n \n11 08-53122 \n \nwell as subsidizing gas, hydrocarbons and agricultural \ninputs.  \n My country, Mali, is firmly determined to achieve \nfood self-sufficiency and to become, in the medium \nterm, an agricultural Power. To that end, we have made \nagriculture the principal tool to attain accelerated \ngrowth. Accordingly, an agricultural framework law \nhas been adopted, and its progressive implementation \nhas included the following measures. \n First and foremost, the new law contains a \nmeasure to launch the rice initiative, which was \ndesigned as a proactive and structural response to the \ndizzying increase in price of grain products on global \nmarkets. Next, the law includes the setting up of a \nnational agricultural development fund and a fund for \nemergencies and disasters. It also involves the setting \nup of land commissions and a programme to develop \nlow-lying lands within the framework of local \nirrigation works. Finally, it involves the setting up of a \nhigh council for agriculture. In addition, we will soon \nadopt guidelines for the marketing of grain products, \nincluding rice, and a mechanism for supplying \nagricultural inputs.  \n Along these same lines, the Government of Mali \nhas prepared and implemented a national strategy to \nfight poverty, a strategic framework for fighting \npoverty and a strategic framework for growth and \npoverty reduction for the period 2007-2011. \n In addition, our Social and Economic \nDevelopment Project has been conceived by the \nPresident of the Republic, Mr. Amadou Toumani Tour\u00e9. \nIt should enable Mali to increase its production and \nfairly share the fruits of growth, invest in the future \nand build a State of good governance and the rule of \nlaw. \n The fight against corruption is another aspect of \nthis overall project. The national convention that will \nbe organized to address this issue in October 2008 \nshould enable the Malian nation to seek through broad \nconsultation a comprehensive understanding of the \nphenomenon in order to define a plan of action against \nthe scourge.  \n Seeking to promote transparent and effective \nmanagement of its public finances, Mali, which has \njoined the African Union\u2019s African Peer Review \nMechanism, has submitted its governance to that \nevaluation process. This exercise, which will be \nconcluded in January 2009, will take stock of the \nsituation, including in the field of political governance, \nbusiness governance and governance of socio-\neconomic development. It will result in \nrecommendations for improvements in those areas. \n In the same vein, the human rights situation in \nMali has been considered within the framework of the \nnew universal periodic review mechanism set up within \nthe context of the Human Rights Council. From this \nrostrum, laden as it is with symbolism, I would like to \nreiterate the commitment of the Government of Mali to \ntake concrete action on the relevant recommendations \nthat we are committed to following at the outcome of \nthis process.  \n Mali remains convinced that the prevention and \npeaceful settlement of conflicts is the best possible \nguarantee of international peace and security. Backed \nby that belief, my country firmly made the choice of \ndialogue aimed at finding a lasting solution to the \nsituation of insecurity that has prevailed in the north-\neast of our country. In this respect, the Algiers peace \nagreement of 4 July 2006 remains relevant, as it \npreserves our territorial integrity and our national \nunity, by enabling the various strands of the Malian \nnation to fully participate in the national construction \nendeavour.  \n Aware that security in the Sahelo-Saharan region \nis closely linked to that of States and peoples sharing \nthe space and that conflicts affecting one country can \nrapidly spread throughout the region, the Government \nof Mali, in October 2008, will organize in Bamako a \nconference on peace, security and development in the \nSahelo-Saharan region.  \n The conference will provide a useful opportunity \nfor the States of the region to jointly reaffirm our \ncommitment to turn our shared space into a zone of \npeace and security, a centre of stability, growth and \ndevelopment. It will also provide us with responses \nadapted to the problems and challenges we face: \ninsecurity, transborder banditry, terrorism and \ntrafficking of all types, including trafficking in drugs, \narms and human beings. \n Here, Mali considers that it is the duty of the \ninternational community to take vigorous action to \nmaintain and build international peace and security. In \nthis respect, we welcome and encourage progress \nA/63/PV.13  \n \n08-53122 12 \n \nachieved in the resolution of conflicts and crises that \nrack the African continent, including those in C\u00f4te \nd\u2019Ivoire, the Sudan, Somalia and the Great Lakes \nregion.  \n Mali calls for the resumption of the negotiating \nprocess in the Middle East and reaffirms its \nunswerving support for the creation of a sovereign and \nindependent Palestinian State. \n There are many other serious challenges facing \nthe international community to which we will have to \nrespond appropriately to build a better world together. \nFirst and foremost, there is the problem of climate \nchange. Today more than ever before, the very survival \nof our planet is threatened by climate change, which \nhas a serious impact on living conditions in developing \ncountries such as mine through, inter alia, \ndesertification, the silting up of rivers, the deterioration \nof the environment, a reduction of the length of the \nwinter periods, floods and poor rainfall patterns. We \nshould, therefore, urgently undertake measures which \nare commensurate with the pressing nature of the \nproblem. In this respect, the conclusions of the high-\nlevel event on climate change in 2007 and those of the \nBali Climate Change Conference in the same year are \nstill relevant and are worthy of being implemented in a \ndiligent way. Mali, which is a party to the Kyoto \nProtocol, is eager to make a useful contribution to the \nfifteenth United Nations Climate Change Conference, \nto be held in Copenhagen in December 2009. \n The second major challenge to which we must \ndevote particular attention is the HIV/AIDS pandemic, \nwhich poses one of the most serious threats to \nsustainable development. We must redouble our efforts \nand our resolve to implement the 2001 Declaration of \nCommitment, as well as the outcomes of the high-level \nmeetings on AIDS and the seventeenth International \nAIDS Conference, held in Mexico last August. All of \nthese forums have highlighted the severity of the \nsituation and stressed the urgent need to act and to \nmobilize resources to fight the pandemic.  \n The third significant challenge for the \ninternational community is the situation of landlocked \ndeveloping countries, which, as a result of their \nisolation and their great distance from the world\u2019s main \nmarkets, are confronted with serious handicaps. I \ncongratulate the Secretary-General for having taken the \ninitiative to convene, following the general debate, a \nhigh-level plenary meeting devoted to the midterm \nreview of the Almaty Programme of Action. Mali will \nactively participate in that meeting and will work to \nensure that leads to operational conclusions that can \ncontribute to the comprehensive, rapid, and effective \nimplementation of the Almaty Programme of Action. \n The fourth challenge is institutional reform of the \nUnited Nations. This issue remains important as the \ncontinuation of the establishment of the Peacebuilding \nCommission and the Human Rights Council and of the \nstrengthening the Economic and Social Council. Thus, \nthe expansion of the Security Council is clearly a \npressing necessity, particularly to redress the historic \ninjustice committed against Africa, namely, that it does \nnot have a permanent seat. That is something which is \nunderscored in the joint African position on the issue. \n All these challenges which we currently face \nrequire a collective global response. Only a reformed \nand democratized United Nations may serve as a \ngenuine crucible for universal collective conscience \ncapable of best discharging its primary mission, \nnamely, to save succeeding generations from the \nscourge of war and destruction. Mali will do its full \npart in this fight. "

        "file_text": "I come before the Assembly \ntoday in the name of my late wife, Shaheed Mohtarma \nBenazir Bhutto, as a victim of terrorism representing a \nnation that is a victim of terrorism. I am a husband who \nhas seen the mother of his children give her life \nfighting the menaces of terrorism and fanaticism, \nwhich haunt the entire civilized world. In her place and \nin her honour, I come before the Assembly as the \nelected President of a democratic Pakistan who \nreceived a mandate from two thirds of our Parliament \n  \n \n08-51851 16 \n \nand assemblies. That extraordinary mandate of support \nwas a vote of confidence in her, in her doctrine and in \nher message. The vote was an act of love and a demand \nfor a democratic, moderate, modern, tolerant and \neconomically just Pakistan \u2014 the essence of the Bhutto \ndoctrine. \n It has been 11 months since the first attack on my \nwife, on 18 October 2007, was followed by the \nadoption of a United Nations resolution calling for an \ninquiry into that crime against humanity. That United \nNations resolution has so far been ineffective. After her \nassassination, on 27 December, the international \ncommunity demanded an independent inquiry \u2014 a \ndemand supported by resolutions adopted in Pakistan\u2019s \nParliament and four provincial legislatures. \n Today, we still do not know what forces and \ninstitutions were involved \u2014 who plotted and planned \nand coordinated and trained and paid for the murder of \nmy wife, my nation\u2019s beloved leader. A United Nations \ninvestigation into the murder of the leader of the \npeople of Pakistan would reassure them that the \ninternational community cares about them and that the \nUnited Nations Charter of justice is more than rhetoric. \nWe owe it to her. We owe it to history. If a country\u2019s \nPresident and his children cannot obtain justice through \nthe United Nations, how will the poor and the \ndispossessed around the world find reassurance that the \nUnited Nations is capable of protecting the weak and \nthe suffering? \n In the name of humanity and in the name of \njustice, the Organization must move forward quickly \nwith the investigation into the assassination of Shaheed \nBenazir Bhutto so that, once and for all, the people of \nPakistan and the rest of the world will know whose \nbloody hands took away one of the greatest women in \nhistory.  \n My wife courageously returned to Pakistan last \nyear, openly confronting the forces of terror. Three \nmillion people turned out to welcome Benazir and the \nreturn of democracy to Pakistan. She was a brave \nwoman who understood the dynamics of our region and \nthe world \u2014 who understood the interrelationship \nbetween politics and economics, between social \ninjustice and political dictatorship. For years, she told \nworld leaders that dictatorship fuels extremism and that \npoverty fuels fanaticism. She outlined the Bhutto \ndoctrine of reconciliation, so brilliantly presented in \nher last book. The Bhutto doctrine sets out a dual \nmission of combating dictatorship and terrorism while \npromoting social and economic reform and justice for \nthe people of Pakistan. Benazir Bhutto understood that \ndemocracy was not an end, but a beginning; that a \nstarving child has no human rights; that a father who \ncannot support his family is someone ripe for \nextremism. \n  Mr. Win (Myanmar), Vice-President took the \nChair. \n \n The Bhutto doctrine of reconciliation is a road \nmap not only to a new Pakistan, but to a new era of \npeace and cooperation between East and West and \namong people of all faiths. It is a road map that, if \nfollowed, will enable us to avoid the clash of \ncivilizations and the clash of religions, which is the \nterrorists\u2019 ultimate goal. \n The Bhutto doctrine is the new century\u2019s \nequivalent of the Marshall Plan, which saved Europe \nafter the Second World War. While the Marshall Plan \nwas based on the principle that an economically sound \nEurope could and would resist communism, the pillar \nof the Bhutto doctrine is that an economically viable \nPakistan will be the centrepiece of the victory of \npluralism over terrorism. The Bhutto doctrine will \nultimately prove to be as critical to the victory of \nfreedom in this century as the Marshall Plan was \ncritical to the triumph of liberty in the last. Ours is the \ndoctrine of reconciliation; theirs is the doctrine of \ndeath. \n Her killers thought that her elimination would \nend her dream of a democratic Pakistan and that the \nBalkanization of our region would enable the forces of \ndarkness to prevail. But our nation rallied in the \naftermath of her brutal and tragic assassination. If \nAl-Qaida and the Taliban believed that, by silencing \nShaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, they were \nsilencing her message, they were very wrong. We have \npicked up the torch and will fight against terrorists who \nattack us and terrorists who use our territory to plan \nattacks against our neighbours or anywhere in the \nworld. \n Ours is a bloody fight, and neither the personal \npain that my children and I feel nor the pain of a nation \nthat has been robbed of its greatest asset, its greatest \nleader, can be fully expressed. But the terrorists\u2019 lust \nfor blood and hate has not been satisfied. Only last \nweek, the forces of evil struck again in a bloody and \ncowardly attack against my people. A suicide truck \n \n \n17 08-51851 \n \nbomb destroyed a great building in our capital, barely a \nstone\u2019s throw away from my office and the House of \nParliament. \n Once again, Pakistan is the great victim in the \nwar on terror. And once again, our people wonder \nwhether we stand alone. Thousands of our soldiers and \ncivilians have died fighting against the common \nenemies of humanity. We have lost more soldiers than \nall the 37 countries combined that have forces in \nAfghanistan. \n The roots of today\u2019s terrorism can be traced to a \nwar involving the world\u2019s super-Powers in Afghanistan \nduring the 1980s. Afghanistan and Pakistan \u2014 and, \nincreasingly, the entire world \u2014 are reaping the bitter \nharvest sown towards the end of the cold war. The \nworld turned its back on Afghanistan after the Soviet \ndefeat. In Pakistan, we were left with 3 million \nrefugees within our borders. Their camps soon became \nbreeding grounds for intolerance and violence. The \nworld left South and Central Asia. We were left to live \nwith the consequences. And one of the greatest of those \nconsequences was the birth of Al-Qaida and the \nTalibanization of Afghanistan and parts of our tribal \nareas. \n Yet, we do not look back at history. We are \nvictims, but we will never be vanquished. On the \ncontrary, the more of our children\u2019s blood they spill, \nthe stronger is our determination to defeat them. We in \nPakistan stand united and in defiance. We are resolved \nthat our future will not be dictated by those who distort \nthe spirit and laws of Islam for their sordid politics and \npolitical goals. \n We may be the targets of international terrorism, \nbut we will never succumb to it. Towards that end, we \nreach out to this Assembly and to the entire civilized \nworld. Terrorism cannot be fought by military means \nalone. Fighting it requires political will, popular \nmobilization and a socio-economic strategy that wins \nthe hearts and minds of nations afflicted by it. \n Unilateral actions of great Powers should not \ninflame the passions of allies. Violating our nation\u2019s \nsovereignty is not helpful in eliminating the terrorist \nmenace. Indeed, such actions could have the opposite \neffect. \n Many participants in this great Hall today read \nabout terror, while we live it. We do not learn about \nterror from reading newspapers or watching the \nevening news. We see our children and our wives being \nblown up before us. Our cities, neighbourhoods, \nstreets, hotels and offices bear the brunt of the terrorist \nfanatic rage every single day.  \n A democratic Pakistan is in the process of \nreaching the national consensus necessary to confront \nand defeat the terrorists. Only a democratic \nGovernment can win this war. We are fighting the \nmenace and we will continue to do so. But this fight is \nfor the peace of the world. This fight is for the future \nof generations to come. Yes, we fight for ourselves, for \nour children, for our very soul. Yes, this war is our war, \nbut we need the moral, political and economic support \nof the international community. In our stability lies the \nworld\u2019s security. Globalization is not just economic; it \nis also political. The terrorist vision strikes out at all \nnations. We must draw a line on their rampage. And we \nmust draw that line in Pakistan. \n The question I ask the world\u2019s leaders in this \naugust Hall is whether they will stand with us, just as \nwe stand for the entire civilized world on the frontlines \nof this epic struggle of the new millennium. \n I stand before this Assembly as the President of a \ngreat nation that just recently, in a decade of brutal \nmilitary dictatorship, suffered human rights abuses and \nthe systematic destruction of the foundations of \ndemocracy and civil society. Sadly, all too often, the \nworld stood silent as dictators ruled our people with a \nbloody fist. Nations that were founded on democracy \nwere silent for reasons of expediency. My wife would \nsay that they danced with dictators. \n Today, as we meet here in New York, the \ndemocratically elected leader of Myanmar, Aung San \nSuu Kyi, continues to be imprisoned in Yangon. She \nhas suffered year after year under house arrest. The \nworld must demand that that great woman finally be \nfreed. We appreciate the efforts of Mrs. Laura Bush in \nthat regard. \n Today, the horror of terrorism that plagues our \nnation and threatens the world is a by-product of the \nlack of commitment to the values of democracy. When \nthe world betrays democracy, it sets the table for \ndisaster. We will all continue to pay the price. \n In these early years of the new millennium, there \nare two great battles before mankind. First, there is the \nbattle for democracy and liberty against dictators, the \nfight for universal human rights. That is the hallmark \n  \n \n08-51851 18 \n \nof this Organization. At the same time, we are fighting \nin the trenches of the battle that will determine the \ncourse of this century \u2014 the battle against extremism \nand terrorism, between the forces of ignorance and the \nforces of education, between bigotry and tolerance, \nbetween justice and discrimination, between \nconfrontation and reconciliation. \n Democracy is not like a switch that can be turned \non and off when it is convenient. It is a universal value \nguaranteed to all men and women. The outcome of \nthese struggles will determine whether the noble \nexperiment embodied in the hallowed halls of the \nUnited Nations will succeed or fail. The struggle \nbetween the Bhutto doctrine of reconciliation and the \nterrorists\u2019 doctrine of death will determine the future of \nmankind. Let not the extremists who would manipulate \nIslam for their political ends define us to the world. \nThey are rabid but they are few. It is time for the world \nto take notice. We are not the cause of the problem of \nterrorism; we are its victims. \n We are an aggrieved nation, not one that has \ncaused grief. We have largely fought this battle alone. \nWe have shared our airbases, our airspace, our \nintelligence and our armed forces in a coordinated \neffort to contain terrorism. \n It is time for the developed world to step up to \nthe plate to help us and in turn help itself. The fight \nagainst terrorism and extremism is a fight for the hearts \nand minds of people. It cannot be won by guns and \nbombs alone. The fight must be multifaceted. The \nbattleground must be economic and social as well as \nmilitary.  \n We will win when people are mobilized against \nfanatics. To mobilize them, we have to give them hope \nand opportunity for their future. They need jobs. Their \nchildren need education. They must be fed. They must \nhave energy. We must give people a stake in their own \ngovernment and we must demonstrate to them that \ndemocracy works, that democratic governance can \nimprove their everyday life. \n An economically viable Pakistan will be a stable \nPakistan. And a stable Pakistan will suck the oxygen \nout of the terrorist agenda. Economic justice and \npolitical democracy are the worst nightmares of \nterrorists. We must all fight this epic battle together as \nallies and partners.  \n But just as we will not let Pakistan\u2019s territory be \nused by terrorists for attacks against our people and our \nneighbours, so we cannot allow our territory and our \nsovereignty to be violated by our friends. Attacks \nwithin Pakistan that violate our sovereignty actually \nserve to empower the forces against which we fight \ntogether.  \n I am a democratic President of a democratic \ncountry that intends to be a model to our region and to \nour religion. I am the President of a vibrant, modern, \ntolerant, peaceful, moderate democracy committed to \neconomic and social justice. People, including my \nwife, died for this movement. We will not waste their \nsacrifices.  \n We will work patiently to convince leaders in the \nFederally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and our \nPakhtunkhwa province to accept the writ of the \nGovernment and turn their back on terrorists. The \nterrorists may blow up our girls\u2019 schools but we will \nrebuild them, brick by brick, inch by inch. We are in \nthis battle to win and we know how we have to do it. \n We will work together with our neighbours in \nAfghanistan and with the NATO forces stationed there \nto ensure security for our common border. We will \ncontinue the composite dialogue with India so that our \noutstanding disputes are resolved. As I discussed with \nthe Indian Prime Minister yesterday, whether it is the \ncore issue of Jammu and Kashmir or cooperation on \nwater resources, India and Pakistan must and will \naccommodate each other\u2019s concerns and interests. We \nmust respect and work with each other to peacefully \nresolve our problems and build South Asia into a \ncommon market of trade and technology. \n Better relations between Pakistan, Afghanistan \nand India would help create a regional environment \nmore conducive to reducing militancy in our region. \nBut let me be clear to those in this Hall and to the \nterrorists lurking in their caves, plotting their next \nassault on humanity. If necessary, we will confront evil \nwith force \u2014 our police, our army and our air force. \nWe will turn the power of the State against the stateless \nterrorists. We will turn the power of justice against the \nchaos of anarchists. We will turn the power of right \nagainst the darkness of evil. \n I did not come to the office of President, to this \nmoment, by design. As my wife once said about \nherself, I did not choose this life \u2014 it chose me. An \n \n \n19 08-51851 \n \nextraordinary combination of circumstances brought \nme to this moment. It has not been an easy road.  \n I spent nine years in prison, in solitary \nconfinement, as a hostage to my wife\u2019s struggle for \ndemocracy and to our party\u2019s future. I was unjustly \nimprisoned under a judicial system manipulated and \ncontrolled by the forces of dictatorship. I refused to \nbreak under pressure. My years in prison made me a \nstronger person and hardened my resolve to fight for \ndemocracy and justice. Those years prepared me for \nthis moment. \n Terror took my wife\u2019s life, but the terrorists \ncannot kill my wife\u2019s dream. Her vision, her passion \nand her force are now our common task. The Benazir \nBhutto doctrine of reconciliation lives on; it guides us \nin our endeavours. Her reconciliation is the mantra of \nthe new era. I am dedicated to implementing what she \nproposed. I wish I could do it at my wife\u2019s side, but \nnow I will do it in my wife\u2019s place. \n Pakistan will prove wrong all the negative \npredictions about its future. We will show the way by \novercoming suspicions towards and from our \nneighbours and building a future for our people.  \n Throughout her life, my wife struggled to make \nthe world a better place for our children, the children \nof Pakistan and the children of the world. I owe it to \nher memory and to all of the martyrs of democracy to \ncontinue to do the same until the Bhutto doctrine of \nreconciliation is not just her dream but the world\u2019s \nreality. "

        "file_text": "At \nthe outset, Sir, I should like to warmly congratulate \nyou on your election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-third session, which undeniably \nreflects the high esteem that the international \ncommunity has for your country of Nicaragua, which is \na friend of Niger. Your election is also the well-\ndeserved culmination of an exemplary diplomatic and \npolitical career. The length and breadth of your \nexperience makes you the right person to carry out the \ndemanding and noble task entrusted to you. Allow me \nto assure you of my delegation\u2019s commitment to \nextending to you our constant support during your time \nin office. Niger is particularly honoured to be working \nside by side with you as a Vice-President of the \nAssembly for the sixty-third session. \n May I also pay tribute to your predecessor, \nMr. Srgjan Kerim, for the exemplary manner in which \nhe led the sixty-second session and, in particular, for \nhaving grappled with the burning issues of the day, \nincluding the food and energy crises and climate \nchange. With regard to His Excellency Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon, I should like to express our full \nappreciation for the significant progress on \nfundamental issues made by the Organization under his \nguidance.  \n The subject you have chosen, Mr. President, as \nthe central theme of the general debate during this \nsession is highly relevant. For several months and to \nvarying degrees, all members of the international \ncommunity have been affected by the overall rise in \nfood prices. That crisis has gripped the attention of \nevery international body. Mr. Olivier de Schutter, \nSpecial Rapporteur on the right to food, was far-\nsighted in sounding an alarm during a press conference \nheld here at the United Nations in which he identified \nthe initial structural causes and called for international \naction. Aware of the urgency of the situation, the \nSecretary-General set up the High-Level Task Force on \nthe Global Food Security Crisis in order to provide a \ncomprehensive and unified respond, support \nGovernments and peoples affected and adopt a \nComprehensive Framework for Action to meet the \nchallenges.  \n The Government of Niger would like to \ncongratulate the Secretary-General on his initiatives. \nWe would also like to warmly congratulate his Task \nForce for their work and for taking into consideration \nthe numerous efforts and views on this issue. The \nchallenge now is to implement the recommendations in \norder to save entire groups of people in the world\u2019s \nmost vulnerable countries from the tragedy of hunger. \n For its part, Niger has taken major specific \nmeasures to address the sharp rise in the cost of basic \nfoodstuffs in order to mitigate the effects on the living \nconditions of the most vulnerable people. \n However, in a country facing the recurrent \nproblem of drought and its consequences for \nagricultural production, the truth is that only lasting \nsolutions will help us to counter the effects of the \nphenomenon and to progressively eliminate the \nuncertainty that characterizes Niger\u2019s production \nsystem.  \n The Government of Niger has therefore decided \nto give priority to the three programmes introduced at \nthe Doha Conference on Consolidating Food Self-\nsufficiency in Niger, which was held in June 2007. \nThose programmes are all the more promising given \nthe potential boon to agriculture as a result of the \nupcoming construction of the Khandaji dam on the \nNiger River. The Government will develop its \n A/63/PV.13\n \n37 08-53122 \n \napproach on the basis of that project and those \nprogrammes so as to provide credible response to meet \nthe food needs of the people of Niger. \n The international financial crisis, which is \naffecting many countries and is today being \nexacerbated by the globalization of the world in which \nwe live, requires that we harness our efforts and \ninitiatives to find solutions requiring commitment on \nthe part of us all. While rich countries fear the risk of \nwidespread economic recession, the poorest countries \nfear food insecurity caused by prices they can no \nlonger afford. Paradoxically, when it comes to the \nfinancial crisis and the consequences of climate \nchange, it is the poorest countries that always pay most \ndearly for the turbulence affecting the globalized \nworld. My delegation therefore supports the proposals \nmade by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, which \nwere previously espoused by President Lula da Silva of \nBrazil, calling on the international community to deal \nurgently with the issue.  \n We also hold out hope that the upcoming Doha \nFollow-up International Conference on Financing for \nDevelopment will produce results that include safety \nnet measures to protect the poorest countries from \nexternal shocks that could compound their \nvulnerabilities.  \n Although the food, energy and financial crises are \nfront and centre on the international stage, there are \nalso other challenges facing the international \ncommunity in the areas of peace, security, development \nand human rights, among others. We must \nacknowledge the fact that international peace and \nsecurity has been as sorely tested by conflicts as by \nother scourges that are equally devastating to the \nharmonious development of peoples and countries \nthroughout the world. Those scourges include \ninternational terrorism, drug trafficking and the illegal \ntrade in small arms.  \n Niger is especially concerned about the impact of \ntrafficking in drugs and weapons; and especially mines, \nthroughout the Sahelo-Saharan strip. The actions of \ncertain armed groups are the true cause of the unrest \nprevailing in the northern part of our territory. Their \nactivities are increasingly being brought under control \nthanks to steps taken by the relevant institutions of our \ncountry. We therefore believe that there is a need for \nincreased willingness and cooperation in this area, \nsimilar to that demonstrated in connection with the \nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy that we adopted in \n2006. While we acknowledge that some progress has \nbeen made, we must also say that further efforts and \ncommitments are needed from the international \ncommunity in supporting countries in conflict or \nemerging from it. \n It is important that we support the progress made \nin countries where, happily, peace is becoming more \nentrenched, including Liberia, Sierra Leone, Burundi, \nGuinea-Bissau and the Central African Republic, which \nwas recently inscribed on the agenda of the \nPeacebuilding Commission. We welcome in particular \nthe resumption of the national peace and reconciliation \nprocess in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire following the invaluable \nimpetus provided by the Ouagadougou Agreement in \n2007. In that regard, my country congratulates and \nencourages all Ivorian politicians on their commitment \nto peace. We hope that, with the support of their \npartners, whose invaluable contributions my delegation \nalso commends, the national peace and reconciliation \nprocess will culminate in the holding of the upcoming \npresidential elections.  \n We also welcome the resumption of the \nManhasset cycle of negotiations as a useful and \nnecessary step in the search for a mutually acceptable \nand lasting solution to the issue of Western Sahara. \n With regard to the Great Lakes region, my \ndelegation welcomes the entry into force, on 21 June \n2008, on the Pact on Security, Stability and \nDevelopment in the Great Lakes Region. We believe \nthat this instrument will enable States parties to address \nthe underlying causes of conflict and to address the \nchallenges they face in the areas of security, \ngovernance and development. We also believe that the \nPact is part and parcel of the new vision for the \nsettlement of conflicts in Africa, perfect examples of \nwhich have just been provided by Nigeria and \nCameroon with the resolution of the issue of the \nBakassi peninsula, and by Gabon and Equatorial \nGuinea with the agreement on a mediation process in \nconnection with their territorial dispute. \n Nevertheless, conflicts persist in Africa and the \nMiddle East that require appropriate involvement by \nthe international community. With regard to the \nsituation in the Sudan, my delegation welcomes the \nappointment Mr. Djibril Yip\u00e8n\u00e8 Bassol\u00e9, former \nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Burkina Faso, as the \nJoint African Union-United Nations Chief Mediator for \nA/63/PV.13  \n \n08-53122 38 \n \nDarfur. We are certain that Mr. Bassol\u00e9 will provide \nnew momentum and help to improve the situation in \nthat brotherly country by, among other things, \nfacilitating the implementation of the Comprehensive \nPeace Agreement, signed in January 2006 between the \nGovernment of the Sudan and the Sudan People\u2019s \nLiberation Movement/Army with regard to the \nSouthern Sudan, and by helping to find an acceptable \nsolution for Darfur. \n With regard to Somalia, we welcome the \nagreement signed on 9 June in Djibouti between the \nTransitional Federal Government and the Alliance for \nthe Re-Liberation of Somalia. We urge the United \nNations to do everything possible to support those \ncountries, both by more effectively backing the African \nUnion Mission in Somalia and by deploying an \ninternational peacebuilding or peacekeeping force. \n The bilateral negotiations between Israelis and \nPalestinians that have begun in the context of the \ncommitments undertaken at the Annapolis Conference \nare a genuine source of satisfaction for my delegation. \nWe believe that the parties should take advantage of \nthose negotiations. We therefore encourage them to \nmaintain the momentum of Annapolis, which reflected \nthe willingness of the parties concerned to make \nprogress towards peace. We should also like to \nwelcome the recent initiative of President Nicolas \nSarkozy of France in the context of the Euro-\nMediterranean Conference. We fervently hope that all \nthose measures will make it possible to reach a speedy \nagreement that enshrines the vision of the two-State \nsolution of Palestine and Israel living side by side in \npeace and security within internationally recognized \nborders and on the basis of the relevant resolutions of \nthe Security Council, the Arab peace initiative and the \nQuartet\u2019s road map. \n We welcome the Doha agreement on Lebanon, \nwhich confirmed the virtue of dialogue and cleared the \npath for speedy presidential elections and the \nestablishment of a Government. The international \ncommunity should support the Lebanese people who, \nthrough that agreement, have demonstrated their \npolitical maturity and ongoing desire for national unity. \n The various peace processes now underway will \nnot be successful unless confidence-building measures \nare first put in place. In that regard, there is a crucial \nneed to find solutions to the issues of disarmament, \nnon-proliferation and the eradication of the trade in \nsmall arms. That is especially true for the poorest \ncountries, who pay a heavy price in conflicts sustained \nby the trade in small arms and light weapons. My \ndelegation therefore deplores the failure at the past \nsession of the Disarmament Commission, another in a \nseries due to the lack of consensus on the agenda. \n As we have seen, the challenges in the area of \ninternational peace and security are numerous and \ncomplex. Unfortunately, for some of us they are \naccentuated by other serious, recurring and even \nchronic threats. As the 2005 World Summit \nacknowledged in its Outcome Document, those threats, \nwhich also have an effect on development, are closely \nlinked to other areas in which the United Nations is \nactive, namely, peace, security and human rights.  \n We therefore believe that the year 2008 is critical, \ngiven that it is replete with major events that could \ncontribute to development. I am referring to the Doha \nRound of trade negotiations, which are at a standstill \ntoday; the high-level event on the implementation of \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) midpoint \nto the target date for their implementation, the Accra \nHigh-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness; and the \nReview Conference of the Monterrey Consensus on \nfinancing for development.  \n In the quest for global well-being, Africa and \ncountries in special circumstances \u2014 especially least \ndeveloped countries, landlocked developing countries \nand small island States \u2014 deserve focused attention \ncommensurate with their situation. My delegation \nwould like to pay homage to Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon for his personal commitment and unwavering \nsupport for initiatives in that regard intended to benefit \nAfrica. Following the G8 Summit at Heiligendamm, \nthe Secretary-General established the Africa Steering \nGroup to monitor the achievement of the MDGs in \nAfrica. With the support of a working group, the \nSteering Group is responsible for finding ways to \ncoordinate and rationalize efforts associated with \ntechnical and financial assistance in order to speed up \nAfrica\u2019s progress. That initiative is very timely for a \ncountry like Niger, whose strategy to reduce poverty \nand speed up development for the period 2009-2012 \nfocuses precisely on the achievement of the MDGs. \nMoreover, the various efforts of the Government in \nrecent years in the areas of health, education and \naccess to water have already led to a significant \nimprovement in the relevant indicators. \n A/63/PV.13\n \n39 08-53122 \n \n The recommendations of the Steering Group and \nthe conclusions of the recent high-level meeting on the \nMDGs, jointly organized by the President of the \nGeneral Assembly and the Secretary-General, provide a \nvery clear course of action for making progress.  \n Sustainable development is the main theme of the \nEconomic and Social Council\u2019s 2008 substantive \nsession. The current debate has clearly shown that such \ndevelopment cannot be achieved without appropriate \nfunding, aid effectiveness and good governance.  \n In conclusion, the delegation of Niger believes \nthat the United Nations is the world\u2019s premier forum. It \nmust serve as a beacon in those times of both hope and \nuncertainty, and ensure collective security in the world \nby means of economic, social and cultural cooperation. \n \nThat is why we need genuine reform of the United \nNations system. My delegation believes that the reform \neffort will remain incomplete unless there is a \nsignificant change in the Security Council, including as \nregards both equitable representation and its working \nmethods.  \n In numerous other areas currently under \nconsideration \u2014 such as, among others, evaluating the \nexperiences of countries involved in pilot programmes \non system-wide coherence and revitalizing the General \nAssembly, which we must ensure \u2014 my country will \ncontribute as much as it can to adapting our common \nOrganization to the challenges we all face in building a \nworld of peace, prosperity and development.

        "file_text": "I stand in for The \nHonourable Navinchandra Ramgoolam, Prime Minister \nof the Republic of Mauritius, who is not able to be \npersonally present to address this Assembly at this \nsession. The Prime Minister has asked me, on his \n \n \n35 08-53141 \n \nbehalf to make this statement and to convey his kind \ngreetings to President D\u2019Escoto Brockmann; to his \npredecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim; and our Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon. \n The problems we face are many and daunting, but \nwe believe that humankind has the ingenuity and \nresources to overcome adversity through a unified \nresponse. The goal of promoting human development \nand security, in all its manifold aspects, should remain \nour priority. In that regard, the theme of this session \u2014 \n\u201cThe impact of the global food crisis on poverty and \nhunger and the need to democratize the United \nNations\u201d \u2014 is both timely and relevant. \n We are all affected by the growing global food \ncrisis. As always, the brunt of food insecurity is borne \nby Africa, Asia and the Caribbean, where riots and \nstrikes have occurred and social unrest threatens \npolitical stability. Admittedly, a number of factors \nunderlie the present scarcity of food. Some of those \nfactors are beyond our control. However, there is an \nurgent need for us to address such issues as outdated \nagricultural practices, inadequate infrastructure, the \ninequitable distribution of land ownership and \ninsecurity of tenure. The list is long. The remedies are \nknown. Hopefully, we can bring to bear the political \nwill that is required. \n Mauritius is a net food importing country. To \nreduce our dependence on food imports, the \nGovernment is implementing a plan to maximize food \nproduction. We are optimizing land use and \ndiversifying the production of food crops, livestock \nand seafood. To overcome the constraints of land \navailability and take advantage of economies of scale, \nwe aim, in partnership with neighbouring countries, to \nproduce for our common domestic markets and \neventually for exports to the region. Our experiments \nin that respect with Madagascar and Mozambique are \nproving to be mutually beneficial and hold great \npromise for the future. \n The right to food is one that is very often \noverlooked, and yet it is intimately connected to human \ndignity. It is important that the international \ncommunity act now to ensure that this fundamental \nhuman right is respected. In this era of scientific and \ntechnological prowess, when we are unravelling the \nmysteries of the immensities of the universe and \nsubatomic particles, and when the discoveries of \nscience daily amaze us and change our perceptions of \nreality, it is unconscionable that countless children \nshould sleep on an empty stomach. One out of every \nsix persons in the world suffers from hunger. That is \nthe greatest moral challenge facing humanity today. \n We commend the Secretary-General for the \ntimely establishment of the High-level Task Force on \nthe Global Food Security Crisis. We also welcome the \nrecent proposal by the European Commission to create \na special facility amounting to more than $1.5 billion \nfor a rapid response to food crises, in coordination with \nthe United Nations Task Force and international \norganizations. \n Over a period of almost one year, the \nunprecedented level of the price of oil has dealt a \nsevere blow to the economic growth of many \ndeveloping countries. Mauritius depends on imported \noil for 80 per cent of its energy consumption, which \nmakes it extremely vulnerable on that count. The share \nof petroleum products in our import bill went up from \n12 per cent in 2000 to 18 per cent in 2007. We have \nrecently set up the \u201cMaurice Ile Durable\u201d project to \nencourage more efficient use of energy and to tap \nrenewable energy sources. \n(spoke in French) \n The Maurice Ile Durable project is bold, but we \nbelieve that the current global situation calls for \nboldness. The prime objective of the project is to strike \na balance between our economic, environmental and \nsocial needs. Last year, we achieved a 5.4 per cent \ngrowth rate increase and this year we forecast a rate of \nmore than 5.7 per cent. However, we realize that \ngrowth is not an end in itself. \n The Government is pursuing a model of \ndevelopment that takes into account not only economic \nimperatives, but also the deep-seated aspirations of \neach Mauritian citizen. At the same time, we cannot \nallow ourselves to compromise the opportunities for \nfuture generations. \n The Maurice Ile Durable project seeks to make \nMauritius a fully-fledged laboratory. We will use the \nnatural resources with which our island is so liberally \nendowed \u2014 the sea, the sun, the wind and a rich plant \nbiomass. We seek an environmental solution to the \nproblem of global warming and to our dependence on \nthe extremely volatile hydrocarbons market. We have \nset ourselves the target of reducing our dependence of \npetroleum-based products by two thirds within \n  \n \n08-53141 36 \n \n20 years. This is how we are contributing to \ninternational efforts to combat the greenhouse effect. It \nis the wager for the future of a very vulnerable small \nisland economy, but I want to believe that it is also the \nobjective of a planet threatened with suffocation on the \nlong term. \n(spoke in English) \n While the causes of food insecurity and the \nenergy crisis are multiple and complex, there is little \ndoubt that climate change will exacerbate the situation \nin the future. Climate change places a particular burden \non developing countries, which have done the least to \ncause the problem. Developing countries are in dire \nneed of assistance to enhance their adaptive capacity \nand minimize their vulnerability because, on their own, \nthey cannot bear the burden of the costs of mitigation \nand adaptation. \n As an island, Mauritius is especially vulnerable to \nthe effects of climate change, sea-level rise, beach \nerosion, coral bleaching and extreme weather \nconditions. They not only affect our local resources \nand industries such as fisheries and tourism, but also \nthreaten vital infrastructure, settlements and services. \nThe increased frequency and scale of natural disasters \nexacerbate our inherent vulnerability. \n Mauritius is fully engaged in the post-Bali \nprocess. The meetings to be held in Poznan in \nDecember and in Copenhagen next year will be crucial \nto determining emission targets. It is vital that we reach \na comprehensive agreement on a climate change \nframework. At the last high-level meeting on climate \nchange, Mauritius made a plea for the creation of a \nspecial fund to enable the development and \nimplementation of adaptation measures. Our appeal to \ninternational donors to provide the much-needed \nresources for operating the fund is yet to be answered. \nHowever, we welcome the recent declaration by the \nleaders of the Group of Eight of a long-term emissions \nreduction target of at least 50 per cent by 2050. We \nalso welcome their undertaking to help support the \nmitigation plans of major developing countries through \ntechnology transfer and capacity-building. \n Small island developing States are innocent \nvictims of global warming and the degradation of the \nenvironment. Only a few weeks ago, we witnessed the \ndevastation caused by a quick succession of hurricanes \nin the Caribbean. We therefore call on the international \ncommunity to assist small island developing States to \nincorporate adaptation and mitigation plans into their \nnational strategies. Continued access to official \ndevelopment assistance, concessionary financing \narrangements, the reduction of debt servicing and \nimproved terms of trade are crucial to building up the \neconomic resilience of small island developing States. \n We are particularly concerned about the \ninadequate level of implementation of the Barbados \nPlan of Action and the Mauritius Strategy. We reiterate \nour request to the international community to honour \nthe offers of assistance made during the international \nconference on small island developing States held in \nMauritius in 2005. Furthermore, the arbitrary gross \ndomestic product criteria applied to determine the \neligibility for securing concessionary finance \ndisqualify most small island developing States from \naccessing much-needed funds for important \ninfrastructure development. It is absolutely necessary \nin that regard that small island developing States be \ntreated as a distinct category. \n More than halfway through, the Millennium \nDevelopment Goal (MDG) track record is mixed. Some \ndeveloping countries are on target while others, \nparticularly from the African continent, are facing \ncrippling difficulties. Even the gains painstakingly \nachieved in fighting hunger and poverty are tenuous \nand could be nullified by the current food and energy \ncrisis. It is vital that donors and development partners \nhonour the pledges made in the Millennium \nDeclaration, the 2002 Monterrey International \nConference on Financing for Development and the \n2005 World Summit. \n Mauritius is on track to meet the MDG targets. \nEfforts are under way in all key socio-economic sectors \nto further improve living standards and to achieve the \nMDGs as early as possible. We are addressing poverty \nin a comprehensive and coherent manner, convinced \nthat it will have a positive impact on the other \ndevelopment goals. Our experience has demonstrated \nthat the most effective remedy to poverty is inclusive \neconomic growth. \n The Government is pursuing a number of \nprogrammes announced in its latest budget to eliminate \nabsolute poverty. We have introduced an Eradication of \nAbsolute Poverty Programme, which comprises a \nnumber of integrated development projects within \nidentified pockets of poverty. We have also put in place \na Human Resource Development, Knowledge and Arts \n \n \n37 08-53141 \n \nFund to ensure that university studies become \naffordable to all. We aim to double enrolment in \ntertiary education by 2015. \n In April, Mauritius hosted the Southern Africa \nDevelopment Community (SADC) International \nConference on Poverty and Development. I am happy \nto inform the Assembly that the Conference formulated \na regional strategy for poverty eradication in the SADC \ncountries. The SADC secretariat has taken follow-up \naction on the development of an implementation plan. \nIn line with one of the Conference recommendations, a \njoint ministerial task force on food security, comprising \nthe ministers of finance, trade and agriculture, met in \nLusaka on 13 July 2008 to tackle the food crisis \naffecting the region. \n Africa\u2019s development needs were debated at the \nhighest level on Monday, 22 September. Concrete and \nconcerted action on the part of African States and their \ncooperation partners is called for to help achieve \nsustained and sustainable development on the \ncontinent. Furthermore, we look forward to the \nforthcoming Follow-up International Conference on \nFinancing for Development in Doha. It will be a unique \nopportunity to address the various facets of \nconcessionary financing and to find new resources for \ndevelopment. \n More important, the Doha Development Agenda \nshould deliver on its promise of development through \nincreased trading opportunities as a means of \neradicating poverty. With regard to the World Trade \nOrganization negotiations, we join those who have \ncalled for the talks to progress on the basis of what has \nalready been achieved. We remain fully committed to \nthe Doha Development Agenda and will contribute \nconstructively to the negotiations. \n We support the effective and quick \nimplementation of the Aid for Trade Initiative, which \nshould take into account the priorities and needs of \nbeneficiary countries. At present, our limited industrial \ncapacity prevents us from taking full advantage of the \nopportunities offered by globalization. On the regional \nfront, I am pleased to say that we have made major \nstrides in our integration process. The SADC Free \nTrade Area was launched on 17 August 2008, and we \nare aiming to fully liberalize trade by 2012. \n Since the adoption of the 2001 Declaration of \nCommitment on HIV/AIDS (resolution S-26/2), \nincreasing numbers of people have gained access to \nHIV prevention and treatment in low- and middle-\nincome countries. However, many countries still have a \nlong way to go to meet the goal we set ourselves under \nMDG 6 of achieving universal access to HIV \nprevention, treatment, care and support by 2010. The \nhigh prevalence of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa \ncontinues to be a cause for alarm. \n Engagement at the highest level is vital in the \nfight against HIV/AIDS. The Mauritius National AIDS \nCommittee, under the chairmanship of The Honourable \nPrime Minister, oversees the implementation of a \nmultisectoral HIV and AIDS strategic plan. That plan \nprovides for antiretroviral treatment free of charge to \nall HIV-infected persons, voluntary counselling and \ntesting service and the implementation of a mother-to-\nchild transmission prevention programme. The \nGovernment has also increased the amount allocated to \nthe fight against HIV/AIDS by 50 per cent in the \ncurrent budget. \n As we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the \nadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \nin December, we must remain unwavering in our \nresolve to promote and protect human rights. Much \nremains to be done to ensure that the basic rights of \nindividuals are universally protected. The Mauritian \nConstitution guarantees that our citizens enjoy \nfundamental rights in their everyday lives. The \nNational Human Rights Commission, the Human \nRights Centre, the Parliamentary Commission for the \nDemocratization of the Economy and the proposed \nEqual Opportunities Act are important mechanisms for \nthe protection and promotion of human rights in our \ncountry. \n As an advocate of all human rights and \nfundamental freedoms, Mauritius severely condemns \nthe decision of Myanmar\u2019s military junta to prolong the \nhouse arrest of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi. My delegation \nbelieves that the national reconciliation and full \ndemocratization of Myanmar cannot be achieved \nwithout the release of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi and other \npolitical detainees and without the participation of the \nNational League for Democracy in the political \nprocess. \n Situations of conflict and war inevitably give rise \nto violations of human rights and to atrocities against \ninnocent civilians. Displacement and violent death \ncontinue to be the lot of far too many in parts of the \nMiddle East, Africa and Asia. Mauritius has always \n  \n \n08-53141 38 \n \nsupported the struggle of the Palestinian people and \ntheir inalienable right to self-determination. We favour \nthe creation of a Palestinian State coexisting with the \nState of Israel within secure and recognized borders. It \nis through dialogue, negotiations and compromise by \nboth sides that lasting peace can come about in the \nMiddle East. \n The deteriorating humanitarian situation in \nDarfur remains a matter of grave concern for my \ndelegation. We urge all parties involved in the conflict, \nespecially the authorities, to exercise restraint in their \nactions and to move towards a just and lasting solution \nto the conflict. We welcome the power-sharing accord \nreached in Zimbabwe. We hope that a Government of \nnational unity will bring peace, stability and \nreconciliation to the Zimbabwean people, who have \nsuffered for far too long the brutal consequences of the \npolitical crisis and economic meltdown. \n The grave and pervasive threat of terrorism \nknows no boundaries; no country is shielded from its \npernicious and devastating impact. Mauritius is \ncommitted to the United Nations Global Counter-\nTerrorism Strategy. It is imperative that we conclude a \ncomprehensive convention against terrorism as soon as \npossible to reinforce the existing legal framework. In \nJune 2008, as part of its contribution to the \ninternational efforts to combat terrorism in all its forms \nand manifestations, Mauritius joined the Global \nInitiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism. \n We fully share the view of the President of the \nGeneral Assembly regarding the democratization of our \nOrganization. The ongoing discussions on the \nrevitalization of the General Assembly, system-wide \ncoherence, mandate review and management reform in \nthe context of the United Nations reform process \nshould be aimed at strengthening multilateralism. We \nneed comprehensive reform of the Security Council so \nthat it is able to meet the needs and respond to the \naspirations of the increasingly changing political \nrealities of the world. \n We call for expansion of the Security Council in \nboth the permanent and non-permanent membership \ncategories and for improvement in its working \nmethods. Mauritius remains firmly committed to the \nEzulwini Consensus, which calls for two seats in the \npermanent category and five non-permanent seats for \nAfrica. I should like to reaffirm once again the \nunequivocal support of Mauritius for India to be a \npermanent member of a reformed Security Council. We \nalso reaffirm our support for a Latin American and \nCaribbean country to be a permanent member of a \nreformed Council. Furthermore, we welcome the recent \nunanimous decision of the General Assembly to start \nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \nreform in an informal plenary meeting of the General \nAssembly by the end of February 2009. \n The principles and objectives enshrined in the \nCharter of the United Nations should continue to guide \nus in our actions. I would like to bring up once again \nbefore the Assembly our legitimate sovereignty claim \nregarding the Chagos Archipelago, including \nDiego Garcia. The Archipelago was excised from the \nterritory of Mauritius by the United Kingdom prior to \nour independence, in disregard of General Assembly \nresolutions 1514 (XV) of 1960 and 2066 (XX) of 1965. \nWe have always favoured a settlement of the issue \nthrough constructive bilateral dialogue. In that regard, I \nwish to inform the Assembly that high-level talks are \nunder way. \n The Government is very sensitive to the \naspirations of citizens of Mauritius to return to the \nislands of their birth in the Chagos Archipelago. I wish \nto recall here that they were forcibly removed from the \nArchipelago prior to its excision from Mauritius. \nLikewise, we urge France to pursue dialogue with \nMauritius on the issue of Tromelin. It is our firm \nconviction that such bilateral dialogue will further \nconsolidate our historical and friendly relations with \nboth the United Kingdom and France. \n In conclusion, I wish to reiterate that the United \nNations remains the most important and credible \ninternational multilateral Organization for the \nmaintenance of peace and security and for building a \nbetter and safer world. The President of the General \nAssembly can rest assured of our unwavering support \nin the work of the United Nations. "

        "file_text": "Mr. President, let me begin \nby warmly congratulating you on your election. You \nhave my very best wishes for a successful term in \noffice. \n This is my first opportunity to address the \nGeneral Assembly as Ireland\u2019s Foreign Minister. It is a \ngreat honour and privilege to do so. Ireland believes \nstrongly in the purposes, principles and potential of the \nUnited Nations. Formed in the shadow of global war, \nthe United Nations embodies the idea of our common \nhumanity. We have a shared interest as well as a moral \nobligation to act on that common humanity in the \nworld. \n In this new century, when we speak of the \ninternational community, it cannot be as a vague \nplatitude or as a faceless scapegoat. Global challenges \nconfront us: climate change, economic turbulence, food \nand energy crises, HIV/AIDS and terrorism, among \nothers. We can either be an international community \npassively divided and at the mercy of those forces, or \nwe can be a community, in the true sense, of active \nparticipants united by our sense of mutual solidarity, \nour common sense of justice, our common desire for a \nbetter and peaceful future and a shared commitment to \ninternational law and the human rights of all. \n The United Nations is the indispensable \nframework for realizing the potential of that \ncommunity, as it has shown again and again. Ireland is \nproud to have played its distinctive part in that history \nand we are absolutely committed to playing a full part \nin its future. And let us be clear \u2014 the challenges we \nface have intensified in the past year. \n Over the past period, we have witnessed the \npotential fallout from the financial crisis for all \ncountries and not least, of course, for developing \ncountries. The depth of their concerns has been heard \nfrom this rostrum. We have all failed as yet to reach \nagreement on a balanced world trade deal. Rising fuel \nand food prices have exacted a particular toll on the \nworld\u2019s most vulnerable and poor. The effects of \nclimate change, likewise, are placing a \ndisproportionate burden on those least equipped to \ncope. More than halfway towards the 2015 target date \nfor the Millennium Development Goals and despite \nsignificant progress in some areas, we have not made \nenough headway towards meeting them. The United \nNations must continue to take the lead in those efforts, \nwhile each of us as political leaders must recognize our \nduty to take effective action in support of goals that are \nonly increasing in relevance and urgency. \n The world needs a strong and effective United \nNations, and that is why, as a committed Member \nState, Ireland has long supported efforts to reform and \n  \n \n08-53141 2 \n \nimprove its operation. I very much welcome and \nappreciate the priority that Secretary-General Ban has \nattached to that task. As he said when he took up \noffice, \u201cthe true measure of success of the United \nNations is not how much we promise, but how much \nwe deliver for those who need us most\u201d (A/61/PV.31, \np. 9). Every Member State must play its part in \nensuring that it can fulfil its role. Ireland is therefore \nproud of the contribution it has made to the reform \nprocess. \n Most recently, we were pleased to work closely \nwith our good friend and colleague, Tanzania, in \nfacilitating consultations on greater system-wide \ncoherence in the United Nations, a vitally important \npart of the reform agenda. I would like to take the \nopportunity to express my deep appreciation of the \nconstructive spirit in which Member States and United \nNations agencies and staff approached the consultation \nprocess, chaired by Ambassadors Kavanagh and \nMahiga. Their report was welcomed in the consensus \nresolution adopted by the General Assembly on \n15 September. A lot, of course, remains to be done. We \nshould not shy away from issues just because they are \ndifficult to tackle. \n Taking forward the reform agenda does not, of \ncourse, mean losing sight of the real strengths and \nachievements of the United Nations, especially in \npeacekeeping. This year marks the fiftieth anniversary \nof the first occasion on which personnel of the Irish \nDefence Forces wore the blue beret. In the five decades \nsince, they have worn it with pride and distinction. I \nwould like to take this opportunity to offer them and \nthose with whom they have served my deepest personal \ngratitude. \n Of course, as the world continues to evolve, so \nwill our approach to peacekeeping. Regional \norganizations, such as the European Union, can and \nshould be expected to play an increasingly prominent \nrole in undertaking Security Council-mandated \noperations. I am particularly pleased that one such \nmission, the EU military operation in the Republic of \nChad, is under the very effective leadership of an \nIrishman, Lieutenant General Pat Nash. \n Last year, my predecessor expressed the hope \nthat, after almost 40 years, it would no longer be \nnecessary for Irish ministers to brief this Assembly on \nthe search for peace on the island of Ireland. I am \npleased to confirm that the task we now confront in \nIreland is no longer building peace, but securing and \nunderpinning it for the generations to come. Our \nhistory has, however, made us particularly conscious of \nthe huge human cost of conflict and the moral \nobligation we carry to prevent and to resolve it. We in \nIreland owe a debt of gratitude to all in the \ninternational community who lent their support to our \nsearch for peace. In that search, we were genuinely part \nof a community \u2014 concentric circles of other nations \nand international actors that provided goodwill and \nmomentum, moral support, concrete assistance, \nindependent mediation and facilitation when needed. \nAnchoring the process was a central partnership \nbetween the British and Irish Governments. So we \nknow the good that can be done and we now feel a \nspecial duty to try and repay some of that debt in kind. \n That is why my Government has established a \nconflict resolution unit within my ministry as a channel \nthrough which we can make our contribution. Its aim is \nto complement the work of others, especially that of \nthe United Nations. It will, in part, draw on the lessons \nwe have learned from our own experiences. As part of \nthat work, Nuala O\u2019Loan, formerly the Police \nOmbudsman in Northern Ireland, who played a \nsignificant personal role in building confidence in the \nnew policing arrangements there, is now serving as our \nSpecial Envoy to Timor-Leste. \n Ireland\u2019s commitment to peacekeeping, \npeacebuilding and conflict resolution extends to \nremoving not only the causes of conflict, but also the \nmeans. Creating a secure and stable world demands \neffective arms control and disarmament and the \nelimination of nuclear weapons. Ireland was very \nproud last May to host the diplomatic conference that \ndelivered the Convention on Cluster Munitions, an \nhistoric agreement to ban the production and use of \nthose pernicious instruments of war. The Convention is \nstrong and ambitious. Each State party undertakes \nnever, in any circumstances, to use, develop, produce, \nacquire, stockpile, retain or transfer cluster munitions, \nor to assist any other party in doing so. It is \ncomprehensive and it provides for no exceptions. It \nsets new standards for assistance to victims and also, \nimportantly, for clearing affected areas. I would once \nagain like to express the deep appreciation of my \nGovernment for the constructive approach taken by \nMember States. Without it, such a significant step \nforward could not have been taken. The Convention \nwill open for signature in Oslo in December, and \n \n \n3 08-53141 \n \nIreland will be among the first signatories. I strongly \nurge all Governments to do likewise. \n Peace and security must be accompanied by a \nfirm commitment to the protection and promotion of \nhuman rights. That remains at the very core of the \nUnited Nations mandate. In this, the sixtieth \nanniversary year of the adoption of the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights, we must act with \nrenewed determination to make its promises a living \nreality for all of our people. That means improving the \nUnited Nations capacity to tackle abuses effectively \nwhenever and wherever they arise, ensuring a strong \nand vigilant Human Rights Council. \n This is also the tenth anniversary of the adoption \nof the Rome Statute establishing the International \nCriminal Court (ICC). It has already carved out a vital \nrole for itself in bringing an end to impunity and in \ndemanding that the rule of law be upheld. Ireland \nremains strongly supportive of the ICC and its \nmandate, and urges all Member States to cooperate \nfully with its work. \n Eradicating world hunger and ending poverty is \none of the most urgent tasks we face. Realizing the \nvision of the Millennium Development Goals is a great \nchallenge, but it can be met. I am very proud that \nIreland is now the sixth largest aid donor in the world \nin terms of gross national product percentage. It is, I \nbelieve, a reflection of our values of solidarity and \nrespect for human dignity. As a committed member \nState, I am also gratified that the European Union and \nits member States continue to be the world\u2019s leading \ndonor, accounting for some 60 per cent of the world\u2019s \nofficial development assistance. \n In support of our efforts to secure the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, Ireland established a hunger task \nforce to determine the most effective contribution we \ncan make to tackling the root causes of hunger, \nparticularly in Africa. Comprising 15 renowned \ninternational experts, its report was launched by our \nPrime Minister, Taoiseach Brian Cowen, last week with \nthe participation of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. \nThe report has highlighted three particular areas for \nfocus. First, we need to improve small-holder \nproductivity in Africa; the agricultural sector has been \nneglected for too long. Secondly, we need increased \nfocus on maternal and infant undernutrition; a bad start \nmakes life an uphill struggle from day one. Thirdly, the \nreport states clearly that we do not need new \ncommitments, but rather delivery on the ones we have \nalready entered into. Those important messages will \nguide our work in the period ahead. \n Let me turn now to the situation in the Middle \nEast. The first Irish peacekeepers 50 years ago were \ndeployed to serve with the United Nations mission in \nLebanon. It is therefore a particular source of sadness \nto me that, despite the great efforts that have been \nmade down the years, we do not yet have lasting peace \nin the Middle East, especially between the Palestinian \npeople and Israel. \n I commend the efforts of all of those who are \nprepared to take the political risks necessary to turn \nthat situation around. In particular, I welcome and \nsupport the dialogue that President Abbas and Prime \nMinister Olmert have engaged in under the auspices of \nthe Annapolis process. I hope that what they have \nachieved together in their talks can be built upon in the \nimmediate period ahead, and that it will result in what \nwe all wish to see \u2014 a just agreement, a lasting peace \nand a more prosperous future for their people. \n Improving conditions on the ground in the \nPalestinian territories, including, very importantly, the \neconomic and social situation, would, I believe, make a \nsignificant and critical contribution to creating the right \ncontext for talks to succeed. In that regard, I have \ncalled many times for an end to the construction of \nillegal settlements not only because it is right to do so, \nbut also because it would send a strong and welcome \nsignal of good faith at a difficult and uncertain time. \nIsrael needs urgently to listen to the voice \u2014 the \nconcerned voice \u2014 of the international community on \nthe settlement issue. \n The situation in the Sudan and the tragic \nsuffering of the people of Darfur urgently demand our \nattention. I strongly urge the Sudanese Government \nand the rebel groups to return to the negotiating table \nand to engage seriously with Chief Mediator Bassol\u00e9. \nThe African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in \nDarfur must be allowed to deploy fully and speedily, \nand a secure environment must be created to allow the \nhumanitarian community to carry out its important \nwork. A culture of impunity cannot prevail. Those \nresponsible for human rights abuses in Darfur must be \nbrought to justice. The Government in Khartoum must \nface up to its responsibilities to protect its citizens, to \nprovide security and to ensure justice is done. \n  \n \n08-53141 4 \n \n In Zimbabwe, the recent agreement to form a \npower-sharing Government is a moment of opportunity \nthat must be seized. The people of Zimbabwe, who \nhave suffered for far too long, deserve a new beginning \nand look to their leaders to provide it. Their leaders \nmust not be found wanting. I look forward to the \ndelivery of genuine power-sharing, of real political and \neconomic reform and of the creation of a more open \nand free society. \n In Burma, we continue to stand with the people in \ntheir demand for greater democracy and human rights, \nand we renew in particular our call for the immediate \nrelease of Aung San Suu Kyi and her fellow political \nprisoners. It is gravely disappointing that the ruling \nmilitary junta has not engaged seriously with the good \noffices mission of the Secretary-General, or responded \nin any meaningful way to the concerns of the \ninternational community. International pressure must \nbe maintained on Burma\u2019s leaders, including, and in \nparticular, by the countries of the region. \n Ireland has watched with great distress the recent \nconflict in Georgia, including the evidence of the use \nof cluster munitions against civilian populations. We \nwarmly applaud President Sarkozy and the French \npresidency of the European Union for their efforts to \nsecure a settlement. The European Union is deploying \na monitoring mission to Georgia to work alongside \nUnited Nations observers, to which Ireland is proud to \nbe contributing. We now need to see the full honouring \nof commitments entered into, including the full \nwithdrawal of military forces by early October. I also \nurge Russia and Georgia to engage constructively and \nin good faith in the discussions scheduled to begin in \nGeneva on 15 October. \n In closing, I would like to return to where I began \ntoday. As Ireland\u2019s Foreign Minister, I come here to \nreaffirm our strong attachment and loyalty to the \nUnited Nations. Whether we wish it or not, we are \nbeing united every day more and more by the common \nchallenges we all face. The principles and the work of \nthe United Nations have never been needed more. Its \nprinciples give us a firm foundation. Continuing \nreform will give us even stronger tools. What remains \nto be proven is our collective will to use them. \n The vision shared by all our peoples of a peaceful \nand secure world, with justice, human rights and \ndignity for all, can be realized only in cooperation with \nothers of like mind. For Ireland\u2019s part, we are \ndetermined not to be a passive member of that formal \ncommunity of nations. \n With the support and the help of others, the \nfoundations of a future of peace have, as I have \nreported, been laid on the island of Ireland. We are now \ndetermined to honour that debt and continue a long \ntradition of active engagement in the world by \ncontributing our energy and our initiative where we can \nmake a difference. It is only through such a \ncommitment by each of us and through this body that \nwe can make the international community more than \nthe sum of its parts, more than the sum of its fears, and \ninstead make it what it was meant to be when the \nUnited Nations was established \u2014 the sum of all our \nhopes.

I am confident that you will ably guide our \nsession to a great success. I would also like to \ncommend His Excellency Mr. Srgjan Kerim for his \nimportant contribution to the work of the Assembly at \nits sixty-second session. \n While the trend of peace, cooperation and \ndevelopment continues to prevail, there have been \ncomplex developments in the world over the past year. \nLocal conflicts endure, acts of terrorism still occur in \nmany parts of the world and new tensions have \nemerged in Europe, including in the Balkans and the \nCaucasus. At the same time, the world is experiencing \nthe most severe economic uncertainties since the 1997-\n1998 financial crisis, together with new challenges \nsuch as climate change and the food and energy \nsecurity crises. More than ever, the current situation \ncompels nations to promote dialogue and cooperation \nto surmount common challenges, both man-made and \nnatural.  \n Viet Nam supports efforts to end violence in \nAfghanistan and Iraq.  \n We should also work to facilitate further progress \nin the search for lasting peaceful solutions to the \nnuclear issues on the Korean peninsula and Iran on the \nbasis of due respect both for the legitimate rights of \nStates to develop and use nuclear energy for peaceful \npurposes and for the regime of non-proliferation of \nnuclear weapons.  \n In follow-up to the Annapolis outcome, I wish to \nreaffirm Viet Nam\u2019s support for the role of the Quartet, \nthe League of Arab States, regional countries and the \nUnited Nations, especially the Security Council, in the \nquest for a lasting solution in the Middle East. Such a \nsolution should respect the inalienable rights of the \nPalestinian people, including their right to establish an \nindependent State of their own, and the principle of \nland for peace. \n As leaders of the world gathered here to discuss \nthe development needs of Africa, we were keenly \naware of the organic relationship between peace and \ndevelopment. Viet Nam undertakes to work closely \nwith the United Nations and the African Union to find \npeaceful solutions to the conflicts and disputes that still \nrage on the continent. \n New uncertainties are unfolding in the global \neconomic and financial situation. Climate change and \nenergy and food shortages are becoming more and \nmore serious global issues. In the face of that situation, \nit is essential to enhance international cooperation to \novercome these problems. In that regard, developed \nA/63/PV.13  \n \n08-53122 2 \n \ncountries should take measures to maintain their \nmacroeconomic and financial stability and implement \ninternational commitments to improve international \neconomic relations and the transfer of technology. Such \ncooperation is possible and effective only when due \nregard is given to each country\u2019s specific conditions, \nlegitimate concerns and interests. \n Given the complex developments in the world, \nthe United Nations has a greater role to play in saving \nhumankind from the scourge of war and in finding \nsolutions to problems. The United Nations must be \nstrengthened to that end. Democratic and \ncomprehensive reform of the United Nations \u2014 \nincluding the General Assembly, the Security Council, \nthe Economic and Social Council and the specialized \nagencies \u2014 will make the Organization more effective \nand efficient in the areas of work mandated by the \nCharter. Viet Nam will continue to contribute to efforts \naimed at making the United Nations more democratic, \nmore effective and more responsive to the needs of the \npeoples of the world.  \n In Viet Nam, the Government is working with \nUnited Nations agencies and other development \npartners to implement the One UN initiative. We hope \nand believe that the experiences of Viet Nam and the \nUnited Nations in implementing that pilot reform \nprogramme will be useful to other aid recipient \ncountries and to the United Nations reform process \noverall. \n In line with its foreign policy of independence, \nsovereignty, peace, cooperation and development and \nits efforts to deeply engage with the world, Viet Nam \nhas seriously observed its commitments and actively \nparticipated in addressing global issues. We strongly \nsupport the Bali Road Map, which aims to establish the \nlegal framework for international cooperation in \naddressing climate change beyond 2012. Despite \nnatural disasters and epidemics, Viet Nam is honouring \nits commitments to maintain the volume of its rice \nexports at 4 million tons annually. We intend to \ncontinue those efforts to ease the pressures caused by \nthe rising price of food and to preserve food security. \n The year 2008 marks the first time that Viet Nam \nhas assumed responsibilities as a non-permanent \nmember of the Security Council. In its desire to make \ngreater contributions to the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security, Viet Nam has \nparticipated in the work of the Council as a \nconstructive and responsible member. We shall \ncontinue to uphold the principles enshrined in the \nCharter while working with other Council members \nand Members of the United Nations to find solutions \nthat serve the interests of international peace and \nsecurity and the legitimate interests of all countries and \nparties concerned. \n In the 63 years since its establishment, the United \nNations has traversed numerous upheavals of history \nand acquired an increasingly significant role in \ninternational relations. Against that backdrop, and with \ntrust in the power of peoples\u2019 will and determination to \nstrive for peace, cooperation and development, we are \nstrongly confident that the international community \nwill overcome new challenges and that the United \nNations will continue to live up to the expectations of \nall the peoples of the world.

        "file_text": "At \nthe outset, I would like to join previous speakers, on \nbehalf of His Excellency Pierre Nkurunziza, President \nof the Republic of Burundi, and our entire delegation, \nin offering our warmest congratulations to Mr. Miguel \nd\u2019Escoto Brockmann on his outstanding election to the \npresidency. We congratulate the other members of the \nBureau as well. \n We would also like to pay well-deserved tribute \nto his predecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, for the skill and \nwisdom with which he guided the work of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-second session. We also take this \nopportunity to congratulate Mr. Ban Ki-Moon once \nagain on the skill and dynamism with which he is \nguiding our Organization. We would also like to pay \nspecial tribute to his tireless devotion to the cause of \npeace and development in Burundi as we attempt to \nconsolidate peace and stability. \n Finally we wish to thank the United Nations \nIntegrated Office in Burundi. \n The sixty-third session of the General Assembly \nis taking place at a time when the people of Burundi \nare at last enjoying the end of the war between the \nGovernment army and the Parti Lib\u00e9ration du Peuple \nHutu-Forces nationale de lib\u00e9ration (PALIPEHUTU-\nFNL). The representatives of both parties have been \nsitting at the same table since May, seeking to identify \nthe ways and means to implement the Comprehensive \nCeasefire Agreement signed in Tanzania on \n7 September 2006. Allow us to also thank the \ninternational community, the United Nations, the \nAfrican Union and the Regional Peace Initiative on \nBurundi for their participation in the return of the \nleaders of the PALIPEHUTU movement to Burundi. \nWe also take this opportunity to call on that movement \nto commit itself resolutely to the peace process, in \nparticular by ending its practice of forcing local \npopulations to supply its fighters. For its part, the \nGovernment of Burundi reaffirms that it will spare no \neffort to ensure progress in the peace process. \n This session is taking place three years after the \nestablishment of democratically elected institutions in \nour country, and it is the first time in our history that \nan elected Government has lasted more than three \nyears. This is an important stage in democracy. The \npeople in general and the Government in particular \nwelcome that milestone. \n Thanks particularly to the support of the \nPeacebuilding Commission, the Government of \nBurundi has just launched, throughout the country, \ndialogue frameworks between the socio-political \npartners of Burundi: the leaders of political parties, \nmembers of Parliament, civil society and the media. \nThey exchange views on the current challenges to our \ncountry in order to reach a consensus on the way \ndemocracy should function in Burundi. In the \nframework of promoting a sound justice system and \nnational reconciliation, the Government will soon \norganize nationwide elections on the machinery for \ntransitional justice. \n Our Government is firmly committed to \nrespecting human rights in all their forms. That is no \neasy task in a country that recently emerged from a \ncivil war that lasted more than 15 years. Nevertheless, \na number of measures have been taken and others are \nunder way. An independent national human rights \ncommission and a national children\u2019s forum will soon \nbe launched. Additionally, a new criminal code \nproviding for severe punishment for gender-based \n  \n \n08-52272 10 \n \nviolence is before Parliament, which is now up and \nrunning normally. In the same vein, the Government \nhas established human rights focal points in all \nministerial departments and is providing training in \nthat area and in peace education. \n I note that in Burundi, security is generally good \nthroughout our national territory, but we are \nencountering certain forms of insecurity linked to \nattacks and killings as a result of armed robbery and \nland disputes. In order to control that phenomenon, the \nGovernment has begun to disarm the civil population. \nThat is a very important and difficult measure, \nparticularly because there is a large number of weapons \nin private hands. We are convinced that, unless those \nweapons are taken out of circulation and destroyed, \npeace and security will always be under threat. We \ntherefore count on the support of our development \npartners to recover all weapons and munitions, \nparticularly once the PALIPEHUTU-FNL combatants \nhave completed the integration process. \n Indeed, although our country is arduously \nrecovering from the devastating effects of civil war, its \ngross domestic product remains among the lowest in \nthe world. The purchasing power of the population has \nfallen and inflation has risen apace, particularly given \nthe international phenomenon of the generalized \nincrease in the price of food and oil products. \n In a different vein, we recently organized a \nnational housing and population census that will \nprovide us with reliable data, without which it would \nbe difficult to carry out sustainable development \nprojects. The results of the census will allow the \nGovernment to improve the drafting of school and \nhealth policies, to which we pay particular attention, as \nevidenced by the measures already taken to establish \nfree health care for children under the age of five and \nwomen at childbirth, as well as free basic education. \n The Government has negotiated and launched \nmacroeconomic and structural reforms that our \ndevelopment partners support. Those reforms are \naimed at macroeconomic stabilization, the privatization \nof State enterprises, and bank and monetary \nmanagement that is compatible with sustainable \ngrowth. \n The Government is determined to fight corruption \nand tax fraud, and to promote real transparency in the \nmanagement of public wealth. Allow me to recall that \nan anti-corruption law has been enacted and that an \nanti-corruption brigade is now operating. The public \noversight body is playing its role and we welcome the \nconsiderable contribution made by civil society \norganizations. \n Burundi welcomes the ratification of the Pact on \nSecurity, Stability and Development in the Great Lakes \nRegion by nine members of the International \nConference on the Great Lakes Region. We will, of \ncourse, pursue measures to ensure that all member \nStates ratify the Pact. \n We recall that Burundi joined the East African \nCommunity (EAC) in July 2007. As I address this \nAssembly, nine Burundian members of Parliament \nrepresent my country in the Legislative Assembly of \nthe Community. That integration represents certain \nchallenges for the people and Government of Burundi, \nparticularly with respect to the imminent creation of a \ncommon market and a customs union, to culminate in \nthe establishment of a political federation. We take this \nopportunity to express our gratitude to the States \nmembers of EAC, which understand the difficulties \nfacing a country emerging from conflict, such as \nBurundi, and have implemented measures to assist our \nintegration. Of course, we also count on the support of \nour development partners to help us in all areas of \nintegration that we consider to be strategic for the \npolitical stability and development of the countries of \nthe subregion. \n Maintaining peace and security is a multidimensional \ntask subject to the many challenges that our Organization \nis called upon to address. These include conflict \nprevention and resolution, combating terrorism, \ncombating the illicit trade in small arms and light \nweapons and combating poverty, hunger and disease, \nincluding the HIV/AIDS pandemic. \n The United Nations is mobilizing many efforts \nand resources to meet those challenges. While it is true \nthat considerable progress has been achieved, our \nOrganization still has much to do, because the way \nforward is still long. We should also point out that \nbloody conflicts and hotbeds of tension remain, \nincluding in Somalia, Darfur, Iraq, Afghanistan and the \nMiddle East, et cetera. Terrorism is gaining ground all \nthe time and is causing more death than conventional \nwar. But we should not be discouraged. On the \ncontrary, our Organization must demonstrate the \ncapacity to prevent this type of conflict and provide \neffective remedies for the ills threatening humanity.  \n \n \n11 08-52272 \n \n In the name of international solidarity, Burundi \nhas decided to make its modest contribution towards \nresolving some of those crises, by providing military \nobservers and police officers in Darfur and C\u00f4te \nd\u2019Ivoire, and to military peacekeeping contingents in \nSomalia in the framework of operations established by \nthe African Union. \n Burundi enthusiastically welcomed the global \nchallenge represented by the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs), which were adopted in 2000 and \nreaffirmed in the 2005 World Summit Outcome \nDocument (resolution 60/1). We are pleased to report \nthat, through its policy of free primary education and \nhealth care for children under five years and women in \nchildbirth, Burundi is achieving successes that deserve \nsupport. While thanking those countries and peoples \nwho have been of such great help to us since the launch \nof the policy in 2005, we would like to call for \ninternational solidarity, because the policy requires \nconsiderable Government resources that our country \ncannot acquire on its own.  \n Indeed, the World Solidarity Fund for the \npromotion of social and human development and the \nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria \ndo exist, but unfortunately, despite those initiatives the \nresults are still modest. We therefore appeal to \ndeveloped countries that have not yet done so to keep \ntheir promise to allocate 0.7 per cent of gross national \nincome to official development assistance.  \n Special attention should be given to problems \nincluding putting order into the international financial \nmarkets, the need to increase investment in Africa, the \nrational management of water and energy resources, \ntechnology transfer, international trade agreements, \nclimate change and the management of toxic waste. \n It is more urgent than ever to harmonize the \nprocedures and instruments for achieving our common \nobjectives, including efforts to counteract hunger, \nreduce poverty worldwide and to ensure peacebuilding. \nOtherwise, we will witness the persistence of \nphenomena including the tragedy of clandestine \nemigration, the brain drain, heightened crime and other \nills.  \n In closing, I wish to say that we hope that a \nminimum of political will and strengthened \ninternational solidarity will enable the United Nations \nto find appropriate solutions to the scourges affecting \nour era. Long live international solidarity. Long live \nthe United Nations. "

        "file_text": "First, allow me to \nexpress gratitude to Srgjan Kerim, President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-second session, for his \nable leadership. I would also like to congratulate and \nwish success to its current President, Mr. Miguel \nd\u2019Escoto Brockmann. \n I am representing a country that, during the last \nseveral weeks, has found itself in a situation that is \nunacceptable for the twenty-first century. \n Once again blood was shed in the South Caucasus \nand once again innocent people died because we, the \nleaders, failed to bring a peaceful resolution to an \nexisting conflict. The armed conflict, which erupted in \na matter of hours, threatened not only the entire region \nbut well beyond it. \n Recently, the unsettling expression \u201ccold war\u201d \nhas re-emerged. I hold the view that the main task of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-third session should \nbe to issue a collective rejection of such developments. \nMemories of the previous cold war are very fresh and \nits consequences linger still. \n In that regard, I believe that our main task should \nbe the establishment of a new, dependable and viable \nstructure. The challenges facing humankind in recent \ndecades have been transformed and reshaped in such a \nway that they cannot be addressed exclusively with the \nstructures established after the Second World War. We \ncontinue to respond to today\u2019s horizontal, interwoven \nchallenges \u2014 such as terrorism, international crime, \ndrug trafficking and others \u2014 through institutions that \nwere designed predominantly to settle disputes among \nStates. Regional cooperation can be a core means of \naddressing those new challenges. Armenia has always \nadvocated such cooperation and is confident that it is \none of the most effective means of addressing \nproblems among States. In that regard, open borders, \ninterconnecting lines of communication and \ninterrelated economic systems are crucial. \n The United Nations was among the first \ninstitutions to respond to the current global problems \nresulting from rising food and fuel prices. That \nphenomenon represents a real threat to all the countries \nof the world. For poor countries, its consequences will \nbe devastating. Unfortunately, even in such \ncircumstances we continue to witness unilateral \nsanctions and border closings. In the face of global \nchallenges, countries should work together to prevent \nthe further deterioration of the situation and to \nimplement the sustainable development agenda. \nOtherwise, we will jeopardize our collective efforts to \nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. \n Neighbouring States have always had and will \ncontinue to have problems with each other. However, \nthose problems cannot be solved if there is no \n  \n \n08-51845 10 \n \ndialogue. With that in mind, and taking advantage of a \nfootball game between our national teams, I invited the \nPresident of Turkey to Yerevan. I welcomed the bold \ndecision of President G\u00fcl to accept the invitation, \nwhich made him my co-author in the \u201cfootball \ndiplomacy\u201d initiative. \n We discussed an array of bilateral and regional \nissues. The most important outcome was our decision \nnot to leave current problems to future generations. I \nam confident that the time has come to solve \nArmenian-Turkish problems, and on that issue I \nobserved a similar resolve on the part of President G\u00fcl. \nI am certain that it is necessary to move fast and \nresolutely in that direction. \n The events of the past few weeks shocked the \nSouth Caucasus region and made it a focal point of the \ninternational media. I believe that they hold very \nserious lessons for us all. I would mention only two. \n First, we Member States must adhere strictly to \nthe letter and spirit of the United Nations Charter. If \nany country rapidly increases its military budget and \nbrags about it; if arms limitations stipulated under \ninternational agreements are openly violated; and if a \ncountry has signed a ceasefire agreement, which \nconstitutes an international responsibility, but threatens \nto resume military action on any pretext, we must \nrespond swiftly and firmly. Prevention is preferable to \ncure, and a potential military conflict must be averted \nat the planning stage. We must confirm unequivocally \nthat the violation or threat of violation of an existing \nceasefire contains elements of aggression. \n Secondly, the time has come to seriously consider \nthe right of peoples to self-determination. We continue \nto witness in our own time how the mere mention of \nself-determination may be tantamount to a declaration \nof suicidal intent. One of the basic principles of \ninternational law \u2014 the right of peoples to self-\ndetermination \u2014 has become grounds for exile, ethnic \ncleansing or genocide. There is no doubt in my mind \nthat it need not be that way in the twenty-first century. \n We do not insist on the idea that each claim to \nself-determination should be resolved through \nsecession. However, we have seen that outcome \nbecome the solution to conflicts more often than not. \nWhen a nation finally has the opportunity to exercise \nits inalienable right, it is immediately categorized as an \nexceptional case. That seems to have become a pattern. \nThere is no doubt that, if it is to be viable, such a solution \nmust be endorsed by all the parties involved. That is \nwhy we continue to negotiate actively with Azerbaijan \nin the framework of the Minsk Group of the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \n(OSCE) in seeking that country\u2019s recognition of the \nRepublic of Nagorno-Karabakh, which has been de \nfacto independent for almost two decades. \n The people of Nagorno-Karabakh, who followed \nthe legal path in declaring their desire for self-\ndetermination, were subjected to a brutal war. For \nyears they hovered on the brink of extinction. At that \ntime, Nagorno-Karabakh was only an autonomous \nregion with neither a regular army, arms and \nammunition, nor any intention of or ability to occupy \nAzeri territory. I think it is at the very least unfair to \nlabel as \u201coccupants\u201d people who fought for their right \nto exist; and yet, Azerbaijan has done just that, even \nfrom this high rostrum. \n In my country, even schoolchildren are very \nfamiliar with the United Nations. Such children \u2014 the \nfuture leaders of my country and of the world \u2014 may \nnot have a profound understanding of the United \nNations Charter, but they know that the Organization \nwas created to ensure peace and security for \nhumankind, to promote friendship among nations, to \nsolve problems jointly, and to protect human rights. \nThe schoolchildren of my country trust the United \nNations, since in their eyes it is primarily the building \nwith the \u201cpretzel gun\u201d memorial before it. \n Some months ago within this building, resolution \n62/243 was adopted with only 39 States out of 146 \nvoting in favour. The resolution was adopted in \nresponse to an episode in the Nagorno-Karabakh \nconflict. A fundamental and sensitive problem with \ndeep roots and painful and bloody developments, and \nfor which immense efforts have been made to secure a \npeaceful settlement, was decided upon by the majority \nin support of one of the parties. \n The outcome was more than predictable \u2014 a new \nwave of belligerent statements in Azerbaijan, false \nencomiums, political speculation and so on. However, \nthe voting in Azerbaijan seemed to be little more than \nwindow-dressing. I hope that the real interests of \nAzerbaijan lie not in its misrepresentation at the \ninternational level of the different elements of the \nconflict, but rather in a peaceful and comprehensive \nresolution, which is equally in the interests of the \n \n \n11 08-51845 \n \nRepublic of Nagorno-Karabakh and the Republic of \nArmenia.  \n The process mediated by the Co-Chairs of the \nMinsk Group is aimed at reaching precisely that goal, \nand I believe that it was in that understanding that \nalmost four fifths of the United Nations membership \nabstained in the voting or did not vote at all on that \nresolution. The voting records of the United States, \nFrance and Russia \u2014 the most well-informed third \nparties regarding the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and \nits resolution \u2014 are ample demonstration of that fact. \n Is it absolutely necessary to shed blood to \nunderstand that frozen conflicts demand an expert and \nconscientious approach and cannot be solved through \ndiscussions in various forums? We have worked in \nearnest under the mediation of the OSCE Minsk Group \nCo-Chairs. Is it not possible to at least abstain from \ncreating new challenges to the process? Is it not our \nmutual goal to erect a pretzel gun monument for the \nArmenian and Azeri children of our region? I assure \nthe General Assembly that those kids deserve one. \n This year, we will celebrate two significant \nachievements in international law: the sixtieth \nanniversaries of the adoptions of the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights and of the Convention on \nthe Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of \nGenocide. For us Armenians, as for other peoples that \nhave survived genocide, those anniversaries are more \nthan important. Armenia has done and will continue to \ndo everything it can at the United Nations to provide \nfor the continuous advocacy of the genocide \nConvention and its enforcement. Genocide cannot be \nthe concern of one nation alone; genocide is a crime \nagainst humanity. \n As for the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights, we fully realize that Armenia, as a young \ndemocracy, has important work ahead in order to \nguarantee the full and efficient implementation of the \nentire complex of human rights. To that end, we are \ntrying to learn from countries with extensive \nexperience and not to repeat others\u2019 mistakes. Those \nlessons are not always easy to take, but we are \nconfident that, for a country like Armenia, they are a \nfundamental guarantee of sustainable development. At \nthe same time we realize that, in a rapidly changing \nreality, along with scientific progress and advances in \ninformation technologies, the protection of human \nrights and the processes to monitor States\u2019 fulfilment of \nthat obligation should be seriously reviewed and \nreconsidered.

        "file_text": "The United Nations \nembodies multilateralism. It is living testimony of the \nintergovernmental process at work. Samoa\u2019s \nmembership of the United Nations is grounded on the \npromise of the hope, equality and justice the United \nNations offers the Member States, irrespective of their \neconomic, political or military strengths. Looking \nback, our Organization has not lived up to the lofty \ngoals enshrined in its Charter. Its credibility has been \ntarnished and undermined, and its performance \nquestioned at times. \n Yet, those perceived failings of our Organization \nare of our own making when we allow the vested \ninterests of a few to take precedence over the urgent \nand deserving needs of the majority; when we accept \nflawed perceptions that certain issues, States and \nregions are more important than others, distorting the \nworld\u2019s focus and the allocation of resources; when we \nturn a blind eye and let the numerical superiority of \ngroups or the importance of some stakeholders \nfrustrate informed discussions of critical issues to score \npoints and achieve symbolic wins that help no one in \nthe long run; and when the long list of broken promises \nand unfulfilled undertakings couched in eloquent yet \nmeaningless rhetoric creates frustration and mistrust \namong Member States. \n The end result is that if no one takes \nresponsibility, the future of the United Nations will be \nin doubt and the cost to the world incalculable. We \nhave no one but ourselves to blame for any deficit in \nthe credibility of our Organization. What we urgently \nneed is a collective sense of trust and commitment to \nits Charter. Only then will the United Nations remain \nrelevant and regain the confidence of our Members. \n There is too much at stake for the world to just sit \nidly by. Strong global leadership is at a premium. \nGovernments must yield not to vested interests and \nexpediency, but because it is the ethical and the just \nthing to do. \n That was my message from this rostrum last year, \nand I am happy to restate it again today. No Member \nState is too powerful or too small not to be part of the \nsolution of making the United Nations an agent of \nchange and a beacon of hope during these challenging \ntimes. And no contribution is too trivial or unimportant \nnot to matter. For States in leadership positions, the \n \n \n29 08-52272 \n \nideal is to lead with humility, fairness and a kind heart. \nThe world expects nothing less. Leadership and \nresponsibility are, after all, one and the same. \n Clearly, Member States can only do so much. We \nneed a committed Secretariat that is aware of and \nsensitive to the needs of the people it serves. That is a \nnon-negotiable prerequisite. Samoa supports the \nSecretary-General\u2019s vision of creating a professional \ncareer service that is flexible and mobile enough to \nallow for quick and positive responses to the diverse \ndemands of Member States. The need for the United \nNations to deliver as one entity cannot be \noveremphasized. It adds value and quality to the \nprocess, eliminates waste, minimizes overlaps and \nensures that the scarce resources entrusted to its care \nare used optimally to supplement Members States\u2019 \nhard-earned efforts. \n Right now our world is facing a difficult and \ntroubled time. As members of the global community, \nour futures are inextricably linked. For Samoa, the \nsmall size of our country, its isolation from the major \nmarkets and permanent vulnerability to climate change \nare factors beyond our control. Yet even as a least \ndeveloped small island nation that has made little or no \ncontribution to the causes of today\u2019s crises, Samoa is \nnot shielded from their immediate negative impact and \nlong-term consequences. \n Global crises, as we know from bitter experience \nwith global warming, energy and food prices, and now \nwith the mayhem in financial markets that threatens to \nengulf the world, affect all our nations irrespective of \nwhether we contributed to those crises or not. \n This is why, in spite of shortcomings in the \nOrganization, the United Nations remains the only \nviable institution that draws all the nations of our \nworld together. However, the need to revitalize the \nGeneral Assembly and to reform the Security Council \nhas been obvious for many years. In the case of the \nSecurity Council, as long as its current composition \nand rules ignore today\u2019s realities, it will continue to \nstruggle to effectively carry out its intended tasks, as \nwe have seen it do over many years.  \n Samoa remains firm in its position that the \npermanent and non-permanent membership categories \nof the Security Council should be expanded. Member \nStates with legitimate credentials should be encouraged to \nstake their claims. Importantly, the intergovernmental \nprocess should commence in earnest during the current \nsession to bring finality to an issue that has taxed \nMembers States\u2019 patience and endurance for over a \ndecade and a half. \n At the very minimum, the unanimous support of \nthe current permanent members of the Security Council \nis a must. We hope, therefore, that candidate States and \npermanent members will reach out to each other in \ngood faith and set aside the barriers that continue to \nfrustrate the reforms to the Security Council that we all \nknow must be made. \n One observation that has been made over many \nyears is that there seems to be indifference, whether \nintended or not, on the part of some of the leader \nnations of our Organization towards small and \neconomically weak States, which, while they observe \ngood governance and practice sound economic \nmanagement, are nevertheless faced with the constant \nstruggle to sustain and maintain the hard-won gains on \nthose fronts. \n Paradoxically, the only time those struggling \nStates get noticed is when they are tottering on the \nbrink or in the process of becoming failed States. By \nthen, the cost in salvage action and remedial \nprogrammes is enormous. Therefore, the willingness of \nleader nations to listen and to try and understand early \non the problems of States struggling to sustain good \ngovernance and economic management would go a \nlong way towards creating effective partnerships, \ndeploying scarce resources efficiently, and engendering \ngoodwill and trust in the process. \n Troubled spots around the world are on the rise, \nincluding in our own Pacific region. Some are \noccasioned by outside forces and influences, and others \nthrough domestically induced factors. Notwithstanding \nour differences, we all aspire to the same values in life. \nHence, we must heed the lessons of history and provide \nappropriate encouragement and interventions to help \nStates restore good governance and abide by the \nprinciples of democracy. \n Yesterday\u2019s high-level meeting on the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) was a timely \nreminder, not of what we have achieved by the midway \npoint, but what decisive actions must be taken urgently \nif the time-bound targets set at the dawn of the new \nmillennium are to be met. Samoa participated in the \nrecent Accra meeting on aid effectiveness, which \nfurther refined the pathways to the MDGs review just \nconcluded and the International Conference on \n  \n \n08-52272 30 \n \nFinancing for Development in Doha in November \n2008. \n Our strategic plan for 2008 to 2012 is a \ncomprehensive development framework linked to the \nbudget process for the implementation of the MDGs, \nwith strategic targeting of those goals on which we \nhave seen minimal progress through priority resource \nallocation. \n We are grateful to the Governments of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and the United Kingdom \nfor their support through debt relief. Similarly, we want \nto acknowledge the innovative partnerships in which \nwe are engaged with our development partners, both \nold and new, giving us full ownership of the process in \nour quest to achieve as many of the MDGs as we \npossibly can. \n In September 2007, during the 2007 South Pacific \nGames in Samoa, my Government worked closely with \nthe United Nations system and others to promote the \nachievement of the MDGs. One innovative way of \nusing sports as a vehicle to effect change in behaviour \nand to relay development messages was the installation \nof a solar-powered \u201cMDG scoreboard\u201d in front of a \nGovernment building to monitor national progress \ntowards the MDGs. \n Climate change continues to play a pivotal role in \nthe decisions of the leaders in our region. Our Pacific \nIslands Forum meeting in August 2008 adopted the \nNiue Declaration on Climate Change. Our Forum \ncommuniqu\u00e9, issued at the same summit, highlighted \nthe vulnerability of Pacific small island developing \nStates to the impacts of climate change. The European \nUnion and the Pacific Islands Forum Troika agreed last \nweek to work together to highlight the ongoing \nvulnerability of Pacific islands to the impacts of sea-\nlevel rise. Our representatives to the United Nations \nare working with like-minded countries to bring to the \nfore the security implications of climate change. \n In total, those efforts and partnerships should \nconvince those in denial that climate change is real. Its \neffects have already been felt by some of our Pacific \nisland States, and for some low-lying islands climate \nchange is an existential issue and their long-term \nsurvivability is at stake. \n Only through selfless and concerted efforts by all \ncountries, led by the major greenhouse gas emitters, \ncan we have a fighting chance of lessening the \ndestructive impact of climate change and enhancing the \nchances of a credible post-Kyoto agreement beyond \n2012. To reach that goal, the Bali Road Map \u2014 with its \nfour pillars of adaptation, mitigation, finance and \ntechnology \u2014 should be supported both in word and in \ndeed. \n The unpredictable weather patterns of recent \ntimes, affecting all regions of the world, are a sober \nreminder of our limitations as human beings against \nthe force of natural elements no matter how good and \ntechnologically sound our preparations are. We need a \nglobal response if we are to succeed. Samoa was \npleased, therefore, to see Australia take its place as a \nState party to the Kyoto Protocol at the Bali meeting. \nWe remain optimistic that, either through a change of \nheart or through new circumstances, other countries \nwill join the Kyoto Protocol to strengthen the \nimplementation regimes of the Convention. \n I mentioned last year the offer of the United \nNations system to establish an inter-agency climate \nchange centre in our country for coordinated support to \nPacific island countries and regional organizations for \nclimate change mitigation, adaptation and disaster risk \nreduction. Given the clear importance to the Pacific \nregion of the project, Samoa has allocated land \u2014 16 \nacres in all \u2014 on which to locate the centre and awaits \nthe provision of the necessary resources by the United \nNations so that the facility, which is already public \nknowledge in the region, can be constructed. \n Samoa continues to support United Nations \npeacekeeping efforts worldwide. Small as we are, \nSamoan police continue to serve side by side with \nofficers from other countries in Liberia, the Sudan and \nTimor-Leste as part of our ongoing commitment. \nWithin the Pacific region, our solidarity in confronting \nthe challenges facing our neighbours ensures a \nguaranteed Samoan police presence in the Regional \nAssistance Mission to the Solomon Islands under the \numbrella of the Pacific Islands Forum. \n A durable peace settlement in the Middle East \ncontinues to elude us, but that does not constitute \ngrounds to be pessimistic. We should support every \neffort to create conditions conducive to the creation of \nan independent Palestinian State alongside a secure and \nsafe State of Israel. \n Finally, those bent on creating fear and panic \nthroughout the world will stop at nothing to achieve \ntheir aims. We must not be held hostage to their \n \n \n31 08-52272 \n \ndevious designs. Individually and collectively, we must \nstep up our efforts to combat the threat of international \nterrorism in its many manifestations. No country can \nsucceed on its own. Only by working collaboratively \ncan we be successful. "

        "file_text": "Let me take this opportunity \nto congratulate you, Mr. President, on your very \ninspiring statement yesterday (see ). Its \n \n \n13 08-51749 \n \nvision and compassion should provide a framework for \nthe deliberations of the General Assembly into the \nfuture. \n I should also like to thank the Secretary-General \nfor his unequivocal resolve to use his tenure to provide \naccountable leadership to this global institution. His \ncall for increased support from all Members in \nrestructuring and streamlining the Secretariat he leads \nto ensure more flexible, efficient and effective tackling \nof the many global challenges confronting humankind \nis timely and must be heeded. \n The unmistakable fact of our time is that the \nworld is in a state of flux with unmatched challenges \naptly described yesterday by you, Mr. President, as a \nconfluence of large-scale interrelated crises. That is \nbefuddling all nations, strong and weak, rich and poor; \nbut, as you and others have also observed, there are \ntremendous opportunities as well. Examples of the \nchallenges that practically all previous speakers have \nalluded to include the phenomenon of climate change \nand its attendant snow-melts, tsunamis, floods and \ndroughts; the difficult-to-explain turbulence in the \ncrude oil market; the soaring prices of food; the \nupheavals in the world financial market; the massive \ntrafficking in drugs and weapons; and the spate of \nharrowing acts of terrorism in many parts of the world. \nWhile some of those problems are natural, many of \nthem are man-made. \n On the other hand, the advent of information and \ncommunication technologies is effecting magical \nchanges in awareness and making time, space and \nboundaries virtually irrelevant to human interactivity \naround the world. Discoveries in medicine are \nimproving the quality of life and life expectancy. Fast \ntransportation, dramatic feats in engineering and \nbioscience technologies with the promise of turning \neven deserts into productive land are unleashing \nunimaginable wealth among nations and individuals. \nCollectively, those opportunities are diffusing power \naround the world, to such an extent as to negate any \nidea of a few nations having hegemonic sway in human \naffairs. \n Indeed, the era of the explosion of knowledge can \nbe said to be fulfilling the biblical saying that \nhumankind has been created in the image of God. \nHumankind is increasingly showing limitless creativity, \nwhich inspires a vision that it is indeed capable of \novercoming the challenges of our time. However, the \nproblem is one of whether we will curb our self-\ncentredness, greed, bigotry and petty inhumanities to \nallow for the sharing of the outcomes of that creativity. \nLeft to our individual nations, the peoples of the world \nwill not be high-minded enough. The main challenge \nthen becomes how the various peoples of the world \nwill accept their common humanity as the centrepiece \nof their endeavours. \n There must be leadership, for which the \nOrganization seems to have been created. The founding \nfathers must have instinctively believed that, with time, \nthe Organization would evolve into a global \nGovernment. For even as there were marked \ngeopolitical considerations in the establishment of the \nUnited Nations, the Organization was also imbued with \na powerful streak of morality. With time, the moral \nstreak has been steadily overcoming the geopolitical \ndimension. That perception is what must drive the \nentire membership to accept the call for reform of this \nglobal institution and its agencies so as to make them \naccountable to Members and, in turn, make Members \naccept their authority and direction. \n Indeed, the United Nations is the only \nOrganization in the world with the potential to \ncommand respect across the board. Under its auspices, \nstrong and rich nations alike are showing increasing \ntendencies to share knowledge and finance resources \nwith the weak and poor. Fellow-feeling in international \nrelations is also deepening. It is my belief that it is \nthrough the Organization that the world will eventually \nachieve peace, stability and prosperity, following the \nmenacing flux that engulfs all of us now. \n It is the same moral streak embedded in the \nUnited Nations that is propelling the development of \nthe various regional blocs around the world. In the case \nof Africa, dramatic improvements have been made in \nthe last decade and a half. The African Union\u2019s Peer \nReview Mechanism demonstrates the great resolve of \nAfrican nations to adhere to the rule of law and good \ngovernance. It is noteworthy that, as of now, close to a \nmajority of the membership of the Union has signed up \nfor review. It is also significant that many more African \nleaders are today acceding to power through the ballot \nbox. \n Meanwhile, under the auspices of the New \nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development, Africa is trying \nto pool resources among its members, in partnership \nwith others outside the continent, to exploit its huge \n  \n \n08-51749 14 \n \npotential and to develop its markets and its energy, \ntelecommunication, transportation and agriculture \nsectors, among others. That is the way to solve the \nmany problems of poverty, illiteracy, disease, \nignorance and conflict. It is Africa\u2019s initiative to \nmainstream itself into globalization, and is receiving \nthe support of the international community. Evidence \nof that includes the many joint conferences held with \nJapan, China, Brazil and India, as well as Africa\u2019s old \nallies in Europe and North America. \n While we appreciate the support from our \ndevelopment partners, I must say that there is still \nroom for improvement, especially as regards the \ncontinent\u2019s efforts to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. The various existing forms of \nassistance are uncoordinated and insufficiently \nsubstantial to achieve the Goals by the target date of \n2015. In that regard, the Secretary-General\u2019s call for \nreview and quick delivery of support is timely. As \nobserved in the Accra Accord of the twelfth United \nNations Conference on Trade and Development, the \nwhole idea of aid is to empower beneficiary countries \nto stand on their own feet and to become effective \npartners in the global market, from which neither rich \nnor poor countries can abstain, given the increasing \ninterdependence of the world. \n In January 2001, I was sworn into office as \nPresident of Ghana on a liberal democratic \nConstitution with the same strong streak of morality \nthat I see in the Charter of the United Nations. The \nConstitution acknowledges the centrality of humankind \nin all endeavours; hence the provisions for respect for \nhuman rights, the rule of law, gender balance, \naccountability and transparency in governance.  \n But, in 2001 the national economy was in bad \nshape and Ghana had to sign up for the Heavily \nIndebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative (HIPC) in \norder to access funds for various reconstruction \nprojects for which credit lines were difficult to come \nby. With national determination and great discipline, \nthe HIPC completion point was achieved in record time \nto earn debt forgiveness of about $8 billion from \nbilateral and multilateral creditors. That success has led \nto increased inflows of domestic and foreign \ninvestment that have enabled the Government to \nlaunch, among other social services, a free and \ncompulsory universal basic education programme and \nsubstantial developments in both the second-cycle and \ntertiary levels education.  \n In the health sector, the first-ever national health \ninsurance scheme, including free maternal care, has \nalso begun in Ghana. Concurrently, heavy investments \nare being made in infrastructure in the transportation, \nenergy and telecommunications sectors in anticipation \nof accelerated growth in the economy. Meanwhile, a \nprocess to modernize the country\u2019s agriculture through \nmechanization has begun to improve the welfare of the \nmore than 60 per cent of society that is rural and \ndepends on the sector for its livelihood. \n By those policies, among others, the nation is \nnow in sight of attaining its ambitious vision of middle \nincome status by 2015, which is also the target date for \nthe Millennium Development Goals. Those \ndevelopments have been crowned by the discovery of \noil in commercial quantities, which the Government is \ndetermined to make a blessing for the whole nation of \nGhana, rather than a curse. \n That is the Ghana story as my term of office \ncomes to a close at the end of this year. The moral I \nglean from the story is that development in freedom is \npossible. In other words, accelerated national \ndevelopment and good governance, including respect \nfor fundamental human rights, are not mutually \nexclusive. Indeed, good governance should hasten \ndevelopment. "

        "file_text": "Belgium echoes the congratulations that have been \nextended to Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann on his \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-third session, and wishes him every success. \n During the past year, the international community \nhas faced unprecedented challenges. As we gather here \nin New York, a major crisis of confidence is shaking \nthe financial markets. This has an impact, of course, on \nthe world economy. The spectre of a global recession \nhas been added to the already onerous challenges that \nhave arisen in recent times, such as the food crisis, the \n A/63/PV.13\n \n15 08-53122 \n \nspike in energy prices, global warming, terrorism and \nthe danger of nuclear proliferation. \n In addition, our world is changing and becoming \nincreasingly multipolar. In that regard, 8 August 2008 \nwill remain symbolic: the very day on which China \noffered us the unique spectacle of the opening of the \nOlympic Games, Russia and Georgia were colliding in \na conflict with harmful repercussions for peace on the \nEuropean continent. The very foundations of the \nbalance that had existed since the 1990s seemed to be \ncalled into question. This uncertain situation has far-\nreaching consequences for international organizations. \n We could imagine that, in the face of these \nenormous challenges, all the world\u2019s countries would \ncome together to combat them jointly. Unfortunately, \nthat is hardly what is happening. Belgium believes that \nonly through close cooperation and enhanced \nmultilateralism will we be able to respond to these \nchallenges. More than ever, whether we like it or not, \nwe are in a situation of mutual dependence. Crises \naffect all of us, and the actions taken by some have an \nimpact on everybody else. That is particularly true for \nthe current serious financial crisis. If we can stabilize \nthe financial markets in the coming few days through \nproactive measures, that will benefit not only the major \nbanks and their employees, but also the entrepreneurs, \nconsumers and citizens of the whole world, including \nthose in the least developed countries. Those countries \nhave already been heavily affected by the sharp \nincrease in the prices of agricultural and energy \nproducts and are the least equipped to deal with a \ntightening of credit conditions.  \n Stabilizing the markets is certainly necessary, but \nit must not make us lose sight of the lessons to be \nlearned from the crisis and the corresponding medium- \nand long-term measures to be taken to ensure that the \nworld does not again become victim to financial \nmanagement that at times is risky and immense \nspeculation with borrowed money.  \n We are well aware that the crisis goes far beyond \nthe capacity of a single country, however powerful it \nmay be. Better regulation of financial markets and the \ndrawing up of control regulations are essential, in \nparticular with regard to short selling, hedge funds and \nstructured products. That is a task that can be \nundertaken only at the international level, in close \ncooperation among the world\u2019s economies. \n Understand what I am saying: Belgium is \nconvinced of the advantages of globalization and free \ntrade. We must not forget that thanks to that \nglobalization of trade, in recent decades the world has \nseen remarkable development and that hundreds of \nmillions of men and women have escaped extreme \npoverty and today have a better daily life, even if the \nsharing of wealth still remains too unequal. \n The developed countries have the duty to \nspearhead a better organization of the financial world. \nThe European Union has already taken steps in that \ndirection, and we welcome that. However, there \nremains much to do. Here, I make an appeal that we \nembark on that task together, with energy and \ndedication. \n The emergence of new economies is an asset for \nthe world. Ever more countries are determined to \nbecome players in the international system. They must \ntake their due place, as the French President \nemphasized last Monday on behalf of the European \nUnion (see A/63/PV.5). It is also in everyone\u2019s interest \nto demonstrate responsibility. \n I would like to stress today that the emerging \neconomic Powers, from Brazil to India and from China \nto South Africa, have, more than we do and more than \never, a need for trade that is both open and fair to \ncontinue to develop their economies at the pace they \ndeserve, without however causing imbalance in the \npillars of international trade. Here too, we must again \nfind the constructive political will necessary to restart \nthe Doha trade negotiations that unfortunately failed in \nGeneva last July. \n We all must also show ourselves to be responsible \nplayers, in order to try and find solutions to the \nchallenges posed by the food crisis and the huge \nincrease in energy prices and to combat the causes and \neffects of climate change. Those challenges we face, \nissues that are extremely complex and closely \ninterlinked, are different facets of one and the same \nquestion, a question that is at the heart of the concerns \nof my country: that of sustainable development. None \nof us can resolve these problems alone. They call for \nsolutions at the world level. It is thus crucial that we \nsuccessfully conclude in December 2009 the \nnegotiations for a global agreement on climate, as we \npledged in Bali.  \n Nor is it by closing in upon ourselves that we \nshall reduce the huge inequalities that still characterize \nA/63/PV.13  \n \n08-53122 16 \n \nglobal development. Better distribution of the fruits of \neconomic growth is a world responsibility that \nconcerns us all. The Millennium Development Goals \nmust remain our main guiding principle. The Follow-\nup International Conference on Financing for \nDevelopment to Review the Implementation of the \nMonterrey Consensus, which will take place in Doha at \nthe end of this year, will be an important moment. The \ndeveloped countries must do more, and I reiterate \nBelgium\u2019s determination to achieve the objective of \ndevoting 0.7 per cent of its gross domestic product to \nofficial development assistance by 2010.  \n However, this is a shared responsibility, which \nfirst and foremost falls to the Governments of the \ncountries involved. That is why Belgium will continue \nto work actively in promoting the concept of good \ngovernance. \n In that regard, the issue of natural resources is \nparticularly important to me. It is not a matter of \ncalling into question the sovereignty of any country. \nBut sovereignty also carries with it responsibilities \u2014 \nindeed, responsibilities first and foremost. Natural \nresources may be a driving force of development to \ndraw populations out of poverty if their exploitation is \nundertaken in a transparent way to benefit the economy \nof the country. Unfortunately, experience shows that \nfrequently that is not the case and that illegal \nexploitation often fuels conflict. Therefore, we must \nwork towards achieving greater transparency and \nfighting illegal exploitation. That is why Belgium \norganized last year a debate on that subject in the \nSecurity Council (see S/PV.5705), and why it would \nlike extensive debate on natural resources during the \ncurrent session of the General Assembly. \n As a member of the Security Council, Belgium \nhas had the opportunity to be at the heart of the \ninternational system. That has bolstered our conviction \nthat we can meet those great challenges only through \nincreased international cooperation and has further \nstrengthened our determination to work for effective \nmultilateralism. The key to that effectiveness is not to \nbe sought only in structures and mechanisms. It lies \nalso and above all in our political will to make them \nwork and together to find solutions to our common \nproblems. \n Here, I note with regret a certain turning inwards, \neven a return to sovereignty-based concerns. I want to \nbe clear: I have great respect for the sovereignty of \nStates. That goes without saying. That is one of the \nfundamental principles upon which our international \nsystem is founded. However, being a sovereign State \nalso means that a State must shoulder its \nresponsibilities in the international community, even \nmore so with regard to its own population. Being a \nsovereign State does not mean that it can neglect the \nneeds of its citizens in terms of development, security, \nthe rule of law and human rights. Sovereignty does not \ngive carte blanche for conduct that is incompatible \nwith the values and commitments to which we have \nsubscribed within the United Nations. Sovereignty \nmust be a force for good, and not an excuse for a State \nnot to meet its responsibilities and to avoid its \ninternational and humanitarian obligations. Otherwise, \nit becomes what I would call souverainism: an abuse of \nsovereignty behind which to hide and escape its duties. \n Too often the argument of respect for sovereignty \nprevents the international community from acting when \nthe situation in a country is deteriorating before our \neyes, resulting in the population suffering and an \nincrease in serious human rights violations. The \nexamples are well known and strike us all. Myanmar, \nDarfur, Zimbabwe and the eastern Congo all confront \nus with a responsibility to protect, a responsibility that \nthe international community is called upon to exercise \nwhen a sovereign State cannot or, worse, refuses to \nassume that responsibility. That can be undertaken \nthrough humanitarian instruments, the civil \nadministration of crises, peacekeeping or peace-\nrestoration missions, or, earlier on, crisis prevention. \n In that context, I wish to speak of combating \nimpunity. Belgium is convinced that there cannot be \nlasting peace without justice. That principle guides our \nforeign policy. It is achieved in the first place by \nbolstering the rule of law and justice at the national \nlevel before, during and after a conflict. For the gravest \ncrimes, we actively support the development of \ninternational criminal law. This is not the time to let \nany doubts persist with regard to our active support for \nthe International Criminal Court by putting forward, as \nsome do, other, more regional solutions. That is \nparticularly true now when the Court is preparing its \nfirst trial. \n Peace and security are the responsibility of the \ninternational community as a whole, and it is in that \nspirit that Belgium approached its mandate in the \nSecurity Council, nearly two years ago: seek \nconstantly, in a constructive and non-dogmatic manner, \n A/63/PV.13\n \n17 08-53122 \n \nthe best way to move things forward. It is particularly \npleased with the progress in crisis management and the \nextraordinary expansion of peacekeeping operations. \nFrom that perspective Belgium calls for a renewal of \nthe United Nations Organization Mission in the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo with a strengthened \nmandate, which is a key factor in maintaining in the \neastern Congo the prospects for settling the crisis and \navoiding a Somalian scenario.  \n Belgium also welcomes efforts of regional \norganizations and their collaboration with the United \nNations. I am thinking, for instance, of the European \nUnion alongside the United Nations in Chad and the \nCentral African Republic.  \n We need to make further progress with regard to \nan integrated and comprehensive approach to conflict \nresolution. The establishment of the Peacebuilding \nCommission is a real step forward in that area. That is \nwhy Belgium has assumed the chair of the country-\nspecific configuration on the Central African Republic. \nMajor progress has been made, but much remains to be \ndone, in particular in order to better help countries \nduring that delicate phase when they are emerging \nfrom crisis. \n We will soon celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of \nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. That will \nbe the time for us to remember the values that it \nrepresents and that we all share, and to which we all \nsubscribed and which we should implement for the \nbenefit of our citizens and for greater well-being \nthroughout the world. It is a responsibility that we must \nremember, particularly since it seems to be called into \nquestion at a time when we are faced with the major \nchallenges that I have just described. Together and on \nthe basis of our shared values, we should assume those \nresponsibilities. \n That is the real challenge. It is not through less, \nbut more international cooperation and multilateralism \nthat we will achieve solutions. "

        "file_text": "This session\u2019s general political debate and \nhigh-level meetings once again convince us of the need \nto move in international relations from confrontation \nbased on narrow national interests towards equal, \nmutually respectful dialogue and cooperation. \nOtherwise, it will not be possible to achieve progress in \naddressing the urgent global and regional problems \nfacing humanity. \n The advent of the twenty-first century raised \nmany hopes, but thus far the world has not been able to \navoid wars as a means of achieving its objectives. \nImposing or dictating one\u2019s will and pressure by \nindividual States increase conflict and make it difficult \nto overcome obstacles. Today, we are dealing with \nglobal challenges that not only impede humankind\u2019s \ndevelopment but also threaten our civilized existence. \nThis situation imposes special responsibilities on all \nstakeholders in international relations, irrespective of \ntheir geographical location, their geopolitical influence \nor their socio-political systems. Equality, \nnon-confrontation, mutual respect and proper dialogue: \nthose are the keys to overcoming the obstacles to \neffective progress on development. \n Over recent years, we have often spoken of the \nneed to increase the effectiveness of the work of the \nGeneral Assembly and its influence on overall global \nprocesses. That can be achieved only if each State that \nseeks to make its own modest but positive contribution \nto addressing global problems can be sure that its \napproaches and proposals will be closely and \nimpartially studied in the General Assembly. \n In the eight years since the Millennium Summit, \nwe have seen that the Millennium Development Goals, \non which the fate of millions of individuals depends, \nwill continue to be mere words on paper if the more \ndeveloped States do not cease to view efforts to \nestablish the conditions conducive to development in \ncountries in the South and to provide those countries \nwith financial and economic support from the \nperspective of their own geopolitical interests. Let us \njust admit honestly that the global partnership for \ndevelopment that is mentioned so often in this \nAssembly still does not exist in practice. \n Unless we deal with the energy and food crises, \nwe will not achieve any progress. We must work in the \ninterests of all and not serve the wishes of a narrow \ngroup of influential countries. We also need to clearly \ndetermine how we will target our efforts and act in a \nsystematic way. \n The challenges we are facing are interrelated: \nclimate change and energy and food shortages, to a \nlarge extent, are due to existing patterns of energy use. \nHumankind has an increasing impact on the \natmosphere and the biosphere; environmental problems \ndue to the increasing impact of human activity lead to \nclimate change; climate change, in turn, leads to \nreduced agricultural harvests; and that, in turn, \nexacerbates the food crisis. \n Thus, we are faced with a single, \nmultidimensional global challenge, and the value of \nthis session will be magnified if at this international \nforum we hear new, justified and forward-thinking \nproposals for a coordinated response to the challenges \nfacing humankind. Such an approach should undergird \nthe work on a post-Kyoto agreement, and today it is \n \n \n31 08-53141 \n \nclear that talks on that accord must include a broader \nrange of issues than simply agreement on quantities \nand quotas for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. \n Belarus has stated on many occasions that future \napproaches to the problem of how to ensure economic \ngrowth while not harming the environment will be \nbased on international cooperation to spread \nthroughout the world energy-saving technology and \ntechnology for the use of alternative and renewable \nsources of energy. \n An intrinsic, fundamental and vital element of \nthat cooperation should be ensuring fair access by all \nStates to such technology by establishing, through the \nUnited Nations, a global mechanism to control the \nprocess. The first step in that direction has been \ndefined and can be adopted in the very near future: \ntheir Tehran ministerial meeting, on the initiative of \nBelarus the non-aligned States proposed holding at the \nsixty-third session of the General Assembly a thematic \ndebate on ensuring access for all States to energy-\nefficient technology and the use of alternative and \nrenewable sources of energy \u2014 naturally with due \nrespect for intellectual property rights. \n Particular attention must be paid to establishing a \nmultidimensional energy agenda at the United Nations, \nwhich should take into account the interests of \nproducer, transit and user countries. Responsible \nenergy cooperation can be a key factor in regional \nsecurity. Turkmenistan\u2019s proposal to discuss ways to \nensure reliable transit for fuel is also promising. \n In the context of establishing a fair system of \ninternational economic relations, particular attention \nmust be paid to a code of conduct for transnational \ncorporations in exploiting oil and gas fields and the \nmineral resources of developing countries. We need \nreliable protection against the practice of international \noil cartels of finding concessions that are profitable to \nthem, but that amount to slavery for the host country. \nSuch deals are often challenged, but the oil companies \nuse the media to justify their measures, citing threats to \nregional security. We look forward to the discussion of \nthat important initiative and those issues during this \nsession of the General Assembly. \n Indeed, attempts to get access to resources are the \nbasic cause of many current conflicts. Here, we are \ntalking not only about oil and other energy resources: \npeople are also dying because of local conflicts linked \nto the lack of drinking water. Given the fact that 97 per \ncent of global water resources are found in the oceans \nand seas, finding practical ways to desalinate seawater \nshould be a priority for scientific research in the \ncoming decades. \n The United Nations can play a role in defining \nthe future of such technology, and we believe that this \nshould belong to all mankind. To ensure that, we must \nput in place mechanisms to avoid the concentration of \nsuch technologies in the hands of a chosen few. One of \nthe main keys to successfully addressing global \nproblems facing mankind is speedily achieving \nagreements and understandings among the whole \ninternational community. Any delay in addressing \nclimate change is unacceptable, because it affects other \nissues on the international agenda. \n We believe that one of the main concerns on that \nagenda should be human development and the \nprevention of exploitation of nations and individuals. A \nUnited Nations action plan to fight human trafficking \nis an important stage in efforts to counter \ncontemporary forms of slavery. Within the United \nNations, work on that plan is under way: we have set \nup an inter-agency coordination group; resolutions \nhave been adopted by the General Assembly and by the \nEconomic and Social Council; and we have held \nthematic debates in the General Assembly. We call on \nall delegations to take an active and constructive role \nin that process, which will raise the issue of human \ntrafficking to a new level. An inadequate response to \nthe threat will promote the exploitation of entire \nnations and establish a new chain of human trafficking, \nand the number of new slaves will increase. Criminals \nwill begin to select the best from among their victims, \nand, as a result, there will be growth in colonialist \nthinking in the new framework of globalization, which \nwould render the problem particularly dangerous. We \ndo not have the right to allow such a situation to \ndevelop. \n From its very beginning, the United Nations was \nseen by its founding States as the most democratic of \ninternational institutions, a universal mechanism for \ninvolving all countries and peoples in establishing a \nnew and just world order. As a founding Member of the \nUnited Nations, Belarus supports the initiative of the \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \nsession, Mr. d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, to give particular \nattention to the democratization of the Organization. \nWe support that process within the United Nations, and \nwe support allowing all Member States equal \n  \n \n08-53141 32 \n \nopportunities and the same rules of the game. We \nfavour strict respect for all the principles set out in the \nUnited Nations Charter. \n The results-oriented proposal for democratization \nincludes enlarging the membership of the United \nNations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic \nRadiation. Over the 20 years since the accident at \nChernobyl, Belarus has acquired unique experience in \nstudying the effects of radiation on individuals and the \nenvironment, and we would like to have the \nopportunity to share that experience with other States \nwithin the framework of the Scientific Committee. We \ncall on all States to support the admission of Belarus as \na member of the Committee, which was established on \nthe recommendation of the First Committee, adopted as \nresolution 913 (X), entitled \u201cEffects of atomic radiation\u201d. \n We also support efforts to democratize the \nSecretariat. The management of each Secretariat \ndepartment should respect the principle of equitable \ngeographic representation. The top five jobs in each \ndepartment should be distributed among the five \nregional groups. Establishing that principle will be an \nimportant step forward in creating confidence among \nMember States. \n We hope that we are moving towards several \nimportant international events. In Doha, there will be \nan international conference on financing for \ndevelopment. Work is continuing on a post-Kyoto \naccord, and discussions on the reform of the Security \nCouncil are entering a new phase. Their success \ndepends on us all. Will we be able to have a \nconstructive dialogue and a non-confrontational \napproach and reach a deeper understanding of the real \ninterests of all peoples throughout the world than we \nhave today? Most answers to those key issues of the \ncontemporary world are to be found in our own history. \nAll we need to do is look back at our own history and \ndraw the right lessons from the past in a timely way.

        "file_text": "I join with those who have \nspoken before me in congratulating General Assembly \nPresident d\u2019Escoto-Brockmann on his election to guide \nthe work of the Assembly at its sixty-third session.  \n As we meet this week, the global financial system \nis confronting its sternest test in recent memory. The \ncurrent crisis is systemic in nature, historic in scale and \nglobal in reach. It comes at a time when the world \neconomy is still wrestling with the most rapid \nescalation, and the highest real levels ever recorded, in \nthe prices for fuel and food commodities. Together \nwith the world\u2019s belated attention to the devastating \neconomic and social implications of climate change, \nthose developments define the agenda before global \ninstitutions and national leaders today. They make the \ntheme for this year\u2019s debate both timely and necessary. \n Given the gravity and urgency of the issues \nbefore us, we must be careful not to conduct this year\u2019s \ndebate in the customary rhetorical manner. Instead, we \nmust resolve to translate the detailed analysis, lofty \nstatements and good intentions for which the Assembly \nhas become well known into concrete actions that the \ncurrent circumstances demand of us, and on which \nhistory will judge us. \n We must each, as countries approaching the \npodium to speak, be prepared to account for the \npledges we have previously made. We must also be \nbold enough to embark on a project to achieve real \nchange in the multilateral system. That change must be \nbased on mandates that are relevant, institutions that \nare accountable and a context that is increasingly \nreflective of integration and interconnectedness. \n Indeed, I would urge that the theme of the next \nGeneral Assembly should emphasize accountability \nand coherence of action on the part of the developed \nworld in matters related to aid, trade and development. \nOften, when taken together, the policies of those \ncountries result in a significant net loss of welfare in \nthe developing world and run counter to their declared \nintentions \u2014 for example, the achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. \n \n \n23 08-51606 \n \n An episode that manifested itself merely two \nyears ago as a moderate decline in the housing market \nin some parts of the United States, and that evolved \ninto difficulties for that country\u2019s sub-prime mortgage \nmarket, has now grown into a rapidly deepening \nsystemic financial crisis of global proportions. Even if \nthey are not fully integrated into the global financial \nsystem, small vulnerable economies such as Guyana \nwill bear the full effect of those developments as \ndemand for exports tightens, the cost of capital rises, \nforeign direct investment becomes scarce and tourist \narrivals and migrant remittances decline. In short, \neconomic growth and poverty reduction efforts will \nsuffer a severe setback and the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals will become even more elusive. \n At the same time, crude oil prices rose by 148 per \ncent during the 18 months preceding July of this year. \nIn turn, that has contributed to increasing prices for \nfood commodities \u2014 in particular for such staples as \ncereals \u2014 rising in some cases by more than 200 per \ncent during the same period. While there have been \nsome signs in recent weeks of those increases tapering \noff, and in some cases reversing marginally, the \noutlook clearly suggests that high prices for energy and \nfood are here to stay. \n Without a doubt, increased food prices provide an \nimportant opportunity and incentive to farmers and \nagricultural economies to increase production. \nHowever, they also present grave implications for \naccess to food, in particular by the poor and, by \nextension, for key nutrition and health indicators \namong our populations.  \n The 2007 World Development Report shows that \ngrowth generated by agriculture can be up to four times \nmore effective in reducing poverty than growth in other \nsectors. Yet the share of agriculture in official \ndevelopment assistance fell from 17 per cent in 1980 to \njust 2.9 per cent in 2006. Agriculture must therefore be \ngiven high priority in the international agenda as well \nas in national budgets. \n It is also urgently necessary for large developed \ncountries to re-examine ways in which current \ninefficient and distortionary trade policies, in particular \nsubsidies that support inefficient domestic production \nand tariffs that protect against more competitive \nimports, can be restructured to reduce distortions in the \nglobal marketplace. \n Given the impact that persistently high food \nprices into the future will have on the poor, the global \ncommunity must commit itself to designing and \nfunding appropriate safety nets to ensure improved \naccess to food and the maintenance of basic nutrition. \n In recent times, the Assembly has been deeply \nconcerned about the consequences of climate change, \nand rightly so. But future generations demand that that \nconcern be translated into rapid action. The climate \nchange challenge will not slow down to meet the pace \nset by the United Nations. Our response must speed up \nto meet the pace of climate change. \n The facts are straightforward. If we are to avoid \ncatastrophic climate breakdown, we need to stabilize \nannual greenhouse gas emissions at about the \nequivalent of 2 tonnes of carbon dioxide per capita by \n2050. Therefore, let the debate move on to how we \nmake that happen, and not stagnate on a paralysing fear \nborn from the magnitude of the problem. \n There are some promising signs. The Kyoto \nProtocol has resulted in the emergence of a $60 billion \ncarbon market, which is a welcome start. But although \ncommon sense dictates that those financial flows \nshould be proportional to the problem being addressed, \nthe bulk of that money stays within the developed \nworld. \n As a rainforest country, Guyana is particularly \naware that there is virtually no capital flowing to \naddress tropical deforestation \u2014 despite the fact that it \ncauses 20 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions and, as \nanalyses done by the Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change, Nicholas Stern and others have \nhighlighted, doing so is the most cost-effective \nabatement solution. That is because the Kyoto Protocol \ncontains no significant incentives to slow the rate of \ntropical deforestation. \n As leaders, we must set a clear direction for our \nnegotiators as we send them to agree a post-Kyoto \nclimate agreement, one that asserts a sense of \nproportionality in addressing the causes of climate \nchange and ensures that all major mitigation options \nare pursued. We must also break the false debate that \nsuggests that countries must choose between \ncombating climate change and supporting national \ndevelopment. Instead, we need to forge new high-\ngrowth, low-carbon economies and make national \ndevelopment supportive of progress towards global \nemissions targets. \n  \n \n08-51606 24 \n \n Specifically, those of us who are leaders of \nrainforest countries need to understand that we provide \nservices that are vital to the health of our planet and \nthat, when we seek capital flows to compensate for \nthat, we are not merely acting as passive poor countries \nlooking for aid: we are providing a critical component \nof the climate solution and we should be leading the \ndesign of mechanisms as we forge a post-Kyoto \nclimate agreement. \n In Guyana, despite the fact that 85 per cent of our \npeople live below sea level and are already suffering \nfrom changing weather patterns and rising water levels, \nwe do not want to just complain about climate change. \nInstead, we want to partner with others to create a \nsolution. As part of that, we are ready to discuss \nplacing almost our entire rainforest in the service of the \nworld if the right economic incentives are created and \nif that can be done in a way that neither trades \nsovereignty over our forest nor restricts the legitimate \ndevelopment aspirations of our people. \n The African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) \ncountries are currently negotiating an economic \npartnership agreement with the European Union (EU). \nThat agreement may fundamentally affect development \nin our societies and jeopardize our future negotiating \npositions at the World Trade Organization (WTO). The \nEuropean Commission has threatened to impose tariffs \non our exports under the Generalized System of \nPreferences if we do not sign agreements that reflect \nthe EU\u2019s model of WTO compatibility, even though the \nmodel includes issues that have been removed from the \nWTO agenda \u2014 the so-called Singapore issues. Those \nagreements will also seriously prejudice our \nnegotiations with other countries and may jeopardize \nthe future of our integration movement. \n The exploitation of the EU\u2019s superior negotiating \nstrength and the use of threats to get countries to sign \nare, ironically, how the EU hopes to start this \npartnership under the economic partnership agreement. \nWhat is particularly irksome is that we are incessantly \nlectured by the same group of countries to the effect \nthat national consultations and working with civil \nsociety are essential hallmarks of good governance. Yet \nwhen the same civil society opposes the economic \npartnership agreement on the grounds that it is not \nsufficiently developmental in nature, we are told to \nignore them \u2014 they are complainers. I wonder if the \nleaders of those countries know, or care, what is being \ndone in their names. Even at this late hour, I wish to \nplead with the EU leaders to review those agreements \nbefore they irretrievably harm the good historic \nrelations that have existed between the ACP and the \nEU. \n That brings me to the matter of the much-needed \nreform of our multilateral institutions, which has been \non the agenda for some time. However, it would be fair \nto say that it has progressed slowly and its results have \nbeen few and difficult to observe. I believe that the \nreforms must be pursued along certain predefined \nprinciples. First, the institutions must have new \nmandates that are relevant to the current circumstances, \nand they must have at their disposal tools to discharge \nthose mandates effectively. Secondly, the institutions \nmust have legitimacy and reflect an equitable \nrepresentation of their membership. Thirdly, in the \ndischarge of their functions, they must demonstrate \nflexibility and responsiveness. Fourthly, they must \ndisplay the highest standards of accountability and \ntransparency.  \n As I mentioned earlier, I believe that limitations \nin the mandate and functioning of the international \nfinancial institutions were a contributory factor in the \ncurrent financial crisis. The mandate of the \nInternational Monetary Fund should explicitly be the \npreservation of systemic financial stability as a global \npublic good. In addition, the use of passive \nsurveillance as a general instrument and conditionality-\nbased lending among the more vulnerable members \nhave clearly proved to be ineffective. That is so not \nleast because the incentives associated with \nconditionality-based lending are almost invariably \nnever applicable to countries of systemic importance, \nand no mechanisms exist to encourage larger countries \nto respond to policy advice. \n Likewise, the World Bank should have a revised \nmandate that focuses on certain key development \nchallenges, such as protection of the environment, \nclean energy and certain aspects of poverty reduction, \ninstead of trying to address every development \nchallenge and undermining its own effectiveness. In \naddition, more needs to be done to democratize the \ninstitutions, to align the interests of the management \nand staff with those of the countries they serve and to \nmake them more accountable to the membership. \n Similarly, a more democratic and reformed \nUnited Nations Organization will be better placed to \nplay a central role in the multilateral system in serving \n \n \n25 08-51606 \n \nthe interests of the international community as a whole, \nwhether in relation to its peace and security mandates, \nthe protection of fundamental rights or the promotion \nof development. \n Within the Commonwealth, heads of Government \nhave developed a set of principles and guidelines that \nshould underpin reform of the international \ninstitutions. Among their recommendations is a call for \na conference along the lines of Bretton Woods to lead \nthe way in determining the future of the international \nfinancial institutions. I trust that those principles and \nguidelines will be fully embraced. \n I wish this sixty-third session of the Assembly \nevery success."

        "file_text": "We are gathered here once \nagain to reflect on major national, regional and global \nchallenges \u2014 and on how together, as the United \nNations, we can renew our commitment to finding \nsolutions. It gives me great pleasure to share with the \nGeneral Assembly some insights on how some of those \nglobal developments affect Rwanda, as well as our \nregion, as we continue to strengthen our social, \neconomic and democratic institutions for improving the \nlives of our citizens.  \n In the context of fighting poverty and achieving \nthe Millennium Development Goals, our second-\ngeneration poverty-reduction strategy is gathering \nmomentum in Africa, East Africa and Rwanda, and is \nbeing implemented in the context of greater stability \nand peace. In Rwanda we are registering a healthy \neconomic growth rate, which is currently averaging \n7 per cent annually, in an increasingly open and \nconducive environment that encourages domestic and \nforeign investors. We also continue to deepen our \nregional integration in the East African community. \nThat is essential for a bigger and more dynamic \nmarket, which should become a far more effective and \nefficient gateway to global business. \n With regard to empowering women and \npromoting their socio-economic and political \nparticipation, we continue to make significant progress. \nIn the just-concluded Rwandan parliamentary elections \nfor the lower chamber, women candidates performed \nexceptionally well, increasing their presence in the new \nParliament from 49 to 55 seats. We believe that, \nbesides improving gender status in our country, that \nmarks healthy progress towards realizing a vision of a \nunited, democratic and prosperous Rwanda. \n  \n \n08-51606 6 \n \n Allow me to raise another issue that may have \nwider implications, namely, that of justice and, more \nspecifically, of universal jurisdiction and its abuse. It is \nimportant that those who consider themselves powerful \nnations do not misuse that tool of international justice \nto extend their laws and jurisdiction over those they \nperceive to be weaker countries. If unchecked, one can \nonly imagine the legal chaos that would ensue should \nany judge in any country decide to apply local laws to \nother sovereign States. The United Nations has a duty \nto ensure that universal jurisdiction serves its original \ngoals of delivering international justice and fairness, as \nopposed to abuse. \n There is no doubt that climate change is among \nthe critical challenges of our time. Africa is being \ngravely affected. Deserts and dry zones continue to \nclaim more territory. Over-reliance on wood for energy \nby our populations is leading to severe deforestation. \nFurthermore, unpredictable weather and rainfall \npatterns, combined with limited scientific and \ntechnological capacities, are already undermining our \ncontinent\u2019s ability to effectively manage water \nresources.  \n We take those challenges very seriously in \nRwanda. Earlier this month, in Kigali, the Africa \nClimate Change Forum brought together policymakers, \nbusiness leaders and academic and scientific \ncommunities from different parts of the world. They \nreaffirmed that the world community urgently needs to \nthink globally, but also to act locally, in translating \nresolutions into actions. Towards that end, we are \ndetermined to intensify efforts in the areas of \nreforestation, terracing and irrigation for more \neffective use of water and land resources, as well as to \nprevent soil erosion. It is indispensable that we partner \ntogether as a global community to urgently act to \nprotect our planet in the context of the Convention on \nClimate Change and the Kyoto Protocol. \n Rwanda is committed to regional and global \npeace and stability. Let us not forget that the process of \ncomprehensively resolving the issue of those who \ncommitted genocide in Rwanda has yet to be \ncompleted. We stand ready to play our part in \naddressing that matter in the context of broader \nobjectives to consolidate stability and peace on our \ncontinent. Once again, I assure the Assembly of our \ndetermination and commitment to creating a safer and \nbetter world. "

I extend my \nheartfelt appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Srgjan \nKerim, former President of the General Assembly, for \nhis devoted efforts during his tenure. I wish also to \nexpress my profound respect for the tireless leadership \ndemonstrated by His Excellency Secretary-General \nBan Ki-moon in the management of the United \nNations. \n Being back in New York, I am reminded of an old \nsaying about bankers. It seems that there are only two \ntypes of bankers in the world: bankers with short \nmemories and bankers with no memories. In finance, \nmarket crazes and panics cling together in much the \nsame way that shadows follow objects. Crazes \ninvariably develop over time, which then give rise to \npanic. It was 10 years ago, in September indeed, that \nthe world experienced a nightmare in which liquidity \nsuddenly dried up. For more than the last quarter \ncentury, it seems almost as if crazes and panics have \nperformed a never-ending musical rondo every few \nyears, with a large number of countries and markets, \nnaturally including Tokyo, as their stage. \n Tokyo stayed relatively clear-headed during the \nmost recent frenzy. However, that said, it could be \nargued that that was due to little more than the \nunusually long time we had suffered when our \nhangover morphed into a debt overhang as a result of \nthe previous craze of the 1980s and 1990s. \n That rondo continues without end, and so \ncertainly humankind will once again hear that very \nsame melody in the not-too-distant future. We simply \nmust advance inch by inch each time and resolve to \nbecome more prudent. Vociferous arguments on the \ninternational financial architecture are about to begin \nonce again. Japan is eager to contribute its experience \nand its knowledge. \n In Japan, May is the month for enjoying new \ngreen growth, and 7 July is the day on which both \nchildren and adults tie strips of paper bearing \nhandwritten wishes to bamboo branches hung from the \neaves and look to the night sky as they pray for their \ndreams to come true. \n This year in May, Japan held the Fourth Tokyo \nInternational Conference on African Development, also \nknown as TICAD IV, bringing together some 3,000 \nparticipants in the port city of Yokohama. \nRepresentatives of 51 nations from Africa gathered, \nincluding 41 at the Head of State and Government \nlevel. Enthusiastically advocating action \u201cTowards a \nVibrant Africa\u201d, that Conference called for support to \naccelerate economic growth, to pursue the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals in a sustainable manner and to \nfoster health, water, sanitation and education in Africa \non the basis of human security, a concept that Japan \nhas carefully nurtured. Three thousand people renewed \ntheir determination to achieve those goals. The \nvibrancy of Japan\u2019s fresh green leaves certainly \ntouched the heart of each participant. \n Then, on 7 July, the day on which we pray for the \nrealization of our dreams for the future, the \nGovernment of Japan moved the stage to Lake Toyako \non our northern island of Hokkaido, opening the G-8 \nSummit and a series of outreach meetings. Again, \nJapan placed issues regarding development among the \nmain themes, and we invited a large number of African \nparticipants. That was to ensure that the momentum \ngenerated by TICAD IV would be firmly maintained. \n By making climate change the theme of another \nsummit, we were able to agree to strive to adopt a \nglobal long-term target of reducing emissions and to \nseek to create, within the United Nations, an effective \nframework, in which all major economies would \nparticipate in a responsible way. That outcome of the \nToyako summit should be regarded as no small matter. \nWe aim to realize those goals by no later than the end \nof 2009. \n I believe that we all associate efforts to address \nclimate change with the name of Japan\u2019s ancient \ncapital for 1,000 years, Kyoto. Japan has always felt \nsome pride on that score. Japan leads the globe in \nrequiring the least amount of energy to produce one \nunit of gross domestic product. Our technological \ncreativity has helped to make that possible. We are \neager for the world to make much greater use of it. The \n \n \n27 08-51851 \n \nsectoral approach also offers a channel through which \nJapan aims to contribute to many other countries. \n Such was the G-8 achievement just over two \nmonths ago with Japan in the Chair. We are now \nwitnessing irregularities in the global economy. It is \nmy wish, and indeed, my belief, that the pledges of \nMay and the dreams of July will be impervious to the \nstrong and fast winds that now buffet them. There is an \nimportant precondition for both making a vibrant \nAfrica even more vibrant and ending global \nenvironmental degradation through the efforts of all \nnations, namely, the stability of the global economy. \n That being the case, the task ahead for Japan, as I \nsee it, is already quite clear: it must first invigorate its \nown economy. In view of the size of the Japanese \neconomy, the second largest in the world, that would \ncertainly be the most immediately effective \ncontribution that Japan can make. I will work \ndeterminedly to that end. Such is my pledge to the \nPresident and members of this Assembly. \n I should now like to change topic and recount a \nsmall event that took place this past summer. It \nhappened in a small town on the outskirts of Tokyo. \nNine high-school students from abroad arrived there at \nthe end of August, setting foot in Japan for their first \ntime. There was nothing unusual about those very \ntypical-looking high-school student visitors, grimacing \nat the unfamiliar food placed before them. However, \nthere was one aspect in which those young men and \nwomen stood apart from participants in conventional \ninvitation programmes. Those high-school students, \nfour Palestinians and five Israelis, had all lost at least \none relative as a result of terrorism or another aspect of \nthe severe situation in the Middle East. \n I have just described one of the ongoing efforts \nby Japanese civil society to promote reconciliation. \nThose high-school students may have no chance to \ninteract with each other when they are back home, but \nfor the several days that they are in a distant country, \ntravelling here and there across the beautiful, verdant \nland of Japan in pairs comprising Israelis and \nPalestinians, something changes inside them. Those \nyoung people come to understand that religion and \nethnicity make no difference when it comes to the \nsorrow felt at losing a parent, and they often shed tears \nupon coming to that realization. Through those tears of \nunderstanding they will come to see ties between their \nfutures. \n For comprehensive peace in the Middle East, \nwhat is necessary is the mental groundwork that will \nmake such peace possible. By investing in the young \nminds of high-school students, Japanese civil society is \nworking to foster that groundwork. \n As that example suggests, there is no doubt in my \nmind that there are certain types of diplomacy that \nJapan is uniquely able to undertake. If Israeli drip \nirrigation technology were to be introduced in the West \nBank of the Jordan River, Palestinian youth would be \nable to devote themselves to the production of \nvegetables. However, the wall of distrust that separates \nthe two sides will not allow that in the immediate \nfuture. Here, Japan wishes to act as a catalyst, serving \nas a mediator between the two sides.  \n Japan is willing to bring its own technologies that \nmaximize the potential of drip irrigation. In time, as a \nresult of irrigation, the land of the West Bank will \nbecome fertile. The agricultural products grown there \nwill be processed by Palestinians and transported \nthrough Jordan to be laid out fresh in stores in \nconsumer regions around the Gulf. The Government of \nJapan aims to bring about such a future through its \nCorridor for Peace and Prosperity initiative. Here, \nJapan continues to provide its technologies and \nfunding, but most of all, it aims to be a mediator, \nfostering trust. Needless to say, trust is the scarcest \nresource of all in the Middle East. \n The Government of Japan is currently preparing \nto submit a draft resolution on the total elimination of \nnuclear weapons. I believe that there is no one who \nquestions the wholehearted commitment of the \nJapanese people to that issue. In the same way, I \nbelieve it would be superfluous to elaborate on the fact \nthat Japan values the activities of the International \nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Japan has fielded \nMr. Yukiya Amano, Ambassador to the International \nOrganizations in Vienna and former Chairman of the \nBoard of Governors of IAEA, as a candidate to be the \nnext Director-General of IAEA. I strongly urge \nmembers to support his candidacy. \n Just a moment ago, I touched briefly on the \nsignificance of 7 July for Japan. The Heads of State \nand Government and their spouses who gathered in \nToyako for the G8 Summit wrote their wishes on \nbamboo leaves. While the words they chose varied, \nthere was not a single person who did not include a \nwish for peace. Yet in the short space of time since \n  \n \n08-51851 28 \n \nthen, there have been incidents at various locations \ndisturbing the peace, one after another. \n First, regarding the situation in Georgia, I \nstrongly expect to see a peaceful resolution of the \nissues, based on the principle of territorial integrity; \nwith the parties involved, including Russia, acting in a \nresponsible manner. And speaking of 7 July, that date \nconjures up abhorrent memories in the United \nKingdom. We, here in this Assembly, have been newly \nincensed at the cruel terrorist attack that took place in \nIslamabad five days ago. It has also turned out to be \ndifficult to find the path towards improving the \nsituation in Afghanistan. There has been no change \nwhatsoever in the fact that terrorism constitutes the \ngreatest threat to peace and prosperity in the world. \n I believe that the international community must \ncontinue to be engaged in tenacious efforts to combat \nterrorism. Japan has, from the start, been committed to \nreconstruction assistance to Afghanistan and we have \nmaintained our refuelling activities in the Indian \nOcean. I would like to state here that Japan will \ncontinue in the future to stand side by side with the \ninternational community and participate proactively in \nthe fight against terrorism. \n Among outstanding issues in the vicinity of \nJapan, it goes without saying that the most pressing are \nthose concerning North Korea. North Korea has \nabducted Japanese citizens, including an innocent \nyoung girl named Megumi. Despite pledging to \nrelaunch an investigation into the abduction victims, it \nhas still not taken action towards fulfilling that pledge. \n Regarding its commitment to abandon its nuclear \nprogrammes, it is widely known that recently there has \nbeen a conspicuous lack of progress. In parallel with \nthe action that North Korea would take, I am prepared \nto take action towards the resolution of the outstanding \nissues of concern between Japan and North Korea and \nthe settlement of the unfortunate past tensions between \nus, moving Japan-North Korea relations forward. What \nwe are waiting for is action by North Korea. I will also \ncontinue to pursue the abandonment of North Korea\u2019s \nnuclear capabilities and its nuclear weapons within the \nframework of the Six-Party Talks. \n That leads me to say that China and the Republic \nof Korea are each important partners for Japan and \ncountries with which Japan must seek to increase \nmutual benefits and shared interests. Japan must \npromote multilayered cooperation with both of those \ncountries as well as with the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations. Together, we must enhance the peace \nand prosperity of the East Asian region and beyond \u2014 \ntowards world peace and prosperity. \n As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, I \nhave only recently become Japan\u2019s Prime Minister. I \nwas designated Prime Minister by the Diet and \nappointed by His Majesty the Emperor of Japan barely \n24 hours ago, and this is my first engagement since \nassuming office. I hope that through my remarks thus \nfar you can appreciate why I have taken such pains to \njoin you here today. There are numerous points I \nwanted to raise. \n Looking back, Japan has come a long way, with \nthe Japan-United States alliance as a permanent \ncornerstone, while steadfastly enhancing relationships \nwith neighbouring Asian nations. And I believe that the \nPresident of this Assembly and all the other dignitaries \ngathered in this Hall will, without exception, \nacknowledge that Japan attaches great importance to \nthe United Nations and has never once veered from the \npath of international cooperation.  \n Even though they have suffered setbacks at times, \nthe citizens of Japan, who have so vigorously pursued \nthe building of the economy, have been guided by a \nsingle philosophy until the present day, that peace and \nhappiness are most certainly within our grasp through \nthe pursuit of economic prosperity and democracy. I \nam determined to work in solidarity with countries \nholding fundamental values in common and to share \nJapan\u2019s experiences with nations strongly needing such \nsupport. It is my unwavering view that this is a \nresponsibility incumbent on Japan. \n It is for these reasons that, speaking on behalf of \nthe people of Japan, I must state and reiterate the \nabsolute necessity of United Nations Security Council \nreform. We must bring about the early reform of the \nSecurity Council through an expansion of both the \npermanent and non-permanent memberships. Next \nmonth, new non-permanent members of the Council \nwill be elected, and Japan is standing as a candidate.  \n Let me conclude my remarks today by expressing \nmy sincere wish for the support of Member States for \nJapan\u2019s candidacy.

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to congratulate Mr. Miguel \nd\u2019Escoto Brockmann on his election to the presidency \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-third session and \nwish him every success in his work. \n In the context of the agenda of the current session \nof the General Assembly, I would like to address the \nfollowing issues, which we consider to be of the \nutmost importance and are directly relevant to the \nsecurity and sustainable development of the Central \nAsian region. \n First are the issues related to the continuing \nintensification and escalation of confrontation in \nAfghanistan, the increasing radicalization of the \nsituation and the provocative terrorist statements by the \nfighters. Despite the enormous efforts and measures by \nthe international community and coalition forces to \nsupport peace in Afghanistan, the situation, \nunfortunately, is deteriorating. The civilians are \nperishing. \n What further exacerbates the situation in \nAfghanistan is the growing volume of drug trafficking. \nToday the production of opium in Afghanistan accounts \nfor more than 8,000 tons, or over 90 percent of global \nproduction. It must be taken into consideration that \ndrug trafficking is becoming one of the important \nsources of financing for fighters, destabilizing the \nsituation in Afghanistan itself and in neighbouring \nStates. \n From this high rostrum, I would like to state \nagain that we are deeply convinced that recent \ndevelopments in the situation in Afghanistan show ever \n  \n \n08-53129 20 \n \nmore clearly that the Afghan problem cannot be \nresolved by the use of armed force, military means and \nincreasing militarization alone. The war, which has \nbeen ongoing for close to 30 years, has destroyed both \nthe economic and social infrastructure, led to the \nimpoverishment of the population and, we must admit, \nhas deprived people of any belief in a future and has \nprovided fertile ground for recruiting more and more \nfighters. \n The developing situation dictates the need to \nradically reconsider the approaches to resolving the \nAfghan problem. It is our firm belief that our main \npriorities must be providing targeted economic aid to \nAfghanistan, building and moulding economic and \nsocial infrastructure, ensuring employment \nopportunities and resolving the acute problem of \ncombating poverty. \n It is necessary to do everything we can to ensure \nrespectful attitudes to national and religious values and \nthe centuries-old traditions and customs of the \nmultinational and multi-faith people of Afghanistan, \nand on that basis to bring together the conflicting \nforces. An important instrument for achieving such \ngoals could be a return to the successful Six plus Two \ngroup on Afghanistan that successfully functioned in \nthe middle of the 1990s under the auspices of the \nUnited Nations and transforming it into a Six plus \nThree group by taking into consideration contemporary \nrealities and including in its make-up neighbouring \nStates, Russia and the United States, and NATO. \n As the President of Uzbekistan, Mr. Islam \nKarimov, has repeatedly underscored, the realization of \nsuch an initiative \u2014 which has already been called for \nfrom a number of international rostrums \u2014 could be a \nworthy alternative in achieving peace, stability and the \nrevival of Afghanistan. \n The outcomes of the high-level event on the \nMillennium Development Goals that took place on \n25 September 2008 demonstrated that the international \ncommunity needs to resolutely seek concrete results in \nachieving the goals in the sphere of development as \nformulated in the Millennium Declaration. \n In that context, all of us share responsibility for \nthe reasonable use of natural resources, including the \ntransboundary rivers in Central Asia. Experience itself \nhas shown that disregarding well-known United \nNations declarations and international standards on the \njoint use of water resources of transboundary rivers can \nlead to very serious and at times tragic ecological \ndisasters, as borne out by the ongoing catastrophe of \nthe drying up of the Aral Sea, with all of its unforeseen \nconsequences for the tens of millions of people in the \nregion. \n According to the fundamental provisions of \nUnited Nations conventions, all decisions on the use of \nthe water of transboundary rivers in Central Asia, \nincluding the construction of hydropower facilities, \nmust in no way inflict damage on the ecology of the \nregion or infringe on the interests of the populations of \nneighbouring countries, nor should they upset the \nestablished balanced use of the water of transboundary \nrivers by all States in those rivers basins. In the case of \ndamage, all measures must be taken to remove or \nmitigate such damage, and, if necessary, the issue of \ncompensation must be raised. \n We are convinced that compliance with those \nrequirements must be mandatory in the implementation \nof various projects such as building hydropower \nfacilities in Central Asia, including compliance by \ninternational financial institutions that wish to \nparticipate in such projects. \n We are also convinced of the importance of \nexpanding cooperation and strengthening interaction \nbetween the United Nations and the International Fund \nto Save the Aral Sea. In this respect, we consider it \ntimely and necessary to grant the Fund observer status \nin the General Assembly, and we call upon Member \nStates to support the draft resolution on this matter \nduring the Assembly\u2019s sixty-third session. \n This year in Uzbekistan we will widely observe \nthe sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights, and a programme of action dedicated to \nthat most significant event has been approved. As of \n1 January 2008, Uzbekistan fully abolished the death \npenalty and introduced habeas corpus, a democratic \nprinciple of justice. The adoption of the law on \nguaranteeing the rights of the child and the ratification \nof the International Labour Organization Minimum \nAge Convention and Convention on the Worst Forms \nof Child Labour have become important steps in \nensuring human rights in Uzbekistan. We have adopted \na national plan for implementing the commitments \nundertaken in those Conventions. Aware of the urgency \nof the problem of human trafficking at both domestic \nand international levels, in April 2008 Uzbekistan \nadopted its law against human trafficking.  \n \n \n21 08-53129 \n \n Committed to the ideals and principles of human \nrights, Uzbekistan advocates gradual reforms and \nchanges with the main purpose of ensuring peace in \nsociety and greater well-being of the people. \n In conclusion, I want to underscore once again \nthat Uzbekistan stands ready to engage in further \nconstructive multilateral interaction within the United \nNations framework to address the urgent issues on the \nagenda of the international community.

        "file_text": "For Venezuelans, Latin \nAmericans and Caribbeans, it is an honour, Sir, to have \nyou as President of the General Assembly at this \nsession. No one is a more authentic Christian than a \nprogressive Christian. It is a risky position and one \nwhich requires sacrifice for a person like yourself, \nwhose life has been a testament to his lofty values. \nIndeed, this criterion is valid for Muslims, Jews, \nBuddhists, animists, Hindus, atheists, and so on if their \nlives are a testament to their respective ethical \nobligations. \n There is another religion whose adherents and \npriests preach from their temples. It is the religion of \nneoliberalism, whose god is the market. \n A few years ago, a well-known academic, \ncaptivated by his own materialistic image, announced \nthe end of history, claiming that we had reached not the \nfountain of eternal youth but the secret to eternal \nprosperity. Today, prompted by the sixtieth anniversary \nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we \nqualify that thought as a curse that reflects the \ninsensitivity of the most egotistical and corrupt. \n At the time of the French Revolution someone \nsaid \u201cFreedom, how many crimes are committed in \nyour name?\u201d These days we could say \u201cFree market, \n  \n \n08-53141 22 \n \nhow much poverty, how much violence, how much \ntorture, how many wars, how many invasions, how \nmuch oppression, how much social injustice is \ncommitted in your name?\u201d We are, therefore, \nsympathetic with President Nicolas Sarkozy\u2019s peace \ninitiatives and his appropriate ideas about a regulated \ncapitalism and a summit of countries affected by the \nfinancial crisis. \n Accustomed as we were to suffering the perverse \neffects of the brutal application of neoliberal policies, \ntoday we see the pain, anguish and anger of millions of \nour brothers in the United States. They have been \nswindled by upper-class criminals, an experience that \nwe Venezuelans know well. \n Since memory is fragile and the neoliberal global \ndictatorship uses private communications media to hide \nits crimes, allow me to recount a terrible event that \noccurred in the country that was the first lab rat for the \nmost radical formula from Wall Street and the \nInternational Monetary Fund. I am speaking of my \ncountry, Venezuela. \n In only two days, in February 1989, a \nspontaneous people\u2019s rebellion was mercilessly \ncrushed. It was a protest against the application, \nwithout anaesthesia, of the magic formulas that the \ngreat financial centres imposed on us. Several \nnon-governmental human rights organizations at the \ntime registered thousands of deaths, but the official \nstatistics recognized only 259 dead, without \nmentioning those who were injured or material \ndamage \u2014 only 259 dead in two days. \n As a diplomat in those terrible days, I assumed \nthat there would be complaints and condemnations \nfrom friendly Governments with good human-rights \ntrack records. Nothing of the sort happened. Venezuela \nwas the pet project of Latin American democracies \nand, at the same time, a neoliberal laboratory whose \nfailure had to be kept secret. The media accomplices of \nyesterday that kept these crimes secret are the same \nthat today slander the democratic, peaceful, socialist \nrevolutionary Venezuelan process led by President \nHugo Ch\u00e1vez. \n In Venezuela we practice extreme democracy: \nextreme freedom of expression, extreme participation, \nextreme challenge to the neoliberal monster and \nextreme commitment to social justice, hence the \ninternational media campaign to attempt to slander and \nstifle democracy in Venezuela. The instruments of that \ncampaign have a name: the Fox network in the United \nStates, the Grupo de Diarios de Am\u00e9rica, the Inter \nAmerican Press Association, the neocolonialist group \nPromotora de Informaciones, S.A., the El Pais daily, \nthe Cadena de Ondas Populares de Espa\u00f1a (COPE) \nradio network of the blessed Catholic Bishops\u2019 \nConference of Spain, the El Mercurio daily in Chile, \nthe El Universal daily in Mexico, the pro-coup \nVenezuelan television station Globovision, and many \nother lackeys of the international far right. \n That brings to mind a topic that no one talks \nabout. Some people think that Nelson Mandela did \naway with apartheid. In the United States, the people \nwe see on the television screens are like the people we \nsee in the streets. Not so in Latin America, in \nVenezuela and in multi-ethnic Latin American \ncountries. On their televisions we do not see people of \nmixed races, nor indigenous people, nor Afro-Latin \nAmericans unless they are playing the role of the \nservants. Hence the racist hatred against the indigenous \nmajority in Bolivia. Racism is the most perverse form \nof discrimination. In the worst dictatorships and under \npersecution, it is possible to hide one\u2019s thoughts, faith \nand political affiliation. But what one can never hide is \nthe colour of one\u2019s skin. \n Democracy, international social justice and peace \ncannot survive under the schemes of unilateralism and \nthe muscular exercises of hegemonic powers. Dissent \nshould not be punished but rather recognized as an \nexpression of democratic and pacifist values. \nAppreciation of and respect for those who are different \nis a guarantee of the fulfilment of the principles \nenshrined in the United Nations Charter. Democracy \nand peace should stem from creativity and the \nconfidence generated by the variety of ideas, colours, \ninterests and proposals. \n Progressive democracy has burgeoned in Latin \nAmerica and the Caribbean, particularly within the past \n10 years, just as the continent has been undergoing \nprofound social change. Long ago, during the sixties \nand seventies, the magic solution to attain the complete \ndemocracy and social progress that some preached was \nthrough free and transparent elections, although in \ncertain select circumstances the elections were neither \nvery democratic nor very transparent. Nevertheless, \nthey were welcomed into the so-called democratic \nclub, since they adhered to unspoken patterns of \npolitical behaviour dictated by the global metropolis. \n \n \n23 08-53141 \n \n It is a fact that today in Latin America elections \nare more participatory, more transparent and freer than \never. Nevertheless, the results are not welcomed when \nthe winners have previously been labelled as villains \nby the imperial super-Power. \n The spectre of progressive democracy is lying in \nwait for the continent of social injustice. People are \ndeciding their own destiny, as they should. But they are \nmaking this choice with a clear preference for leftist \nmovements that offer a response to their circumstances. \nThat does not suit the far right, which is no lover of \ndemocracy, as much as it claims to be. \n That reminds me to some extent of Henry Ford, \nwhen he spoke of his great success in selling the \nModel T. He said \u201cAny customer can have a car \npainted any colour that he wants so long as it is black\u201d. \nSomething similar is happening with the super-Power \nand its partners on our continent. Anyone who wins \nfree and transparent elections monitored by credible \ninternational observers is accepted, provided that \nperson is right-wing. \n Dissent is not accepted by some people in the \nglobal village. The new movements, which are \nsupported by the majority of those who are excluded, \nare not welcome. The magnates of private media are \nthemselves a threat to democracy and freedom, \naligning themselves with the interests they serve, while \npoisoning the collective psyche of the more timid \ngroups in society. \n Concerted efforts to undermine legitimate \ninstitutions are being launched and consolidated under \nfundamentalist doctrines. New witch hunts identify that \nphenomenon, and the fundamentalists of the right are \nembarking on well-coordinated and well-financed \nventures while continuing to sign off on huge corporate \ndeals. Such is the case with the Halliburton company, \nwhose balance sheets are spattered with Arab and \nAmerican blood. All the while, Al Qaeda is bigger than \never, and the weapons of mass destruction have still \nnot been found. \n Homegrown right-wing and racist forces, \nemboldened by foreign support, do not recognize the \nlegitimacy of new or renewed institutions and cause \npolitical and social instability and separatism. Look at \nBolivia. In Ecuador, those groups will not accept the \noverwhelming popular support provided yesterday to \nPresident Correa\u2019s draft constitution, so we will have \nto invite him to come in and join the axis of evil. \n In any case, there is not much to worry about \nwhen it comes to the leftist democracies. They are very \nmodern, in the sense that they do not have religious or \ngender police, while on the other hand they are \nantiquated democracies, where those who gain the \nmost votes come in first and are elected. \n The drama of poverty, social exclusion and \nuneven distribution of income still tyrannizes our \ncountries. The current model of development is not \nsustainable. It endangers life, the planet and peace. As \nlong as there is still hunger, our democracies and our \nenvironment are threatened. The time for profound and \ndemanding changes has come. Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon, in his address to this Assembly at its 5th \nmeeting, referred to the need for a new understanding \non business ethics, with more compassion and less \nunconditional faith in the magic of the markets. Greed \nand consumerism have brought about climate change, \nthe energy crisis, financial chaos and the food crisis. \n The world food crisis continues to expand. Food \nhas become just a form of merchandise used to \nmaximize profits, with the human right to food \nignored. According to the statistics of the Food and \nAgriculture Organization, global food production has \nconsistently exceeded global population growth. That \nmeans that sufficient food is produced in the world to \nprovide more than 2,800 calories every day to each of \nthe world\u2019s inhabitants. Close to 18 per cent more \ncalories are produced per person than was the case in \nthe 1960s, despite the increase in the total population. \nIf sufficient food is produced in the world, how can we \nexplain the fact that more than 850 million people now \nsuffer from hunger or malnutrition, that 25,000 people \ndie from hunger every day and that 18,000 of those are \nchildren?  \n The Secretary-General has stated that \ndevelopment is in a state of emergency, and he \ncontinues to appeal for progress on the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. \n Venezuela promotes policies for social inclusion, \npublic policies to ensure everyone\u2019s rights. In order to \nbuild a new model for development on the basis of \nsolidarity, social justice, equity, cooperation, respect \nfor human rights and the participation of the people, \nVenezuela has a comprehensive social development \npolicy based on the human being. The foundation of \nthat policy is social missions undertaken through wide-\nranging and free social and economic programmes to \n  \n \n08-53141 24 \n \nreach out to all sectors of society, with a particular \nemphasis on the most vulnerable, in order to guarantee \nthe social and economic rights of our people in peace \nand democracy. \n With great satisfaction and humility, our country \ncan share with the Assembly the progress we have \nachieved in implementing the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. The number of people in extreme \npoverty has dropped in our country, and there has been \nan increase of 10.8 per cent in primary school \nattendance. Unemployment has dropped from 23 per \ncent to 7 per cent. In recent years, gross domestic \nproduct expenditures on health have increased by 57.1 \nper cent. We provide total coverage to those suffering \nfrom AIDS. The proportion of the population with \naccess to drinking water has increased from 80 per cent \nin 1998 to 95 per cent in 2007. During the period from \n1996 to 2007, infant mortality dropped from 23.4 to \n13.4 per 1,000 live births. \n Venezuela has made major contributions to \nefforts for cooperation and complementarity between \nthe countries of the South. The Bolivarian Alternative \nfor the Americas (ALBA), which was established by \nBolivia, Cuba, Nicaragua, Dominica, Honduras and \nVenezuela, is an initiative that brings together the \nabilities and strengths of its members to bring about \nstructural change and the relationships necessary to \nachieve development and continue to exist as sovereign \nand just nations. \n Petrocaribe is an energy cooperation agreement \nproposed by the Government of Bolivia to resolve the \nasymmetries in the region between energy producers \nand consumers by means of a new, equitable and just \nsystem of trade between the countries of the Caribbean \nregion. \n The Union of South American Nations \n(UNASUR) is an ongoing political endeavour, which, \nin its short existence, has shown that it is politically \neffective and respects the sovereignty of peoples. It has \narrived at common positions on projects in the fields of \nenergy, social affairs, finance, education, \ninfrastructure, dispute resolution and defence, and has \ngone beyond mere talk to become part of daily life of \nthe citizens of South America. The recent unanimous \nsupport of President Evo Morales and democracy in \nBolivia is a good example of that. \n The President of the General Assembly, \nMr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, stated that more than \na half of the peoples of the Earth languish in hunger \nand poverty while ever-increasing amounts of money \nare wasted on arms, wars, luxury items and totally \nsuperfluous and unnecessary goods. \n That addiction to war is the only thing that can \nexplain the fact that, after the collapse of the Soviet \nUnion, war-loving countries and alliances continued to \nchip away, day after day, at Russian democracy and to \nintrigue in the region against Moscow instead of \nabandoning their threats of war and trying to resolve \nthe lack of trust that is the source of conflict and \nviolence. It is a disgraceful situation that has not \nwanted for ignorant cowboys who think they are \nheroes. The Russian bear is awakening from its \nhibernation. \n How many human lives have we lost among \nIraqis, Americans, Latin Americans, Europeans, Asians \nand Africans? And how many lives could we save if the \nresources devoted to war and to the recovery of \nfinancial institutions were devoted instead to social \ninvestment? \n The reform process requires the adoption of \nmeasures to strengthen the authority of the General \nAssembly, including on matters of international peace \nand security, given that it is the principal deliberating, \nparticipatory and democratic body of the Organization. \nVenezuela supports the expansion of both the \npermanent and non-permanent membership of the \nSecurity Council, the abolishment of the \nantidemocratic post-war mechanism of the veto and the \nimprovement of the Council\u2019s working methods, so \nthat it may be more transparent and accessible and so \nthat never again will anyone resort to lying to the \nCouncil. \n We must remain vigilant to ensure that the \nHuman Rights Council continues to operate on the \nbasis of principles of impartiality, objectivity and \nnon-selectivity without stigmatizing anyone and to \npromote constructive dialogue, without diversions \nabout certification, cooperation without preconditions \nor vetoes, and respect for the particular circumstances \nof nations and regions, as well as for our diverse \nhistorical, cultural and religious pasts. \n We reject racist, xenophobic and discriminatory \nmeasures that clearly deny the human rights that \nshould apply universally to all, including migrants. \nCriminalizing migrants and their families violates their \nfundamental rights. Measures such as the Return \n \n \n25 08-53141 \n \nDirective approved by the European Parliament incite \nracism, xenophobia and other forms of discrimination \nand intolerance. That is incompatible with the defence, \npromotion and protection of human rights, democracy \nand the rule of law. We prefer a Europe of light, \nintegration and reconciliation to a Europe of shadows. \n We know that we are not at the end of history; we \nare not even at the beginning of the end of history. \nWhat we do know is that we are apparently at the close \nof a chapter of history, at the end of a neoliberal \nnightmare in which unbridled capitalism \u2014 as John \nPaul II described it \u2014 social violence and the \npersistent worldwide violation of all human rights \nprevailed. \n This afternoon, the House of Representatives of \nthe United States of America took an historic decision \nwhose effects will be felt throughout the world in the \ntimes to come. Very soon next year, we hope to be able \nto say that the worst has past and that the perverse \neffects of the religion of the market will be replaced, \nGod willing, on the global level, allowing us to move \ntowards democracy, progress and social justice, \nensuring peace among nations \u2014 among nations that \nare free and stand together, among nations that are \nunited.

        "file_text": "Since we \ngathered here a year ago, the world has experienced \nmany serious challenges. Natural disasters, climate \nchange, violent conflicts, terrorism, human rights \nviolations, rising food and energy prices and financial \nturmoil have affected the lives of people worldwide. \nDealing with crisis after crisis is a daunting task. \nWithout the United Nations, it would in many respects \nbe a hopeless one. \n Indeed, it is the United Nations that gives hope to \npeople around the world and it is the United Nations \nthat gives political leaders a unique tool to solve \nproblems and to settle conflicts. It was created more \nthan sixty years ago, under the still-fresh impression of \nthe horrors of the Second World War and with a strong \nfocus on matters of peace and security. Today, the \nworld is a different place, and yet we must keep \nturning to the United Nations to solve our problems \ntogether and to protect those most in need and danger.  \n We applaud the Secretary-General and the \ndedicated United Nations personnel for their hard \nwork. Nevertheless, the Organization is sometimes \nmired in bureaucracy, inefficiency and political \ninfighting. But the blame falls mainly on us, the \nMember States. It is our responsibility to adapt the \nUnited Nations to today\u2019s challenges and to make it the \nbest possible organization to that end. We must equip \nthe Organization with the resources it needs and make \nthe necessary adjustments in its structure. \n In recent years, the regular budget of the \nOrganization has grown in a completely lopsided way. \nCore activities, such as conflict prevention, the \npromotion of human rights and the rule of law, \nhumanitarian assistance and support for economic and \nsocial development, are subject to an artificial policy \nof zero budget growth and must be financed largely \nthrough voluntary contributions. At the same time, \nStates have come to routinely accept massive increases \nin peacekeeping bills. It is high time that we shift our \nfocus from fighting fires to preventing their outbreak. \nWe therefore fully support the efforts of the Secretary-\nGeneral to enhance the conflict prevention and \nmediation capacities of the Secretariat. \n The session just concluded brought about a \nsobering realization that some of the reform processes \ninitiated at the 2005 World Summit have effectively \ncome to a halt. Others have yet to be the subject of \nextremely difficult negotiations. We believe that quick \nprogress is necessary on a number of management \nreform issues, from human resource management to \naccountability and internal justice. We will also \ncontinue our work to achieve a more legitimate and \nmore effective Security Council. To that end, we will \nstep up our efforts to enhance the involvement and \naccess of those who are not members of the Council.  \n Liechtenstein is a strong believer in \nmultilateralism and in a rule-based international \nsystem. Our national sovereignty is grounded in \ninternational law and its observance, and we are \ntherefore strongly committed to the rule of law. Those \nprinciples were chief among our motivations for \njoining the United Nations 18 years ago, and they have \nbeen high among our priorities as a Member ever since.  \n The rule of law has gained much prominence in \nthe work of the United Nations over the past few years, \nbut it has yet to take the central place that is its due. \nThe most precious asset of this Organization remains \nthe legitimacy that it lends to decisions of the \ninternational community. In fact, the United Nations \nsymbolizes the rule of law in international relations. \nWe must preserve that strength and therefore also \npromote the rule of law within United Nations organs, \nincluding the Security Council, and their decision-\nmaking.  \n Together with other countries, we have expressed \nlong-standing concerns about the current practice of \nthe Security Council regarding sanctions listing and \ndelisting, in particular in the area of counter-terrorism. \nThere should be no doubt that we fully support the \nsanctions regimes, which constitute powerful tools for \nthe maintenance of international peace and security, \nbut we also believe that the procedures applied must be \nin accordance with basic international standards of due \nprocess. Recent court decisions indicate that our \nreservations are well founded, and we hope that our \nproposals will contribute to the improvement of the \nsystem. We must avoid the impression that decisions of \nthe Security Council might be in violation of human \nrights standards. \n All of our countries, and the Security Council in \nparticular, are also called to task in the fight against \n \n \n9 08-53135 \n \nimpunity. Since the 1990s, the Council has adopted a \nnumber of landmark decisions to enforce international \ncriminal law, including the decision to establish \ninternational and mixed tribunals. The Council also has \nan important role to play in connection with the \nInternational Criminal Court, which deals with the \nmost serious crimes under international law. The \nCouncil did so in adopting resolution 1593 (2005), and \nit is essential that it continue to exercise responsibly its \npowers under the Rome Statute.  \n Mr. Stratan (Republic of Moldova), Vice-\nPresident, took the Chair. \n The International Criminal Court is the most \nimportant achievement in decades in the area of \ninternational law. Now we must make it work in \npractice and give it the necessary political support. The \nsuccess of the Court will be the yardstick in the fight \nagainst impunity. If we want to win that fight, we must \nshow resolve by supporting the Court. \n Years ago, the General Assembly adopted the \nConvention on the Prevention and Punishment of the \nCrime of Genocide, and the International Criminal \nCourt was given jurisdiction over that crime 50 years \nlater. The Convention was born of the desire to prevent \nthe recurrence of genocide, yet it failed to achieve that \npurpose on several occasions following its adoption. \nThe rallying cry \u201cNever Again!\u201d can be used only so \noften before it loses credibility. In that spirit, all of us \nagreed to the concept of the responsibility to protect \nwhen we met at the summit level three years ago. For \nus and for many others, that was one of the most \nsignificant gains achieved in the 2005 World Summit \nOutcome, which was otherwise a mixed bag. Still, we \nare struggling with the challenge to make the concept \nwidely understood and to apply it in practice.  \n The responsibility to protect is a narrow concept \nthat is limited to clearly defined cases of genocide, war \ncrimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. \nIt is based on the sovereign responsibility of States to \nprotect their own populations as well as the United \nNations Charter. We must maintain that conceptual \nclarity and provide for consistent implementation of \nthe Summit decision. \n In spite of the lofty aspirations expressed at the \n2005 World Summit, we are still far from taking a \ncommon approach to the development agenda, and the \nchallenges are growing rapidly. Climate change, the \nfood crisis, the energy crisis and the faltering \ninternational financial system are just a few examples. \nAll those challenges hit particularly hard those who \nalready live in poverty, and they also threaten to \nundermine the effectiveness of our development \ncooperation. We therefore need a consensus on \nfinancing for development that builds on the Monterrey \nConsensus. Such an agreement will require significant \nsacrifices and compromises on all sides, and it is sorely \nneeded to strengthen the development pillar of \nmultilateral cooperation. \n Let me say in conclusion that we have always \nstood and fought for a strong General Assembly. By \nthat, we do not mean an Assembly that develops an \nantagonistic relationship with other organs of the \nUnited Nations. We want an Assembly that is a forum \nfor meaningful and focused discussions on topics of \nhigh relevance, followed by clear decisions and their \nimplementation. We hope that this session will allow us \nto take a step in that direction. "

        "file_text": "At the outset, I \nhave the honour of congratulating His Excellency \nMr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann of Nicaragua on his \nelection to the post of President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-third session. I wish him every \nsuccess in his endeavours. I would like also to pay \ntribute to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Srgjan \nKerim, for his active collaboration with delegations \nthroughout the last session. I wish also to express my \nprofound respect for the able leadership demonstrated \nby His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon in \nthe management of the United Nations. \n The effectiveness of the international security \nsystem has an impact on the authority of the United \nNations. When agreement among Security Council \nmembers on approaches to overcoming challenges to \nworld peace seems elusive, the common security and \ncredibility of the United Nations are seriously affected. \n We shall respect our shared values and accept the \nrestraints inherent in those values in order to find an \napproach that is based on a global consensus. The \n A/63/PV.13\n \n13 08-53122 \n \nSecurity Council must fully realize its primary \nresponsibility for the collective management of threats \nthat transcend national boundaries and have \nimplications for international security. All of us must \nstrictly follow the Charter as a unique instrument of \ninternational relations. \n The reform of the United Nations and its Security \nCouncil will further improve the credibility of the \nUnited Nations system. The success of the reforms will \ndepend on our political willingness to deliver the \nexpected results. We need to harmonize diverging \nviews in order to arrive at a generally acceptable \nsolution that will reflect the universal character of the \nUnited Nations and adapt it to present-day realities. \n We must enhance the role of the General \nAssembly as the supreme policymaking organ of the \nUnited Nations. It is only by strengthening the \nAssembly\u2019s mandate that we can successfully tackle \nsome of the most pressing issues facing humanity. \n This session is taking place at a very critical \njuncture for the South Caucasus region and for the \ninternational community as a whole. The worrisome \nevents that took place last month in Georgia have \nclearly shown that restoring stability to the region \nrequires a collective effort to strengthen the \ninternational security system. \n Obviously, the situation in that region is a matter \nof concern for us, and Azerbaijan is already making its \ncontribution to reduce tensions. We firmly believe that \nissues that cause disagreements in the region must be \nsettled peacefully, through dialogue, on the basis of the \nnorms and principles of international law and mutual \nrespect. \n The Georgian case has also proved that the \nprotracted conflicts existing in the area of Georgia, \nUkraine, Azerbaijan and Moldova (GUAM), including \nthe Armenia-Azerbaijan Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, \nremain a major source of instability, and a fragile \nceasefire regime cannot be a substitute for lasting \npeace in the region. Persistence of these conflicts \nendangers international peace and security and \nprevents the full utilization of the potential of this \nstrategically important region, situated at the \ncrossroads of Europe and Asia. A resolution of the \nprotracted conflicts in the GUAM area will not only \nbring immediate benefits to affected countries, but will \nsubstantially contribute to stability and regional \nsecurity. \n In that context, the Caucasus Stability and \nCooperation Platform initiated by Turkey could serve \nas a good departure point for building the regional \nsecurity system. It is of utmost importance to ensure \nthat our common efforts are built on the principles of \nmutual respect for territorial integrity, recognition of \nexisting borders, equality and good-neighbourliness. \n The prerequisite for the establishment of \ncooperation and good-neighbourly relations in the \nregion is the withdrawal of Armenian troops from the \noccupied lands and the restoration of the full \nsovereignty of Azerbaijan over those territories. Only \nthrough that can we pave the way for peace and \neconomic prosperity for the entire region. \n The earliest possible resolution of the armed \nconflict in and around the Nagorno-Karabakh region of \nAzerbaijan remains a primary task for us. The \nGovernment of Azerbaijan is committed to a peaceful \nsettlement of the conflict on the basis of the norms and \nprinciples of international law, including relevant \nSecurity Council resolutions, General Assembly \nresolutions and documents of the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe. \n In order to facilitate the negotiation process, \nAzerbaijan initiated, during the sixty-second session of \nthe General Assembly, consideration of the agenda \nitem entitled, \u201cThe situation in the occupied territories \nof Azerbaijan\u201d. The Assembly comprehensively \naddressed the issue and adopted resolution 62/243. We \nhighly appreciate the principled support of the States \nmembers of the General Assembly for that resolution, \nwhich reaffirmed the Assembly\u2019s continued respect and \nsupport for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of \nthe Republic of Azerbaijan within its internationally \nrecognized borders and demanded the withdrawal of all \nArmenian forces from all the occupied territories of the \nRepublic of Azerbaijan. The resolution also reaffirmed \n\u201cthat no State shall recognize as lawful the situation \nresulting from the occupation of the territories of the \nRepublic of Azerbaijan, nor render aid or assistance in \nmaintaining this situation\u201d (resolution 62/243, para. 5). \nIt recognized  \n\u201cthe inalienable right of the population expelled \nfrom the occupied territories of the Republic of \nAzerbaijan to return to their homes, and \nstresse[d] the necessity of creating appropriate \nconditions for this return, including the \nA/63/PV.13  \n \n08-53122 14 \n \ncomprehensive rehabilitation of the conflict-\naffected territories\u201d. (para. 3) \n The Assembly  \n\u201c[recognized] the necessity of providing normal, \nsecure and equal conditions of life for Armenian \nand Azerbaijani communities in the Nagorno-\nKarabakh region of Azerbaijan, which will allow \nan effective democratic system of self-\ngovernance to be built up in this region within the \nRepublic of Azerbaijan\u201d. (para. 4) \n I would like to stress that the principles laid out \nin the resolution will be used as a basis in the \nnegotiation process. The General Assembly will \ncontinue to follow the situation in the occupied \nterritories of Azerbaijan under agenda item 18 of the \ncurrent session. \n In recent years, Azerbaijan has made crucial \ncontributions to strengthening regional stability by \npromoting security, energy, communications and \neconomic cooperation projects. Production and secure \ndelivery of hydrocarbon resources of the Caspian Sea \nto international markets has been an important element \nof Azerbaijan\u2019s foreign and domestic policy. We will \ncontinue to carry out a strategy that will substantially \nimprove energy security and economic prospects in the \nregion and beyond. \n Another strategic project under implementation is \nthe construction of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway \nlinking our country with Georgia and Turkey through a \nmajor transport connection. This will create an \nessentially new and effective communication corridor \nbetween East and West, between Europe and Asia. \n The economic development and growth of \nAzerbaijan have been on the rise. The growth rate of \nour gross domestic product remains one of the highest \nin the world, and reached 18 per cent in the first nine \nmonths of 2008. According to the forecasts of \ninternational financial institutions, the growth rate will \nretain its dynamics for the next year. \n Azerbaijan is of the view that facilitating trade \noffers enormous opportunities to pursue development \nobjectives. Against this background, the joint report of \nthe World Bank and the International Finance \nCorporation, \u201cDoing Business 2009\u201d, recognized my \ncountry as a top reformer in 2007-2008 in \nimplementing business regulatory reforms, and as one \nof the leading countries with investment-friendly \neconomies. According to the report, out of 181 countries, \nAzerbaijan was rated first in improving the commercial \nenvironment and encouraging business start-ups. \nAzerbaijan strongly believes that these factors are \ncentral in attracting and mobilizing financial resources \nto support socio-economic development of the country.  \n In the meantime, we are champions in the \nimplementation of the Extractive Industries \nTransparency Initiative (EITI) and consider the \nGeneral Assembly\u2019s adoption without a vote of \nresolution 62/274, on the EITI, as a sign of the global \nrecognition of our efforts. \n Protection and promotion of human rights is one \nof the central duties of the international community. \nToday, this is not merely a question of protecting \nindividuals; it is fundamental to promoting peace and \nstability around the globe. Azerbaijan remains actively \ninvolved in the work of the United Nations human \nrights bodies. As a member of the Human Rights \nCouncil, we attach great importance to the efficient \nfunctioning of the Council. It is our common task and \nresponsibility to ensure that that institution lives up to \nthe expectations vested in it and truly becomes an \nobjective, vigorous and credible universal human rights \nbody. \n Azerbaijan is fully committed to all its \nobligations as a State member of various international \norganizations to promote democracy, the rule of law \nand human rights. We believe that through consistent \nreforms and investments in education, we will achieve \nlong-term stability and prosperity in our part of the \nworld. "

        "file_text": "Sophocles said that all mankind is subject to error. We \nare gathered here in this Assembly in order to limit the \nscope of those errors and to ensure respect for the \nmandate of the United Nations. My Government fully \nagrees with the objectives and ideas expressed by \nPresident Nicolas Sarkozy as President of the European \nUnion (see ).  \n There is much that remains to be done and many \nobstacles to be overcome: armed conflict, hunger, \npoverty, environmental degradation, terrorism, \norganized crime, human trafficking, lack of respect for \nhuman rights and the abuse of power. All these things \nthreaten what we wish to build in the United Nations: a \ncommunity of States that enjoys progress, peace and \nprosperity.  \n Add the economic crisis the world faces now to \nthose scourges, and it becomes difficult not to see the \nfuture as dark and menacing. As the poet Yeats \ndescribed, we live in a world where \n(spoke in English) \n\u201cThe best lack all conviction, while the worst are \nfull of passionate intensity.\u201d \n(spoke in French) \n During this critical period, every country must \nmake a choice: either to focus solely on its own limited \ninterests and promote nationalistic ends in order to \ndistract people\u2019s attention from danger throughout the \nworld, or to look outwards, to open its mind and \nborders and to commit to warning people that the only \nway to face threats successfully is to do so together. \n The history of Greece and the character of the Greek \npeople are such that we have chosen the second path. It \nwas in ancient Greece that society for the first time \ndeveloped those ideals that are cherished today by free \npeople throughout the world: democracy, equality and \nindividual rights. More recently, we have lived through \nseveral wars, poverty and deprivation. Nevertheless, we \nendured, and we have been able once again to grab hold \nof the ideas that we were the first to profess. \n We have not forgotten, however, what it is like to \nfeel fear and need. This is why we will continue to \nwork closely with all States, organizations and \ninstitutions to ensure that all people can live in security \nand can prosper and thrive. \n The United Nations must be at the helm of this \neffort. In order to play its role efficiently, the United \nNations needs increased support from us all, \nparticularly in its efforts to develop and improve. \nDiscussions about Security Council reforms and the \nneed to breathe new life into the General Assembly \nhave been going on for far too long. We hope that, \nstarting at this session, today, concrete measures will \nbe adopted to reach our objective. \n(spoke in English) \n This year we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of \nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. \nUnfortunately, gross violations of human rights persist \nthroughout the world, and we Member States need to \nredouble our efforts to reduce them. The Human Rights \nCouncil could be a powerful force in that struggle, and \nGreece has decided to become a candidate for \nmembership for the term beginning in 2012. We ask for \nthe Assembly\u2019s support and trust. \n Along with protecting human rights, the United \nNations must strengthen its efforts to alleviate the bitter \npoverty that still grips many parts of the world. We need to \nincrease trade for development, and we regret the lack \nof progress in the Doha Round. In 2000, we agreed on \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), probably \nthe most ambitious development project ever \nundertaken by man. In terms of time, we are halfway \nthere. Yet a lot remains to be done. The progress \nachieved so far is jeopardized by higher prices, \nparticularly for food and oil, and the global economic \nslowdown. Our success will be judged primarily in \nAfrica. \n We believe that one way to help jumpstart \ndevelopment in Africa is to involve women in the \neconomy more extensively. Providing entrepreneurial \n  \n \n08-53129 22 \n \nopportunities to women at local, national and regional \nlevels will allow them to strengthen their role in \nsociety, increase their involvement in education and \nultimately allow them to play a more active part in \ndecision-making. As the French social theorist Charles \nFourier said more than 200 years ago, \u201cThe extension \nof women\u2019s rights is the basic principle of all social \nprogress.\u201d \n The challenge of climate change, if not addressed, \nthreatens not only the MDGs but also the economic and \nsocial stability of our world. We have to achieve, in \n2009, a new, truly global agreement with ambitious, \nbinding mitigation targets. We also need a much \nstronger effort on adaptation, where there is a huge \ndeficit between the needs and the actual financing \nprovided. That deficit is exacerbated by the fact that no \nmatter what we do, we are locked in for significant \nclimate change in the next three to four decades, which is \ngoing to especially affect the less developed countries. It is \nan unjust reality that those that are least to blame for the \ncreation of the problem are to suffer most. \n Greece is moving to face this challenge. We have \nsigned, this week in New York, agreements with the \nAfrican Union and the Caribbean Community for \nthe funding of adaptation projects, and we plan to do \nthe same with the Alliance of Small Island States, \nproviding a total of \u20ac20 million for the next four years. \nOne might argue that this is just a drop in the adaptation \nbucket. It is, however, a drop in an empty bucket. \n Migration is a critical element in the development \nof neglected regions, and the United Nations High-\nlevel Dialogue on International Migration and \nDevelopment has taken the lead in dramatizing the \nlink. By hosting the third Global Forum on Migration \nand Development in the fall of 2009, Greece aims to \nprovide a platform on which to explore solutions and \ninitiatives for the benefit of all countries and especially \nfor the immigrants themselves. \n As heartbreaking as the suffering of immigrants \nand refugees often is, nothing can compare to the \nmisery involved in human trafficking. Young women \nwho leave their homes in search of a better livelihood \nare exploited, brutalized and forced into a life of \nunspeakable depravity by the traffickers in human \nmisery who are involved in the international sex trade. \nI say it is time for the international community to say \n\u201cEnough!\u201d I urge all the members of the United \nNations to begin working together forcefully to put an \nend to this blight on human dignity. \n Along with protecting the weak and vulnerable, \nthe United Nations has the responsibility to act \nforcefully and to protect the world from the kind of \nfanaticism and extremism that cripples any social \nprogramme. Terrorism poses a major threat to the \nsecurity of our countries, to the stability of our \ndemocratic societies and to the rights and freedoms of \nour citizens. Around the world, whether in Afghanistan \nor Pakistan, Iraq or Yemen, the international \ncommunity must show its strong commitment to \ncombating terrorism while protecting human rights and \nthe rule of law. \n On regional security, Greece is preparing to \nassume the chairmanship of the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) next \nJanuary. The OSCE \u2014 the world\u2019s largest regional \nsecurity organization \u2014 can be a forum for frank and \nfruitful talks on security issues and can contribute \neffectively to such crucial concerns as early warning, \nconflict prevention, crisis management and post-\nconflict rehabilitation. Finland, the current Chair, has \nmade a major effort to promote positive discussions \namong the OSCE States, and Greece intends to \ncontinue that policy and try to resolve outstanding \nissues. \n The crisis in South Ossetia has created a volatile \nsituation that affects stability in all the South Caucasus \nand has exacerbated international tension. Greece\u2019s \nposition on that crisis is rooted in the principles that \nhave always guided our foreign policy \u2014 peaceful \nsettlement of disputes and respect for the sovereignty, \nindependence and territorial integrity of States. In both \nthe European Union (EU) and NATO, we supported the \nsix-point agreement that helped end conflict in the \narea, but we are anxious to see measures that will \nalleviate the anger and mistrust that now pervade the \nregion. \n In the broader Middle East, the Israeli-Palestinian \nconflict is at the root of most of the problems, and the \nregion requires a comprehensive and lasting solution. \nI think that we all agree that the peace process \nrelaunched last year at the Annapolis conference has \nthe potential to achieve tangible results and merits the \nstrong support of all of us. \n In Lebanon, we welcome the presidential \nelection, the formation of the National Unity \n4\n3\n \n \n23 08-53129 \n \nGovernment and the resumption of the national \ndialogue. Lebanon\u2019s sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity should be respected, in conformity with the \nrelevant Security Council resolutions. \n Turning to our immediate neighbourhood, Greece \nis committed to a South-Eastern Europe where all \ncountries belong to the European and Euro-Atlantic \nfamilies. We were as pleased to welcome Croatia and \nAlbania to NATO a few months ago as we were to \nwelcome Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union \nlast year. We have been encouraged also by the recent \ndevelopments in Serbia, a country which grows closer \nto Europe every day. \n In the same spirit, we agree with our NATO allies \nand European Union partners that invitations to the \nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be \nextended when a mutually acceptable solution is \nreached on the name issue. Greece will continue to be \nguided by the letter and the spirit of Security Council \nresolutions 817 (1993) and 845 (1993) on that issue, \nand I want to take this opportunity to express our \nappreciation to the Secretary-General and his Personal \nEnvoy, Mr. Matthew Nimetz, for their commitment and \ntheir tireless efforts to settle the dispute. \n The new reality of Kosovo requires continued \nattention from the international community. The United \nNations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo has \ndone a good job providing security for Kosovo\u2019s \npopulation, and its successor, the European Union Rule \nof Law Mission Kosovo, should assume its \nresponsibilities as soon as possible. \n Beyond the Western Balkans, Greece continues \ntaking fruitful initiatives in the spirit of international \nlaw and the United Nations Charter to broaden and \nstrengthen cooperation with Turkey. We are convinced \nthat modern Turkey, with a clear European orientation, \nwill add to the stability of our region. We therefore \nsupport the European aspirations of Turkey as it moves \nto meet the prerequisites set out in the negotiating \nframework of the European Union. But words must be \nmatched with deeds. The principles of good-\nneighbourly relations and peaceful settlement of \ndisputes with other nations are essential preconditions. \nYet 34 years after the 1974 invasion of Cyprus, a \nsovereign United Nations and European Union member \nState, Turkey continues to occupy over one third of the \nisland\u2019s territory with nearly 40,000 troops. That \nunacceptable situation is a flagrant violation of \ninternational law, a threat to the security and welfare of \nGreek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots alike, and a \nserious obstacle to the stabilization of the region. \n Greece has consistently supported Cyprus in its \nnatural and justified desire to see the withdrawal of all \noccupation forces as part of a settlement for its \nreunification as a bizonal, bicommunal federation with \nintercommunal equality, a single sovereignty, a single \ncitizenship and a single international persona. Relevant \nUnited Nations resolutions and principles exist to \nprovide the framework for a mutually acceptable \nsolution. \n We thus welcomed the recent decision by Cypriot \nPresident Dimitris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot \nleader Mehmet Ali Talat to resume negotiations under \nthe auspices of the Secretary-General. We believe that \na viable solution can be achieved by the Cypriots \nthemselves through negotiations between the two \ncommunities without artificial deadlines and \narbitration. We shall continue to do everything possible \nto facilitate a settlement, and we hope that Turkey will \nalso demonstrate flexibility and goodwill towards that \nend. \n As is obvious to all of us, the United Nations is \nonce again beset by a host of troubles that will require \nthe patience of Job to endure and the strength of \nHercules to confront. As individual States, we have no \nhope of marshalling the strength to contemplate, let \nalone battle, the dangers facing us. But together, \nthrough the United Nations, we can find the resolve not \nonly to confront those awesome challenges but to \nsubdue the threat that they pose for humankind. "

I pledge Iceland\u2019s support and \ncooperation in the important work that lies ahead. \n Almost all United Nations Member States \nrecently sent athletes to compete in the Beijing \nSummer Olympic Games, where the world witnessed \noutstanding sportsmanship, in terms of both \nperformance and conduct. The Olympics have become \na global venue where there is no contradiction between \nthe demonstration of international solidarity and \npositive patriotism. While recognizing that the example \nof such a sporting event cannot be applied directly to \ninternational relations in the political field, it could \nstill be an inspiration as we seek ways to make our \nOrganization more effective in dealing with the \nimmense global challenges of the twenty-first century. \nThe Olympics reflect the human commonality and \naspirations that should be our point of departure. \n Extreme poverty continues to remain an obstacle \nto development and security in many parts of the \nworld. Despite considerable accomplishments in the \nreduction of poverty, this is still the single most \ndaunting challenge facing mankind and the source of \nso many other problems with global repercussions. \nExperience shows that a combination of local, regional \nand international initiatives is usually required to \neradicate the manifold causes of poverty. This includes \nadditional resources for development cooperation. \n We, the international community, must fulfil the \npromises we made to our most vulnerable constituents \neking out an existence in extreme poverty, especially in \nsub-Saharan Africa. They are the ones who depend \nmost on the solidarity of the international community. \nThe forthcoming meeting in Doha on financing for \ndevelopment will test the resolve of the international \ncommunity and, for its part, Iceland aims to be among \nthe top contributors of official development assistance \n(ODA), having already doubled its budget for \ndevelopment cooperation over the past four years.  \n The Secretary-General has aptly referred to the \ninterconnected challenges of soaring food costs, \ndevelopment and climate change. Indeed, the objective \nof widespread sustainable development seems ever \nmore distant. But apathy or despair is not an option \nbecause, inevitably, the cost of inaction will rise \ncorrespondingly. Action needs to be broad-based and \nsustained, addressing both urgent humanitarian and \nlong-term structural issues. Much can be done to \nstrengthen food security. Iceland, for example, has for \ndecades shared its experience and expertise in modern \nfisheries with developing coastal States, including \nthrough the work of the United Nations University \nFisheries Training Programme in Reykjavik. Ninety-\nfive per cent of the people in the world dependent on \nharvesting living marine resources live in developing \ncountries. We will continue to make a small but significant contribution towards improving their lives \nand thereby further the cause of sustainable \ndevelopment. Our goal of economic prosperity with \nenvironmental responsibility is the key to sustainable \ndevelopment and long-term prosperity. \n The threat of climate change can be tackled only \nthrough the combined efforts of the international \ncommunity. The urgency of the threat has been \nhighlighted repeatedly by my colleagues from the \nsmall island developing States and many least-\ndeveloped countries. They are the front-line States, \nexposed and vulnerable to the growing consequences \nof climate change. Ultimately, though, we will all be \naffected. It is in that spirit that Iceland welcomes and \nfully supports the Pacific Island initiative for a General \nAssembly resolution on security and climate change. \n The urgent work started in Kyoto must be \naccelerated in Copenhagen next year, and carbon \nemissions need to be systematically reduced. The \nworld can break the dependence on fossil fuels only by \noffering efficient and economical alternatives. Iceland \nis fortunate to have abundant hydroelectric and \ngeothermal power and has already reached the goal of \nderiving about 80 per cent of its energy consumption \nfrom clean renewable sources. The resulting expertise \nand technology have been made available to \ndeveloping States, and Iceland is proud to host the \nGeothermal Training Programme of the United Nations \nUniversity. \n Sixty years ago, Eleanor Roosevelt wisely \nobserved that \u201cThe Charter of the United Nations is a \nguiding beacon along the way to the achievement of \nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the \nworld\u201d. As we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, her words \nremind us of the progress already made and the long \nand difficult road ahead, made more difficult by major \nnew global challenges. \n Today\u2019s world does not tolerate racial \ndiscrimination and the time has come to make sex \ndiscrimination universally unacceptable too. My \nGovernment will continue to promote gender equality \ninternationally. We will do it both through multilateral \nefforts within the United Nations \u2014 most notably in \nthe United Nations Development Fund for Women \n(UNIFEM) \u2014 and in the World Bank. Regrettably, \ngender equality and women\u2019s empowerment remain \nelusive goals throughout the world. I urge the United \nNations to lead by example. \n The challenges posed by globalization also offer \nnew opportunities to revitalize the United Nations \nsystem and better equip the Organization to meet the \nchallenges of the twenty-first century: better \ntechnology, better communications and more efficient \nmanagement are all available. The United Nations is a \nlong way from being a perfect mechanism, but its role \nin the international system is indisputable and \nindispensable. If we settle for a United Nations that \nsometimes appears to be an abstract objective in itself, \nwe will never fully realize the potential of this \nuniversal gathering of nations. On the other hand, if we \nencourage a high level of ambition and adaptability I \nam convinced that the United Nations will live up to \nthe ideals of its founders and be celebrated as a \ncornerstone of the international architecture on the \ncentenary of the Charter in 2045. \n One simple method of raising the profile of the \nUnited Nations, as well as awareness of its important \nwork, is informing our citizens. I am pleased to inform \nthe Assembly that the Government of Iceland intends \nto make the purpose and work of the United Nations an \nintegral part of the curriculum at the primary and \nsecondary levels of education in our country, in \naddition to the existing and more selective activities at \nhigher levels. Iceland strongly encourages all Member \nStates to do the same. This may prove to be an \neffective means of offering the multilateral ideal of the \nUnited Nations as a part of the world view imparted to \nfuture leaders and citizens around the globe. \n It is perhaps an oversimplification to speak of a \ncontest between multilateralism and unilateralism in \ninternational affairs. Those different approaches \nfrequently overlap, but it is clear that when an effective \nmultilateral option is available it will always be the \npreferred choice for most countries, especially smaller \ncountries such as mine. This should inspire us to make \nthe United Nations a forum that can deliver substantive \nresults, in accordance with international law, in order \nto ensure that unilateral actions on issues of major \nsignificance become less likely. \n Iceland has been a responsible and active \nMember of the United Nations since 1946 and it is \nnow, after 62 years, seeking for the first time to serve \nas a non-permanent member of the Security Council, \nwith the full support of the other four Nordic countries. \n  \n \n08-52265 24 \n \nThe election will take place in this Hall in three weeks\u2019 \ntime. \n Throughout the history of the United Nations the \nNordic countries have been key contributors to the \nOrganization\u2019s peacekeeping and development \nassistance activities and have been able to play a role \nthat is disproportionate to their share of the global \npopulation. Above all, the Nordic countries have \nshown unwavering commitment to multilateral \ncooperation and the rule of law. If elected as a member \nof the Security Council, Iceland will continue in that \nstrong tradition. \n We seek the seat as a democratic State not in \nconflict with other countries; as a State with a history \nof solving its disputes peacefully; as a State that \nrespects universal human rights; and as a State without \nsubstantial geopolitical interests and, therefore, a State \nthat can approach issues with a certain objectivity. We \nsee our candidature not only from a national \nperspective. It is also a test of whether the smaller \nStates Members of the Organization, from all the \nregional groups, can have an opportunity to serve on \nthe Council and thus reinforce its legitimacy. The \nelection of Iceland would bolster the principle of \nsovereign equality and equitable representation. \n Academics sometimes associate certain periods in \nhistory with countries or regions as a way of \nhighlighting predominant characteristics or trends. It \nwould reflect well on us here today if we had the \nforesight and courage to take measures in coming years \nthat would give future historians reason to refer to the \ntwenty-first century as the century of the United \nNations.

        "file_text": "At the outset, allow me to \ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your election. In \nfulfilling your challenging tasks during this session, \nyou may rest assured of the support and cooperation of \nthe delegation of the Republic of Hungary. I also wish \nto salute your predecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, \nrepresentative of the Eastern European Group, who \nserved us with distinction and dedication. \n The challenges we have to face daily in an \nincreasingly globalized world require answers based on \nthe principle of universally accepted values and the \npractice of flexible adaptation to swift changes in our \nenvironment. That need is reflected in the new external \nrelations strategy adopted by the Hungarian \nGovernment at the beginning of this year. Our strategy, \npolicies and actions demonstrate our commitment to \nupholding the rule of international law, to giving \npriority to effective multilateralism, to spreading the \nculture of cooperation and the peaceful settlement of \ninternational disputes, and to working towards \npreserving a liveable and sustainable environment for \nfuture generations. Hungary\u2019s geographic position and \nits expertise in democracy building, good governance, \npromoting the rule of law and human rights, \ndisarmament and non-proliferation will serve as a good \nbasis for our effective contribution to the work of the \nOrganization. \n Skyrocketing energy prices, food and financial \ncrises and commodity speculation are endangering the \nresults we have attained so far towards achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). A coherent \nand coordinated response is needed to reverse that \nprocess. As an emerging donor country, Hungary \nfirmly believes that the international community \ncannot use the difficulties we all face as an excuse not \nto do the utmost to achieve the MDGs. \n  \n \n08-53129 8 \n \n We are firmly dedicated to broadening the \noutreach of our foreign policy to the developing \ncountries of Africa, Asia, Latin America and the \nCaribbean. International development cooperation and \nassistance are a growing segment of our foreign policy. \nWe are strongly committed to intensifying our efforts \nin the years to come. We are therefore gradually \nincreasing our official development assistance, \nconcentrating primarily on those activities where \nHungary has comparative advantages, especially in the \nareas of agriculture to combat famine and poverty \nthrough the introduction of modern growing facilities, \nanimal husbandry technologies, forestry and fisheries \nprogrammes, water management, developing health \nservices and promoting good governance. \n Every day we are ruining our environment \nthrough the intensive pace of development and the \nemission of greenhouse gases. To address that \nchallenge, we need a more effective institutional \nframework that includes clear political guidance; \nadequate, stable and predictable funding; a strong \nscientific base; and improved assessment of activities \nand emergency response institutions. Hungary fully \nagrees that the matter is urgent and hopes that the \nongoing deliberations on the future of the United \nNations Framework Climate Change Convention and \nthe Kyoto Protocol will lead to concrete results in the \ncoming year. \n This year we mark the sixtieth anniversary of the \nadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights, as well as 15 years of the existence of the \nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. \nOver the past 60 years, humankind has made \nextraordinary progress in the promotion and protection \nof human rights. Our job is to work hard for the full \nimplementation of human rights treaties. Our \nexpectations were fulfilled on 3 May of this year when \nthe Convention on the Rights of Persons with \nDisabilities entered into force. Hungary became the \nsecond Member State to ratify the Convention and its \nOptional Protocol. We hope that it will be universally \naccepted in the near future.  \n We strongly supported the establishment of the \nHuman Rights Council and we are determined to \ncontinue to do so. In our view, the time has come for \nthe Council, as well as for all of us, to redouble our \ndedicated efforts to make the work of the Human \nRights Council more efficient.  \n Following the adoption of a consensus resolution \nby the Council last September, the Forum on Minority \nIssues will hold its first session at the end of 2008. I \nam personally very proud that the first Forum session \nwill be chaired by a fellow Hungarian, \nMs. Vikt\u00f3ria Moh\u00e1csi, a member of the European \nParliament. I hope that, under her guidance, the Forum \non Minority Issues will be widely recognized, efficient \nand results-oriented. \n We firmly believe that a lasting solution to \ncurrent challenges cannot be achieved without the \neffective involvement of women in all aspects of \ninternational cooperation. I would like to state that \nHungary fully supports the initiative to undertake a \ncomprehensive review of the implementation of \nSecurity Council resolution 1325 (2000) by 2010, and I \nam confident that the United Nations should play a \nleadership role.  \n The United Nations and the European Union \u2014 \ntogether with Governments, non-governmental \norganizations and other international organizations \naround the world \u2014 have made tremendous efforts to \npromote international cooperation in the area of the \nprevention of genocide and mass atrocities. However, \nthe steps taken thus far still fall short of preventing the \nmany dreadful crimes against humanity. As a Member \nof the United Nations and the European Union, \nHungary is fully committed to the idea of preventing \ngenocide and is ready to take specific steps to that end. \nWe have decided to prepare a feasibility study on the \nestablishment in Budapest of an international centre for \nthe prevention of genocide and mass atrocities. In our \nview, it should be an independent institution with the \naim of contributing to international efforts to prevent \nthe occurrence of genocide. \n The most important outstanding issue in the area \nof counter-terrorism, is the full and speedy \nimplementation of the United Nations Global Counter-\nTerrorism Strategy (see resolution 60/288), for which \nMember States have the main responsibility. \nConcluding a comprehensive convention on \ninternational terrorism also remains a high priority for \nthe Republic of Hungary, and we fully support the \nwork of the Ad Hoc Committee in that regard. We hope \nthat we will be able to finalize the drafting of a \ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism \nduring the sixty-third session. \n \n \n9 08-53129 \n \n In spite of the many security and political \nchallenges that still persist in Afghanistan, we \nacknowledge and appreciate the achievements of the \ninternational community and the enormous work that \nhas been done so far to bring about tangible \nimprovements in the everyday lives of the Afghan \npeople. In that process, the United Nations Mission in \nAfghanistan remains instrumental, especially in the \npreparation and conduct of the upcoming presidential \nand parliamentary elections in 2009 and 2010. Hungary \nremains committed to helping Afghanistan to rebuild \nfollowing many years of war and to create a State that \nis safe, stable and democratic. We are committed to \ncontinuing our military assistance as a leading nation \nin the Provincial Reconstruction Team in the northern \npart of the country, as well as to expand our \ndevelopment activities in Afghanistan. \n Contributing to peace and stability and achieving \nprosperity have constituted a cornerstone of Hungarian \nforeign policy in the Western Balkans for many years. \nWe continue to believe that that goal is best served by \nactively supporting the integration of the region into \nEuro-Atlantic structures. As we all know, on \n17 February, Kosovo declared its independence. A \nnumber of United Nations Member States recognized \nthat independence, including Hungary. We deem it of \ncrucial importance that a resolution of the Kosovo \nAssembly and its new constitution fully committed \nKosovo to democracy, the rule of law, the protection of \nSerb communities and other minorities, the protection \nof cultural and religious heritage and the international \npresence. Without a stable Kosovo there can be no \nstability in the Balkans. In that context, we welcome \nand support the continued presence of the international \ncommunity on the basis of Security Council resolution \n1244 (1999). We also remain committed to contributing \nto the stability of Kosovo through the European Union \nRule of Law Mission, the International Security Force \nin Kosovo and an international civilian office as part of \nthe international presence. \n Hungary fully supports the efforts of the \ninternational community and various institutions to \nimplement the peace agreement in Georgia. Hungary \nstrongly believes in the peaceful settlement of \nconflicts. The use of military force to settle territorial \ndisputes represents a dangerous precedent that can \nhave further implications in the whole region and \nbeyond. Any further steps and negotiations must be \nbased on full respect for Georgia\u2019s sovereignty, \nterritorial integrity, internationally recognized borders \nand democratically elected leadership. It is of crucial \nimportance that all parties agree on a unified \ninterpretation of the agreement. We fully support, and \nwe are ready to participate in, the planned missions of \nthe different international institutions, such as those of \nthe EU and the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe, in resolving the conflict and \nmonitoring the implementation of the peace agreement. \nHungary has offered humanitarian assistance, and we \nare studying further possibilities to assist Georgia. \n Hungary attaches great importance to the \ncomprehensive process initiated at the Annapolis \nConference, convened by the President of the United \nStates of America, in order to settle the Middle East \nconflict. Since Annapolis, there have been regular \nmeetings between Israel and the Palestinian National \nAuthority. We hope that the peace process will lead to \nthe resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the \nnormalization of Israeli-Arab relations. \n The Iranian nuclear programme continues to be a \nmatter of serious concern for my Government. Iran has \nfailed to provide the international community with \ncredible assurances as to whether its nuclear projects \nare in line with its international obligations. We deeply \nregret that the leadership of Iran has refused to abide \nwith the relevant Security Council resolutions. Only \nfull and unconditional compliance with the demand to \nsuspend its enrichment-related and reprocessing \nactivities can pave the way for the re-establishment of \nconfidence in the peaceful nature of the Iranian nuclear \nprogramme and open up prospects for intensified \neconomic and political cooperation. We hope that Iran \nwill change its present course of confrontation and opt \nfor constructive dialogue with its partners. \n After five years of conflict, Iraq is showing clear \nsigns of recovery for the first time. With the help of the \ninternational community, Iraq is achieving major \nmilestones in the reconciliation and reconstruction \nprocess. Hungary welcomes the fact that the improved \nsecurity situation allows for the establishment of a \nwithdrawal schedule, assuming that a fundamental \nchange in the capability of the Iraqi Government to \ntake control provides grounds for a long-term \nsettlement of the crisis. \n Due to the conflict raging in Darfur, which is one \nof the most worrisome on the African continent, the \nsituation in the Sudan and neighbouring countries is \n  \n \n08-53129 10 \n \nstill unpredictable and explosive. Hungary welcomes \nthe extension of the mandate of African Union-United \nNations Hybrid Operation in Darfur until 31 July 2009. \nIt is essential that the mission be fully deployed by the \nend of the year. The establishment of criminal courts in \nthe region paves the way towards a solution of the \ncrisis in Darfur. Nevertheless, we should continue to \nfollow the fragile peace process closely. \n We are convinced that, in order to address the \nvarious challenges of the twenty-first century, the \ninternational community needs a strong, reformed and \nwell-functioning United Nations. Progress has been \nmade in all areas of United Nations reform in the past \ntwo years, with some new bodies becoming \noperational. In other areas we need further \nconsultations and negotiations with Member States in \norder to achieve a lasting solution. Hungary is ready to \ncontribute to those negotiations. We welcome the \nrecent decision of the General Assembly to start the \nintergovernmental negotiations on the reform of the \nSecurity Council during the sixty-third session. \n In conclusion, Hungary is strongly committed to \nwork with you, Mr. President, during the sixty-third \nsession of the General Assembly in attaining the \nobjectives of the United Nations.

        "file_text": "On behalf of \nthe Government and the people of the Republic of San \nMarino, I wish to congratulate Mr. d\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann on his appointment as President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-third session. Please rest \nassured that the Republic of San Marino is eager to \noffer all its support for the success of this session. \n  \n \n08-51851 42 \n \n I would like to express our appreciation for the \nexcellent work carried out during the sixty-second \nsession of the General Assembly by the outgoing \nPresident, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, in particular for the \ncommitment and determination he demonstrated while \npresiding over the Assembly and promoting the United \nNations reform agenda. \n I would also like to give special thanks to the \nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for the great \nenergy and dedication he has displayed in leading this \nOrganization and, in particular, for his admirable \ncommitment to the United Nations reform agenda and \nhis continuing vigilance and determination in the face \nof emergencies and events of international political \nimportance. \n Furthermore, I would like to express San \nMarino\u2019s appreciation for the consideration the \nSecretary-General has shown to all United Nations \nMember States, without distinction, including small \nStates, and for the attention he has paid to particularly \ndelicate and urgent issues, such as climate change and \nthe global food crisis. \n The United Nations reform process is of \nfundamental importance to world equilibrium and must \nremain the focus of our efforts. We must not allow our \nfailure to reach agreement on United Nations reform to \nlead to the decentralization and weakening of the \nOrganization\u2019s pivotal role. \n The key role played by the United Nations is of \nthe essence in present international conditions, marked \nby wars and national conflict. In these early stages of \nthe twenty-first century, we are witnessing a series of \nnew conflicts ever more driven by economic interests \nand clashes of civilizations, both ethnic and religious, \noften within the same country. \n More than 60 years ago, the signatory States of \nthe Charter of the United Nations assumed the shared \nresponsibility of maintaining international peace and \nsecurity. They undertook to work together to prevent \nand remove threats to international security, to \nsuppress acts of aggression and to resolve, through \npeaceful means, disputes within and between States \nthat could lead to war. \n On the sixtieth anniversary of the creation of the \nUnited Nations peacekeeping bodies, it is important to \nremember the men and women who believe in those \nideals, who have dedicated themselves to the people of \nthe world, working tirelessly to promote peace and \nstability worldwide in dangerous war-torn zones with \nresolve, dedication and professionalism while always \nremaining impartial and neutral. \n However, in spite of all their work, we are still \nfar from attaining those goals and the United Nations \nhas not had a full impact on many international crises. \nThe reform of the United Nations in this context has \nthus become even more essential. Reform would enable \nthe United Nations to have the necessary strength to \nact, fully respecting the ideals and objectives that it set \nitself at its founding. \n The Republic of San Marino has always \nsupported the United Nations reform process and, in \nparticular, believes the process of the revitalization of \nthe General Assembly to be fundamental. Those \nreforms are necessary to reaffirm the role of the \nGeneral Assembly as the most representative body of \nthe United Nations.  \n The Republic of San Marino believes that the \nstrengthening of the General Assembly is of even \ngreater significance for, as a profoundly democratic \nbody of the United Nations, it currently represents the \nmost important forum in which a small State can be \nheard and bring its own contribution at the \ninternational level. \n Greater efficiency would make the General \nAssembly more complementary in its relations with the \nother main bodies of the United Nations, thus avoiding \nany duplication of activities and establishing \nmechanisms that would effectively implement the \nprovisions of resolutions adopted by the Assembly. \n The process of democratization within the bodies \nof the United Nations assumes fundamental importance \nfor a small State such as the Republic of San Marino. \nGreater representation and democratization of the \nOrganization\u2019s main bodies can guarantee States with \nsmall territories and populations the possibility of \nparticipating and having a larger role in the decision-\nmaking process within multilateral bodies. \n I am convinced that smaller States like San \nMarino can contribute in a fundamental way to the \nOrganization precisely because they do not have \nmacroeconomic, military or geopolitical interests. \n It is of parallel importance that small States \nestablish efficient forms of collaboration and \nconsultation in order to coordinate their actions so that \n \n \n43 08-51851 \n \ntheir voices can be adequately heard within \ninternational organizations.  \n In the framework of contacts with other small \nEuropean States, which are frequently renewed, \nincluding on the occasion of our participation in the \nwork of the General Assembly, San Marino has \npromoted a meeting with other small European States \nwith which it is already collaborating on specific \nhumanitarian projects, to consider other forms of \nmultilateral collaboration. \n Having participated with a group of small States \nin the financing of a UNICEF project for children \naffected by HIV in Gabon, this year the Republic of \nSan Marino, in concert with the private sector, is taking \npart in other UNICEF projects aimed, in particular, at \nprotecting the rights of disabled children. \n Strong involvement in the protection of children\u2019s \nrights has characterized relations between San Marino \nand UNICEF for many years. That commitment was \nfurther expressed last December through the \nparticipation of Their Excellencies the Captains Regent \nat the commemorative plenary meeting of the General \nAssembly on the follow-up to the outcome of the \nspecial session on children, an event that lent further \nimpetus to the States\u2019 activities and underscored the \nneed for their cooperation. \n Population growth, climate change and the spread \nof new diseases, as well as economic and financial \ninstability and armed conflicts, are seriously \nthreatening the achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). In particular, the subject \nof climate change has become a priority in the United \nNations agenda over the last two years because of its \nimpact on our habits and the future needs of all \ncountries without distinction. Those regions that are \nmost vulnerable due to their geographic position, as \nwell as developing countries, and small islands in \nparticular, are facing an even graver emergency \nsituation. \n In addition, the global food crisis and rising \nprices present a trend that is increasingly distressing. \nThe United Nations and the specialized agencies play a \ncentral role in confronting those emergencies. In \nparticular, the Republic of San Marino would like to \nexpress its full support to the High-Level Task Force \non the Global Food Security Crisis, established by the \nSecretary-General last April with the precise objective \nof coordinating all ongoing activities aimed at \nstemming the crisis. \n On the occasion of the opening of the fifty-\nsecond session of the Commission on the Status of \nWomen, the Secretary-General announced the launch \nof the campaign \u201cUnite to End Violence Against \nWomen\u201d. San Marino intends to work in support of that \ncampaign to protect the rights of women, which \nparallels a commitment undertaken during its \nchairmanship of the Committee of Ministers of the \nCouncil of Europe. \n I would like to add that the campaign to combat \nviolence against women was also carried out at the \nnational level, where we tried to raise public awareness \nof an issue too often ignored or underestimated. \nFollowing that initiative, the Parliament of San Marino \nrecently adopted a new law: the Prevention and \nRepression of Violence against Women and of Gender-\nBased Violence. It is a decisive and innovative legal \ninstrument for our country that provides for, inter alia, \nthe introduction of preventive measures addressing \nviolence against women and gender-based violence, as \nwell as the protection of victims during criminal \nproceedings. \n The Republic of San Marino also pays particular \nattention to the problems faced by persons with \ndisabilities and the protection of their rights. San \nMarino has in fact already ratified the International \nConvention on the Protection and Promotion of the \nRights and Dignity of Persons with Disabilities and its \nOptional Protocol.  \n The Republic of San Marino is pleased to \ncelebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights.  \n The Republic of San Marino has always been \ncommitted to the promotion of the principles of \npeaceful coexistence and the mutual respect between \nindividuals and peoples, in the knowledge that the \nunderstanding of others and mutual respect are the \nfundamental prerequisites of justice and peace. The \npromotion of intercultural dialogue is a concrete tool \nfor attaining those values and for affirming one of the \nguiding principles of the United Nations: peace \nfounded on justice and international cooperation. \n San Marino is committed to and continues to \nwork towards the promotion of intercultural dialogue, \nin particular in its religious dimension. At the regional \n  \n \n08-51851 44 \n \nlevel, in the context of its activities in the Council of \nEurope, San Marino this year coordinated the Council\u2019s \nfirst meeting on the religious dimension of intercultural \ndialogue, which was held on an experimental basis. \nRepresentatives of member States of the Council of \nEurope, religious leaders, experts and representatives \nof civil society participated in the meeting. The \ndevelopment of dialogue among and with religions at \nall levels of society makes a fundamental contribution \nto preventing tensions which may endanger the \npeaceful coexistence of peoples, as stressed at the \nhigh-level meeting on that subject promoted by the \nUnited Nations. \n In conclusion, I would like to wish the President \ngreat success in his important task and to assure him of \nour full support during the sixty-third session of the \nGeneral Assembly.

        "file_text": "I wish at the outset to discharge the \npleasant duty of conveying to you, Sir, the message of \nHis Excellency, Mr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, President \nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who is \nunable to attend and therefore asked me to convey to \nyou his sincerest congratulations on your election to \nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nthird session. He has no doubt that your great \nexperience, enriched by your skills and knowledge, \nwill allow you to fulfil the heavy responsibility that has \nbeen entrusted to you, to the satisfaction of all. \n I should also like to pay tribute to your \npredecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, and congratulate him \non the dedication and skill with which he fulfilled his \nmandate. Finally, I should like to pay due homage to \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon, whose reforming \nefforts, commitment and energy have enhanced the role \nof the United Nations and made it more credible to \nMember States and to international public opinion. \n This session is opening at a particularly difficult \nmoment for humanity. The international financial \ncrisis, the sharp rises in the cost of food, energy and \nfuel, and the effects of climate change are weakening \neconomies throughout the world, particularly those of \nthe developing countries. They are a threat to \ninternational peace and stability and therefore represent \na major challenge to which the community of nations \nmust respond in a concerted, decisive and tangible way. \n With regard in particular to the global food crisis \nand the sharp rise in food prices, the Democratic \nRepublic of Congo calls for new, innovative and urgent \naction to be taken beyond the recommendations made \nat the Rome Summit. We also endorse the appeal for \nthe mobilization of the resources necessary for the \nWorld Food Programme to implement its strategic plan \nand achieve its priority mission. We are firmly \nconvinced that human intelligence, which makes all \nscientific progress possible, should also allow us to \neliminate hunger throughout the world, provided that \nwe do so at the global level and that all States \ndemonstrate the necessary political will. It is on the \nbasis of that belief that the member countries of the \nEconomic Community of Central African States held a \nregional meeting in Kinshasa in July in order to rise to \nthe challenge posed to our subregion by the food crisis \nand the sharp rise in food costs. We made a frank \ndiagnosis, and concrete and urgent measures were \ntaken. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is \ndetermined to make an active contribution towards \nimplementing those measures.  \n Similarly, the United Nations environmental \nconventions that the Democratic Republic of the Congo \nratified include the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change, the United Nations \nConvention to Combat Desertification, the United \nNations Convention on Biological Diversity and the \nMontreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the \nOzone Layer. \n Home to 60 per cent of the forests of the Congo \nbasin, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is aware \nof the crucial role that it can play in controlling the \nglobal climate. It intends to assume that role in a fully \nresponsible way, provided that the international \ncommunity provides in exchange fair remuneration for \nthe environmental goods and services that are provided \nby the forests of Congo to all humankind. \n \n \n45 08-53141 \n \n The fact that the different crises are affecting \u2014 \nthough perhaps in different ways \u2014 all countries \nthroughout the world without exception clearly \ndemonstrates the futility of any claim to protective \nisolation. On the other hand, it demonstrates the \ncommon destiny of all humans and the justification for \nthe dialogue of religions, cultures and civilizations, \neach of which must be protected and respected as an \nintegral and irreplaceable part of the human heritage. \nWe therefore commend the maturity of those States that \nhave apologized or expressed regrets, and even offered \ncompensation for the harm caused to others by slavery, \ncolonization, aggressive behaviour or violations of \nfundamental human rights and the rights of peoples. \nThat will leave in the collective universal memory an \nindelible testimony to those who, in the name of a \ntransitory supremacy that scorned the true basic nature \nof the world, claimed eternal superiority and at one \npoint in history claimed to have a lasting moral right \nover weaker people. \n With the promise of a great future but weakened \nby years of bad government and war, the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo, thanks to the confidence of its \npeople and the sustained support of the international \ncommunity, has risen again as a State, a republic and a \ndemocracy. Indeed, following the success of our \nreunification and pacification efforts, and after \nexemplary presidential, legislative and provincial \nelections, the legitimate new authorities of our country \nlaunched a programme of reconstruction and are now \nready to organize urban, municipal and local elections \nin order to allow the people to choose their own local \nrepresentatives responsible for everyday affairs. \n The improvement, however, needs to be shored \nup urgently, because two territories in North Kivu, out \nof the 142 that make up the Republic, are still the scene \nof a dangerous security situation that could undermine \nall the investments that have been made towards the \nrebirth of the country. In fact, because of one of the \nnational armed groups, the Congr\u00e8s national pour la \nd\u00e9fense du peuple (CNDP), it has not yet been possible \nto enjoy the full benefits of the AMANI Forum \u2014 \n\u201cAmani\u201d means peace in Swahili \u2014 to implement the \nact of engagement signed at the Conference on Peace, \nSecurity and Development for the provinces of North \nand South Kivu, held in Goma from 6 to 25 January \n2008 at the initiative of the Head of State. On the \ncontrary, fighting has broken out again, which has \ncreated a massive displacement of populations and led \nto renewed violations of human rights. \n With regard to the Nairobi communiqu\u00e9, which \nwas the basis for resolving the problem of the harmful \npresence in the same region of the country of armed \nelements from the Forces d\u00e9mocratiques de lib\u00e9ration \ndu Rwanda (FDLR). That group continues to sow death \nand destruction despite the progress that has been made \nelsewhere. That progress includes, first, the \norganization of information and awareness-raising \nprogrammes for armed Rwandan groups in order to \nensure their voluntary participation in disarmament \nfollowed by their return to Rwanda, their country of \norigin, if they so wish, or to relocate them far from the \nborder between the Democratic Republic of the Congo \nand Rwanda, or outside Congolese territory; secondly, \nthe cantonment, disarmament and voluntary \nrepatriation to Rwanda of several dozen FDLR \nelements and their dependants; and, finally, the \ndeployment of special brigades of the Forces arm\u00edes de \nla Republique d\u00e9mocratique du Congo, who will work \nwith the United Nations Organization Mission in the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) to \ncompel, if necessary, reluctant FDLR elements to \naccept the disarmament, demobilization, reintegration \nand resettlement or repatriation programme and to \ncurtail their movements. \n In the face of a resurgence in violence, the Head \nof State has taken the initiative once again by \nreasserting the Government\u2019s support for the Goma act \nof engagement and the AMANI Forum as the best way \nto put an end to the presence of armed groups in North \nand South Kivu and for the Nairobi communiqu\u00e9 to \nresolve the problem of the FDLR. Under his initiatives, \na disengagement plan drawn up by MONUC has been \nadopted and a verification and monitoring mechanism \nis being developed. Accepted by the Government and \nthe armed groups, with the exception of the CNDP, the \nplan will come into force on 1 October and end 45 days \nlater. \n The Democratic Republic of the Congo calls \nupon the Security Council to support the plan and \nprovide MONUC with a clear mandate and adequate \nresources in order, if necessary, to impose peace and \nsecurity in that part of the Congolese territory. The \ncredibility of the United Nations and its peacekeeping \nmissions \u2014 of which that in the Congo is by far the \nlargest \u2014 are at stake. \n  \n \n08-53141 46 \n \n The human conscience cannot tolerate and the \npeople of Congo cannot understand how, despite \nhaving leaders legitimately elected by the people and \nwho enjoy international recognition, a small group \nshould be allowed to maintain a perpetual rebellion, \nentailing the rape of women and the loss of human life \non a massive scale. In the face of the tragedy in the \neastern Congo, MONUC should be authorized to act \nand be able to act convincingly. It is our firm belief \nthat there could be no more legitimate use of force or \ntimely exercise of the United Nations moral authority. \n In addition to the efforts made to eliminate \ninsecurity in the East of our country, the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo is seeking to strengthen the rule \nof law, consolidate democracy and ensure good \ngovernance. Justice is therefore one of the pillars of \nour policy. For approximately 10 years now, our \ncountry has witnessed millions of deaths, the direct or \nindirect victims of armed conflicts. Entire families \nhave been wiped out, mass graves abound, and \nviolence against women has reached unprecedented \nlevels. The country is trying to remedy the situation. \nFor that reason, we supported Security Council \nresolution 1820 (2008) on women and peace and \nsecurity, and we thank the Secretary-General for \nhaving placed the suffering of the women and girls of \nthe Congo high on his agenda and for the support he \nhas given us in that regard. \n What we need most of all, however, and what the \npeople of the Congo ardently desire and which we are \nduty-bound to guarantee to them is the right to justice. \nThat means neither more nor less than putting an end \nto impunity. How can we prevent recidivism and \ncopycat offences if, thanks to political horse-trading, \ncriminals are not prosecuted? How can we put an end \nto the rape of women and girls and other massive \nviolations of human rights if the warlords are exempt \nfrom legal prosecution because of their military \nstrength or capacity for doing great harm? The logic of \ncivilized society is specifically intended to counter the \nlaw of force with the force of the law. \n In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we \nhave experienced the unique role that justice plays as a \nfactor for national harmony and reconciliation, peace, \nsecurity and stability. It is thanks to justice that we \nhave been able to bring lasting peace to Ituri and North \nKatanga. It is with the support of justice that we intend \nto restore peace throughout our country. It will be \nnational justice preferably, international justice if \nnecessary, but justice in any case is a fundamental \nrequirement. It is in that context that we must place \nefforts to rehabilitate the national judicial system, and \nit is in the same framework that we are cooperating \nwith the International Criminal Court. \n The Democratic Republic of the Congo is also \ndoing its very best to meet the fundamental needs of its \npeople in the areas of healthcare, education, self-\nsufficiency in food, basic infrastructure, electricity, \ndrinking water for all and, of course, efforts to \ncounteract HIV/AIDS, malaria and, above all poverty. \nFive pillars have been established to that end. They \ninvolve infrastructure, employment, housing, education \nand health, and water and electricity. The complexity \nof those areas in a country as large as ours justifies the \nscope of the contributions we seek. The Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo is therefore open to any partner \nthat can help us meet the challenges of reconstruction \nand development. \n All peoples of the world aspire to peace; hence \nthe need for international and regional mechanisms and \ninstruments for peacekeeping and conflict prevention \nand settlement. Therefore, the Democratic Republic of \nthe Congo welcomes the fact that the Secretary-\nGeneral has accepted our request to establish a United \nNations Peacebuilding Office for Central Africa. We \nare convinced that the Office will promote greater \ncloseness and coordination between the United Nations \nand the countries of the region. The issues of peace, \nsecurity, humanitarian aid and development will be \nconsidered expeditiously and treated with the urgency \nthat they merit. \n In more global terms, we continue to support the \nefforts of the Organization in its various efforts to \npromote peace, security, human rights, gender equality \nand development. In that context, we call for \naccelerated reform of the United Nations and the \nSecurity Council, because achieving our dreams in the \nface of current and future challenges depends on it. The \nUnited Nations must change and adapt itself to meeting \nthe new challenges of armed conflict, globalization, the \nlack of financial resources adequate to the breadth of \nits missions, pandemics, terrorism, and the need to \nbuttress the system of collective security, particularly \nby enlarging the number of decision-makers in terms of \ninternational peace and security and by ensuring a \nmore balanced and fair representation of the world in \nthe Security Council. That is an indispensable \ndemocratic requirement for the proper and effective \n \n \n47 08-53141 \n \nfunctioning of the United Nations system. In that \nregard, the African continent should be represented as a \npermanent member of the Security Council. \n Furthermore, the need for Security Council \nreform should not obscure the need to review other \nbodies of the United Nations system, particularly the \nEconomic and Social Council and the Secretariat. The \nsame applies to the working methods of the other \ncouncils and the International Court of Justice, which \nneed to be revised, while their interaction with bodies \nyet to be created must be better identified and \ndelineated. Similarly, efforts to revitalize the work of \nthe General Assembly should continue and its authority \nstrengthened in order to allow its President to play a \nkey role in finding solutions to international problems. \n It is said that nature only poses threats to \nhumankind that its creativity is capable of addressing. \nDespite our differences, the time has come to put our \nindividual imaginations together to ensure that the keys \nof the global economy are not left to out-and-out \ncapitalism. We should instead use the universal values \nof justice, solidarity and altruism to promote peace and \ninternational security. We believe that, together, we can \nprovide a better future for humanity so long as we \nwork every day to achieve the ideals of our universal \norganization. \n I wish every success to this sixty-third session of \nthe General Assembly.

        "file_text": "At the outset, Saint Vincent and the \nGrenadines expresses its solidarity with the people of \nCuba, Haiti, Jamaica and the United States of America, \nwho have been savagely battered in quick succession \nby Hurricanes Gustav, Hanna and Ike. Within the \nCaribbean and our America, the heroism, bravery and \nresilience of the Cuban, Haitian and Jamaican people \nand ordinary Americans are a well-documented source \nof pride to us all. We wish you all, the afflicted nations \nand peoples, a speedy recovery, and we stand with you \nin your rebuilding efforts. \n Allow me to express my pleasure in noting that \nthe presidency of the General Assembly is now held by \na man whose native shores are kissed by the \nmagnificent Caribbean Sea. I am comforted by the \nknowledge that he has a full appreciation of the \n  \n \n08-52272 34 \n \nmajesty of our landscape and seascape, the \nopportunities and challenges facing our region, and the \nnobility of our Caribbean civilization. Mr. President, \nyour dream that another world is possible, as \ncourageously outlined in your inaugural presidential \nstatement, is both timely and prescient. I \nwholeheartedly endorse your call for frankness, \ndemocratization and a focus on the needs of the poor, \nall under the redemptive and transformative rubric of \nlove and solidarity with our fellow human beings. \n It is in that spirit of love and frankness that I \ncome before the Assembly today. In all candour, I must \naffirm what you, Mr. President, have already \nconcluded: that the United Nations, as the supreme \nmultilateral institution of a profoundly troubled and \niniquitous world, can and must do more, in the form of \ndecisive action, to improve the condition of our planet, \nthe living conditions of the less fortunate and the safety \nof our global family. \n The late Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia once \nstated: \n \u201cThroughout history, it has been the inaction of \nthose who could have acted, the indifference of \nthose who should have known better, the silence \nof the voice of justice when it mattered most that \nhas made it possible for evil to triumph.\u201d \n There can be no doubt that the right-thinking and \ncivilized peoples of the world are aware of the \nchallenges facing us and of the path to peace, \nprosperity, and progress upon which we must \ncollectively embark. However, the work that we have \nentrusted to the United Nations is compromised by \napathy and inaction by too many of us and by the \ncrippling pursuit of narrow self-interest by a handful of \npowerful countries. In this session, we have an historic \nopportunity to reassert the relevance and credibility of \nthis body by keeping the promises that we have made \nto ourselves and the world. \n The United Nations is charged with tackling the \nweighty problems that beset the world, not with the \nrefinement of the art of impotent diplomacy. I have no \ndoubt that the principles concealed in the language of \n\u201cmandate review\u201d, \u201csystem-wide coherence\u201d and \n\u201crevitalization\u201d are important, and doubly so to the \nprofessional diplomats who look inward rather than \noutward and who lose sight of the forest for the trees in \ntheir endless quest to choreograph the dancing of ever \nmore angels on the head of a pin.  \n One year ago, I stood at this very podium and \ndenounced the failure of the international community \nto end the genocide in Darfur. One year ago, there were \npromising, though belated, signs that the United \nNations was finally beginning to act decisively in this \nregard. One year ago, I stated that \u201cthe force on the \nground is still insufficient, its mandate is ambiguous \nand its emerging presence is years too late\u201d \n(A/62/PV.10, p. 15). Today, one year later, I am \nshocked by our collective failures in Darfur. Last \nmonth, Force Commander Martin Luther Agwai \ncompared his role to that of a boxer in the ring with his \nhands tied behind his back, because his promised force \nof 26,000 personnel is still less than 10,000 strong.  \n I thus reflect as to whether our promises of \n\u201cnever again\u201d and our commitments to the memories of \none million Rwandans mean anything, as the blood of \nhundreds of thousands of Africans again stains the soil \nof the continent and our collective conscience. As a \npeople whose past and future are inextricably \ninterwoven with the continent, we, the citizens of Saint \nVincent and the Grenadines, ask ourselves, in the \nwords of the Caribbean Nobel Laureate from Saint \nLucia, Derek Walcott, \u201cHow can I face such slaughter \nand be cool?! How can I turn from Africa and live?\u201d \nThe conflict in Darfur is over five years old, and the \ntime has long since past for genuine international \naction to halt that unspeakable human tragedy. \n While I congratulate the General Assembly on \nfinally clearing the way towards intergovernmental \nnegotiations on Security Council reform, it cannot be \nan illusory or insincere process. The credibility of the \ndecisions made by the United Nations in the name of \npeace and security hinges on the existence of a \nSecurity Council that is democratic and representative \nof the regional and development diversity of our body. \n As we are all well aware, the scarcities and \nescalating prices of basic foodstuffs have already led to \nriots and political instability worldwide and within our \nown Caribbean Community. While Saint Vincent and \nthe Grenadines has confronted the crisis with a creative \nnational food production plan that mixes agricultural \nincentives with education and assistance, our local \nmeasures are only ameliorative and cannot totally \ninsulate us from what is largely an imported problem.  \n We are again buffeted by the winds of unequal \ntrade liberalization, in which the agricultural subsidies \nof developed States force our own nascent \n \n \n35 08-52272 \n \nagro-industries into an uncompetitive demise. We are \nwitness to a world where crops are grown to feed cars \nwhile people starve, and where climate change ruins \nage-old farming and fishing livelihoods. The so-called \nfood crisis that we now face is but a symptom of \ndeeper structural flaws in our global economic system \nand consumerist culture. It represents the human face \nat the confluence of countless systemic flaws and \npoorly conceived strategies, including trade barriers, \nthe mad rush to biofuels, adverse climate changes and \nanaemic development assistance. Any meaningful \nattempt to alleviate the suffering of the poor and \nhungry people of the world must start with those \nsystemic issues and resist the urge to treat the \nsymptoms while ignoring the disease and its causes. \n The banana farmers of Saint Vincent and the \nGrenadines continue their heroic struggles to eke out a \nliving in the face of international corporate greed, \nthinly disguised as principled globalization. Our \nfarmers, tradesmen and private sector are still waiting \nfor the oft-promised opportunities that supposedly \naccompany globalization. However, the evidence to \ndate suggests that the international community has \ninadvertently institutionalized and entrenched poverty \nwithin a system of global winners and losers. The \nironically titled Doha Development Round looks less \nand less like a negotiating process and more and more \nlike a suicide pact within which the World Trade \nOrganization (WTO) and the major economic Powers \nwant everything and concede little or nothing to the \npoor and developing nations of the world.  \n The solutions to our economic crises hinge upon \ngenuine negotiation and compromise in the interests of \nthe world\u2019s least privileged. We are ill-served by \nbenign neglect, unequal enforcement and concepts of \nwelfare colonialism. The recent troubles in the world\u2019s \npremier financial and banking countries exacerbate the \nprofound challenges facing developing nations. \n Six years ago, world leaders gathered in Mexico \nand gave birth to the Monterrey Consensus, in which \nthey pledged their objective to eradicate poverty, \nachieve sustained economic growth and promote \nsustainable development as we advance to a fully \ninclusive and equitable global economic system. I \nprayed at the time that the Conference would not \ndevolve into a dragon\u2019s dance upon a decorous \nplatform of the finest diplomatic language which few \nare determined to embrace for action.  \n Six years later, Monterrey is remembered as the \nsite of grand, unfulfilled commitments to the \ndeveloping world, much as Africa recalls the empty \npromises of Gleneagles. The four decade-old promise \nto devote 0.7 per cent of gross national income to \nofficial development assistance remains more illusion \nthan reality. Countries like ours are therefore forced to \nscour the globe for friends willing to partner with us \nfor the development of our people, while others would \nrather sit in judgement of our development decisions \nand priorities than rise to offer a helping hand.  \n Saint Vincent and the Grenadines once again \npleads with the international community to be \ncognizant of the plight of Taiwan\u2019s 23 million people. \nEven though the United Nations historical neglect of \nthe Taiwan issue has not been a source of pride, the \nGovernment of Taiwan has acted responsibly and \nwithout confrontation to subordinate many of its \nlegitimate political claims into efforts aimed at \nreducing cross-Strait tensions, promoting peace and \nbuilding relations with the People\u2019s Republic of China.  \n The United Nations must now act to ensure the \nsurvival of that fledgling rapprochement. Taiwan \nshould be encouraged on its path to peace by \npermitting its meaningful participation in the \nspecialized agencies of the United Nations. Much as \nTaiwan\u2019s vibrant economy is recognized through its \nparticipation in WTO, there is no compelling reason \nwhy its equally vibrant people should be denied \nparticipation in the World Health Organization and \nother specialized agencies. \n The Caribbean is in the midst of its annual \nhurricane season and the awesome winds, sea surges \nand torrential rains of Gustav, Hanna and Ike have \nbrought the issue of climate change into sharp relief. It \nis a matter of life and death to the people of the \nCaribbean and other small island developing States. \nSimilarly, the cost of adaptation to the changes \nwrought by our industrialized brothers and sisters must \nbe borne adequately and responsibly by those who \nhave so profoundly altered our global environment.  \n Hurricanes remind us in the Caribbean of our \nexistential oneness. Accordingly, the effort of \nCaribbean nations to fashion a more perfect union is to \nbe fully supported as a vital strategic necessity. \n The geographic happenstance that has placed the \ninnocent people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in \nthe path of increasingly intense storms has also located \n  \n \n08-52272 36 \n \nus unfortunately between the supply and demand that \nfuel much of the West\u2019s narcotics trade. As a result, our \nscarce resources are increasingly being diverted to \nstem the tide of drugs and small arms flowing through \nour region.  \n To the people of Saint Vincent and the \nGrenadines, disarmament means not the eradication of \nnuclear weapons, which we lack the will and resources \nto build, but the elimination of small arms, which \nthreaten to shoot holes in the fabric of our democracy \nand compromise the values of our civilization. We are \nassailed by guns, which we do not build, and by deadly \nnarcotics such as cocaine, which we do not produce. \nThe United Nations must act to protect the innocent \nvictims of the world from the scourge of small arms \nand light weapons. \n In recent months, I have been profoundly \ntroubled by the creeping return of cold war rhetoric to \nthe language of international and hemispheric \ndiscourse. In this globalized and interconnected world, \nit is no longer possible to divide the planet into \ncompeting hemispheres or to completely quarantine or \nindeed blockade ideological foe from friend. We must \nguard against the return of discarded philosophies and \nlearn from the recent past, in which developing \ncountries were used as pawns and proxies for the \nhegemonic ambitions of others.  \n Our multipolar experiment is too young for the \ndeveloping and globalizing world to return to the old \nrhetoric and recriminations that invariably blossom \ninto violence and death, most often visited on the \npeoples of developing countries. It is my sincere prayer \nthat this body will hew more closely to the principles \nof multilateralism and the sovereign equality of all \nStates, and resist any pressures for the United Nations \nto devolve into a playground for the triumphalist \nambitions of presumptive super-Powers. \n Mr. President, you sit at the helm of a body \nentrusted with the well-being and safekeeping of \nhumanity. We have gradually strayed from the noblest \nof our goals and increasingly paid only lip service to \nproblems that are well within our ability to solve. In \ncountless spheres, we have promised action. Let us \nnow keep those promises for the good of our global \nfamily. \n The poetic summation of the American poet \nRobert Frost is apt: \n\u201cI shall be telling this with a sigh  \nSomewhere ages and ages hence:  \nTwo roads diverged in a wood, and I \u2014  \nI took the one less travelled by,  \nand that has made all the difference.\u201d \nLet us choose with courage the road less travelled by. \nEach of us can make a difference, accordingly.

        "file_text": "I wish to begin by joining \nthose who have congratulated Mr. d\u2019Escoto Brockmann \non his election as President of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-third session. My delegation is confident that, \nunder his able stewardship, the General Assembly will \nmake progress on many issues scheduled for discussion \nduring the current session. I would also like to pay \nspecial tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Kerim, who \nsuccessfully presided over the General Assembly at its \nsixty-second session.  \n The focus of our discussions at the present \nsession, namely, the impact of the global food crisis on \npoverty and hunger in the world, as well as the need to \ndemocratize the United Nations, relates well to our \nMillennium Development Goals. For us in the \ndeveloping world, the eradication of poverty is the first \n \n \n11 08-51851 \n \nof our priorities and should indeed continue to receive \nserious attention. \n The current global food crisis, characterized by \nescalating food prices, is causing untold suffering for \nthe majority of poor people in many developing \ncountries. That has been compounded by the energy \ncrisis, with devastating social and economic \nconsequences, especially for the most vulnerable in \nsociety such as women, children, the elderly and \npeople living with HIV and AIDS. The crisis now \nqualifies as a humanitarian emergency that requires \nglobal solidarity to provide post-haste assistance in the \nform of food, water and energy. \n For most developing countries, the crisis is \ncompeting with other pressing demands for scarce \nresources for development, including achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), especially as \nwe are faced with declining official development \nassistance and foreign direct investment. The trend \nwill, regrettably, reverse some of the progress made \ntowards the attainment of the MDGs. It is therefore \ncrucial that national efforts aimed at addressing the \nglobal food and energy crises be complemented by \nappropriate international assistance and interventions, \nincluding debt cancellation for low-income, \nfood-deficient developing countries so as to release \nmore resources to fight hunger.  \n Adequate support for food production \nprogrammes is absolutely necessary. We call for more \nresearch into better seed varieties and assistance in \nirrigation technology and improved water harvesting \nmethods, necessary to mitigate the effects of climate \nchange on agriculture. Zimbabwe believes that the \nchallenges of climate change should be addressed in \nthe context of development programmes that recognize \nthe three pillars of economic and social thrusts, as well \nas environmental protection. \n In the past year, Zimbabwe is proud to have \nplayed its modest part in promoting sustainable \ndevelopment through its chairmanship of the sixteenth \nsession of the United Nations Commission on \nSustainable Development. The session examined the \nobstacles and barriers to development in the areas of \nagriculture, land use and rural development, and to \ndrought-mitigation measures and desertification \nprevention in Africa. My Government, which was an \nactive participant at the High-Level Conference on \nWorld Food Security, held under the auspices of the \nFood and Agriculture Organization in Rome in June \nthis year, will continue to play its active role in \nformulating policy recommendations on the subject of \nsustainable development targets. \n We share the view that trade is an important tool \nfor development, and so we reiterate our call for an \nopen, rule-based, predictable and non-discriminatory \ntrading and financial system that seeks the removal of \nthe main trade barriers. Tariffs have unfortunately \nremained high on goods from developing economies, \nsuch as textiles and farm products. It is therefore \ndisturbing that the Doha Round negotiations have \ncollapsed without any indication of when they will be \nreconvened. \n The objectives of the Charter of the \nUnited Nations in the economic arena will remain \nunfulfilled unless all Member States genuinely and \nseriously participate in efforts to redress challenges \nthat persist in developing countries. Social justice, \npolitical stability and sustainable development in most \ndeveloping countries can best be achieved through \ngenuine and committed support for empowerment \nprogrammes through, inter alia, just land ownership \npatterns. We understand only too well in our context \nthat sustainable development is not possible without \nagrarian reform.  \n My Government has therefore gone a long way \ntowards laying the foundation for sustainable food \nproduction through its land reform programme. The \nmajority of our rural people have been empowered to \ncontribute to household and national food security and, \nindeed, to be masters of their own destiny. However, \nthe effects of climate change, which have included \nrecurrent droughts and floods in the past seven years, \nand the illegal, unilaterally imposed sanctions on my \ncountry have hindered Zimbabwe\u2019s efforts to increase \nfood production. Once again, I appeal to the world\u2019s \ncollective conscience to apply pressure for the \nimmediate removal of those sanctions by Britain, the \nUnited States and their allies, which have brought \nuntold suffering to my people. \n Zimbabwe has always been and continues to be a \nfirm believer in multilateral approaches to solving \ndisputes, as opposed to the unilateralism favoured by \nsome countries. Our experience has shown that the \ncooperative and pacific approach often leads to lasting \nsolutions to conflicts. We therefore deplore the \nvindictive approach, which is often characterized by \n  \n \n08-51851 12 \n \nself-righteous finger-pointing, double standards and the \nimposition of unilateral sanctions, to coerce smaller \nand weaker countries to bow to the wishes of militarily \nstronger States. \n In addition, the unilateral and coercive economic \nmeasures that we have witnessed in recent years are \nagain completely at cross purposes with the principles \nthat guide international cooperation, as enshrined in the \nCharter of the United Nations. \n Not long ago, some permanent members of the \nSecurity Council sought to invoke Chapter VII of the \nCharter of the United Nations so that its weight of \nsanctions and other measures could be applied against \nmy small country, which, by any stretch of the \nimagination, is no threat to international peace and \nsecurity. What insanity is this that has afflicted some \nworld leaders? Should that sacred document, the \nCharter of the United Nations, be allowed to suffer \nsuch undeserved emasculation and disgraceful abuse? \nAnd where is the protection of small and innocent \ncountries like mine from threatened and real acts of \naggression and punitive acts, often based on \ncompletely false allegations of violations of the rule of \nlaw, democracy or human rights? By the way, those \nwho falsely accuse us of those violations are \nthemselves international perpetrators of genocide and \nmass destruction. \n The innocent masses of men, women and children \nwho have perished in their thousands in Iraq surely \ndemand retribution and vengeance. Who shall heed \ntheir cry? Surely those who invaded Iraq under false \npretences and on the strength of contrived lies and in \ncomplete violation of the Charter of the United Nations \nand international law must be made liable for them. \nThey must be made to answer for their acts of \naggression. \n Zimbabwe derives solace from the fact that there \nare some permanent members of the Security Council \nthat have taken principled stands in defending the \nCharter and protecting our sovereignty by ensuring that \nthe Council acts not only within its mandate, but also \nimpartially, objectively and justly. Indeed, their sense \nof justice ensured that Zimbabwe \u2014 a country that \nposes no threat to regional or international peace \u2014 did \nnot fall prey to the cocktail of lies and machinations \nthat had been designed by our detractors to encourage \nUnited Nations sanctions against us under Chapter VII. \nWe thank them for upholding truth and objectivity.  \n While we recognize the important role of the \ngood offices of the Secretary-General in helping \nMember States to resolve political and other problems, \nwe are of the view that international civil servants \nshould discharge their noble duties with sensitivity and \nneutrality. At no time should they seek to pander to the \nwhims and caprices of the mighty against the weak. \nSimilarly, we call on certain Security Council members \nto desist from abusing the Secretariat in an attempt to \npromote their political interests. It is our firm belief \nthat the Secretary-General and his staff should be \nallowed to serve all Member States without fear or \nfavour. \n We reiterate our long-held view that the Security \nCouncil as presently constituted is undemocratic. Its \npresent configuration renders it subject to manipulation \nby the powerful countries that use the Council as a \nreadily available legitimizing forum for their political \nmachinations. Thus, it is imperative that the Security \nCouncil be democratized by ensuring equitable \ngeographical representation through an increase in its \nmembership. Zimbabwe remains steadfast in its \nsupport for the Ezulwini Consensus, which calls for \nAfrica to have two permanent seats with the same \npowers and prerogatives as the current permanent \nmembers, as well as two non-permanent seats. \n We share the view that the General Assembly, a \nbody that represents all of us and enjoys a wider \nrepresentation of States, must continue to be the \nsupreme decision-making body of the United Nations. \nWe call for its revitalization to make it more effective \nand to enable it to fully carry out its Charter mandate. \nIt is our fervent hope that a revitalized General \nAssembly will reassert its prestige, its pre-eminent \nrole, its authority and its capacity to guide and direct \nother organs of the United Nations system. In that \ncontext, the tendency of some members of the Security \nCouncil to usurp the power and mandates of the \nGeneral Assembly must be resisted. \n I am pleased to report that the inter-party talks in \nZimbabwe \u2014 for which our regional grouping, the \nSouthern African Development Community (SADC), \nappointed a facilitator \u2014 ended with the signing of an \nagreement on the formation of an all-inclusive \nGovernment on 15 September. That was achieved \nentirely through African mediation, which is clear \ntestimony that Africa is capable of overcoming its own \nchallenges and problems, which, by the way, are often \nthe remnants of colonialism. African leaders, working \n \n \n13 08-51851 \n \ntogether, were able to find an African solution to an \nAfrican problem. In that regard, I wish to pay special \ntribute to President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, \nwhose patience, fortitude, sensitivity, diplomatic skills \nand painstaking work made it possible for the \nZimbabwean parties to overcome what had appeared to \nbe insurmountable and intractable difficulties in \nreaching an agreement. \n I would like to extend my thanks to SADC, the \nAfrican Union and individual African and other leaders \nwho lent their support to that initiative. My party, the \nZimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front, will \nabide by the spirit and letter of the agreement to which \nwe have appended our signature. As the Government, \nwe are prepared to cooperate with all other countries \nthat respect Zimbabwe\u2019s sovereignty. I would therefore \nlike to appeal to those members of the international \ncommunity that have imposed illegal sanctions against \nZimbabwe to lift them so that my country can focus \nundisturbed on its economic turnaround programme. \n In conclusion, we hope that we will continue to \nshape an Organization that upholds universal values \nand interests, attends to the urgent needs of those in \nneed and remains in the service of humanity. Long live \nthe United Nations!  "

        "file_text": "I warmly greet and congratulate the members of the \nAssembly as we begin our work at the sixty-third \nsession.  \n First of all, I would like to convey to \nrepresentatives and the peoples of their countries the \nwishes for peace and prosperity of His Excellency \nGurbanguly Berdymukhammedov, President of \nTurkmenistan. Allow me to congratulate the esteemed \nPresident, Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, on his \nelection to that high and responsible post and to wish \nhim success in organizing the fruitful work of the \nGeneral Assembly at this sixty-third session. Allow me \nalso to thank Mr. Srgjan Kerim for his successful \nleadership of the Assembly at its previous session and \nfor his active collaboration with the delegations. \n The United Nations, which is mandated to discuss \nand resolve issues relating to the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security, is currently at one of \nthe most critical moments in its history. That is \nespecially evident against the background of current \ndevelopments at the global and regional levels. The \ndiversity of contemporary challenges and threats calls \nfor the adequate preparation of a whole range of \napproaches to prevent them through cooperation among \nall Member States.  \n Today, we need solid measures to counter and \nfight such global challenges as international terrorism, \nhuman trafficking, organized crime, illegal drug \ntrafficking and the threat of the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction. We are also witnessing \nthe effects of climate change and environmental \ndegradation. On top of that, the world community is \nfacing global issues relating to energy and food \nsecurity. \n Turkmenistan is a principled and active \nparticipant in the process to identify joint actions \naimed at resolving the most pressing problems of our \ntime. In that context, we regard the need to intensify \ninternational action to ensure peace and security as a \npriority task. The fight against terrorism is one of the \nmost important aspects of that problem. \n Turkmenistan, as a party to major United Nations \ninstruments to combat international terrorism and \norganized crime, supports the Organization\u2019s efforts to \ndevelop a global strategy to fight terrorism and stands \nready to provide its practical assistance to the \ninternational community in that regard. \n The non-proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction is a pressing issue on the international \nagenda that is connected with ensuring peace and \nsecurity. Our country plays an active role in identifying \nnon-proliferation measures and takes practical steps for \ntheir implementation at the national and international \nlevels. As a party to the Treaty on the \n  \n \n08-53135 4 \n \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and other very \nimportant international legal instruments in that sphere, \nTurkmenistan has joined international initiatives aimed \nat preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction. \n In that connection, the signing of the Treaty on a \nNuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia, which was \nprepared and adopted under the aegis of the United \nNations in 2006, has become an important element in \nthe efforts of the world community to resolve the issue. \n Today, we must all take a fresh look at the \nexisting system for maintaining international peace and \nsecurity. The current situation and emerging trends call \nfor an adequate approach and the formulation of \ncomprehensive measures, and the community of \nnations should take part in their implementation. I am \nconfident that ongoing discussions and deliberations at \nthis session will provide us with an opportunity to take \nstock of the entire panorama of the contemporary \nworld through the prism of ensuring a safe life for \nStates and peoples.  \n Undoubtedly, the General Assembly will help to \nconsolidate efforts of Member States for the effective \nimplementation of such measures. Turkmenistan \nsupports close cooperation with the United Nations in \nadopting comprehensive measures for collective \ninteraction to address the most pressing issues of our \ntimes. In that connection, we believe it necessary to \nconsider qualitatively new factors in ensuring security.  \n Energy security has become an integral \ncomponent of the global security system. The \navailability and accessibility of fuel and energy \nresources, their free delivery to international markets \nand effective use by consumers have become major \nfactors in the development of the world economy as a \nwhole.  \n As a major oil and natural gas producer, \nTurkmenistan holds a prominent place in the global \nenergy system. In that connection, we take a highly \nresponsible approach to developing international \ncooperation on the basis of our national interests and \nthe needs of our partners. Turkmenistan\u2019s policy, of \ndiversifying supplies of hydrocarbon materials and \nensuring energy security has become an important \nfactor in that approach. It is apparent that major \ninvestments are needed to develop an effective and \nstable system of global energy security and that a \nconsiderable share of those investments should be \ndirected towards the transportation of hydrocarbons \nand the protection of energy infrastructure. In order to \nensure adequate supplies to the world energy markets, \nwe will also need a highly developed infrastructure of \ninternational pipeline networks. \n At the same time, ensuring energy security is not \nsimply a matter of increasing the pace of hydrocarbon \nextraction, developing new deposits or expanding the \ninfrastructure for transporting and delivering energy \nsupplies to end users. We must take into account other \nfactors of that system, such as political stability, the \nsituation in world markets and the presence of security \nguarantees for international pipelines.  \n Adequate security for energy infrastructure \nfacilities also implies a decrease in their vulnerability \nto the impact of natural and man-made disasters, \npotential risks connected to changes in the military and \npolitical situation in certain regions of the world, \nthreats from international terrorists, and the \nunauthorized siphoning of transported energy \nresources. Such problems often interrupt or reduce \nsupplies of fuel, in particular oil and natural gas, and \nresult in major financial losses and higher prices for \nenergy supplies, with a negative impact on the \ndevelopment of the world economy. \n Therefore, it has become increasingly urgent to \ncoordinate the efforts of States to establish a unified \nsystem of energy security. To that end, we must \ndevelop an appropriate international legal framework \nand effective partnership mechanisms, including for \nthe protection of energy transportation systems. It \nappears that this problem affects us all, be they energy \nproducers, transit countries or consumers. \n On that basis, Turkmenistan has launched an \ninitiative aimed at elaborating, under United Nations \nauspices, a unique document defining the legal basis \nand security guarantees for the functioning of \ninternational pipelines. As a preliminary step towards \nimplementing that initiative, Turkmenistan has \nprepared a draft resolution on the reliability of energy \ntransit and its role in ensuring stable economic \ndevelopment and international cooperation, which is \nbeing proposed for consideration at the sixty-third \nsession of the Assembly. Support for that draft \nresolution may provide a good stepping stone for the \nfuture and demonstrate the principled readiness of the \nworld community seriously to resolve those issues. In \nthat context, Turkmenistan is prepared to organize in \n \n \n5 08-53135 \n \n2009 an international conference on that problem under \nUnited Nations auspices in Ashgabat, our country\u2019s \ncapital. \n This year has witnessed an important event in the \nlife of Central Asia that, I believe, may have a \nconsiderable positive impact on the situation in the \nregion. I mean by that the commencement of the \nfunctioning of the United Nations Regional Centre for \nPreventive Diplomacy for Central Asia. The \ninauguration of the Centre gave an impetus to the new \nstage of strategic partnership of Central Asian \ncountries with the United Nations in undertaking a set \nof measures aimed at preventing conflicts and \neliminating their underlying causes. \n We consider the inauguration of the Centre as \ntestimony of the great attention that the world \ncommunity devotes to the processes occurring in \nCentral Asia, clear understanding of the role and \nimportance of our region in global international affairs \nand a desire to provide utmost positive assistance in \ntackling regional problems. In the long run, that \nactivity will be aimed at achieving the long-term goal \nof ensuring the security, stability and sustainable \ndevelopment of the States and peoples of the Central \nAsian region. \n Moreover, we believe that close interaction of \nneighbouring countries is one of the most decisive \nfactors. In that context, by closely adhering to its \ninternational obligations as a permanently neutral \nState, Turkmenistan stands for developing good-\nneighbourly cooperation with all the countries of the \nregion. \n In that connection, Turkmenistan provides \neconomic and humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan \nand actively supports the efforts of the international \ncommunity to restore peaceful life in that fraternal \ncountry. We would like to see Afghanistan as a \npeaceful and prosperous nation, a good neighbour and \npartner of all the States in the region. \n The issue of the Caspian Sea has acquired special \nrelevance in the context of regional stability and \neconomic cooperation. Moreover, its comprehensive \nconsideration envisages the solution of problems \nrelating to the establishment of an international legal \nbasis for cooperation, as well as large-scale \ndevelopment of the geo-economic potential of the \nCaspian region as a major energy basin and \ntransportation crossroads between East and West, \nSouth and North. For some States in the region that do \nnot have direct access to international sea \ncommunications, the Caspian Sea is the most important \nroute to the world markets. \n In that regard, effective activity in the Caspian \nSea is directly linked to the enhancement of security in \nthe adjacent region. Turkmenistan advocates that the \nCaspian area should be a zone of peace, stability and \neffective international cooperation on the basis of \nmutual respect and a partnership of equality. \n Being an integral part of the international \ncommunity, Turkmenistan sees its future in the \ndevelopment of a truly democratic society, in which \nevery individual person, his or her rights and freedoms \nand the all-round development of his or her potential \nrepresent the main value and measure of the country\u2019s \nprogress. Just a few days ago, Turkmenistan witnessed \na major political event \u2014 the adoption of the new \nversion of its constitution, which laid down the legal \nbasis for the development of national statehood and the \nfurther democratization of social life. In particular, the \nconstitution considerably broadens the powers of the \nparliament as the country\u2019s main legislative body. In \naddition, it expands the role of local bodies of \ngovernment and self-government, in whose work \ncitizens take an active part on a broad representative \nbasis.  \n Democratization is a natural process of \ndevelopment of any State and society, and in that \nconnection, the strengthening of a democratic, secular \nand law-based State is our own conscientious sovereign \ndecision, and we will steadfastly follow this course. \n The foreign policy of Turkmenistan is determined \nby the national interests of our State and its people, and \nits main goal is civilized development on the basis of \npositive integration into global political and economic \nprocesses. Therefore, cooperation with the United \nNations is the strategic direction of our foreign policy, \nand the principles enshrined in the United Nations \nCharter serve for us as the basis for the development of \nTurkmenistan\u2019s relations with other States. \n We view the United Nations as a universal \ninternational organization, serving as the main \nguarantor of the global security system and the \nframework of the present and future world order. We \nadvocate that international law and the United Nations \nCharter and their principles of respect for the \nsovereignty of every nation and its choice of its own \n  \n \n08-53135 6 \n \nway of development and non-interference in internal \naffairs should remain the basis of the world order and \nthe alpha and omega of relations among nations. \n On that basis, Turkmenistan determines its view \nto its partnership with the United Nations and states its \ninterest in strengthening and expanding its role in the \nsystem of international relations, especially with regard \nto the consolidation of the efforts of Member States to \nensure peace and security on Earth.

        "file_text": "\u201c[We] will not enjoy development without security, we \nwill not enjoy security without development, and we \nwill not enjoy either without respect for human rights\u201d \n(A/59/2005, para. 17). In this year when we celebrate \nthe sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights, that fundamental observation by former \nSecretary-General Kofi Annan continues to be as \nrelevant as ever, and it must continue to guide our \nactions and those of our Organization and our \nGovernments. \n I should like briefly to recall the two high-level \nevents that we have attended in the past few days: that \non Africa\u2019s development needs and that on the \nMillennium Development Goals. Those meetings \nshowed that some progress has been made \u2014 and there \nhas been unquestionable progress that must be \nacknowledged: for example, we have seen a drop of \n400 million in the number of people living in extreme \npoverty, a drop of 27 per cent in the mortality rate of \nchildren under the age of five, increased investments in \neducation and health and progress regarding gender \nequality. But they also emphasized the absolute need to \nstrengthen our efforts if we want to achieve the goals \nthat we set ourselves by consensus in 2000, all the \nmore since the rise in food and fuel prices and the \nslowing of the world economy that we have seen in \nrecent months threaten our achievements. \n \n \n41 08-52265 \n \n Luxembourg has resolutely focussed its \ncooperation policy on the eradication of poverty, \nparticularly in the least developed countries. Its actions \nare conceived in the spirit of sustainable development, \nincluding its social, economic and environmental \naspects, with men, women and children at their core. \nToday, my country spends 0.92 per cent of its gross \nnational income on official development assistance, \nand we expect to continue on that track in order to \nachieve the goal of 1 per cent in the coming years. \nTogether with others, we shall invest our efforts to \nensure that the commitments entered into 2005 at the \nEuropean level are fully respected at the Doha \nConference on Financing for Development.  \n While establishing a true development \npartnership must be based on shared responsibilities by \ndonor and recipient countries, and while we are \ncounting on strengthened action by developing \ncountries with regard to good governance, the rule of \nlaw, capacity-building and ownership of their own \ndevelopment, respect by developed countries of their \ncommitments regarding the quality and quantity of \nassistance is an important basis for such a partnership, \nparticularly with respect to Africa. Nevertheless, I \nwould like to recall that the European Union and its \nmember States account for 55 to 60 per cent of global \nworldwide development assistance. \n I would not like to omit a subject that was at the \ncentre of our discussions last year and that has a major \nimpact on the potential of countries\u2019 development: \nclimate change. It is essential to continue along the \ncourse started in Bali and to conclude in Copenhagen a \npost-Kyoto regime that does not impede, but rather \nsupports, the sustainable economic development to \nwhich the developing countries aspire. Mechanisms \nmaking an effective transfer of technology possible and \nappropriate financing available are, in our view, \nindispensable tools for the post-2012 regime, with \nrespect to both mitigation and adaptation as part and \nparcel of an effective global multilateral regime, with \nlegally binding emission reduction targets for \nindustrialized countries and with contributions by each \naccording to their means.  \n Luxembourg, for its part, decided at the \nbeginning of the year to systematically integrate the \nquestion of adaptation to climate change into its \ndevelopment programmes.  \n However, climate change has a potential impact \nnot only on development but on the security of \ncountries. The initiatives of small developing Pacific \nisland countries to refer this issue to the Assembly \nseems to me most timely. It favourably complements \nthe initiative by the Maldives at the seventh session of \nthe Human Rights Council to take up the relationship \nbetween climate change and the full enjoyment of \nhuman rights. As I have already had the opportunity to \nsay from this rostrum, to successfully take on climate \nchange we must tackle it in all its complexity and face \nit in a concerted manner. What better framework to do \nso than the United Nations? \n Since development needs, particularly in Africa, \nhave been at the centre of our attention this week, \nallow me to say a few words about some of the \nconflicts in Africa which impede the development of \nthe countries they are ravaging, and in whose solution \nthe United Nations is heavily invested \u2014 unfortunately \nnot always with the desired results.  \n The conflict of Darfur is in its sixth year now, \nand images of people devastated by attacks, \ndisplacement, precarious life in the camps and the daily \nfear of fresh violence continue to haunt the media, and \nalso our minds. International efforts and efforts of the \nUnited Nations to resolve the crisis, particularly \nthrough joint deployment with the African Union of the \nlargest peacekeeping mission ever decided on, and the \ncentral role of mediation in the search for a political \nsolution may continue to be in vain if the parties to the \nconflict, blinded by their short-term interests, continue \nto lack the necessary political will to commit \nthemselves to a lasting solution.  \n For a solution to Darfur to be lasting, it must \ncomprise a number of components: security, by \ncessation of hostilities and a return to calm on the \nground; political, by the conclusion of an agreement \nfor the sharing of power and resources; humanitarian, \nthrough effective measures to respond to immediate \nhumanitarian needs and development needs of the \npopulation; and judicial, of course, by the end of the \nwidespread impunity for the crimes committed in \nDarfur and bringing to justice the main perpetrators of \nthe atrocities there to make a true reconciliation \npossible. Peace and justice should go hand in hand in \nDarfur, just as throughout the world. That is one of the \nfundamental principles that guide Luxembourg\u2019s \nforeign policy. We cannot, nor should we, close our \neyes to the serious crimes committed in Darfur. Any \n  \n \n08-52265 42 \n \npolitical solution that would indefinitely put off justice \nin Darfur would be flouting even further the rights of a \npopulation that has been suffering for too long. \n The European Union and my own country are \nendeavouring to make their contribution with the \ndeployment of the European Union force (EUFOR) in \nChad and the Central African Republic, a force charged \nwith protecting the refugees of Darfur as well as \ninternally displaced persons, and allowing the \nhumanitarian community access to those vulnerable \npeople in a volatile security environment. EUFOR \nmust pave the path for a United Nations force starting \nin the spring of next year. It is important that this \ntransition occur under good circumstances, according \nto the timetable, and that the force can deploy fully, in \nthe interest of achieving lasting stability in the \nsubregion. \n Another conflict in Africa which concerns us \ngreatly is the one in Somalia. Somalia has been in the \ngrips of civil war for more than a generation now, and \nthe consequences are felt throughout the entire region \nof the Horn of Africa. The signing of the Djibouti \nagreement several weeks ago between the Transitional \nGovernment and an opposition party will perhaps open \nthe way to a lasting stabilization of Somalia. Only by \nconsolidating the political situation and improving \nsecurity can the international community fully carry \nout its peacekeeping efforts in that country in the wake \nof the African Union, which has deployed a \npeacekeeping force under extremely trying \ncircumstances. I welcome the efforts under way in the \nSecurity Council to give concrete form, when \nconditions permit, to the firm commitment entered into \nby the international community and the United Nations \nto help Somalia. \n Much more could, indeed, be said about the \nsituation in Africa. We are concerned over the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, where fighting has \nrecently resumed. In Zimbabwe, one must hope that all \nforms of intimidation and violence will now be ended \nso that that battered country can recover. However, \nmore could also be said about the positive \ndevelopments in Liberia and Sierra Leone, where it has \nbeen possible to put in place an integrated strategy for \npeacebuilding and to draw up a reliable way out of the \ncrisis. \n The sum of $700 billion has been at the centre of \nconcerns over financial policy this week. It appears \nthat this staggering sum has been deployed in order to \nrepair the damage of the capitalism of the casino-like \nbanking sector that relies on debt and speculation to \nachieve precarious growth. Imagine, for a moment, this \nsum being applied to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals upheld by this Assembly in 2000 \nand 2005. Millions of children could survive. Millions \nof women would not die during or after childbirth. \nMuch progress could be made against AIDS and \nmalaria, or in education and training programmes for \nmillions of poor people who live on one or two dollars \na day. Take a moment to reflect on this. \n I also want to mention another topic which \nconcerns us a great deal, one where our Organization, \nin cooperation with the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the European \nUnion, should play a central role, namely, the conflicts \nin Georgia. \n As the President of the French Republic, \nrepresenting the European Union, said a few days ago \nfrom this rostrum, the European Union wants to act for \npeace. It is prepared to make its contribution, \nparticularly by deploying an on-the-ground observer \nmission, and in the international discussions that \nshould begin in mid-October in Geneva, with a view to \na peaceful and lasting solution. Such a solution should \nbe based on full respect for principles of independence, \nsovereignty and territorial integrity, and we condemn \nany action at odds with those principles. Additionally, \nwe feel it is important to see that an independent \ninvestigation be carried out on the Georgian conflict. \n It is said that war kills truth first. The European \nUnion has committed itself to stopping the violence \nand getting the troops out of Georgia, which will \nundoubtedly help the Georgian people in both \nhumanitarian and security terms. The real reasons for \nthe outbreak of this conflict cannot be left to historians. \nLight must be shed on the situation. Therefore and \nmost importantly, in order to avoid similar cases in the \nfuture, the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the United Nations is to \nprevent the outbreak of armed conflict. If a conflict \narises it is incumbent on all of us to investigate the \nreasons and the circumstances in order to prevent other \nclashes. \n I also want to share what was said by the \nPresident of the European Council regarding another \ntopic, particularly after having heard the statement last \nTuesday of the President of the Islamic Republic of \n \n \n43 08-52265 \n \nIran before the General Assembly (see ). It is \nintolerable that Iran should call for the destruction of \nthe State of Israel. We cannot tolerate such anti-Semitic \ncomments, particularly from this rostrum here in our \nOrganization. \n As so often, shadows of darkness and rays of \nhope become intermingled when we analyse \ninternational situations, but one constant remains true: \nthe importance of an effective multilateral system. \n The United Nations could be even more effective \nif it were to continue its internal reform efforts. \nUnfortunately, there is a certain fatigue with regard to \nreform of the Organization. This is particularly \nregrettable because global challenges cannot wait. A \nmore cohesive and effective Organization would \nbenefit us all. Let us not hesitate to redouble our efforts \nto honour our reform commitments of 2005. \n With regard to the reform of the Security \nCouncil, I am pleased that we are finally going to begin \nintergovernmental negotiations at the beginning of \n2009. I hope that those negotiations will quickly \nachieve results. I also hope that the reformed Council \nwill be more representative, but above all, I hope that it \nwill perform better and be more transparent, thereby \nensuring greater effectiveness and enhanced legitimacy \nand implementation of its decisions. \n Other areas of reform agreed in 2005, such as the \nmanagement of the Organization, have not yet been \naddressed. I therefore encourage the Secretary-General \nto pursue his effort to reform human resources \nmanagement on the basis of the three pillars of \ntransparency, effectiveness and the taking of \nresponsibility.  \n With regard to system-wide coherence, we should \npursue our efforts in the areas of operational activities, \ncommercial practices and environmental initiatives. We \nmust essentially move away from the fragmented \nsystem that has evolved in the course of the past \n60 years of United Nations history. \n In conclusion, I think it very important to once \nagain draw the Assembly\u2019s attention to our collective \ndecision regarding the responsibility to protect people \nagainst genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and \ncrimes against humanity. We should continue to work \non the concept of the responsibility to protect, which \nshould be implemented in the framework of criteria \nand conditions set out in the final document of the \n2005 Summit (resolution 60/1), so as to progressively \nestablish an irrefutable basis upon which the \ninternational community can act in accordance with a \ngiven situation.  \n As a founding Member of the Organization, my \ncountry endeavours to contribute to the purposes and \nprinciples of the Charter through resolute and ongoing \nsolidarity, through concrete involvement in efforts \naimed at development, peace, security and respect for \nhuman rights, and through the determined pursuit of a \nmultilateral approach with the United Nations at the \ncore. It is in that same spirit that, as we did in 2001, \nLuxembourg has presented its candidacy for a \nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council for the \nperiod 2013 and 2014. That too is how we intend to \ncontinue to shoulder our share of responsibility in this \nAssembly.  "

Their messages of sympathy \ncomforted and strengthened us immensely.  \n We are particularly indebted to the Government \nof Egypt for the medical attention rendered to our late \nPresident when he suffered a stroke while attending the \nAfrican Union summit in Sharm el-Sheik on 29 June \n2008 and for his subsequent evacuation to France. We \nare similarly grateful to the Government of France for \nthe medical attention and hospitality availed to the late \nPresident up to the time of his death as well as for the \nrepatriation of his body to Zambia for burial. The \nPresident was put to rest on 3 September 2008, which, \nincidentally, would have been his sixtieth birthday.  \n I wish to inform this Assembly that, in \naccordance with the Zambian Constitution, elections \nfor the new President should be held within 90 days of \nthe death or incapacitation of a sitting President. Thus, \nthe Government has designated 30 October 2008 for \nthe presidential by-election. In the spirit of \ntransparency, accountability and good governance, the \nZambian Government has invited international \norganizations, including the United Nations, to send \nelection observers to the elections. \n At this juncture, let me join others who have \nspoken before me in congratulating you, Mr. President, \non your assumption of the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-third session. Zambia has no \ndoubt that you will steer this session to a successful \nconclusion. I wish to assure you of Zambia\u2019s support. \n May I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to \nyour predecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim of the former \nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, for ably presiding \nover the proceedings of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-second session. \n I wish to thank the Secretary-General for his \ntireless efforts in his dedicated service to humankind in \ntrying to maintain international peace and security, \nachieve development and eradicate poverty for all. \n The theme for this session, \u201cThe impact of the \nglobal food crisis on poverty and hunger in the world \nas well as the need to democratize the United Nations\u201d, \nis indeed testimony to the noble efforts of the \nSecretary-General. The theme is also most appropriate, \nespecially since it is relevant to the development \nchallenges currently facing Africa and the developing \nworld as a whole. \n It is confirmed in the Secretary-General\u2019s reports \nthat many developing countries, and in particular \nsub-Saharan Africa, will not meet the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by 2015 and that Member \nStates should therefore redouble and reconfirm their \ncommitments if we are to meet that target. \n Zambia believes that the attainment of the MDGs \nwill be meaningful only if it is all-inclusive. That will \nrequire the implementation of programmes and policies \nfor empowering women, the girl child and other \nvulnerable groups of society be part of the overall \nprocess within that framework. \n \n \n11 08-53129 \n \n In that regard, Zambia supports the assertion that \nwomen\u2019s empowerment and gender equality are drivers \nfor reducing poverty, building food security and \nreducing maternal mortality. It is in that realization that \nmost of the States members of the Southern African \nDevelopment Community (SADC) signed the SADC \nProtocol on Gender and Development in \nAugust 2008 \u2014 the first of its kind in Africa. \n Such regional and national efforts need to be \ncomplemented by global action. It is in that regard that \nZambia welcomes the ongoing debate on reforms in the \ncontext of United Nations system-wide coherence, \nparticularly as they relate to strengthening the gender \narchitecture, which is currently fragmented and \nunderresourced. \n In the process of empowering women and striving \nfor gender equality, Zambia realizes that HIV/AIDS \ncontinues to be a challenge to the country\u2019s \ndevelopment, with the prevalence rate for women \nbeing higher than that of men. The pandemic is robbing \nthe country of a young and productive workforce. The \nZambian Government therefore has put in place a \nnumber of policies that have helped to reduce the \nprevalence of HIV from 16 per cent in 2001 to \n14 per cent in 2007. That reduction in the prevalence \nrate is an indication that our Government is determined \nto stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. That would not, \nhowever, be possible without the support of the \ninternational community. \n The Monterrey Consensus places obligations on \ndeveloped and developing countries alike to come up \nwith concrete strategies and action to address poverty. \nMost African countries, including Zambia, have \nresolved to develop their economies and embarked on \nprudent macroeconomic management, channelling \nresources to growth sectors that present the greatest \nprospect for wealth and employment creation. They \nhave further developed policies, plans and programmes \nthat are not only growth-oriented but also pro-poor and \naddress social development. \n I wish to acknowledge with appreciation the role \nthat our cooperating partners and the international \ncommunity have played and continue to play in all our \ndevelopment and poverty-eradication programmes. We \nwelcome the commitments made by Africa and its \ncooperating partners in the context of various \nimportant initiatives and partnerships in recent years, \ninter alia, the Tokyo International Conference on \nAfrican Development, which among other things, came \nup with a Follow-up Mechanism with regard to \nimplementation of commitments made during the \nconference. \n Similarly, the China-Africa Partnership and the \nEuropean Union-Africa Strategic Partnership have also \ncontributed substantially to Africa\u2019s development \nneeds. With regard to the India-Africa Forum, we also \nlook forward to the speedy implementation of \ncommitments undertaken during the Summit Forum in \nIndia in April 2008. \n Furthermore, we appreciate the assistance \nrendered by the G-8 Africa Partnership, the Emergency \nPlan for AIDS Relief of the President of the United \nStates of America, the comprehensive health-care \ninitiative sponsored by the Government of Cuba, the \nInitiative for Africa\u2019s Development of the Republic of \nKorea and Pakistan\u2019s Special Technical Assistance \nProgramme for Africa. In similar vein, we look forward \nto the implementation of the recently launched Africa-\nTurkey partnership forum. \n Zambia notes with concern, however, that the \nefforts the cooperating partners are making with regard \nto improved access to the markets of the developed \ncountries and official development assistance flows \nand finance for development for African countries have \nnot been completely fulfilled. We commend the five \ncooperating partners that have met or exceeded the \ntarget of 0.7 per cent of their gross national income as \ntheir contribution to official development assistance. \nWe urge the cooperating partners that have not fulfilled \ntheir commitments to do so. We also look forward to \nthe upcoming Follow-up International Conference on \nFinancing for Development to Review the \nImplementation of the Monterrey Consensus in Doha \nand hope donors will honour their commitments. \n We are aware that improved market access for \ndeveloping countries is one commitment that, once \nfulfilled, will offer the greatest prospects for our \nintegration into the world trading system. It also has \nthe potential to foster food security for all and to raise \nthe standard of living of the majority of the population \nthat depends on agriculture for its livelihood.  \n In that regard, Zambia notes with disappointment \nthat the Doha Round of trade negotiations collapsed at \na time when many of us were looking forward to a \nsuccessful conclusion to those protracted talks. It is my \ncountry\u2019s hope that the negotiations will reconvene and \n  \n \n08-53129 12 \n \nconclude as soon as possible so that the developing \ncountries can compete favourably and become \nintegrated into the multilateral trading system. \n The current global oil and food crises not only \npose a threat to the gains made in achieving \nmacroeconomic stability and growth in developing \ncountries, but are an even greater threat to the \nachievements made towards eliminating extreme \npoverty and reducing by half the proportion of people \nsuffering from hunger. \n A solution to the food crisis must be found as a \nmatter of urgency. In that connection, Zambia wishes \nto thank the Secretary-General for establishing the \nHigh-Level Task Force on the Global Food Security \nCrisis, whose task is to find a coherent and coordinated \napproach to resolving the food crisis. In addressing the \ncrisis, we must be mindful of the fact that a large \npercentage of the people in developing countries \ndepend on agriculture for their livelihoods. Therefore, \nin finding a solution to high food prices, we should \nensure that we do not inadvertently encourage rural-\nurban migration by including measures that are \ndisadvantageous to those engaged in food and general \nagricultural production. \n In addition, the issue of climate change, which \nhas worsened the food crisis, requires the concerted \nefforts of the international community to address it \nthrough the development of adaptation and mitigation \nmeasures. Zambia, like most of sub-Saharan Africa, \nhas not been spared the adverse effects of climate \nchange, such as increased exposure to drought, rising \ntemperatures, more erratic rainfall and extreme weather \nconditions. Those are threatening water and \nagricultural systems, thereby condemning millions \nmore to face malnutrition and water shortages. \n Mr. Tanin (Afghanistan), Vice-President, took the \nChair. \n Let me now turn to the ongoing reforms of the \nUnited Nations, in particular the protracted discussions \non reform of the Security Council. Zambia wishes to \nreiterate the fact that United Nations reform will not be \ncomplete without meaningful reform of the Security \nCouncil. Any new proposals to reform the Council \nshould take into account Africa\u2019s call for two \npermanent seats with the veto power and two \nadditional non-permanent seats, as that will not only \naddress the historical injustice against Africa, but also \nrespond to the need to democratize the Security \nCouncil, given that Africa constitutes the second-\nlargest bloc of the United Nations membership. \nEqually important in that regard will be the need to \nreform the working methods of that important United \nNations body. \n It is a matter of concern to Zambia that the \nquestion of Western Sahara has remained unresolved \nfor such a long time. In accordance with the principles \nenshrined in the United Nations Charter and General \nAssembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, \nthe people of Western Sahara should be free to exercise \ntheir inalienable right to self-determination. In that \nregard, Zambia calls for the implementation of all \nrelevant United Nations resolutions on that matter, \nwhile supporting the ongoing efforts between the \nparties concerned to find a lasting solution. \n With regard to the situation in Zimbabwe, Zambia \nwelcomes the signing of the Inter-Party Agreement on \n15 September 2008 and pays tribute to former South \nAfrican President Thabo Mbeki, who, on behalf of \nSADC, successfully discharged the mandate entrusted \nto him. We remain optimistic that the concerned parties \nwill adhere to the Agreement, which has created a good \nbasis for addressing the socio-economic problems \nconfronting the country. In that regard, we appeal to \nthe international community to provide all possible \nsupport to the people of Zimbabwe in their efforts to \nresuscitate their economy. \n There is no doubt that the United Nations remains \nthe only multilateral institution capable of addressing \nthe challenges of our one world. The world\u2019s poor are \nlooking to the United Nations system to deliver on its \ncommitments to enable them to live in dignity with \nevery possible opportunity, free from hunger and \ndiseases such as HIV/AIDS and, above all, in a \npeaceful, secure and environmentally sustainable \nworld. Let us therefore not fail them, for they deserve \nno less. "

From \nthat perspective, the Republic of Moldova fully \nsupports the United Nations reform process in \naccordance with the main directions reflected in the \nfinal document of the 2005 World Summit (resolution \n60/)1, subsequent initiatives of the Secretary-General \nand resolutions adopted on key aspects of the reform of \nthe Organization\u2019s structures and management.  \n We support strengthening the coordinating role of \nthe Economic and Social Council in developing global \neconomic and social policies, promoting dialogue and \nintensifying cooperation with international financial, \neconomic and trade institutions and Governments in \nattaining the Millennium Development Goals, as well \nas the Council\u2019s involvement in addressing \nhumanitarian crisis situations and issues related to \npost-conflict reconstruction. \n The decision to launch intergovernmental \nnegotiations will bring a new impetus to Security \nCouncil reform and will stimulate and increase the \nefficiency of United Nations activities in the field of \ninternational security and peacekeeping, including \nthrough developing cooperation with regional \norganizations and Member States in identifying \nsolutions to conflicts in different parts of the world. \n The events that occurred in South Ossetia, \nGeorgia, have proved once again that frozen conflicts \ngenerate instability and threaten regional and \ninternational security. The Republic of Moldova \nsubscribed to the European Union (EU) declaration \nregarding the degradation of the situation in South \nOssetia, delivered at the extraordinary meeting of the \nPermanent Council of the Organization for Security \nand Cooperation in Europe on 8 August 2008, and calls \nfor the full implementation of the peace plan mediated \nunder the French presidency of the EU. At the same \ntime, categorically rejecting all methods of settlement \nby force, including those used to ensure territorial \nintegrity, the Moldovan Government does not consider \nthat international recognition of Abkhazia and South \nOssetia will stabilize the situation. \n In the specific case of the Transdniestrian \nconflict, the Republic of Moldova acted and continues \nto act in accordance with the law on basic provisions of \nthe special legal status of the localities on the left bank \nof the Nistru River which was adopted unanimously on \n22 July 2005 and which provides for resolution of the \nTransdniestrian conflict by political means only. \n Believing that demilitarization and \ndemocratization of the Transdniestrian region are \nessential to a viable resolution of the conflict, the \nPresident of the Republic of Moldova has advanced a \nnumber of initiatives on security for and confidence-\nbuilding between both banks of the Nistru River.  \n A strategy for conflict resolution based on a \ncomplex approach consisting of packaged proposals for \nall conflict-related issues \u2014 political, economic, social \nand humanitarian \u2014 has been adopted. It envisages a \nspecial legal status for the Transdniestrian region that \nincludes respect for the sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity of the Republic of Moldova, consolidation of \nthe neutrality status, withdrawal of foreign troops from \nthe country\u2019s territory and recognition of ownership \nrights and firm guarantees for the population. \n At the same time, the activities of the European \nUnion Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and \nUkraine (EUBAM) and its close cooperation with the \nrelevant institutions in charge of border management in \nboth States have contributed to increased security and \ntransparency at the border, which creates a more \nfavourable atmosphere for settlement of the \nTransdniestrian conflict. At present our efforts, as well \nas those of mediators and observers, are directed to \n \n \n7 08-53135 \n \nresuming negotiations in the Five plus two format with \na view to a final resolution of that conflict. \n The Assembly\u2019s review meeting to assess the \nimplementation of the United Nations Global Counter-\nTerrorism Strategy, on 4 September 2008, emphasized \nboth the progress registered by the United Nations and \nits Member States during the last years and the \ndeficiencies in the fight against international terrorism. \nIn that context, I would like to reaffirm that as a party \nto 13 international conventions and other, regional and \nbilateral treaties in that field, the Government of the \nRepublic of Moldova continues to take concrete steps \nin fighting terrorism in accordance with the provisions \nof those instruments, relevant Security Council \nresolutions and national documents, including the \nNational Strategy for Preventing and Fighting Money- \nLaundering and Terrorism Funding.  \n The Republic of Moldova will further undertake \nall possible steps for contributing to United Nations \nactions in consolidating international legislation in the \nfield of countering international terrorism, especially in \nview of the finalizing of the development and adoption \nof the comprehensive convention on international \nterrorism and organization of the high-level conference \non terrorism under United Nations auspices. We \nconsider that in the framework of those activities, \nincreased attention should be given to the issues related \nto fighting terrorism that is fuelled by separatist \ntendencies that affect States\u2019 sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity. \n Climate change is an inherent challenge for \nsustainable development. Global warming and its \neffects, including natural disasters and food and energy \ncrises, have become major threats for the global \npopulation and for international security. After the \nterrible drought of last year \u2014 the consequences of \nwhich we are still overcoming \u2014 the Republic of \nMoldova was hit this summer by the most serious \nfloods of the last two centuries, which affected over \n10,000 hectares of agricultural and private lands, \ndestroyed hundreds of houses and other buildings and \ncaused damages exceeding $120 million. \n We would like to express our gratitude for the \nassistance provided by the United Nations Office for \nthe Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs by other \nspecialized institutions, including the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme and UNICEF, and by \nMember States to alleviate the consequences of the \nfloods. \n The Republic of Moldova fully supports the \nactivity of the High-Level Task Force on the Global \nFood Security Crisis, established and headed by the \nSecretary-General. Development and implementation \nof a comprehensive plan for food security, in \ncooperation with relevant United Nations agencies and \nthe Bretton Woods institutions, would constitute an \nimportant step for overcoming the food crisis. \n The Government of the Republic of Moldova is \nundertaking concrete action with a view to reducing \nthe impact of the food crisis on the situation in the \ncountry. At present, a national agriculture and food \nsecurity programme is being developed. We consider \nthat the high-level meeting on the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals held on 25 September and the \norganization of annual meetings on monitoring the \nengagement and implementation of those goals \nconstitute new and important opportunities for \nimplementing the achievement of all internationally \naccepted development objectives. Their implementation \nis still possible in the majority of countries if \nconsolidated actions directed towards concrete results \nare established and continuously sustained and \ndeveloped until the year 2015.  \n The progress achieved with the support of the \nEuropean Union (EU) in the implementation of the \nMoldova-EU Action Plan and in conforming the \nnational standards to the European standards has \nopened new opportunities for the advancement of \nMoldovan-European relations. We highly appreciate \nthe constructive cooperation with the EU in that \nprocess and continue to rely on the assistance of its \nmember States in ensuring development and the \ngradual integration of our country into the European \nUnion. \n At the same time, we rely on the support and the \nopportunities offered by the United Nations and \nMember States with a view to promoting the political, \nsocial and economic policies of the country and its \nEuropean integration aspirations and to ensuring \nsettlement of the Transdniestrian conflict, withdrawal \nof foreign military troops and accomplishment of the \ndevelopment priorities of the country. \n I would like to reiterate the attachment of the \nRepublic of Moldova to the ideals of the United \nNations and its commitment to continuously cooperate \n  \n \n08-53135 8 \n \nwith Member States towards achieving the important \nobjectives of the Organization.

        "file_text": "Since the last time we \ngathered here in this great Hall, we have passed a year \nof great hopes and grave fears. We have witnessed the \nhope-inspiring glory of human accomplishment at the \nOlympic Games in Beijing but shuddered at crumbling \nstock and housing markets around the world. We have \na growing global understanding on climate change and \nthe issues relevant to it, but seen millions of lives \nthreatened by the shortage of food in many countries \nand witnessed with disbelief the brutal slaughter of \ninnocent people at the hands of terrorists in \nAfghanistan, Pakistan, India, Algeria and several other \nparts of the world. \n Since I spoke at this rostrum in the last session of \nthe General Assembly, my country, Afghanistan, has \ngrappled with a number of important challenges, none \nmore troubling than the problem of international \nterrorism. Terrorist forces have significantly increased \ntheir attacks and brutality, and enjoyed freedom in their \nsanctuaries. \n While Afghanistan has borne the brunt of terrorist \nviolence, the scourge has now spread like a wildfire \nacross the wider region. In Pakistan, where, until \nrecently, extremist circles remained mainly focused on \ndestabilizing Afghanistan, today terrorist violence is \nunfortunately also directed within Pakistani territory \nand against the Pakistani people.  \n Daily acts of intimidation and violence against \ncommunities in Afghanistan and Pakistan, in particular \non both sides of the Durand Line, the killing of \npolitical and tribal leaders and the burning of schools \nare the upshots of the continued spawning and spread \nof terrorism and extremism in the region.  \n \n \n29 08-51749 \n \n The callous attack on the Marriot hotel in \nIslamabad over the weekend, the bombing of the Indian \nEmbassy in Kabul and the terrorist attacks in the Indian \ncities of Bangalore and Ahmedabad were the most \ndisturbing demonstration of terrorists\u2019 growing reach. \n Undoubtedly, terrorism will not go away until we \ndismantle the elaborate institutional support terrorists \nenjoy in the region and eliminate their secure \nsanctuaries. That will be possible only if we engage in \nsincere regional and international cooperation. \n The democratic transition in Pakistan, heralded \nby the historic elections of last February, has been a \nmost promising development in our region. \n We in Afghanistan have warmly welcomed the \ninauguration of the civilian democratic Government. In \nparticular, I take the opportunity to once again \ncongratulate my brother, President Asif Ali Zardari, on \nhis election as the President of Pakistan. I assure my \nbrothers, President Zardari and Prime Minister Gillani, \nthat Afghanistan stands ready to take several steps for \neach single step that Pakistan will take to address the \nchallenge of radicalism and terrorism. \n To the extent that terrorism in our region \ncontinues to be a global threat, evolving in nature and \ntactics, the struggle against it must continue unabated. \nIn this context, I recall with appreciation this year\u2019s \nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Summit in \nBucharest, where around 40 countries with existing \nmilitary commitments in Afghanistan once again \nreiterated their strong resolve to stay the course. \n Among the most significant outcomes of the \nsummit was the emphasis on the Afghanization of the \nsecurity sector as a measure to ensure sustainability \nand enhanced effectiveness. To that end, I call for a \nredoubling of efforts by the international community \naimed at enabling the Afghan national security \ninstitutions, both the army and the police, to take on a \ngreater share of the war against terrorism and for the \nprotection of our people. \n Above all, Afghanization of military operations is \nvital if the problem of civilian casualties is to be \naddressed effectively. The continuation of civilian \ncasualties could seriously undermine the legitimacy of \nthe fight against terrorism and the credibility of the \nAfghan people\u2019s partnership with the international \ncommunity. \n Whereas the military endeavour at the regional \nand international levels remains the primary response \nto the threat of terrorism, success will only be possible \nif the local population is empowered to confront it. \nTherefore, while terrorism and a persistent \nenvironment of insecurity are at work to subvert \nAfghanistan\u2019s growth, we must do what it takes to win \nthe battle of Afghanistan\u2019s economic development.  \n Last June, my Government launched the \nAfghanistan National Development Strategy at the \nAfghanistan donors conference in Paris. If the pledges \nmade at the conference are translated into timely \ncommitments, I am confident that we will attain the \ndevelopment goals set out in our Strategy. \n On behalf of the people of Afghanistan, I thank \nPresident Nicholas Sarkozy of France for his \nleadership in excellently organizing the Paris \nconference. I also thank the United States and all the \nother countries around the world that pledged \ngenerously towards the implementation of the \nAfghanistan National Development Strategy. \n As in the security sector, Afghanization of the \ndevelopment process is the key not just to the goal of \nensuring ownership but also to the effective \nimplementation of our Development Strategy. \nAfghanization of the development process can be \nachieved through a meaningful commitment by our \nfriends and donors to aid effectiveness. In that context, \nwhile urging a shift away from the use of parallel \nstructures and wasteful mechanisms, I strongly endorse \nthe role of the United Nations and the special \nrepresentative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kai Eide, \nin coordinating the international community\u2019s \nparticipation in Afghanistan\u2019s development and State-\nbuilding processes. \n Thanks to the selfless sacrifices of men and \nwomen of Member States and the determination and \nsacrifices of our own people, the journey of \nAfghanistan\u2019s reconstruction is resolutely under way. \nToday our people are more educated, healthier, better \noff and more optimistic about their future. We have \nbuilt thousands of new schools and reconstructed many \nmore, where millions of our youngsters go to school \nand prepare for the responsibilities of tomorrow. Our \nrapid economic growth, with double-digit growth rates \nalmost every year, has resulted in higher income and \nbetter living conditions for our people. Our rural \ndevelopment programmes have improved lives in \n  \n \n08-51749 30 \n \nthousands of our villages that had never before seen an \nagent of the State among them. \n We have also taken a number of legal and \ninstitutional measures to intensify our anti-corruption \nefforts, such as establishing the High Office of \nOversight and Anti-Corruption, including special units \nin the Office of the Attorney-General and in the \njudiciary to oversee efforts aimed at eliminating \ncorruption through preventive, educational and \nenforcement measures. We are committed to ensuring \nmore concrete results in the coming years. \n Also very important, on counter-narcotics, this \nyear we have registered a 20 per cent decline in total \nopium production, while the number of poppy-free \nprovinces has reached 18, making 50 per cent of the \ncountry virtually poppy-free. The key to sustaining our \nsuccess will be ensuring alternative livelihoods for our \nfarmers, investing to a greater extent in law \nenforcement and interdiction and, above all, addressing \nthe far greater dimensions of the world\u2019s drug trade \nthat lie outside Afghanistan, such as reduction of \ndemand in foreign markets and stricter border controls. \n Our efforts in counter-narcotics and in other areas \nhave been complicated by the acute shortage of food \nwithin the country. In collaboration with the United \nNations, we have launched a humanitarian appeal that \nwe hope will receive a timely response from our \npartners in the international community. \n The United Nations Charter promises freedom, \njustice, a dignified life, security and peace, and it is \nincumbent on all of us to work together to ensure that \nthose promises are kept. Today, there are still too many \ncorners of the world where conflict and tension are \nputting the lives and livelihoods of millions of people \nin jeopardy.  \n We deeply sympathize with our Palestinian \nbrothers and sisters and their struggle and suffering. \nWe urge a just and comprehensive settlement that fully \nrealizes the rights of the Palestinian people, including \ntheir right to an independent State, living in peace, side \nby side with the State of Israel. \n Today, once again, this Assembly session has \nbrought us together at a time when our world is poised \nbetween great opportunities and menacing challenges. I \nam confident that we will make use of our growing \ncollective ability as a community of nations to do what \nis right for the betterment of our world."

        "file_text": "Allow me to congratulate \nyou, Sir, on your election as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-third session. I am pleased to see \na member of our regional group of Latin America and \nthe Caribbean in that high office. I am convinced that \nyour longstanding diplomatic experience and in-depth \nknowledge of current international issues will enable \nyou to successfully discharge the high responsibility of \nyour office. I would also like to recognize the able \nstewardship and valuable work of your predecessor, \nMr. Srgjan Kerim, during the Assembly\u2019s sixty-second \nsession. \n To the Secretary-General of the Organization, His \nExcellency Ban Ki-moon, I pledge Suriname\u2019s full \nsupport in implementing the resolutions of the United \nNations to achieve the objectives of the United Nations \nCharter for sustainable development, international \npeace and security and respect for human rights and \nfundamental freedoms. \n We are commemorating the sixtieth anniversary \nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights this \nyear, while many of these rights are still under serious \npressure. New threats, such as global warming and \nclimate change and most recently the global food and \nenergy crises, are an infringement on people\u2019s rights to \nfood, health, education, security and the overall \nfreedom to live in dignity. Those tribulations are \nintertwined and universal and thus beyond the control \nof any single nation. Millions of vulnerable people are \ntherefore looking to the international community, with \nthe United Nations at the helm, for effective measures \nto bring some kind of relief. \n The Economic and Social Council recently \nrecognized the seriousness and complexity of the \nglobal food crisis and reiterated that its consequences \nrequire a comprehensive response by national \nGovernments and the international community. It is \nessential for us to intensify our combined efforts, and \nwe therefore support the emergency global partnership \nplan for food, called for by Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon in his address to the General Assembly high-\nlevel event on the global food and climate change \ncrises. \n The financial and monetary implications of the \nglobal crisis require substantial political and financial \ncommitments from us all, from national Governments, \nfrom multilateral organizations, including international \nfinancial institutions, and from the private sector. We \nwill have to change the way that we, human beings, \nbehave towards Mother Nature and we will have to \nfind a solution to policies and regulations that are \ndetrimental to our progress, such as protectionist \nagricultural policies in developed countries that are \ncausing low production in the agricultural sector of \nmany developing countries. If we do not find lasting \nsolutions now, the cost of our inaction will be \nunacceptably high, and the threats that we will most \nlikely pass on to the next generation will be \ndevastating. \n My country, Suriname, was on the right track \ntowards achieving some of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, including poverty reduction \nsustained by economic growth rates of over 5 per cent \nannually in the past three years, with predictions by \nrenowned international financial institutions of \napproximately 8 per cent growth for the coming years. \nAs a result of the current food and energy crises, as \nwell as the recent volatility of financial markets, it has \nnow become a challenge for us to keep up the pace and \nquality of our development. \n My Government has taken action and has already \nput some measures in place to respond to the new \ndifficulties we are facing because of those external \ndevelopments. We have expanded social security to \ncover the most needy, such as children, the elderly and \npeople with disabilities, we have put in place food \nprogrammes for schoolchildren, and we have increased \nsalaries and Government pensions, which had \nweakened as a result of years of inflation. The \nGovernment has now called upon the private sector to \nfollow its lead and restore eroded salaries and \npensions. \n Africa, the cradle of humanity, is a continent with \nimmense capability, endowed with indispensable \nhuman and natural potential. Paradoxically, in many \nparts of the continent, development is lagging behind \nor even absent, and development perspectives are \nbleak. \n \n \n27 08-51839 \n \n My country commends Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon for holding the important high-level meeting \non \u201cAfrica\u2019s development needs: state of \nimplementation of various commitments, challenges \nand the way forward\u201d, which took place just two days \nago. It is our genuine expectation that the outcome of \nthat meeting will lead to new and unique opportunities \nfor impacting positively on and contributing to the \ndevelopment of Africa. \n Suriname remains committed to the promotion \nand protection of human rights. My country \nunderscores the principle of equality before the law \nand emphasizes that everyone should be held \naccountable for their actions. Against that backdrop, \nSuriname acceded to the Rome Statute of the \nInternational Criminal Court on 15 July of this year. \nWe thus expressed our commitment to fighting the \nimpunity of the perpetrators of gross human rights \nviolations. However, providing the Court with its full \npotential to meet its mandate depends on a collective \ncommitment at the global level. \n Environmental disturbances today are of such \nmagnitude that we can no longer ignore their negative \nimpact on the world\u2019s resources. As a country with 90 \nper cent of its territory covered by forests within which \nlies one of the largest stretches of pristine tropical \nrainforests on earth, Suriname is aware of its value and \npotential to contribute to the global mitigation of \nclimate change, the conservation of biodiversity and \nthe protection of water resources. \n However, the contribution of the international \ncommunity to the preservation and protection of such \nglobally valuable resources is not proportionate to the \nsacrifice made by the forested countries. Moreover, \nforested countries like Suriname with very low \ndeforestation rates are forgotten in mechanisms devised \nto compensate for deforestation. \n Suriname recently hosted the Paramaribo \nDialogue, a country-led initiative on financing for \nsustainable forest management in support of the United \nNations Forum on Forests. During that international \ndialogue, multiple stakeholders from all over the world \ncame together to develop substantive proposals for the \nestablishment of an international financial framework \nto assist in future sustainable forest management. \n We stress the importance of new financing \nmechanisms, since good management of forests and \nother natural resources cannot and should not be at the \nexpense of the development of our own peoples, the \npeoples of countries with high forest coverage and low \ndeforestation rates. We therefore look forward to \nsubstantial investments to support the sustainable \ndevelopment of such countries. \n Suriname has supported the restructuring process \nof the United Nations from the start, with the aim of \nachieving a more effective and efficient Organization \nthat would be better equipped to adequately address \nold and new challenges. In that process, we expect that \nthe role of the United Nations as a partner in \ndevelopment will gain further relevance and achieve a \nmore coherent and enhanced presence in support of \ncapacity-building and sustainable development. \n Suriname is also currently engaged in a \u201cOne \nUN\u201d policy process, through which it responds to the \nneed for coherent involvement of the United Nations in \nits development efforts. To that end, Suriname and the \nUnited Nations agencies signed the Country \nProgramme Action Plan for the period 2008-2011, \nwhich also addresses the pursuit of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. \n We have entered an era of growing anxieties and \nconcerns that go beyond national borders. The \ncontemporary world situation requires harmonization \nof the United Nations with current international \ndevelopments. Suriname believes that the United \nNations should be given the tools and instruments to \nenable the Organization to address global challenges in \nsupport of a comprehensive and coherent development \nagenda in the interest of all the nations of the world."

        "file_text": "My first \nwords are addressed to the President of the General \nAssembly, at its sixty-third session, my friend Miguel \nd\u2019Escoto. I am pleased that the responsibility of \npresiding over our deliberations has fallen to a \ndistinguished Latin American of such political and \ndiplomatic eminence in his country and in the region. \n The President has invited us \u2014 and because of its \ngreat importance we are obliged to comply with his \nsuggestion \u2014 to focus our debate on the impact of the \nworld food crisis on poverty and hunger in the world.  \n This Organization was founded at the end of a \nworld conflagration in order to banish war forever and \nto prevent armed confrontations between nations or \ngroups of nations. Although it has not been possible to \navoid all such events, certainly it has acted as a \ndeterrent force that has prevented wars that might have \nproved even more devastating. The nations of the \nworld decided that it would be here that conflicts \namong its Members would be resolved.  \n Now we have to act on a conflict that is not \nbetween Member States, but is rather one of all States \nagainst hunger and poverty. It is difficult to explain \nwhy, if the world is producing sufficient food for all, \n854 million people find themselves in a state of food \ninsecurity and more than 1.7 billion people are \nsuffering from iron deficiency. In the last few days we \nhave noted how hundreds of millions of dollars have \nbeen directed to rescue commercial enterprises, while \nwe still view with indifference the fact that every year \n5.6 million children younger than 5 years are dying \ndirectly or indirectly because of malnutrition \u2014 that is \n640 each hour. In other words, since the moment when \nwe began our deliberations this morning, 5,000 \nchildren younger than 5 years have died. They did not \ndie because of terrorist acts, which all condemn, nor \nbecause of natural disasters, which we all regret. They \ndied for a reason as simple as it is tragic \u2014 they were \npoor. This situation is simply indefensible. \n As part of the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs), we undertook to reduce the number of people \nsuffering from hunger by one half and the number of \npeople who live with an income of less than $1 per day \nby one half between 1990 and 2015. How can we meet \nthis objective if the price of rice has risen by 74 per \ncent and that of wheat by 130 per cent? How can we \nmeet this objective if more than one billion people who \nhave escaped extreme poverty run the risk of suffering \nfrom hunger unless we do something to stop this \nupward spiral of food prices? \n What is the point of ensuring that more people \nearn more than a dollar a day if the rise in food prices \nhas in fact altered that measurement of extreme \npoverty? I do not want to suggest that nothing is being \ndone. The World Food Programme is doing formidable \nwork and donor countries have made extraordinary \ncontributions to alleviate the crisis and bring food to \nthe countries that need it most.  \n The deliberations of the Human Rights Council, \nthe High-level Conference on World Food Security \nheld at the headquarters of the Food and Agriculture \nOrganization and the meeting of the High-level Task \nForce on the Global Food Security Crisis constitute \nadditional expressions of the concern of international \nbodies. \n But the fact is that we face a reality that has \nalready caused social disruption and to which no \nimmediate solution is in sight. The major mission of \nthe United Nations is the preservation of peace, and \npeace is not just the absence of armed conflict between \ncountries, but also lies in the tranquillity of nations and \nentails the elimination of adverse factors that may \ndisturb that tranquillity.  \n As if skyrocketing food prices were not enough, \nthey have now been compounded by unjustified \nspeculation, which has raised the price of fuel to \nabsurd levels. It is no longer just the exorbitant \nearnings of oil companies that are at stake; what is at \nstake now is the hunger of millions of people who have \nseen their efforts and hopes go up in smoke without \neven knowing what has hit them. \n This means that we must see to it that from the \nUnited Nations reforms that have been so often \npostponed there emerges a strengthened General \nAssembly so that, as an expression of all its \nmembership, it may act with authority in response to \nsuch situations as those before us today. The \nConstitution of almost all States of the world provides \nfor the declaration of a state of emergency as a \nmechanism for dealing with imminent threats to \nnational security or to social harmony. \n \n \n19 08-51606 \n \n I am convinced, and I want to say so today, that \nbecause of the price of food, we are facing a threat to \nsocial peace and that the General Assembly could so \ndeclare it so that all governmental forces, private \ninitiatives and international bodies may coordinate \ntheir efforts in a crusade to rescue hundreds of millions \nof people from the clutches of poverty. \n The world food price crisis cannot be dissociated \nfrom climate change, as if these two problems were not \ninterrelated. Climate change has led to irregular crops \nthrough droughts and floods that have had such a \nsevere effect on food stocks. \n If the problem of the scarcity and the lack of food \nis something that we have to deal with \ncomprehensively, we should take measures to mitigate \nthe polluting effects of carbon, at least by market \nmechanisms or a limiting of carbon production. It is \nindispensable to develop more efficient technologies, \nsuch as wind and solar energy, to take the place of \nfossil fuels, if our response is not to remain a \ntemporary palliative but may offer a lasting, \nsustainable solution; we must see to it, without further \ndelay, that we tackle both problems, the food crisis and \nclimate change, in an integral, comprehensive and \nconsistent manner. \n It is only thus that we will be able, without \nfurther delay, to arrive at responses that are not just \nstopgaps, but lasting, sustainable solutions. Indeed, \never-greater importance is to be attached to the way we \nrelate to the ecosystems that sustain life throughout the \nworld, and how that affects the survival of our species \nand civilization.  \n We must understand that the environmental \nagenda of the twenty-first century cannot be built on \nthe basis of the idea of a conflict between the \nenvironment and the market, nor between the \nenvironment and trade barriers, but on the basis of \nopportunities which the market and trade offer to \nstimulate new ways of addressing the environmental \nissues that affect us all. \n We know today that there is no intractable \ncontradiction between conservation and development, \nas perhaps there might have appeared to be when the \nUnited Nations convened the first meeting to discuss \nthe subject in 1972. Let us make no mistake. The \nopposite of conservation is not development, but waste. \nIt is clear from the intimate relationship that exists \nbetween environmental problems and those that have to \ndo with social and economic development that the best \nway to promote natural capital is to promote social \ncapital. \n The only way to create a different environment is \nto build a society free of the problems of poverty, \nunderdevelopment and ignorance which today limit our \ncapacity to establish harmonious relations among all \nsocial sectors, and between them and their natural \nenvironment. \n We have the resources to do it: technology, \nscientific knowledge and, above all, political \nleadership and innovative capacity. But we can only \nsucceed through a common approach to environmental \nmanagement, shared by all the members of the global \ncommunity who are already moving in this same \ndirection. \n The international community has been happy to \nsee that on the other side of the Pacific, tensions have \nabated, but we note with concern that threats to \ninternational peace and security have emerged in other \nparts of the world.  \n Panama has set forth its positions in the Security \nCouncil. I shall therefore only refer to what was also \nsuggested by the President, that is, the need to \ndemocratize this Organization. \n Over the last four years, I have heard from \ncountless speakers a widespread demand for the United \nNations to finally adapt its structures, which the \n50 signatories of the original Charter designed 60 years \nago, to the reality of an Organization with 192 Member \nStates and a geopolitical situation very different from \nthat which then existed. \n It has become a ritual repeated year after year for \nevery Head of State, foreign minister or ambassador to \ncall, without much success, for a recrafting of the \nOrganization. For myself, as is shown by the \ncommitment of my country to the United Nations, for \nthe fifth time in five years, I come to this podium to \nask with the same vigour and energy for the political \nwill to implement reforms. \n Panama made a proposal, which, like all the \nothers, could not be the subject of consensus. We still \nstand by it. We stand by the idea that this Organization \nmust modernize itself, and soon. We cannot allow a \nsituation where, in the absence of agreement, we end \nup by abandoning the spirit of reform that has inspired \nus up till now. \n  \n \n08-51606 20 \n \n I propose therefore that we agree, before the end \nof the decade, upon initial fundamental reforms which \nwill begin to turn the wheels of modernization. There \nare numerous examples in different parts of the world, \nas well as in my own experience as a member of the \nGovernment, that allow me to assure members that \nsmall reforms, which may appear insignificant to begin \nwith, eventually lead to other, more profound reforms. \nWe must start somewhere. \n I would like to express my gratitude to the \nGeneral Assembly for granting my country, Panama, \nthe honour of non-permanent membership of the \nSecurity Council over the past two years. Panamanian \ndiplomats and jurists contributed to the drafting of the \nCharter of the United Nations and, since that time, \nPanama\u2019s representatives have contributed the wealth \nof their experience so that the principles which inspired \nthe Charter can continue to prevail. You may rest \nassured that we will not rest until this Organization, so \nvital for peace in the world and the sole hope for \nmillions of the poor, is finally endowed with a legal \nstructure appropriate for the twenty-first century."

        "file_text": "Uruguay, one of the founding States of the United \nNations, sees the fundamental principles of its foreign \npolicy fully reflected in the Charter of this \nOrganization.  \n For that reason, we believe it important at the \noutset to reassert the validity of those principles in the \npresent international context and to emphasize once \nagain the traditional Uruguayan position of full respect \nfor international law, support for multilateralism, \npeaceful settlement of disputes, sovereign equality of \nStates, rejection of the use or threat of use of force, \nnon-intervention in the internal affairs of other States, \nthe self-determination of peoples, the promotion and \nprotection of human rights and international economic \nand social cooperation. \n It is worth repeating that this list is not simply an \ninventory of good intentions, but of legal principles \nand fundamental values. Their enshrinement in the \nCharter of the United Nations gives them the status of \ninternational law, to whose validity and enforcement \nall States must conform. \n Furthermore, those principles are crucial guiding \ntools in a world that presents us today with major \nchallenges. We, nations gathered here, have the moral \nand legal duty to find suitable solutions that will make \npeace and development the rule of coexistence for our \npeoples. \n As we all know, a severe food crisis is currently \nafflicting too many countries throughout the world. If a \nsustainable and lasting solution in to be found, we must \naddress the structural factors influencing and causing \nthe crisis. Correcting the distortions in the multilateral \ntrade system, in particular in agricultural trade, is \ncertainly a decisive element in ensuring a plentiful \nsupply of food that will meet the needs of the entire \npopulation of the planet. \n Uruguay believes that, in addition to tackling this \nserious crisis with urgent measures, we must make \nprogress towards a long-term solution. That inevitably \nmeans redoubling our efforts to strengthen the \nmultilateral trade system and swiftly resuming the \nnegotiations in the World Trade Organization. It is \nessential that we do so, particularly in the area of \nagriculture, in order to guarantee world food security \nand to avoid a reversion to protectionist practices that \nwould only further aggravate the situation.  \n The food crisis is not the only crisis affecting us, \nhowever; another major challenge facing the world \neconomy is undoubtedly that of energy. Here, as with \nagriculture, Latin America requires the technological \ncooperation of developed countries. Likewise, when it \ncomes to developing the production of alternative \nenergy sources, such as bioenergy and biofuels, \nresearch and technical assistance are essential if we are \nto benefit from the opportunities provided by such \nproduction without affecting food security or the \nenvironment. The United Nations has a crucially \nimportant catalytic role in that regard.  \n In addition, we cannot overlook the current \nfinancial crisis of the major developed countries, which \ndemonstrates the global interconnectedness and \ninterdependence among States. Although developing \ncountries are certainly not the cause of the crisis, its \neffects afflict and punish the economies of emerging \ncountries. \n  \n \n08-53129 30 \n \n With regard to the environment and sustainable \ndevelopment, Uruguay is a party to the major \ninternational conventions in that area. While we have \nemphasized the importance of international \ncooperation, we have also always emphasized the \nindividual responsibility of every State to actively \nprotect the environment in its own territory and waters, \nand have always valued the vigilant participation of \ncivil society in that regard.  \n That is why, while we receive significant \ninvestments that contribute to our industrial \ndevelopment, my country also exerts rigorous control \nover the environmental practices of the entities \ninvolved, applying internationally recognized standards \nand requiring the use of the most modern technologies \navailable, with effective control over the environmental \nimpact of those undertakings. The Uruguayan \nGovernment thus reaffirms its unwavering commitment \nto protecting the environment as a human right and as a \nfundamental component in the achievement of true \nsustainable development. \n Another major issue on the agenda of the General \nAssembly is the Millennium Development Goals \nagreed by Member States in September 2000, which \nUruguay has fully endorsed. In that context, Uruguay \nhas taken firm steps to achieve the Goals. We need \nonly highlight, among other policies with a significant \nsocial content, the recent launching of our \ncomprehensive national health system \u2014 aimed at \ntransforming the health-care model by prioritizing \nprimary health care and prevention in order to \nguarantee a basic right of all citizens \u2014 as part of the \nsocial inclusion policy that Uruguay is implementing.  \n Given its strict adherence to international law, \nUruguay is also firmly committed to consolidating \ninternational peace and security, as demonstrated by its \nstatus as one of the 10 major contributors of troops to \nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations and as the \nworld\u2019s largest contributor per capita in terms of troop \nnumbers. Our country is currently participating in \n16 United Nations peacekeeping missions deployed in \nAfrica, the Americas, Asia and Europe. Since we began \nto participate in peacekeeping missions, Uruguay has \ngained experience in matters related to reconstruction \nand peacebuilding in areas devastated by conflict, \nmaking great efforts to put an end to hostilities so that \nvarious societies and communities can agree on peace \nand achieve national reconciliation. \n However, as our international experience has \ntaught us, peacekeeping, while essential, is not \nsufficient to return affected countries to institutional \nnormalcy and an orderly and peaceful life. That is why \nthe strong involvement of the international community \nis needed in peacekeeping efforts to effectively ensure \nthe building of stable, democratic and prosperous \nsocieties through robust institutional mechanisms for \nresolving their conflicts. For that reason, Uruguay \nsubmitted its candidature to the Peacebuilding \nCommission in February 2007. We hope to be able to \ncontribute to the attainment of those noble objectives \nin that forum.   \n The cause of peace requires, in institutional \nterms, a strengthened and effective Organization. That \nbrings us to the topic of the United Nations reform \nprocess. The negotiations in that regard have not \nproceeded with the scope and speed originally \nenvisaged. Although the two recently established \nbodies, the Human Rights Council and the \nPeacebuilding Commission, have been in existence for \na few years, we have not yet been able to move on to \nSecurity Council reform \u2014 which is essential \u2014 and \nonly a few timid steps have been taken in the process \nof reforming the Secretariat and the General Assembly.  \n Uruguay reaffirms its support for the process of \nSecurity Council reform in the permanent and \nnon-permanent membership categories. However, we \nwill not support the creation of new members with the \nright of the veto, since we believe that the issue of \nextending the veto must not be included in the package \nto be agreed upon in the intergovernmental \nnegotiations. Moreover, in keeping with its traditional \nposition since the founding of the United Nations, our \ncountry disapproves of the right of veto, which is a \nprivilege that runs counter to the full democratization \nof our Organization.  \n In the area of reform, we also view the One \nUnited Nations pilot project in two ways. We see it \nfirst as an instrument through which reform of the \noperational activities of the United Nations system \ncould be put into practice; and secondly, as a \ncooperative exercise in areas of priority identified by \nthe Uruguayan Government in the context of a national \ndevelopment strategy based on sustained and \nsustainable economic growth with equity and social \njustice. However, we understand that the programme \nshould adapt itself to specific national priorities and \nneeds. That is why no single model is applicable to all \n \n \n31 08-53129 \n \npilot countries, given their inherent differences from \none another. \n I also wish to refer to a topic of particular \nrelevance for Uruguay \u2014 the situation of so-called \nmiddle-income countries. Those countries find \nthemselves in a paradoxical situation. Although there \nare certain indicators of economic growth, negative \ncircumstances that hinder sustainable and sustained \ngrowth in the medium- and long-terms have not been \ntaken into account, nor has it been possible to prevent \ndramatic erosion of some of the progress made. In \nparticular and with dramatic effect, the well-known \nclear vulnerability of the economies of developing \ncountries in a globalized world economy subjects them \nto the effects of external crises with clear, direct \nconsequences, such as rising poverty and inequity in \nincome distribution, as well as strengthened migratory \ntrends, to mention just some effects that Uruguay has \nexperienced directly.  \n Finally, in affirming its unwavering commitment \nto the fight against terrorism, Uruguay reiterates its \nrejection of all terrorist acts and vigorously condemns \nall attacks against civil populations and public \ninfrastructure, the destruction of which adversely \naffects the civil population. Terrorism must be \nunequivocally condemned and cooperation between \nStates must increase in order to ensure that such acts \ndo not go unpunished. \n We must be careful, however. The fight against \nterrorism must always be waged based on the rule of \nlaw, and consequently in the strictest respect for the \nstandards of international humanitarian and human \nrights law. \n The same applies to drug trafficking. Our country \nhas continued its unrelenting fight against illegal drug \ntrafficking. Our effort targets both supply and demand. \nThanks to that policy and beyond our success in \nstamping out the illicit traffic in those substances, our \ncountry has been at the vanguard of our continent in \nterms of its policies to prevent consumption and treat \nthose affected by drugs. \n Both terrorism and drug trafficking severely \ncompromise the full enjoyment of human rights, the \nsafeguarding of which has been one of the strategic \npolicies of the current Government. We want respect \nfor human rights to be more than routine rhetoric; it \nshould enjoy full expression in the daily life of its \ncitizens. On that basis, our country has prioritized \nstrengthening legislation and the competent national \nbodies, and has sought to extend international human \nrights and to consolidate institutions that effectively \nprotect and secure the international enjoyment of \nhuman rights and prevent their violation. In short, the \nprotection of human rights is one of the central axes of \nthe Republic\u2019s foreign policy and is without a doubt \nUruguay\u2019s basic political institutional asset. \n As is evident, the effective protection of human \nrights calls for a strong jurisdictional body to guarantee \nits application. In that context, the creation of the \nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) was a fundamental \ncontribution to the progressive development of \ninternational law and an event of tremendous legal and \npolitical importance. In 2006, Uruguay enacted a \nnational law pledging full cooperation with the ICC. \nRespectfully, we urge the international community as a \nwhole to do the same in order to prevent genocide, war \ncrimes and crimes against humanity from going \nunpunished. \n In conclusion, I would like to stress that, with \nconflicts threatening peace and international security \nand taking into account the growing interdependence \nof States as a result of globalization, it is now crucial \nto emphatically reaffirm the relevance of the United \nNations as the lead body and ultimate multilateral \nforum for finding appropriate solutions to today\u2019s \nmajor global challenges. \n The pursuit of multilateralism therefore implies a \nsearch for collective responses to international \nconflicts and problems, in accordance with \ninternational law and in the framework of the \nprinciples of the United Nations Charter, which \nregulates peaceful coexistence between nations. \nIndeed, we must uphold the ideals that inspired the \nestablishment of the Organization. That is a civilizing \nproject that we cannot abandon as it represents \nunfinished business that we owe it to ourselves and to \ngenerations to come to complete. "

        "file_text": "We are \nextremely pleased to see Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann presiding over the sixty-third session of the \nGeneral Assembly. I take this opportunity to express \nmy sincere thanks to His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \nSecretary-General of our Organization, for his \ncommitment and active role in the service of the \nUnited Nations and for promoting its ideals of justice \nand peace. \n The world today is faced with innumerable \nchallenges. We who govern our respective countries \nbear a heavy responsibility. We must become \nincreasingly concerned about the fate of our world. \nWhy are we going through all these crises? Why are \nthere so many centres of tension throughout the world? \nWhy is there so much poverty and vulnerability in our \nuniverse? Why is terrorism spreading throughout the \nglobe? Those are questions that must be addressed by \neach one of us, by our collective conscience and, first \nand foremost, by the United Nations, whose key \npurpose remains the defence of the ideals of peace, \njustice, solidarity and development. \n Today\u2019s reality is quite different. Unfortunately, \nall those values are far from being solidly established. \nThe most privileged nations must therefore show \ngreater concern for the fate of some parts of the world \nand, in particular, for developing countries where \nviolence, hunger, disease, injustice of all sorts conflicts \nand their consequences are facts of daily life. \n The double crisis of food and energy, to mention \nbut two, requires a new surge of solidarity at the \ninternational level. The crisis affects the entire world, \nbut is felt particularly in developing countries. \nFurthermore, we firmly believe in multilateralism. That \nis why the reform of the major organs of the United \nNations is required today to ensure greater firmness \nand effectiveness.  \n Last March, Operation Democracy in the \nComoros put an end to a rebellion that had shaken the \nisland of Anjouan and re-established constitutional \nlegality. As I promised, free, transparent and \ndemocratic elections took place on the island last June, \nenabling us to complete the establishment of local \nGovernments on the islands of the Union of the \nComoros. \n Therefore, I would like to pay heartfelt tribute to \nthe African Union, the League of Arab States and the \nfriendly countries of Tanzania, the Sudan, Libya, \nMorocco, Senegal, France and the United States of \nAmerica, which have all supported us morally, \nmaterially or financially in our task to complete \nwithout bloodshed the delicate operation of freeing the \nisland of Anjouan. \n Firmly resolved to consolidate the renewed \nstability and in line with the commitment made to our \npartners, I have decided to organize as soon as possible \nan inter-Comorian conference to bring together \npolitical movements, local island Governments, civil \nsociety and the Comoros\u2019 partners. The conference will \nfocus on the outstanding institutional issues that have \nlong been a source of misunderstanding between the \ncentral Government and the federal entities. Initial \ncontacts with the international community have been \nestablished to muster the support necessary to convene \nthat national gathering which is required to improve \nthe functioning of our national institutions. \n Economic difficulties cannot allow us to lose \nsight of other major challenges, including environmental \nproblems, which particularly affect the small island \ndeveloping States, of which the Indian Ocean islands \nare a part. Thus, as head of State of the country \ncurrently holding the chairmanship of the Indian Ocean \nCommission, which has observer status at the United \nNations, I would like to reiterate our subregional \norganization\u2019s desire to contribute to implementing the \nMauritius Strategy. I also take this opportunity to thank \nthe European Union for having agreed to finance a \nprogramme of support for the Indian Ocean \nCommission within the framework of the tenth \nEuropean Development Fund as the Union\u2019s \n \n \n15 08-51845 \n \ncontribution to the implementation of the Mauritius \nStrategy. \n I appeal to the United Nations and to the \ninternational community to support the efforts of the \nIndian Ocean Commission to ensure the successful \ndevelopment and integration of its Member States and \nto pay particular attention to the issue of implementing \nthe Mauritius Strategy. \n Every individual and every nation aspires to \njustice, dignity and freedom. Those are the ideals of the \nUnited Nations system to which we must remain \nfaithful if peace, security and development are to \nensure the progress of humanity. \n On the basis of respect for those values, allow me \nto inform this Assembly of the great concern of the \npeople and the Government of the Comoros with \nregard to the issue of the Comorian island of Mayotte. I \nwould like to note that, following talks undertaken with \nFrance on that issue since last September following my \nmeeting with President Nicolas Sarkozy, I did not \nintend to raise the issue at this session. The high-level \nworking group that was set up for that purpose on the \ninitiative of the French President provides, I believe, \nan ideal bilateral framework to study all aspects of the \nissue. \n However, the intention recently declared by the \nFrench authorities to organize a referendum in 2009 \nwith a view to transforming Mayotte into a French \ndepartment forces me to raise the issue here. It will be \nagreed that such a decision, coming at a moment when \ndiscussions are under way between the two parties, will \nnot favour an open and constructive dialogue. \nTherefore, in order to throw further light on the \njustification of the Comorian claim to the island of \nMayotte, allow me to set out certain important facts \nthat need to be taken into account when we analyse the \nissue.  \n Throughout the years of French colonization, the \nComorian archipelago, comprised of the four islands of \nAnjouan, Grande Comore, Mayotte and Moh\u00e9li, was a \nsingle physical, geographical, religious, cultural and \nlinguistic entity. Under French domestic law, and ever \nsince Anjouan, Grande Comore and Moh\u00e9li were \nestablished as a French protectorate, they were \ncombined with Mayotte to form a single territory. \n The first text on that issue was the decree of \nSeptember 1889. Since then, the political and \nadministrative unity of the Comoros archipelago has \nnever been questioned in any document, despite the \nplethora of provisions adopted with regard to the \nComoros. I would refer, for example, to the law of \n9 May 1946, the law of 17 April 1952, the decree of \n22 July 1957, the law of 22 December 1961 and the \nlaw of 3 January 1968. \n Thus, each time the French legislature or \nregulatory authority has acted, it has done so by \nconsidering the archipelago of the Comoros to \nconstitute a single territory.  \n It is clear then that the French Republic has never \ncalled into question the territorial unity of the \narchipelago of the Comoros, while international public \nopinion has consistently considered that the four \nislands of the Comoros form a single territory, subject \nto the French Republic and administered most recently \nunder the provisions of article 72 and following the \nFrench Constitution. \n It was in that spirit that at the end of 1974 we \nimplemented the procedure provided for by article 53 \nof the French Constitution, which aimed to gain the \nsupport of those affected by the accession to \nindependence of the archipelago of the Comoros. \n In accordance with the law of 23 November 1974, \nthe people of the archipelago of the Comoros were \ninvited to vote on whether they wished the territory to \ngain independence.  \n In all the islands, namely, in Anjouan, Moh\u00e9li, \nMayotte and Grande Comore, on 22 December 1974, \noverall a positive answer was given to the question \nposed.  \n The question was put to the Comorian people as a \nsingle, indivisible people and over 96 per cent voted in \nfavour of independence, in accordance with the law \nbased on article 53 of the French Constitution. \n However, at that time the French Parliament, \nrather than simply ratifying that decision of the people, \nwanted to draw up another law organizing another \nreferendum on the pretext that in Mayotte about 60 per \ncent had voted against. \n But the question had been put to the Comorian \npeople, comprising the population of Mayotte, \nAnjouan, Moh\u00e9li and Grande Comore, and the result \ntranslated into overall terms as that did not in any way \naffect the letter and spirit of the law. \n  \n \n08-51845 16 \n \n Faced with the unwillingness of the French \nParliament at that time to recognize the irrevocable \nverdict of the Comorian people, the late President \nAhmed Abdallah Abd\u00e9r\u00e9mane, with the backing of the \nComorian people, unilaterally declared the \nindependence of the Comoros on 6 July 1975. \n Looking beyond such measures, which come \nunder French domestic law, I should like to stress the \nprinciple of the inviolability, under international law, \nof borders inherited from the colonial era and thereby \nto make it clear that the Comorian demand is indeed in \nconformity with the law.  \n Lastly, I would like to remind the Assembly that \nthe Comoros, comprising Mayotte, Anjouan, Moh\u00e9li \nand Grande Comore, was admitted into this prestigious \nOrganization on 12 November 1975, as demarcated by \nits borders, without France showing its opposition to \nthat admission. \n Today, there are good grounds for our great \nconcern over France\u2019s official statements regarding the \ndepartmentalization of the Comorian island of \nMayotte. Those statements are not in keeping with the \nprinciples of justice, fairness and respect for \ninternational law, for which the great country of France \nis known.  \n For that reason, my country as of now considers \nany ballot organized on the question of making the \nComorian island Mayotte a department to be null and \nvoid. Such are the facts \u2014 and the facts speak for \nthemselves. \n However, today the reality is that France is in \nMayotte notwithstanding the relevant resolutions of the \nUnited Nations and all the other international \norganizations that have been regularly seized of the \nmatter. Against that background, I have entered into \ntalks with the French President, His Excellency \nMr. Nicolas Sarkozy, who has shown a willingness to \nfind a solution to the problem. \n It may therefore be hoped that that legitimate \nclaim of the Comoros to the island of Mayotte will \nsoon have a happy outcome. I am particularly \nconfident of that, because many outstanding problems \nthroughout the world have been settled and others are \non the way to being settled since His Excellency \nPresident Nicolas Sarkozy assumed France\u2019s highest \noffice.  \n Let me take this opportunity to make a solemn \nappeal to the French Government to strive to preserve a \nclimate conducive to a committed dialogue, which has \nour support and which, in order to result in a \nnegotiated settlement will need to take into account the \nconcern of the Comoros that its national unity and \nterritorial integrity be respected.  \n Moreover, I urge the international community to \nhelp to reconcile the views of the two parties along \nthose lines, because the unity of the four islands of the \nComoros, as well as peace and lasting stability for the \narchipelago, are a prerequisite for its harmonious \ndevelopment. \n In conclusion, may I express the sincere thanks of \nthe Comorian delegation to all the American authorities \nfor the particularly warm welcome and the good \narrangements made to ensure the success of this sixty-\nthird session of the General Assembly.

        "file_text": "I am \nhighly honoured to address the Assembly on behalf of \nthe Government of the citizen revolution, of the \nPresident of Ecuador, Rafael Correa Delgado, and of \nthe people of Ecuador at these paradoxical times of \nboth crisis and hope. \n Allow me to convey the fraternal greetings of the \npeople and the Government of Ecuador to you, Sir \u2014 \nPresident of the Assembly and former Minister of \nForeign Affairs of Nicaragua, Father Miguel d\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann \u2014 on your election to such an important \nposition. We agree with you on the need to attach the \nhighest priority to the fight to eradicate poverty and to \npay special attention to relevant issues such as climate \nchange, the energy and food crises, human rights, \ndisarmament, the rights of women and children and the \npreservation of cultural and biodiversity. \n With the end of the cold war, we believed, not \nwithout reason, that the confrontation between two \nways of life and two great Powers would give way to \nthe solution of the planet\u2019s pressing economic and \nsocial problems. Two decades have elapsed since that \nhistoric date, and we see with concern that that crisis \nhas deepened, that social cohesion is harder to obtain, \nthat new threats to security have intensified, and that \nthe use of force and the number of conflicts have \nincreased. \n My country is convinced that the strengthening of \nthe multilateral system is an imperative in the world of \ntoday. We have no other option to guarantee peace and \nsecurity in the world than to renew our political \ndecision to progress in the reform of the United \nNations system, and in particular of the Security \nCouncil. This year, we have taken a significant step in \nthat direction with the General Assembly\u2019s adoption of \ndecision 62/557, which provides a general framework \nto advance these negotiations. Let us hope that we \nmake progress. \n The debate on the need to increase membership \nof the Security Council and to democratize the Council \nand make its working methods more transparent and \ninclusive is undoubtedly one of the fundamental \nelements of the reform process. However, at the same \ntime, we should not forget that another of the central \npoints required to give back to the United Nations the \nrole that it should have is to strengthen its democratic \nand representative organ par excellence, namely the \nGeneral Assembly. \n Nor should we forget that any process of reform \nwill be incomplete if it does not include the \ndemocratization of the organizations that make up the \nUnited Nations system. In the twenty-first century we \ncannot continue working with a system in which most \ncountries cannot access the decision-making bodies \n  \n \n08-53135 36 \n \nbecause of structures that respond to the special \ncircumstances that prevailed when those bodies were \ncreated. We need to urgently build a multilateral \nsystem that responds promptly and effectively to \ntoday\u2019s challenges and that recognizes the fundamental \nprinciples of international law, such as the sovereign \nequality of States. Only with thorough-going reform \ncan the United Nations regain the lead role that it \nshould play in international affairs. \n We cannot understand that States Members of this \nOrganization continue supporting peacekeeping \nbudgets of billions of dollars and yet have serious \nconcerns about increasing budgets for development \nprogrammes, especially fundamentally important \nprogrammes to fight poverty, HIV/AIDS, malaria and \nthe effects of climate change. Our citizens are \nbeginning to call us to account with regard to the \nresources that we contribute annually to this \nOrganization and the results that we obtain. That is \nwhy we consider positive the proposal stressed by the \nPresident of the General Assembly to commence a \ntruly thorough and democratic reform of this \nOrganization. \n To work for development and the reduction of \npoverty and to deal adequately with the needs of \nmillions of human beings who are struggling today in \nmisery, disease and despair, is an absolute requirement \nin order to guarantee peace and security. Therefore, my \ncountry assigns high priority to economic and social \npolicies aimed at overcoming unequal distribution of \nincome and employment, and at guaranteeing the right \nof its population to health, education and social \nsecurity. These efforts must be accompanied by \ndecisive and effective support from developed \ncountries, through a substantial increase in official \ndevelopment assistance (ODA) \u2014 cooperation that \ncannot be subject to conditions of any kind and that \nmust supplement national efforts based on sovereign \ndevelopment policies. \n There is still much to do, however, if we are to \nachieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \nAs we have stated in several forums, Ecuador \nconsiders that the MDGs are basic minima for survival \nand that we should go beyond them. In our country, we \nhave left behind an outdated concept based on market \ngrowth indices and are currently working actively and \nwith impressive results on increasing the quality of life \nof the citizens of Ecuador. We call this concept of \n\u201cbuen vivir\u201d \u2014 \u201cliving well\u201d \u2014 which means living \nwith dignity and in accordance with our cultural values \nand in harmony with nature. \n Ecuador and, I am sure, all developing countries \nhope that the Doha Conference on Financing for \nDevelopment will produce positive results for our \ncountries, such as access to external financing for \ndevelopment, relief of the external debt servicing \nburden, the reform of international financial \ninstitutions and the effective alignment of official \ndevelopment assistance with the national strategies and \npolicies adopted by sovereign countries, together with \nthe strong commitment of donor countries to allocate at \nleast 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product \n(GDP) to official development assistance. Middle-\nincome countries deserve special attention since they \naccount for more than 41 per cent of the poor of the \nplanet. \n The United Nations should actively promote \nSouth-South cooperation. We believe that the High-\nlevel United Nations Conference on South-South \nCooperation to be convened by the General Assembly \nin 2009 is evidence of the role which the Organization \nshould play in this area. It will constitute an excellent \nopportunity to strengthen and enhance this important \ncooperation. \n Likewise, it is necessary that there be a special \nplace for economic and social development in the work \nof the United Nations. Without a total fulfilment of the \ncommitments that have been undertaken and without a \ntrue inclusion of our needs based on our own agendas \nfor development, we cannot talk of international peace \nand security. \n Ecuador wishes to highlight, at this juncture, the \nvital role that the Group of 77 and China and the \nNon-Aligned Movement (NAM) have to play on these \nand other issues. During the last NAM ministerial \nmeeting, held in Tehran, Iran, in July, we reiterated our \nconviction that this important mechanism of political \nagreement is central in ensuring that our countries\u2019 \ninterests are fully taken into account. \n Ecuador also assigns importance to the role of the \nUnited Nations in establishing a world order based on \nrespect for international law, the norms and principles \nset out in the Charter, and the promotion of and respect \nfor human rights international humanitarian Law. \n My country supports the actions the United \nNations is taking to address the serious security \n \n \n37 08-53135 \n \nproblems we face, such as the fight against terrorism, \nthe worldwide drug problem and the fight against \ntransnational organized crime. Accordingly, we \nwelcomed the recent positive outcome of the first \nreview of progress in the implementation of the Global \nCounter-Terrorism Strategy. My country will continue \nto give its support to these important initiatives. \n Ecuador also supports negotiations aimed at the \neventual adoption of a legally binding convention on \nterrorism. However, we believe that, given the vitally \nimportant implications of the issue, such a convention \nshould expressly and unequivocally cover the \nobligations of all States to fight terrorism in the \nframework of international law, human rights, \ninternational humanitarian law and the principles and \nnorms established in the Charter of the United Nations. \n The fight against terrorism cannot be an excuse \nfor some States to feel released from their obligation to \nrespect fundamental norms of international law, such as \nrespect for the sovereignty and the territorial integrity \nof other States and non-intervention in their internal \naffairs. Likewise, the violation of the human rights of \nalleged terrorists \u2014 who have been tortured, \nincarcerated in clandestine military prisons and \ndeprived of the basic right to defend themselves \u2014 \nalso constitutes a very serious precedent. These \npractices must be condemned by the international \ncommunity. Sovereignty, the inviolability of territory, \nthe non-use of force and non-intervention in the affairs \nof other States are the only guarantee for peaceful \ncoexistence among the peoples of the world. \n Ecuador assigns high priority to the actions of the \ninternational community to ensure that States comply \nin good faith with their human rights obligations. We \nbelieve that the Human Rights Council, which is \nconsolidating its position as the best mechanism for the \npreservation and protection of human rights, has \nsubstantially improved its working methods. But all \ncountries must make an effort to set aside their \npolitical objectives to allow the Council to effectively \nfulfil the purposes for which it was created. \n Ecuador feels that the Universal Periodic Review \nsystem established by the Council is a good step in that \ndirection. For this reason, my country was glad to be \nthe second country in the world to submit its review, in \nApril 2008. On that occasion, we reiterated our \nunfailing commitment to respect for and protection of \nhuman rights. We were able to share with the \ninternational community the substantial advances made \nin the implementation of our national human rights \nplan, and we voluntarily made additional \ncommitments. \n The adoption of the United Nations Declaration \non the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was a milestone. \nMy country was actively involved in the negotiation of \nthat important instrument and is now committed to its \nimplementation and follow-up in order to contribute to \nnational policies aimed at consolidating the identity, \nculture and effective exercise of the political, economic \nand cultural rights of the indigenous peoples and \nnationalities of Ecuador. \n The issue of migration is of singular importance \nto my country. The Government of Ecuador is therefore \nimplementing a comprehensive immigration policy, \ncontained in the National Human Development Plan \nfor Migration, that includes programmes, projects and \nactions aimed at guaranteeing the protection and a \ncomprehensive approach to migration issues and of \nmigrant persons, regardless of their origin or \nadministrative status within the territory of a State. \n The free movement of persons is a right that must \nbe protected, and I believe that no Government \nrepresented here is opposed to that. However, the \nregulation of such movement must be in strict \naccordance with the principles of international \nhumanitarian law and the human rights of migrants. In \nthe words of the President of my country, Rafael \nCorrea Delgado, \u201cthere are no illegal human beings, \nonly practices that violate the rights of persons\u201d. In \nthat respect, we are deeply disturbed by the return \ndirective issued by the European Union. We believe \nthat, today more than ever before, our countries must \njoin together to demand effective compliance with the \nobligations arising from international human rights and \non migration agreements. Emigration and return must \nboth be an expression of freedom. \n The new Constitution of Ecuador establishes the \nprinciple of universal citizenship, the free movement of \nall peoples on Earth, and a progressive end to the \nconcept of \u201cforeignness\u201d in order to transform unequal \nrelations between countries, especially between the \nNorth and the South. We must not forget that migration \nis often a direct consequence of economic models \nbased on exclusion, in which the market, the \naccumulation of wealth and selfishness paper over the \ntrue needs of human beings. \n  \n \n08-53135 38 \n \n As I said, humanism and solidarity are \nfundamental principles that guide the actions of the \nGovernment of Ecuador. That is why my country \nadopted a State policy on refugees on 16 September of \nthis year. That policy is aimed at providing \ncomprehensive assistance to persons placed under the \nprotection of Ecuador. \n We will honour all our national and international \ncommitments regarding refuge seekers, but we need \nthe determined cooperation of the international \ncommunity. We must not forget that Ecuador is \ncurrently the country with the largest number of \npersons in need of international protection in the entire \nwestern hemisphere. According to studies conducted by \nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \nfor Refugees, there are approximately 200,000 \nColombian citizens in need of international protection \nwithin the territory of Ecuador. Ecuador is now \nimplementing a process of extended registration, which \nwill benefit thousands of Colombian brothers in urgent \nneed of international protection. \n The severity of the world food crisis is an issue \nthat our countries must address in a comprehensive \nmanner while taking all of its dimensions into account. \nIn that respect, Ecuador believes that subsidies and \nother trade distortions have a serious impact on the \nagricultural sectors of developing countries. For that \nreason, Ecuador firmly supports the proposal to hold a \nspecial session on that issue during the sixty-third \nsession of the General Assembly. \n In addition, Ecuador is compelled to highlight the \ncurrent financial crisis, which also deserves our \nOrganization\u2019s particular attention. The crisis is further \nproof of the decline of our current economic system, \nwhich prioritizes speculative capital over productive \ncapital, threatens the common good and endangers the \ndevelopment prospects of the majority of world. It is \nnot a country-specific crisis, but a systemic crisis of \ncapitalism that calls for profound and comprehensive \nresponses. \n Ecuador\u2019s foreign policy reflects its firm \ncommitment to disarmament and the non-proliferation \nof weapons of mass destruction. Ecuador has not only \nadhered to international instruments in that field, but \nalso supports and carries out all the obligations \nemanating from those instruments in order to achieve \ntheir effective implementation. We are concerned by \nthe fact that there are countries that, regrettably, have \nnot adhered to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons, while others that have adhered to it \nare not meeting their obligations, especially in terms of \ndisarmament and the destruction of their arsenals. With \nregard to that policy issue, Ecuador welcomes the \nadoption, in Dublin in July, of the Convention on \nCluster Munitions. My country will sign the \nConvention in a ceremony to be held in Oslo on \n3 December 2008. \n Other issues of great concern to my country \ninclude the fight against transnational organized crime \nand its ramifications, the production and illicit traffic \nof narcotics, corruption, the manufacturing and illicit \ntraffic in small arms and light weapons, and human \ntrafficking. We believe that the United Nations has \ntaken decisive steps on those issues by adopting \ninternational conventions that allow for cooperation \nbetween our countries in the fight against those \nscourges. We believe that adequate and equitable \ninternational cooperation is essential. Such \ncooperation, as I said, must respond to the needs of our \ncountries and be aimed at supporting national policies. \n Ecuador is convinced that a strong and effective \nmultilateral system is the only means for the world to \novercome the problems it faces and, above all, to \nguarantee the well-being of peoples and international \npeace and security. It is therefore incumbent upon us to \ntransform the United Nations. \n To conclude, I have the pleasure of announcing to \nthe world that Ecuador has made a new step towards \nthe strengthening of our democracy. Yesterday, the \nEcuadorian nation approved by an ample majority a \nnew political Constitution \u2014 a new social pact based \non a transformed relationship between the State, the \neconomy and politics, creating a new model of \ndevelopment aimed at human welfare and harmony \nwith nature.

        "file_text": "I \nreceived the news of your election to the General \nAssembly presidency, Sir, with a brother\u2019s pride. \nTwenty-one years ago, it was through war in Central \nAmerica that we became acquainted. Today it is peace \nthat allows us to meet once more. In the name of the \npeople of Costa Rica, and in my own name as well, I \nam honoured to extend to you a brotherly Central \nAmerican greeting. \n I have come here to speak words of the urgency \nthat any leader feels at decisive moments in history. \nThis is not just any year. While we hold this General \nAssembly, millions of people who used to be able to \nmeet their most basic needs have seen the face of \npoverty once again. Hunger, that abominable monster \nthat we had escaped for so many years, has returned to \nchase away the dreams of humanity. Pessimism and \nhopelessness have taken control of our economies, and, \nas always, the poorest among us will pay the \nconsequences. World military spending has reached \n$3.3 billion per day, but international aid continues to \nreach the poorest countries at a snail\u2019s pace and fails to \nreach middle-income countries altogether. Brutal \nhurricanes and intense droughts remind us that this \nplanet reacts to our irrationality, and the time that \nremains for us may be a countdown to disaster if we do \nnot make a change. \n It may be that in no other General Assembly have \nissues more global than now been discussed. Our \ninterdependence has made us all vulnerable, but in that \ninterdependence also lies our strength. In the past, a \nnation could avert its gaze from distant suffering and \nscorn the pain of others. Today, that option does not \nexist. Every victory and every failure is shared.  \n The man who, motivated by hunger, cuts down a \ntree in the virgin Amazon rainforest unwittingly \ndeprives us of a fraction of the air we breathe in this \nroom. The European mother who is forced to buy less \nfood because she cannot afford the costs unwittingly \naffects the economy of all nations in the world. The \nAfrican child who drops out of school because of a \nlack of resources unwittingly determines the future \nperformance of our species. We are all united in that, \nand perhaps for the first time in history, no one can \nlook in another direction. We are seated simultaneously \nat the prosecutor\u2019s bench and at the defence table, in \nthe public gallery and in the judge\u2019s chair.  \n We must take advantage of this moment when \nequality among nations is seen in the equality of our \nchallenges. We will not be able to face our realities \nunless we understand them completely. We will not be \nable to shine the light of reason upon our Earth if we \nintentionally leave some regions in the dark. If we are \nseriously to take up the challenges of our time it is \nright that like that old protagonist of the Charles \nDickens tale, we open our eyes to our past, our present \nand our future; we must guarantee peace and justice for \nthe past, peace and development for the present, peace \nand nature for the future. \n In the Preamble to the United Nations Charter, \nthe States that make up this Organization undertook to \nestablish conditions under which justice can be \n \n \n41 08-51839 \n \nmaintained. Of those conditions, perhaps the most \nimportant is will: the will to demand that our \nobligations are fulfilled; the will to speak out when \ninternational law is violated; and, above all, the will to \nensure that acts that are an affront to all humankind do \nnot go unnoticed. \n Evil springs not only from action but also and, \nabove all, from omission. To keep silent when crimes \nare grave and responsibilities are clear is not to remain \nneutral but is to side with the aggressors. Our recent \npast is marked by horrendous, unpunished crimes that \ncall out, not for vengeance, but for justice. We cannot \naccept that evil is banal. If we do not want to repeat the \npainful history of Kosovo and Bosnia, of Rwanda and \nKampuchea, then it is time for the international \ncommunity to demand that those responsible for the \ncrimes committed in Darfur be judged before the \ninternational criminal court. Costa Rica will oppose \nany attempt to avoid such a path, which is the path of \npeace. Forgiveness is based on memory, not on \ndissimulation; and peace will be possible only through \nmemory. We must understand, in the words of Elie \nWiesel, \u201cthat the memory of evil will serve as a shield \nagainst evil; that the memory of death will serve as a \nshield against death\u201d. \n If the spirit of the past calls on us to hold people \nresponsible for the violation of human rights, the spirit \nof the present calls on us to ensure that those rights are \nfulfilled today. Governments can indirectly hurt their \npeoples in many ways, one of which is excessive \nmilitary spending. In developing nations, in particular, \nevery long-range missile, every helicopter gunship and \nevery tank is a symbol of the deferred needs of our \npeople. On a planet where one sixth of the population \nlives on less than a dollar a day, spending $1.2 trillion \non arms and soldiers is an offence and a symbol of \nirrationality because the security of a satisfied world is \nmore certain than the security of an armed world. Latin \nAmerica is not immune to this phenomenon. Last year \nLatin American military spending reached $39 billion, \nin a region that has never been more peaceful or more \ndemocratic. \n I know of no greater perversion of values and no \ngreater misplacement of priorities. With a small \npercentage of world military spending we could give \ndrinking water to all of humanity, equip all homes with \nelectricity, achieve universal literacy, and eradicate all \npreventable diseases. I am not talking about the utopia \nof a world without armies. Unfortunately, that is an \nidea whose time has not yet come. I am talking about \ntiny percentages of an expenditure that could be \nreduced without harming the ability of countries to \ndefend themselves \u2014 particularly developing \ncountries. That is why my Government has presented \nthe Costa Rica consensus, an initiative that would \nestablish mechanisms to forgive debts and use \ninternational financial resources to support developing \nnations that spend more and more on environmental \nprotection, education, health care and housing for their \npeople and less and less on arms and soldiers. I am \nconvinced that that will bring us greater development, \ngreater security and greater peace than all the money \nthat we have now set aside for our armies. I humbly \nask members today to support this initiative. \n I also ask for members\u2019 support for the arms trade \ntreaty that Costa Rica is advocating within this \nOrganization, to prohibit the transfer of arms to States, \ngroups or individuals if there is sufficient reason to \nbelieve that those arms will be used to violate human \nrights or international law, or to interfere with \nsustainable development. The destructive power of the \nworld\u2019s existing 640 million small arms and light \nweapons, most in the hands of civilians, deserves the \nsame attention or even more attention than military \nspending. \n However, no matter how urgent it may be to \nensure the present development of our peoples, it is \nequally important to ensure their future development. \nThe spirit of the future, as we look ahead to it, offers \nus a desolate image. Imagine an unending desert, a \ncracked ground too hot to stand on. Imagine a planet \nwhere life has been displaced and only cockroaches, if \nanything, can survive. Imagine a world whose range of \ncolours, which until now has been endless, is reduced \nto grays and dark browns. Imagine polluted air, \nimpossible to breathe. \u201cThis is not a poor copy of \nJohn\u2019s delirium during his exile on Patmos\u201d as Gabriel \nGarcia M\u00e1rquez once said. I am not describing the \nApocalypse but simply the world that awaits us if we \ndo not take action right away to declare \u201cpeace with \nnature\u201d. \n Sixty years ago an illustrious Costa Rican, a \nvisionary and brave man, Jos\u00e9 Figueres Ferrer, \nabolished my country\u2019s army. What had been the \ngeneral headquarters of the Costa Rican armed forces \nis today our main national museum. Our children have \nnever seen a column of soldiers on the march; they \nknow only the march of columns of ants. No Costa \n  \n \n08-51839 42 \n \nRican children know the difference between this or that \nmissile, or this or that combat plane, but they can \ndistinguish among the trees of the forest and the \nanimals of the sea; they know the importance of the \nwater cycle, of wind energy, of rivers and of sun. Ours \nis a nation of peace among humans, but we also aspire \nto be a nation of peace with all forms of life. \n We have set a goal of becoming carbon-neutral \nby 2021. Last year we became the world leader for the \nnumber of trees per capita and square kilometre, \nplanting 5 million trees. In 2008 we will plant \n7 million more. We are leading an international crusade \nagainst global warming and environmental destruction, \nwith a special focus on the planet\u2019s primary forests. \nToday, Assembly members, I ask you to join us. \n The march of humanity through history is neither \nlinear nor continuous. It is marked by detours and \npitfalls, and even by painful setbacks. As in Pedro \nCalder\u00f3n de la Barc\u00e1\u2019s play La Vida es Sue\u00f1a, one \nmorning we awake as princes and the next we are no \nmore than beggars. But not everything in life is a \ndream. There are concrete realities that we have been \nable to build. There are indisputable achievements in \nthe history of humankind. This Organization is one of \nthem. Members may tell me that the United Nations is \nfounded on the search for peace, understanding among \npeoples and respect for international law. That is all \ntrue. But I dare to say that more than anything else this \nOrganization is founded on hope, the hope that our \nmarch is upward, that our future will be better, and that \na promised land lies behind the deserts of violence and \ninjustice that, with courage, we have been able to \ncross. \n I assure this Assembly that if we confront the \nspirit of our past, of our present and of our future, if we \nbuild peace on a base of justice, development and \nnature, and if we turn away from forgetfulness, arms \nand environmental destruction we will reach that \npromised land some day and our children and our \nchildren\u2019s children will never again be beggars in the \nkingdom of their dreams.

        "file_text": "I would \nlike to warmly congratulate Mr. d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, \non his election to preside over our debates and to \nassure him of the full support of Burkina Faso. I would \nalso like to express to his predecessor, Mr. Kerim, all \nmy appreciation for the skill with which he guided the \nwork of the sixty-second session.  \n It is also my pleasure to pay well-deserved tribute \nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, who is \ninvesting his efforts with foresight and dedication to \nensure the success of the reform of our Organization in \norder to build a safer world and to ensure continuing \nprogress. I would like to reiterate in particular our \nwarm thanks to him for the visit he made to our \ncountry last April. \n This session of the General Assembly is taking \nplace at the midpoint in the timetable for attaining the \nMillennium Development Goals and in an international \ncontext marked by threats to global peace. The food \nand energy crises have been joined by a financial crisis \nof exceptional seriousness. This session is therefore \ncrucial and provides us with a great opportunity to \nassess the measures that have been taken and to take \nthe necessary corrective measures.  \n In that respect, I welcome the initiative to \norganize a high-level meeting on the midterm review \nof the Millennium Development Goals. The \n \n \n31 08-51749 \n \nconclusions of that meeting, I firmly believe, will help \nus to establish appropriate strategies to speed up the \nachievement of the Goals.  \n The current food crisis throughout the world has \namply demonstrated the ineffectiveness of our \nagricultural policies and the fragility of our production \nand trading systems. It is urgent to improve how \ninternational institutions function, to relaunch \ninvestment in agriculture and to support farmers\u2019 and \nprofessional organizations in innovative partnerships. \nTo that end, it is important that we commit ourselves to \nmajor investment in farming, improved organization \nfor producers, greater control of water resources, more \neffective distribution of seeds and fertilizers, and \nsimpler access to land. \n The energy crisis helps us to prioritize our search \nfor lasting solutions in favour of renewable \nresources \u2014 solar, nuclear, wind and bioenergy \nresources \u2014 because of the impact of energy-related \nfactors on States\u2019 development strategies. \n Official development assistance has decreased in \nrecent years in terms of the level of funding and its \neffectiveness. Beyond the central and recurring \nquestion of the level of official development \nassistance, there are four other dimensions that I \nbelieve are crucial. Those dimensions are, first, \nownership of economic policies and support for \ncapacity-building in governance in our States; \nsecondly, harmonizing and simplifying donor \nprocedures; thirdly, the gradual alignment of assistance \nwith national development priorities and programmes; \nand fourthly, improved coordination between our \ntechnical and financial partners on the ground, under \nthe leadership of Governments.  \n Those are the main requirements with regard to \nensuring more effective public aid. I take this \nopportunity to express my thanks to all our \ndevelopment partners who have always supported us as \nwe strive for encouraging results. \n The scourge of drugs and narcotics is a threat to \nAfrica in general and the West African subregion in \nparticular. Used as departure and transit points for \nexporting illegal drugs, some parts of our countries are \nexperiencing a genuine cross-border crime wave. The \nrapid eradication of that scourge requires the solidarity \nand active support of the international community. \n With regard to environmental issues, the \ninternational community must invest more if it is to \nbring appropriate responses to the climate change \naffecting our planet. Scientific and political ideas must \nbe aimed today at protecting and preserving a fully \nfunctioning ecosystem for future generations. \n Resolving conflicts throughout the world, and \nparticularly on the African continent, represents a \nmajor challenge for the community of nations. Burkina \nFaso, which currently holds the presidency of the \nEconomic Community of West African States and the \nWest African Economic and Monetary Union is making \nits contribution to enhancing peace and security, which \nare indispensable to ensuring progress and democracy. \nIn Africa, centres of tension remain, but we can \nwelcome the remarkable progress achieved by \nnumerous mediation efforts in various regions, which \nhave demonstrated the capacity of Africans to resolve \ntheir disputes for themselves. \n In Darfur, the Security Council\u2019s decision has \nallowed the deployment of the African Union-United \nNations Hybrid Operation. Burkina Faso, which is \ntaking part in that peacekeeping operation, welcomes \nthe appointment of Mr. Djibril Yip\u00e8n\u00e8 Bassol\u00e9 as the \nJoint African Union-United Nations Chief Mediator for \nDarfur. Given the complexity of his mission, I call on \nthe international community to give him its full support \nand to ensure a rapid resumption of the political \ndialogue and to strengthen the operational capacities of \nthe hybrid force. \n We are also concerned by the erosion of the \nSomali State and its post-electoral crises. With regard \nto Western Sahara, we are encouraged by the efforts \nmade by the parties to the conflict, particularly the \nKingdom of Morocco, and by the Security Council\u2019s \ncall for a realistic settlement.  \n The Sahelo-Saharan region has been affected by \npersistent insecurity for many years. Collective efforts \nat dialogue and cooperation are required to restore \npeace and security there. In that regard, we welcome \nand support the Algiers accord reached recently \nbetween the Government of Mali and the Tuareg \nrebels.  \n Burkina Faso also welcomes the progress made in \nthe Middle East. The strengthening of Lebanese \nsovereignty, the creation of a viable Palestinian State \nand security guarantees for Israel will contribute to \nestablishing lasting peace in that region. \n  \n \n08-51749 32 \n \n With regard to the Iranian nuclear issue, I hope \nthat reason will prevail and that negotiations will \nreconcile Iran\u2019s rights to civil nuclear power and the \nlegitimate fears of the international community with \nregard to military nuclear proliferation.  \n In Afghanistan and Iraq, the situation continues to \nbe tragic and to claim new victims every day, most of \nwhom are innocent civilians. Burkina Faso will \ncontinue to invest with the entire international \ncommunity in re-establishing peace in those countries. \n The news today is dominated by the conflict \ntaking place in the Caucasus. While reasserting its \nsupport for negotiations by the European Union, \nBurkina Faso hopes that the solution to the crisis will \nbe based on inclusive dialogue and respect for \ninternational legality.  \n I note with pleasure an improvement in relations \nbetween the Republic of China or Taiwan and the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China. I deeply hope that this \nnew spirit will open the way to Taiwan\u2019s participation \nin the activities of international organizations. \n For many years now, the United Nations has been \ncommitted to a process of reforms that should lead to \nthe improved effectiveness of its activities in the face \nof the demands of the modern world. Despite the \nprogress that has been made, much remains to be done. \nOur resolve to reach that goal must remain constant. \n Burkina Faso has deep faith in multilateralism \nand solidarity among peoples. We reassert our \nwillingness to make our contribution wherever it is \nrequested to maintain and consolidate peace, \ndevelopment and democracy. "

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I wish you all success for your tenure in \noffice.  \n Guaranteeing international peace and security as \nwell as the sustainable development of our peoples is \nour shared responsibility. The way we carry it out will \ndetermine our common destiny. The centrality of the \nUnited Nations has never been so clear. The United \nNations will be what we, as sovereign and equal \nMember States, want it to be. \n We live in a time of historic acceleration, a time \nof great opportunities but also of challenges on a \nglobal scale. Global challenges imply a collective \nresponsibility. The United Nations is the forum that \nbest embodies that collective responsibility. That is \nalso why I strongly support the statement made by the \nPresident of the French Republic, current President of \nthe Council of the European Union. \n In a globalized and interdependent world, only \nstrong multilateral institutions can promote the \nfundamental values of peace, democracy, human rights \nand sustainable development. Portugal is committed to \nsupporting effective multilateralism based on a \ncohesive and efficient United Nations. \n Our words cannot be empty rhetoric. Therefore \nwe must be consistent and put into practice the values \nand principles we defend. Our actions must be based \non very clear assumptions. First, we must make every \neffort to ensure that the United Nations has the means \nnecessary to fulfil its mission, and we must contribute \nto the achievement of the mandates with which we \nentrust it. \n Secondly, we must ensure broader representation \nin the United Nations bodies and make their actions \nmore transparent. Is it reasonable to continue having a \nSecurity Council without reforming its working \nmethods, when countries such as Brazil and India have \nno permanent seat and when Africa is not permanently \nrepresented? We surely do not think so and are open to \nthe possibility of broader solutions.  \n \n \n11 08-51749 \n \n Thirdly, we must guarantee the fulfilment of the \ndeclarations on human rights approved by all of us. \nThe Organization must bear in mind that the ultimate \nbeneficiaries of its actions are not States as such, but \nthe citizens and peoples that compose them. \n Portugal has been committed to this common \neffort \u2014 first, by participating in peacekeeping \noperations. I would like to commend the many \nthousands of Portuguese who have participated in over \n20 missions led by the United Nations and those who \ncurrently are taking part in missions in Afghanistan, \nthe Central African Republic, Chad, Kosovo, Lebanon \nand Timor-Leste. \n This year we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of \nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations, and I would \nlike to pay tribute to all of the Blue Helmets. In \nparticular I pay tribute to the memory of all of those, \nincluding Portuguese nationals, who have made the \nultimate sacrifice for the ideals of the United Nations \nCharter. \n Africa must remain a priority. That belief led us, \ntogether with our African partners, to hold the Cairo \nand Lisbon summits between the European Union (EU) \nand Africa, which began to further the dialogue \nbetween the two continents. The shared principles, the \ncommitments undertaken and the EU-Africa Joint \nStrategy illustrate a renewed partnership based on \ncooperation in areas such as peace and security, \ndevelopment, good governance and human rights, trade \nand regional integration. Peace, sustainable \ndevelopment, access to education and health care and \nthe integration of African economies in the \ninternational markets are essential objectives in \nbuilding a more just, peaceful and balanced \ninternational order. Accordingly, we must support the \nefforts of the African nations to achieve those \nobjectives. \n In that context, I would like to congratulate the \nAngolan people for the civic-minded manner in which \nthey conducted their recent electoral process. The \nlegislative elections had a profound bearing on the \nconsolidation of democracy in Angola, with important \nregional political repercussions. \n I also welcome the political agreement in \nZimbabwe, which we hope will mark a new period of \nnational reconciliation as well as political and \neconomic development. \n I wish also to congratulate Guinea-Bissau on the \nanniversary of its independence. Guinea-Bissau is one \nof the States Members of the Community of \nPortuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP), from which it \nhas received strong political support. The CPLP has \nundertaken increasing responsibilities as an operational \npartner of the regional organizations to which its \nmember States belong, such as the European Union and \nthe African Union, and of global organizations such as \nthe United Nations. \n The recent Lisbon summit of the CPLP, at which \nPortugal took over the presidency of the Community, \nconfirmed its members\u2019 determination to promote \npeace, democracy, human rights and development. It \nalso led to the definition of a common strategy of \ninternational assertiveness based on our shared asset: \nthe Portuguese language \u2014 the fifth most spoken \nlanguage in the world, connecting nations and peoples \nin five continents. This assertiveness should lead to the \nincreased use of Portuguese as an official or working \nlanguage of international organizations. \n Recently, Portugal also assumed the presidency \nof the Community of Democracies. Very soon, we will \nbe presiding over the Ibero-American Summit \u2014 a \ngenuine reference point for political cooperation based \non shared cultures and values. We are honoured by \nthose mandates, which we intend to exercise with \ndetermination and confidence. \n Portugal believes that the natural vocation of the \nAlliance of Civilizations to bring together peoples, \ncultures and religions will be instrumental in \nestablishing a world where dialogue prevails over \nconflict and where tolerance, respect for cultural \ndiversity and individual identity, and mutual \nunderstanding overcome built-up tensions. We \ntherefore resolutely support the Implementation Plan of \nthe High Representative of the Secretary-General. \n Seven years have passed since New York suffered \none of the most infamous acts the world has witnessed \nin our time. Although much has been done since then, \nterrorism continues to be a threat. The implementation \nof the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy is \nfundamental to success in combating that common \nenemy. In that regard, it is crucial to respect human \nrights and fundamental freedoms, the promotion of \nwhich contributes to preventing terrorism. \n Hunger and extreme poverty are other, more \ninsidious but equally destructive common enemies. \n  \n \n08-51749 12 \n \nMuch has also been said in that connection, and some \nmeasures have been taken. However, much more is \nrequired. We reiterate our unwavering support for the \nMillennium Development Goals. Portugal, which is \ncontributing to the limit of its capabilities, is directing \nmost of its development aid to Africa, where the levels \nof poverty are most striking.  \n We are pleased to note the establishment of the \nHigh-level Task Force on the Global Food Crisis. \nCombating hunger and poverty requires a strengthened \nglobal partnership in which the United Nations and the \nBretton Woods institutions have a central role to play.  \n Ensuring sustainable development requires that \nwe confront the challenges posed by climate change \ntogether. Failure to act now will result in an \nirreversible legacy for future generations, as shown by \nthe last progress report of the Intergovernmental Panel \non Climate Change. In that common effort, we must \nsupport those who are most vulnerable to the effects of \nclimate change, such as small island developing States \nand least developed countries.  \n Oceans, seas, islands and coastal areas, which are \nvital for human life and economic prosperity, deserve \nour utmost attention. It is therefore important that we \njoin efforts to ensure that negotiations are completed \nby December next year on a global and transparent \nagreement on a post-2012 climate regime. \n Economic development is not an end in itself; it \nis a means towards the progress of humankind and the \naffirmation of human rights. Portugal has been the \ndriving force behind the draft optional protocol to the \nInternational Covenant on Economic, Social and \nCultural Rights, which the Assembly will be called \nupon to adopt. It is our opinion that the draft protocol \nrepresents a landmark in the promotion of democracy \nthat will enable us to properly celebrate the sixtieth \nanniversary of the adoption of the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights. Let us always bear in \nmind that the dignity of human beings is not \nnegotiable. \n I would now like to refer to the humanitarian \nsituation of refugees. Portugal acknowledges the \nremarkable work carried out by the United Nations \nHigh Commissioner for Refugees. We must continue \nour collective efforts. In that regard, my country has \nresponded to the need by tripling its refugee quota. \n We are the United Nations. Its destiny is in our \nhands. The success of the Organization is closely \nlinked to its capacity for regeneration and increased \ndemocratization, representation and effectiveness. I \ntherefore wish to commend the consensus in the \nGeneral Assembly as regards the Security Council \nreform process, which should enable intergovernmental \nnegotiations to begin shortly. Portugal is honoured to \nbe directly associated with that outcome.  \n In 2000, Portugal submitted its candidacy for a \nnon-permanent seat in the Security Council for the \nbiennium 2011-2012. Our candidacy must be \nconsidered in the light of the principles and values of \nthe United Nations that we have long defended and \nwhich are enshrined in the Portuguese Constitution. We \nstand for service to peace and stability, sustainable \ndevelopment and human rights. We also believe in the \ncentral role of the Organization in pursuing those \ngoals. We stand for equal representation for those \nStates that constitute the majority in this house because \nwe believe that that is the best way to guarantee a \nsense of justice, which is essential if decisions are to be \naccepted by all.

        "file_text": "For \nChina, this has been a special year. We experienced \n \n \n35 08-51749 \n \ntwo major events. One was the devastating earthquake \nin Wenchuan, which caused grave loss of life and \nproperty. In the face of the disaster, the Chinese people \nshowed great strength, courage, solidarity and \nresilience. By now, the people affected by the \nearthquake have been properly relocated and recovery \nand reconstruction work is well under way. The other \nevent was the successful hosting of the Beijing \nOlympic Games. That grand sporting event provided a \ngood opportunity for athletes from around the world to \nshow true sportsmanship. It also enabled the world to \nlearn more about China and for China to learn more \nabout the world.  \n In our fight against the earthquake disaster and \nour efforts to host the Games, we received \nunderstanding, support and assistance from the \ninternational community. I wish to take this \nopportunity to express sincere gratitude on behalf of \nthe Chinese Government and people.  \n Now the whole world wants to know in what \ndirection China is heading, both politically and \neconomically, after the Beijing Olympic Games. Let \nme tell you in unequivocal terms that China will \nremain committed to the path of peaceful development, \nunswervingly pursue reform and opening-up, and \ncontinue to adhere to an independent foreign policy of \npeace. This is in the fundamental interests of the \nChinese people and the people of all other countries. It \nis also in keeping with the trend of the world. \n The Olympic Games that just concluded were \nheld in China, the largest developing country in the \nworld. The international community has highly \ncommended the efforts made by the Chinese \nGovernment and people for the Games, and their \nsuccess has greatly inspired the Chinese people and \ngiven them even more confidence and strength to \nachieve modernization of the country.  \n At the same time, however, we are soberly aware \nthat China is a country with 1.3 billion people. \nAlthough its total GDP is one of the highest in the \nworld, it trails behind more than 100 countries in terms \nof per capita income. Development between urban and \nrural areas and among different regions in China is \nunbalanced. The rural areas, particularly in western \nChina, are underdeveloped. Tens of millions of Chinese \nlack adequate food and clothing.  \n China is still a developing country, where \nproductivity remains low and further development is \nconstrained by the shortage of resources and energy \nand by environmental consequences. Our socialist \nmarket economic system, democracy and the rule of \nlaw need to be further improved, and certain \noutstanding social issues are yet to be resolved. To \nachieve China\u2019s modernization is a daunting task, and \nwe still have a long way to go. Both the opportunities \nand challenges that we face are unprecedented. We will \nseize the opportunities, rise up to challenges, dedicate \nourselves to nation-building and focus on development. \nThat is what the Chinese Government and people have \nbeen thinking and doing. \n People may ask how China is achieving its \ndevelopment. The answer is through reform and \nopening up. This year marks the thirtieth anniversary \nof China\u2019s reform and opening-up policy, a policy that \nfundamentally changed the closed, backward and \nossified situation that had existed in China for years. It \nis a policy that freed people\u2019s minds and aroused their \ninitiative, liberated the productive forces, generated \ngreat economic and social progress and instilled vigour \nand vitality into the country. Without that policy, there \nwould not have been such change in China in the last \n30 years.  \n To achieve the goal of modernization and build a \nstrong, prosperous, democratic, culturally advanced \nand harmonious country, we will pursue the reform and \nopening-up policy. It is of vital importance to the \ndevelopment of China today. It is also a strategy that \nwill shape China\u2019s future. We are firm in carrying this \npolicy forward. \n The Chinese nation has all along cherished the \nfine tradition and benefited from the wisdom of being \nopen to new ideas and drawing on the strengths of \nothers. The Chinese people have learned from 30 years \nof reform and opening up that only continued \neconomic and political restructuring and reform in \nother fields can lead to sustained economic growth and \nsocial progress. And only continued opening up in an \nall-round way can lead the country to greater national \nstrength and prosperity. This is the conclusion we have \ndrawn both from our practice and exploration and from \nhistorical experiences. \n The world needs peace, for only with peace can \nthere be development. China earnestly hopes to have a \npeaceful international environment in order to achieve \nits development goals. The Chinese Government is \ncommitted to an independent foreign policy of peace \n  \n \n08-51749 36 \n \nand stands ready to work with other countries to \nadvance the noble cause of the peace and progress of \nmankind. \n Respect for sovereignty and non-interference in \nthe internal affairs of other countries is the prerequisite \nfor sound State-to-State relations. The Chinese people \nhave learned from their modern history of humiliation \nthat when a country loses its sovereignty, its people \nlose dignity and status. China is firm in upholding its \nhard-won sovereignty and territorial integrity and will \nnever tolerate any external interference. Following the \nprinciple of treating each other as equals, China also \nrespects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of \nother countries, as well as the independent choices of \ntheir people for their own social systems and \ndevelopment paths. \n China is ready to develop friendly relations with \nall countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit \nrather than on ideology or on a political system. In \nhandling international affairs, we make our own \njudgement on the merit of each case and take our \nposition in light of our national interests and the well-\nbeing of the world\u2019s people. We will neither blindly \nfollow the position of others nor give way to the \npressure of any forces. In international relations, China \ndoes not seek to build alliances or become a leader and \nwill never do so in the future. \n Peaceful settlement of international disputes is a \nfounding purpose of the United Nations and a basic \nprinciple of international law. China is committed to \naddressing historical issues and current differences \nwith other countries through dialogue and negotiation. \nAs a permanent member of the Security Council, China \nwill continue to play an active and constructive role in \npromoting the peaceful settlement of international \nhotspot issues and regional conflicts. \n China\u2019s development is peaceful in nature. It will \nnot harm anyone or pose a threat to anyone. China does \nnot seek hegemony now, nor will it do so in the future. \nChina keeps and develops an appropriate level of \nmilitary capability solely for the purpose of \nsafeguarding China\u2019s sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity. \n The confidence and pride of the Chinese nation \ntoday are based on China\u2019s economic development, \nsocial justice, the civility of its people and moral \nstrength. China will, through its own development, \ncontribute to the peace and development of the world. \n In the long history of humankind, the destinies of \ncountries have never been so closely linked as they are \ntoday. Given the global nature of issues threatening the \nsurvival and development of mankind, such as global \nwarming, environmental degradation, resource \nconstraints, frequent outbreaks of diseases and natural \ndisasters and the spread of terrorism, and in the face of \nthe intertwining challenges related to finance, energy \nand food, no country can expect to avoid difficulties or \nto handle the problems alone.  \n Ongoing financial volatility, in particular, has \naffected many countries, and its impact is likely to \nbecome more serious. To tackle the challenge, we must \nall make concerted efforts. So long as people of all \ncountries, including their leaders, can do away with \nhostility, exclusion and prejudice, treat each other with \nsincerity and an open mind and forge ahead hand in \nhand, humankind will overcome all difficulties and \nembrace a brighter and better future. \n China, as a responsible major developing country, \nis ready to work with other members of the \ninternational community to strengthen cooperation, \nshare opportunities, meet challenges and contribute to \nthe harmonious and sustainable development of the \nworld.

        "file_text": "It is with great \npleasure that I extend my warmest congratulations to \nMr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann on his election as \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \nsession. In electing him amidst this rather complex \nglobal scenario, the international community places \nconfidence in his qualities as a statesman, a spiritual \nleader and a defender of the most disenfranchised. \n For my part, I am convinced that the experience \nthat Mr. d\u2019Escoto Brockmann gained at a historic time \nand in the particular circumstances in the lives of the \nfriendly people of Nicaragua will serve him well in \nanalysing and better understanding the challenges we \nface in this, the first decade of the twenty-first century. \nI count on his wisdom and balance, in the conviction \nthat spiritual force will always inspire him and help \nhim preside over our deliberations with success. He \ncan count on my personal support and on the \ncooperation of the delegation of my country, Guinea-\nBissau. \n Allow me also to thank his predecessor for the \nresults achieved at the last session. I would also like to \nexpress our appreciation to Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon for his dedication and for the spirit of \ninnovation he has shown in fulfilling his duties. His \nreport on the international situation (A/63/1) \nemphasizes the gravity of the major challenges the \nworld is facing as well as the complexity of the \nreforms that are needed to improve the functioning and \nefficiency of the Organization and the working \nconditions for its staff. \n We agree with him that in order to more \nefficiently solve the numerous problems of our planet, \nwe need an organization which is less bureaucratic, \ncapable of adopting new technologies and possessing \nsufficient financial means and competent and highly \nmotivated staff. We support the efforts of the \nSecretary-General with a view to increasing the \nOrganization\u2019s capacity to maintain peace and to \naddress global issues. We also support his proposal to \nintroduce, in the Secretariat in particular, new working \nmethods based not only on the recognition of \nindividual skills, but also on an emphasis on teamwork. \n The present international situation demands \nserious reflection about the cause of the present crisis \nwhich greatly affects our countries. The three main \nelements of the crisis \u2014 energy, food and international \nfinances, to which we would add the disastrous \nconsequences of climate change \u2014 call for a better \ncoordination of our efforts in the pursuit of innovative, \ncourageous and adequate solutions leading to the \nestablishment of a new world order, one which is more \njust and equitable and which is capable of responding \nto the realities of an interdependent and globalized \nworld. \n The increase in oil prices has destabilizing effects \non our economies. The cost of producing electrical \nenergy in particular has become an unsustainable \nburden for the poor countries and a major obstacle to \nthe achievement of the Millennium Development \nGoals. \n In my country, Guinea-Bissau, for example, the \nlack of energy seriously compromises all socio-\neconomic activities, particularly hospital care and the \ndistribution of drinking water, which is essential for \nguaranteeing hygiene and public health. How can a \npoor country like ours face the unjustified increase in \nthe price of oil? What means do we have at our \ndisposal to face the adverse consequences of a system \nwhich has been poorly based on speculation and which \nhas nothing to do with the law of supply and demand? \nIs it not the right time for us to think about creating a \nworld fund to mitigate the effects that are jeopardizing \nour ability to reach the Millennium Development \nGoals? How can we invest in and improve our \ninfrastructure in such vital areas as health, education \nand agriculture if we are continuously compelled to \nspend enormous resources from our already limited \nfunding to purchase fuel? \n Moreover, the tremendous increase in food prices \non the international market and the hunger and \nmalnutrition which could affect many countries, in \nAfrica in particular, are also matters of great concern \nand impel us to take action and implement appropriate \nagricultural policies with sufficient financial means so \nthat we can invest in the creation of modern and \naffordable means of production. \n Saying that agriculture is a priority should not be \na mere slogan. We need to be reminded that the right to \nfood is a fundamental right and is enshrined in the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, whose sixtieth \nanniversary we are celebrating this year. Every country \nshould be able to guarantee food autonomy. We \ntherefore need to examine and reformulate conditions \nfor obtaining agricultural credits in particular. \n \n \n5 08-51851 \n \n A food shortage can pose a serious threat to the \npeace and security of a country. At the international \nlevel, we need to seriously discuss how to improve our \ncapacity to respond effectively to the food crisis by \nputting into practice new scientific knowledge and by \napplying technologies suited to the climate conditions \nof the various regions of our planet and to the social \nand economic realities of our respective peoples. \n In an interdependent and globalized world, we \nhave to strive to establish and ensure respect for rules \ncapable of regulating the international, financial and \ntrading system without impeding the free flow of \ncapital. But the international financial system, which is \nalready affected by serious distortions, cannot be based \nonly on a quest for speculative profit and on unlawful \nbehaviour, which can have enormous consequences, as \nis the case now in many countries, where thousands of \nfamilies have financial difficulties, particularly in the \narea of housing credits. Unfortunately, the \nconsequences of these poor practices are not limited to \na few countries. \n The international community must react to all of \nthese challenges. But how can we succeed without \nclose cooperation among all countries of the world? We \nneed cooperation in order to face climate change and to \nmitigate the effects of natural disasters such as the \nterrible hurricanes which have caused so much \ndestruction in countries in the Caribbean, such as Cuba \nand Haiti, and also in Houston, Texas.  \n Our main goal should be to foster dialogue in all \ncircumstances \u2014 dialogue among the countries, \npeoples, cultures, religions and civilizations of the \nworld. It is only through dialogue that we will be able \nto identify our differences and find solutions in our \ncommon interest.  \n We need dialogue and negotiation at the \ninternational level to prevent and solve conflicts, such \nas the conflict in the Middle East, and to preserve the \nlives of human beings in danger, in Darfur and in \nSomalia, for example. We need dialogue and \nnegotiation to defend and protect the most vulnerable, \nin particular women and children, by promoting and \nensuring respect for human rights, the principle of \ndemocracy and the rule of law. \n At the national level, we need dialogue aimed at \ncreating appropriate conditions for the consolidation of \ndemocracy through free, transparent and credible \nelections, as we intend to do in Guinea-Bissau on \n16 November.  \n Finally, we should further dialogue and \nnegotiations with the view to promoting a policy of \ninclusion that guarantees the active participation of all \nstakeholders, above all women and youth, and civil \nsociety in general, in building peace and political \nstability and in creating the necessary conditions for \ndevelopment. \n Although confronted with complex international \nsituations, the international community has ways of \nfacing those challenges. However, real political will is \nneeded from us all. The United Nations can play an \neven more decisive role in preventing and resolving \nconflicts, in protecting our planet and in creating better \nliving conditions for millions of people. Thus we need \na United Nations that is better organized, less \nbureaucratic and better suited to confronting those \nmany challenges. \n We reiterate our full support for the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, in the implementation of \nmuch-needed reforms for the greater efficiency, \ncapacity to respond and credibility of the United \nNations. We equally support the reform process \nundertaken by the Member States of our Organization \nin order to democratize the United Nations system, in \nparticular the Security Council, the enlargement of \nwhich remains a priority for us all, considering the new \neconomical and political reality of today\u2019s world and \nabove all the need to address the historic injustice done \nto the continent of Africa for more than 60 years."

        "file_text": "It is a privilege and an \nhonour to address this distinguished audience on behalf \nof Bulgaria, particularly as my country is celebrating \nthe centennial anniversary of the proclamation of its \nindependence. Throughout those 100 years, Bulgaria \nasserted and safeguarded its independence, often \nthrough active participation in international \norganizations, including the United Nations. Having \nrecently become a member of the European Union \n(EU), my country is now even more committed to the \nuniversal and regulatory role of the United Nations in \ntoday\u2019s globalized world. We align ourselves with the \nstatement made by President Sarkozy of the French \nRepublic on behalf of the EU (5th meeting). \n Permit me to congratulate you, Sir, on your \nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-third session. We wish you every success in \nthe months ahead and pledge our full support for your \nendeavours. Our deep gratitude goes to His Excellency \nMr. Srgjan Kerim for his able guidance of the \nAssembly at its previous session. \n Given the growing urgency of food security, the \ntopic that we are discussing today is of crucial \nimportance. We fully support the United Nations-led \nefforts, reflected in the Rome Declaration, to ensure a \ntimely response to a problem that may have grave \nconsequences for the livelihoods of millions of people. \n Food security is a cross-cutting issue that should \nbe considered against the background of other \ninterrelated global challenges, such as climate change \nand energy security. These also demand an immediate \nresponse based on the common but differentiated \nresponsibilities and capabilities of various countries. \nThe United Nations should continue to provide a \nunique forum for the elaboration of the effective \nmultilateral approach needed. \n Next spring, Bulgaria intends to host a summit \nentitled \u201cGas for Europe: New Transregional \nPartnerships and Projects\u201d. It is important to bring \ntogether heads of State and Government from all \ninterested countries in South-Eastern Europe, the Black \nSea/Caspian Sea region, Central Asia, the EU and the \nUnited States in order to encourage political dialogue \nat the highest level and to enhance transregional \ncooperation with a view to achieving a balance among \nenergy and other strategic interests. \n Effective multilateralism requires an intensive \npartnership between the United Nations and regional \norganizations. On the basis of the European Union-United \nNations Joint Declaration on Cooperation in Crisis \nManagement, the EU and the United Nations have \nengaged in partnerships that have already delivered \nresults in many areas related to peacemaking and \npeacebuilding. A good and pragmatic relationship \nbetween the United Nations and NATO in the Western \nBalkans, Afghanistan and Africa is also of crucial \nimportance. \n Various forms of regional, subregional and \ntransborder cooperation may serve as building blocks \nfor a comprehensive collective security system. Peace \nand stability are well rooted when local communities \nand immediate neighbours live in harmony. That \nphilosophy guided the recent Bulgarian chairmanship \nof the South-East European Cooperation Process. \nRegional cooperation in South-East Europe has \nrecently gained momentum. South-East Europe is in \n \n \n27 08-52272 \n \nthe process of changing from an area recovering from \nwar to a thriving and dynamic region. Over the past 12 \nmonths, a whole new architecture of interaction has \ncome into being, connecting the countries of the region \nto the rest of Europe and the international community. \nIn line with the concept of regional ownership, the \npivotal role has now been assumed by the new \nRegional Cooperation Council. \n Democracy, security and cooperation still have a \nway to go in the Black Sea region. More coherent \nefforts are needed for an ultimate settlement of the \nprotracted conflicts there. Frozen conflicts should not \nbe neglected, because they tend to reignite tension time \nand again. The recent armed hostilities in South \nOssetia and in other parts of Georgia have provided \nample evidence to that effect. Bulgaria gave its full \nsupport to the peacemaking mission of the French EU \npresidency and remains actively involved in the \npreparation of the EU Monitoring Mission. We are \nconvinced that the sovereignty and territorial integrity \nof Georgia should be upheld and that the military \ncontingents should be withdrawn to their positions \nprior to the conflict in order to allow effective \nmonitoring by the EU and the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) of the \nimplementation of the six-point plan. \n Bulgaria contributes fully to the Eastern \nDimension of the European Neighbourhood Policy, \nwhich should address the needs and priorities of all \npartners in the region. We see opportunities for \nlaunching projects in important sectors such as \ntransport, trade, energy, the environment and border \nsecurity. The EU\u2019s Black Sea Synergy initiative is a \npragmatic way to intertwine various regional \ninitiatives, thus multiplying their effect. \n As prevention and development are inextricably \nlinked, the Bulgarian Government and the country \noffice of the United Nations Development Programme \n(UNDP) in Bulgaria are currently exploring the \npotential for a Bulgaria/UNDP regional hub for the \nWestern Balkans and the Black Sea area to share \naccumulated know-how, training and research. \n We condemn terrorism unequivocally and reject \nterrorist ideology in all its forms and manifestations. \nThe first review of the United Nations Global Counter-\nTerrorism Strategy held recently proved that the United \nNations should continue to play a central role in \nmobilizing the international community to counter \nterrorism and all related phenomena, such as \nradicalization and extremism. \n In countering terrorism, it is essential to conduct \nthat struggle within the requirements of international \nlaw and to overcome prejudices and stereotype \nperceptions in a world of great diversity. Bulgaria\u2019s \nlong history of tolerance has been based on the \ncommon understanding that cultural diversity is a great \nasset in our society. It is in that spirit that Bulgaria \nactively participates in the United Nations Alliance of \nCivilizations and supports other like-minded \ninitiatives. \n This year, we mark the sixtieth anniversary of \nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations. As we pay \ntribute to the six decades of promoting peace and \nprotecting the vulnerable, we should also realize that \nthere is still much to be done. The United Nations is \nfacing a serious challenge due to the complex and \nmultidimensional character of a growing number of \npeace operations and missions. \n Bulgaria continues to make its contribution to the \ninternational peacekeeping efforts in the western \nBalkans, Afghanistan, Iraq and Africa. Our task today \nis not only to keep the peace; we must also make \ncertain that peace is irreversible and sustainable. The \nPeacebuilding Commission, an early achievement of \nthe reform process, has now become functional and has \nachieved some practical results in Burundi and Sierra \nLeone. \n Global celebrations of the sixtieth anniversary of \nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights this year \nhave reaffirmed the critical importance of universal \nadherence to international human rights standards, the \nrealization of which should make the world better for \nus all, free of poverty, intolerance and discrimination. \nDespite the progress achieved, we should never relent \nin our efforts. The Human Rights Council, with its \ninstitution-building process successfully accomplished, \nshould engage in constructive, all-inclusive work \naimed at promoting and guaranteeing all human rights \nfor all. \n Stable peace and security can be achieved only \nthrough development. Therefore, there is an urgent \nneed to accelerate the implementation of the \ninternationally agreed development goals, including \nthe Millennium Development Goals. We are convinced \nthat the responsibility for the timely achievement of \n  \n \n08-52272 28 \n \nthose Goals lies with both developed and developing \ncountries. \n Solidarity with those in need, and in particular \nwith the developing countries, is an important and \nirrevocable principle of Bulgarian foreign policy. We \nare taking our first steps in building a new donor \ncapacity and shall strive to achieve the targeted levels \nof official development assistance as part of the \nEuropean Union development cooperation policy. \n In order to perform its role in the world \nefficiently, the United Nations must follow persistently \nthe course of reforms initiated at the 2005 World \nSummit. We welcome the progress achieved during the \nsixty-second session of the General Assembly towards \nimproving the working modalities of the main United \nNations bodies. Bulgaria expects that the remaining \ntasks on the United Nations reform agenda will be \npursued vigorously and without delay during the \ncurrent session. \n In that regard, we welcome the efforts of the \nSecretary-General and his determination expressed in \nhis opening statement. It is in our common interest to \nensure that this sixty-third session of the General \nAssembly achieve tangible results. That is what the \npeoples of our countries, the people of the world, are \nexpecting of us. "

        "file_text": "It is humbling to \nstand before this great Assembly today. Events of \nrecent weeks have proved beyond doubt that we are \nnow in a new global age. Living through the first \nfinancial crisis and the first resources crisis of \nglobalization, we are a world not simply in transition, \nbut facing transformation, with change more far-\nreaching than anything we have seen in our lifetimes. \nThe challenges, the opportunities for us and the risks \nthat we now face come together at the global \ncrossroads of the United Nations, providing the focus \nfor debate and decision here in this General Assembly \nHall.  \n A predecessor of mine said that if one built the \npresent only in the image of the past, one would miss \nout entirely on the challenges of the future. It is to \nthose challenges of the future that I want to address my \nremarks today. \n In the next two decades, our world economy will \ndouble in size. That means double the opportunities \nand potential for more businesses, more jobs and more \nprosperity. Extraordinary promise and opportunity \nawait, but there are also wholly new insecurities and \npressures \u2014 global problems that will require global \nsolutions. \n The twin shocks of a global credit crunch and \nsoaring commodity prices lead straight to the front \ndoors of every family in every country, with higher oil, \ngas and food prices, and higher costs for credit. But \nbecause it is a global financial crisis and a global \nshortage of food and resources, it will not be resolved \nsimply by individual nations acting in isolation, \nalthough there is much that they can do themselves. It \nwill be solved in the end by us acting together. \n I want to talk about how we can work together to \ntackle financial instability and the intense pressure now \non our finite world resources. The immediate priority is \nto help people everywhere cope with these difficult \ntimes and to do so fairly. That is why, in Britain, we \nhave acted to help those hit hardest, assisting people \nwith the costs of gas and electricity, supporting \nhomeowners and the housing market and helping \npeople acquire the skills to do the new jobs of the \ntwenty-first century. \n But if we have learned anything in the past few \nyears about the world in which we are now living, it is \nthat the world we share is more interconnected than \never before and that the solutions have to be similarly \ncoordinated. \n First, we must do all that it takes to stabilize the \nstill turbulent financial markets and, in the months \nahead, we must work together to rebuild the world \nfinancial system around clear principles. In the short \nterm, each country is taking action to deal with the \nfallout of the credit crunch, and the United States of \nAmerica deserves support from the rest of the world as \nit seeks to agree on in detail what all parties agree on \nin principle. \n In Britain, we have taken decisive action to \npromote stability in our banking system, protecting \ndepositors and introducing a temporary ban on short-\nselling. We have already injected billions into the \nmarket, making in excess of \u00a3100 billion available, and \nannounced only last week that our special liquidity \nscheme will be extended until the end of January next \nyear. \n Confidence in the future is also needed to build \nconfidence today, and that confidence will be built by \nshowing that what are global problems can be \naddressed by globally coordinated solutions. I believe \nthere are five key principles behind that all nations \nshould unite around as we examine the future of our \nfinancial system. \n The first principle is that of transparency. People \nmust know what they are buying and selling, and they \nmust know what they are dealing with and not fear \nwhat might be hidden on each other\u2019s books. We must \nlook at the rapid introduction of improved \ninternationally acceptable accounting standards and \ndisclosure. \n Secondly, there must be sound banking practice \nand more effective regulation that looks not just at \nsolvency but at liquidity, at managing and pricing risks \nfor bad times and for good times, together. \n Thirdly, there must be responsibility. No member \nof senior management should be able to say he or she \ndid not understand the risks they were running and \nwalk away from his or her obligations. \n Fourthly, there must be integrity. Most people \nagree that companies should align reward with stability \nand long-term gain because what matters is hard work, \n \n \n19 08-52272 \n \neffort and enterprise. We should align the advice of \ncredit-rating agencies with the interests of the \ninvestors. \n Fifthly, just as banks are global and the flows of \ncapital are global, so oversight can no longer just be \nnational but must also include global supervision. That \nis why we want to work to support immediately the \nestablishment of international colleges for each of the \nlargest global financial institutions \u2014 30 of them by \nthe end of the year.  \n The international institutions built in the wake of \nthe Second World War have not kept pace with the \nchanging global economy. We need national regulators \nto be cooperative, rules and principles to be consistent, \nand international movements of capital to be \ntransparent. \n The current era has been one of global prosperity. \nIt has also been an era of global turbulence, and while \nthere has been irresponsibility, we must now say \nclearly that the age of irresponsibility must be ended. \nWe must now build that new global financial order, \nfounding it on transparency, not opacity; rewarding \nsuccess, not excess; and responsibility, not impunity. \nThat order must be global, not national. \n Global action cannot be limited to financial \nstability. We must also address another problem of \nglobalization \u2014 the global scramble for resources. We \nneed global action to deal with high commodity prices \nand a rising global population demanding more energy. \nOnly by taking tough decisions on energy security and \nclimate change and by bringing together a new global \npartnership of oil producers and oil consumers can we \nbring stability to global energy markets and secure \nsustainable energy supplies for the long term. \n We are committed to tackling the global \nchallenge of climate change. Oil will of course \ncontinue to meet a large part of our global energy \nneeds for some decades to come, but over the past year \nwe have seen the price of oil rise to as high as $146 per \nbarrel before falling again to $90 in the past month \u2014 \na fall of nearly 40 per cent. Such high and volatile \nprices have a harmful impact on the global economy, \nand all countries surely have a shared interest in \navoiding such dramatic swings in the price of scarce \nresources. \n We must now therefore consider whether the \ncurrent international architecture can bring the more \ntransparent and stable energy markets this global \neconomy clearly needs. We must bring producers and \nconsumers together, build common understanding and \naddress the issues through meaningful and sustained \ndialogue. At the end of this year, I will be hosting a \nglobal energy summit in London, building on the \nmomentum generated in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to agree \non key areas for further action. It is only by acting \ntogether that we can make the most of the world\u2019s \nscarce resources and harness the power of our greater \ninterdependence for our common good. \n Some say that in a time of difficulty we should \nlook inwards and cut aid; that we have an excuse for \nwalking by on the other side; and that, by our inaction, \nwe tolerate famine \u2014 but in today\u2019s world, there is no \nother side. \n Africa is not part of the problem, but an \nindisputable part of the solution. It is only by helping \nAfrica to become a net exporter of food rather than a \nnet importer that we can hope to achieve a long-term \nend to soaring food prices. Only by restarting and \nseeing the trade talks through can we help our \neconomies benefit from the annual boost of \n$150 billion that would be achieved by removing the \nprotectionist trade barriers and trade-distorting \nsubsidies that currently cost developing countries the \nmost \u2014 $15 billion a year in their agricultural incomes \nalone. \n As Governments and as nations, we must respond \nwith courage and vision to the new insecurities that \nface people, because while the global changes \nhappening all around us are complex, the instincts they \nsummon up in people are not. We must resist those \ninstincts that are protectionist. Now is not the time to \npull up the drawbridge, to seek solace in isolation or to \nrevert to an outdated and futile protectionism. It is only \nby maintaining our open, flexible and dynamic \neconomies that we can best secure people\u2019s jobs, \nhomes and standards of living in a global age.  \n Our global institutions have always had a \nsweeping ambition, set up not against a single enemy \nbut against poverty, conflict, injustice and intolerance, \nand set up in the belief that, for peace to last, \nprosperity must be shared. Now we must build on the \nidealism of the era that created those institutions and \nchange and evolve those institutions to meet the \nchallenges of the global age. This United Nations is \nwhere the world turns to confront some of its greatest \n  \n \n08-52272 20 \n \nchallenges. It is where international law is made, where \nthe most acute political problems are addressed, and \nwhere the hopes of the world for a better future \nultimately rest. \n For the past 40 years, it has been this United \nNations that has been the key forum where the \ninternational community has sought peace in the \nMiddle East, and it is the United Nations that must help \nthe next Government of Israel build on the foundations \nlaid by Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas to \nagree to a two-State solution that guarantees the \nsecurity of Israel and gives the Palestinians a viable \nState. \n In Cyprus, where the United Nations has been \npresent for 30 years and more, we have a real chance of \na settlement, thanks to new leadership, which has our \nsupport. \n In Afghanistan, the International Security \nAssistance Force is training Afghans to take back their \ncountry after two generations of almost constant \nconflict. When the Afghan Government can deny its \nland to Al-Qaida and its associates, the international \ncommunity will have done its job, but the task is hard \nand long. Progress is encouraging, but must be \ncontinued and stepped up. \n In the Sudan, United Nations peacekeepers help \nkeep the fragile North-South peace agreement in place, \nbut Darfur remains for all of us a disaster. It is the \nresponsibility of the Government of the Sudan to create \nthe conditions in Darfur that will allow the conflict to \nend and a new deal for the people of Darfur to be put in \nplace. Justice has to be part of any sustainable peace. \n Difficulty has never daunted the United Nations. \nWhere we are rebuffed, we are resolute, so we must \nalso send a powerful signal of our support for \ndemocracy and human rights in Zimbabwe. We must \nstand firm against oppression in Burma. We must, as \nwe did yesterday, reaffirm the practical measures that \nunderpin our determination to defeat poverty. Now \nwould be the worst time to turn our back on the \nMillennium Development Goals. \n We have reached a unique point in the world\u2019s \nhistory. For the first time in human history, we have the \nopportunity to come together around a global covenant, \nto reframe the international architecture to make it fit \nfor the challenges facing us in the twenty-first century, \nand to build the first truly global society and global \ncitizenship. Our history is not our destiny, it is what we \nchoose to make it. \n Let us resolve today to end any irresponsibility, \nto protect the global public interest by cleaning up the \nworld\u2019s financial system and to reaffirm our \ncommitment to meeting our global responsibilities on \ntrade, poverty, energy and climate change, and let us \nact upon that as people, as Governments, as nations \nunited. Let history record that ours was a truly global \nresponse to the first truly global crisis."

        "file_text": "Sri \nLanka congratulates the President on his election to \nthis high office. We are confident that your guidance \nwill enable the General Assembly to make progress on \nthe important issues confronting humanity to make the \nwork and role of the United Nations more relevant to \nthe lives of billions of people. \n While my mother tongue is Sinhala, let me \nelaborate a few thoughts in Tamil. Sinhala and Tamil \nare the two languages of the people of Sri Lanka. Both \nhave been used through the centuries, are rich in \nliterature and are widely used in my country, with \nrecognition as official languages. With the widening of \ndemocracy in our country, the bonds between the \nSinhala and Tamil people of Sri Lanka will grow \nstronger and remain a major force for its future \ndevelopment. We will march towards a richer freedom \nand the lasting unity that await us as a nation. \n The theme of our debate \u2014 \u201cThe impact of the \nglobal food crisis on poverty and hunger in the world \nas well as the need to democratize the United \nNations\u201d \u2014 is indeed far-sighted. It focuses on one of \nthe critical survival needs of humanity, as well as one \nof the key institutional needs of the world body. The \nglobal food crisis has become a frightening actuality \nand has the potential to assume even more dangerous \nproportions if we fail to take urgent and collective \naction. Similarly, a less democratic United Nations \nruns the risk of being less effective and less credible, \nwhile giving rise to major concerns about its \nlegitimacy. \n Through a series of projects with regional impact, \nSri Lanka will contribute to the goal of increasing food \nproduction, investing more in agriculture and research \nand sharing technologies and best practices. That is an \nintegral part of the rural empowerment that is so \nessential in the developing world, as the vast majority \nof our people are rural based and depend on agriculture \nfor their livelihoods. Achieving food security would \nrequire strengthening and revitalizing the agriculture \nsector. That calls for the empowerment of small- and \nmedium-scale farmers through a series of measures. \nThose represent vital collective steps by all of us in the \n  \n \n08-51749 2 \n \nUnited Nations system. Sri Lanka sees self-sufficiency \nas the answer to overcoming the food crisis and giving \nstrength to nations. No longer can we expect farmers in \ndeveloping countries to be mainly producers for export \nmarkets.  \n In that context, implementation of effective social \nsafety nets remains a priority as reassurance and \nempowerment. That is why we have introduced social \nsecurity measures such as the fertilizer and fisheries \nsubsidies. The advice given by some powerful \ncountries and powerful institutions are contrary to that. \nYet it is necessary that we pay no heed to such advice \nand determine to do what is best for the innocent \npeople of our countries. \n As the current Chair of the South Asian \nAssociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), I \nhave the honour to state that at the recent summit we \naffirmed our resolve as a region to make our own \ncontribution to grapple with the food crisis and to make \nour region revive its historic critical role in food \nproduction by once again becoming a major granary of \nthe world. We also decided on the immediate \nestablishment and operationalization of the SAARC \nFood Bank. That mechanism, we believe, will help \nconsiderably to ensure both food and nutritional \nsecurity for the people of South Asia. That initiative \nwill contribute to the larger global efforts that we \nlaunched in Rome, in June this year, to avert and \nmitigate the impact of the food crisis. \n We must also find solutions to the energy crisis \nthat are both equitable and pragmatic. Energy supplies \nmust be diversified by developing advanced, cleaner, \nmore efficient and cost-effective technologies for both \nfossil fuels and renewable energy sources. We need to \nengage in energy conservation and accept the reality of \ndependence on fossil fuels for much longer. \n Equally obvious is the imperative of transferring \nnew technology to the developing countries. In our \nown region, we will use increasing resources of human \nand scientific talent to produce our own technologies, \nmaking the best use of the natural resources, the sun, \nwind and the ocean, which we have in abundance, free \nof the restrictions of the marketplace. The demands of \nhumanity can no longer be allowed to be at the mercy \nof speculative or captive markets. \n To that end, Sri Lanka\u2019s own view is that the \nUnited Nations and its agencies must take leadership in \ndeveloping a framework for international cooperation. \nWe urge caution in the rush to use biofuels to break our \ndependence of fossil fuels. It has already been seen that \nthe rush to biofuels has contributed to high food prices. \nSri Lanka\u2019s policy is that no arable land should be \ndiverted or directed to the production of biofuels, \nhowever profitable that may be in the short term. It was \npropitious that Sri Lanka acted with courage and \nforesight over the last three years, without being cowed \nby many pressures, and thus did not confront any \nsituation where our people had to face hunger or \nstarvation. \n On climate change, SAARC leaders reiterated the \nneed to redouble efforts within an expanded regional \nframework for environmental protection, conservation \nand justice. We stressed that we should contribute to \nrestoring harmony with nature, a part of the heritage of \nSouth Asia. We humans have interfered with nature too \nmuch for too long. We must accept that the dangers of \nclimate change are man-made and that its solutions, \ntoo, require man\u2019s intervention. \n Since the promulgation of the Charter of the \nUnited Nations to save succeeding generations from \nthe tragedy of war, at least the major threat of \nintercontinental war seems to have receded. However, \nthe just struggle of the Palestinians for statehood \ncontinues.  \n Today, the United Nations and its peoples are \nconfronted with the fast-spreading menace of \nterrorism, which manifests itself in various forms in \nAsia, Africa and Latin America. The United Nations \nhas a grave responsibility to save today\u2019s and \nsucceeding generations from that new and continuing \nmenace. We have been talking for long enough; it is \ntime for clear action in that regard. \n Like many other countries, Sri Lanka has not \nbeen spared this global menace. Exploiting perceived \nethnic grievances that must and can be addressed \nthrough political means, a well-organized terror group, \nthe Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), engages \nin blatant and brutal acts of terrorism, including suicide \nbombings, to seek negotiating leverage, political \nrecognition and legitimacy. \n I am saddened by the loss of life and destruction \ncaused by the recent terrorist attack in Pakistan.  \n Our Government has always been ready to \naddress the causes of these issues and effectively \nimplement political and constitutional solutions to \n \n \n3 08-51749 \n \nmeet the aspirations and respect the rights of all \ncommunities. What the Government would not and \ncould not do is to let an illegal and armed terrorist \ngroup, the LTTE, hold a fraction of our population, a \npart of the Tamil community, hostage to such terror in \nthe northern part of Sri Lanka and deny those people \ntheir democratic rights to dissent and free elections. \nThrough our past actions, we have proved it. \n The Government has therefore declared its policy \nof engaging in dialogue and discussion with the \ndemocratic leadership of the Tamil community, a \npeople who have lived in harmony with other Sri \nLankans for centuries. Today, there are Tamil leaders \nholding responsible ministerial posts in my \nGovernment. A former Attorney-General of then \nCeylon, Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan, a beloved \nTamil politician, had this to say at a public meeting in \nColombo in September 1904: \u201cI have been to many \ncountries in the world. But nowhere have I seen such a \nfriendly race as the Sinhalese, who also uphold high \nmoral values.\u201d Such was the harmony between the \nTamils and the Sinhalese. But a malicious group has \nturned all of this upside down. \n All successive Governments of Sri Lanka have \nendeavoured to resolve the problem for over 25 years, \nincluding through Norwegian facilitation and \ninternational co-chairs overseeing a so-called peace \nprocess that was treated with contempt by the \nterrorists. On each occasion that talks were held \nseeking peace, the terrorists of the LTTE walked out on \nthe flimsiest of pretexts and reverted to terrorism of the \nworst kind, indiscriminately targeting innocent \ncivilians. \n Our Government will only be ready to talk to that \nillegal armed group when it is ready to commit itself to \ndecommissioning its illicit weapons, dismantling its \nmilitary capability and returning to the democratic \nfold. The Government has also made it clear that the \nelected Government cannot and will not permit the \nundermining of the territorial integrity of the sovereign \nUnited Nations Member State of Sri Lanka and the \ndivision of its territory. We are clear in this message. \n The Government\u2019s objective is to enable the \npeople to enjoy the benefits of democratic processes \nand to speed development activities in those areas \nwhere there is a heavy presence of terrorists. That \nwould be similar to the fast-tracking of economic \ndevelopment taking place in the Eastern Province of \nSri Lanka, where former terrorists now serve as \ndemocratically elected Provincial Councillors, and a \nformer child soldier conscripted by the LTTE is now \nthe elected Chief Minister, having abandoned terrorism \nand embraced democracy.  \n Significantly, the restoration of democracy in the \nEast of Sri Lanka was achieved in less than one year of \nit being freed from the clutches of terror. \n Our Government has also sought and received the \ncooperation of the United Nations, the International \nCommittee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and other \nagencies to help us in providing humanitarian \nassistance to internally displaced persons (IDPs) and \nother affected civilians. The Secretary-General\u2019s \nRepresentative on IDPs, who visited Sri Lanka some \nyears ago, said:  \n\u201cSri Lanka presents the unusual situation of a \ncentral Government providing relief aid to \npersons under the control of the main opposition \ngroup. In a world replete with examples of \nGovernments and rebel groups using food as a \nweapon against civilian populations, the situation \nin Sri Lanka is one that deserves closer attention \nif not more publicity as an important precedent.\u201d \n(E/CN.4/1994/44/Add.1, para. 67) \n The Government of Sri Lanka continues this \nhumanitarian policy even today, although we know that \nthe terrorists seize a good proportion of those \nhumanitarian supplies. Our supplies are not confined to \nfood; they extend to medicines and all other essentials \nas well as schools and hospitals, with teachers, doctors, \nnurses, and all other essential staff. That is not all; the \nGovernment also purchases the paddy and other \nfoodstuffs produced in those areas. I do not think there \nis any country in the world where there is a \nGovernment that provides such humanitarian assistance \nto terrorists that attack it. Our Government considers \nthe supply of humanitarian relief to its people as its \nprime responsibility. \n The complex situation in Sri Lanka needs to be \naddressed and resolved through an appropriate process \nof deterrent law-and-order action and patient political \nefforts of consensus-building. We have achieved the \ndifficult but essential task of building peace in the \nEastern Province and are confident that it can be done \nin the north as well. \n  \n \n08-51749 4 \n \n This session of the Assembly is a good time to \ntake stock of progress made towards the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) around the globe. It is \nregrettable to note, as we do so, that most are behind \nschedule. The slowing down of global economic \ngrowth, financial turmoil and speculation, rising food \nand fuel prices and the impacts of climate change are \nclear obstacles. Also, sanctions imposed on the leaders \nof some countries, and on their leadership, based on \ntheir political role, following protests, are in fact, \ntargeted at the innocent people of those countries.  \n The steadily growing menace of international \nterrorism, with related activities such as the smuggling \nof illegal arms, human trafficking, drug trafficking, \nmoney-laundering, and business empires run by \nterrorist groups undoubtedly undermine the \nfundamentals of humanity and civilization. It appears \nthat steps taken by us to eradicate such illegal activities \nhave not been effective. This further complicates all \nnational and international efforts at moving towards \nrealizing the MDGs. Terrorism, as I have emphasized \nmany a time, by its very nature, pushes back even our \nmodest achievements. \n Another similar menace is threatening to devour \nour children, the most valuable asset of any nation. \nThat is the insecurity of cyberspace which has not only \nhelped corrupt the minds of our children but also \nexposes them to predators such as paedophiles, drug \ndealers and pornographic sites. Sri Lanka has banned \npornographic and similar destructive sites from being \navailable through Internet service providers. We are \nalso controlling and restricting the use of mobile \ntelephones for such damaging activities. That is an \nimportant area for world leaders to focus on. \n It is important that urgent and collective actions, \nboth short- and long-term, are taken to stem those \nadverse trends. Only such determined and concerted \nactions will enable progress to be made towards the \nrealization of the agreed development goals, including \nthe MDGs, and frustrate elements that are bent on \nreversing the gains made. \n We must deeply commit ourselves as Members of \nthe United Nations to forging a way forward from the \nlimitations not seen by those who laid the foundations \nfor this great institution of humankind. If we fail to do \nit now, future generations will curse us. \n I wish to conclude my address with a verse from \nthe Dhammapada, words from the Enlightened One: \n \u201cVictory breeds hatred, \n The defeated live in pain. \n Happily the calmed live, \n Having set victory and defeat aside.\u201d "

        "file_text": "Let me start by \nexpressing my respect and gratitude to the President of \nthe General Assembly at its previous session, \nMr. Srgjan Kerim, whose active involvement and \ninitiatives have contributed to a broader Assembly \nagenda and facilitated its work. I wish to extend my \ncongratulations to his successor, Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann. I congratulate you, Sir, on your \nappointment and wish you fruitful work. \n The past year has seen many new challenges and \nproblems with which the international community has \nto deal. In our attempts to respond to these problems \nand to search for the best solutions we have recognized \nyet again that different crises cannot be successfully \novercome without referring to such universal values as \ndemocracy, freedom and solidarity. \n One of the biggest global challenges at present is \nthe food crisis and its consequences. The decision to \nmake that issue the central theme of this year\u2019s General \nAssembly session testifies to the special role of the \nUnited Nations as a forum for debate focused on major \nglobal challenges. Poland appreciates the initiative to \njuxtapose the debate on the food crisis with discussions \nabout the need to democratize the United Nations, as it \nis only a democratic and effective United Nations that \ncan face up to the global challenges of eliminating \nhunger and poverty and ensuring the sustainable \ndevelopment of the poorest nations. That is why we \nremain certain that the United Nations reform process \nshould continue.  \n One of the fundamentals of the democratic \ngovernance of the United Nations is the rule \u201cone \nState, one vote\u201d. Each State should be given the \nopportunity to decide in which direction the United \nNations will head, and the General Assembly remains \nthe most important forum for such democratic debate. \nIn this context, it is especially important to streamline \nthe decision-making mechanism.  \n We are in favour of accelerating the pace of work \non Security Council reform. The number of \nnon-permanent members of the Council should be \nincreased so as to truly reflect today\u2019s world. Let us \nremember that some of the rules in that regard were \nlaid down in a world that was fundamentally different \nfrom today\u2019s.  \n \u201cEveryone has the right to a standard of living \nadequate for the health and well-being of himself and \nof his family, including food, clothing, housing and \nmedical care and necessary social services\u201d: that \nprinciple is enshrined in article 25 of the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights, whose sixtieth \nanniversary we celebrate this year. As an international \ncommunity, we bear responsibility for their fulfilment.  \n Fighting against hunger and poverty is among the \neight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It has \nbeen almost eight years since the international \ncommunity set them. Despite numerous declarations \nand commitments we are still short of achieving the \nGoals. It will be impossible to overcome the current \ncrisis or carry out our development policies unless \u2014 \n \n \n31 08-51839 \n \nand I stress this \u2014 every country shoulders its \nindividual responsibility, takes concrete steps and \nassesses the progress made so far. We should make \njoint efforts to promote a global development \nprogramme with the MDGs as its basis.  \n It was in that vein that Poland joined British \nPrime Minister Gordon Brown in endorsing the call to \naction on the MDGs. We hope that that statement, \nwhich reflects a broad understanding among countries, \nbusiness representatives, non-governmental organizations \nand faith groups will contribute to the full attainment of \nthe Millennium Development Goals. We believe that \nthe high-level meeting on the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals taking place on 25 September will \nresult in concrete commitments that will be \nimplemented in a timely manner: timeliness is of \nspecial importance. \n As we analyse the causes of the food crisis and \ntry to find effective prescriptions for combating \npoverty and hunger, we take note of the immense \nnegative impact of climate change on these \nphenomena. Although the consequences of climate \nchange will be felt globally, it is the poorest who will \nbear the brunt and who will be hurt the most severely. \nIt goes without saying that, without solidarity, \nresponsibility and enhanced mutual cooperation, \ndeveloping countries will not be able to fulfil their \ncommitments regarding reductions in greenhouse gas \nemissions and will fail to successfully adapt to climate \nchange. This calls for a certain change of philosophy in \nour approach, and for much greater effort on the part of \nthe North in favour of the South. What I am saying \nnow is mere short hand: the rich should become much \nmore committed to helping the poor. The United \nNations is, if not the sole organization, then definitely \nthe principal organization that can implement these \nobjectives. \n Poland wants to be an active partner in the \ninternational community\u2019s activities to that end. With \nthis in mind, we will be hosting in Poznan in December \nthis year the fourteenth session of the Conference of \nthe Parties to the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change and the fourth Meeting \nof the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol. One of the key \nchallenges facing this year\u2019s Conference is to work out \nsolutions and mechanisms that will support and bring \nabout true systemic change in developing countries. It \nis especially vital to ensure the funding of investments \nthat will help to modernize the economies of those \ncountries and help them reduce carbon dioxide \nemissions and adapt to climate change. I reiterate that \nthere is no possibility of implementing these objectives \nwithout a major change in thinking, especially by the \ncountries that now have the most resources. We hope \nthat this year\u2019s Poznan Conference will lay strong \nfoundations for reaching a new agreement in \nCopenhagen in December next year.  \n As holder of the presidency of the fourteenth \nsession of the Conference of Parties, Poland will strive \nto bring the positions of major countries as close as \npossible so as to ensure maximum progress during the \nPoznan Conference. We anticipate cooperation and \nsupport from our international partners and friends. We \ngreatly appreciate the Secretary-General\u2019s deep \ncommitment to the implementation of these objectives. \n Introducing new, more climate-friendly \ntechnologies should be coupled with enhanced energy \nsecurity and diversification of energy sources. As we \ndo not yet have mechanisms to guarantee solidarity on \nthe energy crisis among all States members of the \nEuropean Union \u2014 I refer to the European Union but \nthis is also applicable to all other States of the world \u2014 \nthe issue of energy security becomes our priority. \n Poland is following developments in Georgia \nwith concern. We believe that engaging in dialogue and \nacting in a spirit of solidarity and consistency in \nimplementing energy policy should become a priority \nfor all European States, especially European Union \nStates. It is only in that way that Europe can be assured \nof energy security, especially at a time of the complete \nunpredictability of actions of the current main \nsuppliers of energy to Europe. \n Poland\u2019s concern arises from the abuse by some \nStates, especially one very powerful State, of energy as \na tool to achieve political goals in relations with \nneighbours and with all the other nations that benefit \nfrom the supply of energy by that State. \n Thus it is of fundamental importance to diversify \nthe sources of supply, to introduce transparent rules \nregulating the energy trade and to extend transport \ninfrastructure, especially by developing alternative \nroutes and energy sources for the European Union, \nmainly from the Caspian Sea, Central Asia and the \nMiddle East. This could significantly accelerate the \ndevelopment of the States of those areas and enhance \ntheir potential as part of global solidarity. \n  \n \n08-51839 32 \n \n I have referred to Georgia in the context of \nenergy security. But the situation in that country is far \nmore serious. Several weeks ago we witnessed an \nillegal military aggression and the division of the \ncountry. That was an aggression against an independent \nState. Fundamental principles of international law, such \nas the inviolability of borders and respect for territorial \nintegrity, were breached. \n Without respect for those principles, the world \nwill be a hotbed of not one but hundreds of conflicts. \nWe cannot allow the relativization of international law. \nWe cannot accept that international law is applicable to \nthe weak but not binding on the strong. If we do, \ninternational law will have no positive impact, \nespecially as concerns the principle of territorial \nintegrity. We must not allow the undermining of a \nprinciple on the basis of which the United Nations was \nestablished 63 years ago in the aftermath of the Second \nWorld War as a consequence of the bankruptcy of the \nLeague of Nations. That founding principle of the \nUnited Nations is the principle of law and of \nopposition to the unlawful use of force. \n Not all members come from countries \nneighbouring Georgia or from countries in or near \nEurope, but the problem of Georgia is a problem for us \nall, for every country that is grappling with issues \nrelating to territorial integrity or to stronger neighbours \nabusing their advantages. The international order \nshould be based on strict compliance with the United \nNations Charter by all subjects of international law \u2014 \nfirst and foremost, by all States. It should be based on \ncommon responsibility for the fate of countries \nincapable of ensuring their own security alone.  \n Those were the motives that guided my response \nto the Georgian conflict and the actions of the \nPresidents of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Ukraine. \nThe complete implementation of the peace plan, which \nshould also cover the issue of the territorial integrity of \nGeorgia, is a prerequisite for the further discussions \nabout the Caucasus to be held in Geneva in October \nand a prerequisite for the future of relations between \nthe European Union \u2014 of which Poland is the twenty-\nsixth member \u2014 and Russia. Those relations can be \ncorrect and mutual only if both sides respect \ninternational law in their relations both with each other \nand with third parties. \n One expression of Poland\u2019s involvement in \ninternational security is its participation in a counter-\nterrorism coalition in many volatile regions of the \nworld. Today, more than 3,500 Polish troops and police \nofficers are taking part in global peacekeeping and \nstabilization forces \u2014 from Africa to the Balkans, \nthrough the Middle East and Asia.  \n Iraq was one such place. Through the five years \nof its presence in Iraq, Poland has made efforts to help \nits Iraqi friends and allies to ensure strengthened \nexternal and internal security. Its mission, the main \nstage of which comes to an end this year, has clearly \nbeen a success. Iraq today is definitely safer and more \nstable than a few years ago, despite the doubts \nexpressed in some circles.  \n What remains a challenge, however, is the \nsituation in Afghanistan. We deeply believe that the \nmission in Afghanistan, in which Poland is also taking \nan active part, is bound to end in success, not only a \nmilitary success in the fight against terrorism but also \nthe success of the Afghan nation in improving its day-\nto-day existence. Military action must also be \naccompanied by measures to stabilize the Afghan \neconomy, improve the internal security situation and \nenable Afghanistan to grow more quickly. I should like \nto believe that this mission will end successfully. \n The continuing lack of stability in the Middle \nEast is a source of concern for almost \u2014 the \u201calmost\u201d \nis regrettable \u2014 every country in the world, including \nPoland. The lengthy process of building an \nindependent Palestinian State should be completed as \nsoon as possible, for the sake of Palestinians and \nIsraelis alike, both nations being Poland\u2019s friends. We \nwish the Palestinian people every success in their \nstruggle for an independent State. To Israel, with which \nwe have important historic ties, because many of its \ncitizens come from Poland, we wish successes and \npeace, a peace much needed by Israel.  \n I note with pleasure that our hopes are being \nraised by the situation in Lebanon. Poland believes that \nthe elections and the new President will bring the \nstability and peace for which the Lebanese people have \nbeen waiting for 35 years \u2014 and even before that the \nsituation was often difficult. We wish the new \nLebanese authorities and the nation of Lebanon every \nsuccess. We will be involved in this part of the world in \na spirit of international solidarity and because of our \nhistoric ties with the region.  \n The issues I have mentioned cannot be resolved \nby a single State or a single group of States. Today we \n \n \n33 08-51839 \n \nsee clearly that we need joint action by all countries: \nrich and poor, from both the east and the west. \nHowever, in today\u2019s world, where the division into east \nand west is no longer as important as it was in the past, \nwhat we need above all is solidarity between north and \nsouth; we must give help to those in need.  \n We need to promote democracy, of course \nadapting it to the cultural conditions and traditions of a \ngiven State, because, regardless of its flaws, there has \nnever in our history been a system more friendly to \nmankind. We should act jointly and in a spirit of \nsolidarity through effectively operating international \nstructures such as the United Nations and its agencies, \nwhich have global reach and an unchallenged position. \nThe Secretary-General rightly says that there should be \ndeeper coordination between the work of the agencies, \nirrespective of the great successes which the bodies \naffiliated to the United Nations have scored over recent \ndecades. \n What is most important, however, is to ensure \nuniversal respect for international law, human rights \nand fundamental freedoms.  \n I hope that when we meet next year during the \nsixty-fourth session the world will be slightly safer and \na little closer to the principles that I have had the \nhonour to refer to in this address."

        "file_text": "At the outset, on behalf of the \ndelegation of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea, allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-third session. I also wish to express confidence \nthat, under your able stewardship, the current session \nwill be a success.  \n It is a centuries-long aspiration of mankind to live \nin a peaceful and prosperous world, free from war and \ndomination. Nearly 10 years have passed since the \nGeneral Assembly adopted the Millennium Declaration \n(resolution 55/2), reflecting that common desire. \nNevertheless, a vicious circle of aggression and \nintervention, conflict and terrorism still persists within \ninternational relations, and, consequently, global peace \nand security continue to face serious new challenges. \n The military alliances in place throughout the \ncold war era are being further intensified, and arms \nraces in new forms are taking place in the Asia-Pacific, \nEuropean and other regions. Attempts to justify \nviolations of the sovereignty of developing countries \nunder the pretext of human rights, non-proliferation \nand the war on terror go ever-more undisguised. \nDisparities in wealth and imbalances in the level of \ndevelopment between the North and the South have \nbecome further deepened, foreshadowing gloomy \nprospects for the achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals in developing countries. The ever-\nworsening energy, food and financial crises of recent \ndays are seriously affecting the already vulnerable \neconomies of developing countries. \n Today\u2019s realities require all Member States to \npool their efforts for the building of a just, peaceful \nand prosperous world as a matter of priority, as they \npledged in the Millennium Declaration. \n The building of a new world, free and peaceful, \nwithout domination, subjugation, aggression or war is a \ncommon aspiration of the world\u2019s peoples and is now \nthe shared responsibility of humankind. Ongoing \nefforts to reform the United Nations and enhance its \nrole should be directed towards that end. It is also \nimperative to hold in check the attempts of some \nindividual countries to address critical international \nissues related to world peace and security solely with a \nview to their own interests. For that purpose, there is a \nneed to decisively enhance the authority of the General \nAssembly, in which all Member States exercise their \nequal rights. \n Aggression and interference in the internal affairs \nof sovereign States and acts committed under the cover \nof human rights protection should be completely \nrejected. Today, the worst peace-breaker and human \nrights violator in the world is none other than the \nUnited States, as evidenced by its armed invasion of \nsovereign countries and its unhesitating massacre of \ninnocent civilians. \n Human rights are sovereign and independent \nrights. We urge Member States to remain vigilant in the \nface of the constant clamouring by the United States \nand other Western countries on the subject of human \nrights protection and not to accept the politicization of, \nor selectivity and double standards in human rights. \n The main reason that the question of relations \nbetween the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea \nand Japan has been unresolved for over half a century \nlies in Japan\u2019s failure to liquidate its past, which is \nstained with large-scale crimes. Japan is the only war \ncriminal State that whitewashes the history of \naggression and massacre of millions of innocent people \nin Korea and other Asian countries and today attempts \nto grab the sacred Tok Islet of Korea. Such a country \n  \n \n08-53129 38 \n \nshould never be permitted to become a permanent \nmember of the Security Council. \n No one aspires to peace more than the Korean \npeople, who suffered under Japanese military \noccupation for almost half a century and since have \nbeen in confrontation with the United States for over \n60 years. Even now, a series of reckless military \nmanoeuvres destabilizing the region, including through \nthe strengthening of strategic military alliances, \nmassive shipments of state-of-the-art war equipment \nand annual large-scale military exercises, are being \nconducted in and around the Korean peninsula. \n The Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military \nexercise, staged by the United States and the Republic \nof Korea this past August, under the pretext of what \nthey called \u201cPreparation for an emergency on the \nKorean peninsula\u201d, was nothing more than a war drill, \nfor all intents and purposes mounting a pre-emptive \nnuclear strike on the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea. \n Double-faced approaches, such as talking about \ndialogue and resorting to war exercises against a \ndialogue partner behind the scenes, are a clear \nindication of the persistently hostile policy of the \nUnited States against the Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of Korea and the confrontational policy of the \npresent South Korean regime. \n In the face of such military threats and danger of \nwar, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea has \nbeen strengthening in every possible way its self-\ndefence capability in order to safeguard its national \nsovereignty and peace. That choice and right of ours is \njust and legitimate and cannot be subject to criticism \nand blame by others. If the powerful deterrent to war \nsecured by the Songun policy of the respected General \nKim Jong Il had not existed, the Korean peninsula \nwould have already suffered catastrophes several times \nover, which would certainly have led to the complete \ndisruption of regional peace and stability as a whole. \n The denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is \nthe lifetime instruction of President Kim Il Sung, the \ngreat leader of our people, and the Government of the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea remains \nconsistent in its position of resolving the nuclear issue \npeacefully through dialogue and negotiations. The \nadoption of the North-South Joint Declaration on the \nDenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in 1992 and \nof the Agreed Framework between the United States of \nAmerica and the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea in 1994 are a demonstration of the firm political \nwill of our Government to denuclearize the Korean \npeninsula. \n Thanks to our sincere endeavours, several rounds \nof the Six-Party Talks have been held to date, enabling \nthe adoption of the Joint Statement of 19 September \n2005, followed by the agreements on and \nimplementation of phased actions aimed at resolving \nthe nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.  \n The Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea \nhonoured its commitments to the agreements of the \nSix-Party Talks in good faith. Nuclear facilities were \ndisabled at the final stage, a nuclear declaration was \nsubmitted and those measures envisaged for the \ndestruction phase were even implemented in advance.  \n That notwithstanding, the United States has laid \nan artificial obstacle to implementing the 3 October \nagreement by refusing to implement its obligations and \nput forward such an unjust demand as verification of \nan international standard never agreed on among the \nsix parties or between the Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of Korea and the United States.  \n The international standard asserted by the United \nStates is nothing but the special inspection that the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) called for \nin the 1990s to infringe upon the sovereignty of the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, causing it \nultimately to pull out of the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. \n The United States has now put on hold the \nimplementation of the procedure for de-listing the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea as a State \nsponsor of terrorism under the pretext of verification, \neven after having officially declared that the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea is not a State \nsponsor of terrorism. That is little short of admitting \nthat the list is not actually related to terrorism.  \n As far as verification is concerned, it is a \ncommitment to be fulfilled by the six parties during the \nfinal phase of the denuclearization of the entire Korean \npeninsula, in accordance with the 19 September Joint \nStatement. The United States insistence on unilateral \ninspection of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea is a brigand-like demand to unilaterally disarm \nthe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, the other \nwarring party, by discarding its commitment to the \n \n \n39 08-53129 \n \ndenuclearization of the entire Korean peninsula, the \ncore of which is the removal of the United States \nnuclear threat, in accordance with the 19 September \nJoint Statement. \n Now that the United States has broken the \nagreement, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea \nis inevitably taking relevant countermeasures based on \nthe principle of action for action. If the six parties are \nnot true to their word in carrying out their respective \nobligations because of their great lack of trust in one \nanother, no progress will be made at all. That is a \nlesson drawn from the process of previous Six-Party \nTalks. The Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea will \ncontinue to make every sincere effort to achieve the \ndenuclearization of the entire Korean peninsula, but we \nwill not be indifferent to an attempt to offend our \ndignity and self-respect and to violate our sovereignty. \n As members are well aware, inter-Korean \nrelations have been worsening ever since the \ninstallation of the new regime in South Korea, which \nrejects the North-South joint declaration of 15 June \n2000 and the declaration of 4 October 2007. \nResolutions were adopted by consensus at previous \nGeneral Assembly sessions supporting the historic \nNorth-South summits held in Pyongyang in 2000 and \n2007 and the 15 June 2000 joint declaration and the \n4 October 2007 declaration resulting from them. As \nstipulated in those resolutions, the 15 June joint \ndeclaration and programme of action and the 4 October \ndeclaration constitute major milestones that could \nshorten the process of improving inter-Korean relations \nand achieving independent national reunification in the \nnew century, as well as a grand programme for Korean \nreunification that clearly reflects the demands of the \ntimes and the aspirations of the nation. \n Those declarations enjoy the unanimous support \nnot only of the entire Korean people, but also of the \ninternational community as a whole, as they are most \ncomprehensive and realistic in their content and \ninclude all previous inter-Korean agreements, \nincluding the joint statement of 4 July 1972, which \nclarifies the three principles of independence, peaceful \nreunification and great national unity. \n It is intolerable that the declarations agreed upon \nand adopted at the highest level in the North and the \nSouth and supported unanimously by the international \ncommunity are now being disregarded simply because \nof the changed regime in South Korea. The \nGovernment of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea will continue to seek national reconciliation and \nunity by fully implementing the 15 June joint \ndeclaration and the 4 October declaration, launching a \nnew era of independent reunification, peace and \nprosperity and doing its utmost to ensure durable peace \nand stability on the Korean peninsula.

        "file_text": "The developing \nworld is at a tipping point. In the Philippines, we feel \nthe pain of high prices of food, fuel and rice. Our \npeople pursue the universal dream of a better life for \nthemselves and their children: better education, better \nhealth care, higher wages, a dignified retirement. We \nare proving the value of a new paradigm for \nself-reliance through the use of, first, a targeted \nstrategy with a set of precise prescriptions to ease our \nprice challenges; secondly, food self-sufficiency and \nmore energy independence; and thirdly, long-term \nreforms. This is a positive example that we wish to \nshare with the rest of the world. \n Our gains over the past seven years were hard-\nearned. We made tough and sometimes painful \ndecisions to reset our economy: tax increases, banking \nreforms, a crackdown on smugglers and tough fiscal \ndiscipline, to name a few. Thankfully, these reforms \nhave given us some running room to weather the first \nwave of global price shocks that reverberated across \nthe world earlier this year. \n \n \n15 08-51570 \n \n It has not been easy, but Filipinos are tough and \nresilient. We have pulled together. We have been able \nto draw on additional revenues to provide targeted \ninvestments in food and fuel to keep our poor afloat \nuntil a better day. But we are also realistic and know \nthat we cannot do it alone. We need a strong United \nNations as never before. We need rigorous \ninternational cooperation as never before. \n Economic uncertainty has moved like a tsunami \naround the globe, wiping away gains, erasing progress, \nnot just here on Manhattan island, but also in the many \nislands of the Philippines. Just when we thought the \nworst had passed, the light at the end of the tunnel \nbecame an oncoming train hurtling forward with new \nshocks to the global financial system. The setbacks \nfrom these global shocks of the past year \u2014 and of the \npast weeks \u2014 are real and profound. It will take time \nand perseverance to put the pieces back together. \n To address these global challenges, we must go \non building bridges among allies around the globe in \norder to bring the rice to where it is needed to feed the \npeople, to make investments to create jobs, and to keep \nthe peace and maintain stability in the world. \n It is therefore timely that the Secretary-General, \nBan Ki-moon, has organized this year\u2019s agenda around \nthe impact of the global economy on the poor. He \ndeserves our highest praise for his quick and decisive \naction on the global food crisis. His Comprehensive \nFramework for Action, involving the United Nations, \ndonor countries, civil society and the private sector, \nseeks to achieve food security through the right \ncombination of policies, technologies and investments. \nThis is a model of the United Nations in action. \n Since the volatile global economic situation \nbecame apparent many months ago, in the Philippines \nwe have increased and stabilized the supply of rice and \ndelivered targeted subsidies to the poor. We have \nreached out to neighbours such as Viet Nam and others \nin the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and \nelsewhere to ensure a stable supply and affordable \nprices. We have clamped down on price gouging and \ninvested additional billions in planting and agricultural \nmodernization. \n We have increased our energy independence by \n17 per cent through greater use of geothermal energy, \nbiofuels and other renewable sources, and we expect to \nattain 60 per cent energy independence in two years. \nBiofuels have been cited as being a positive factor for \nclean energy. At the same time, they have also been \ncited as a negative factor that contributes to high food \nprices. We are pursuing a policy of using non-food \nbiofuel sources planted on land unusable for food \nproduction purposes. We see this approach as a way for \ncountries to seek a sustainable balance between food \nand energy needs.  \n For food self-sufficiency, our food baskets are \nNorth Luzon in our largest island and the southern \nisland of Mindanao. Mindanao has fields of the highest \nproductivity, yet also the majority of our poorest \nprovinces. It is a sad irony that our food basket has \nsome of the highest incidences of hunger in our nation.  \n The prime reason is the endless Mindanao \nconflict. Our archipelago of 7,000 islands has had its \nshare of religious strife, ethnic tension and violence. \nFor years, we have worked to achieve peace in \nMindanao. Much progress was made until violent \nelements within the Moro Islamic Liberation Front \n(MILF) decided to take the law into their own hands. \nWe will restart the dialogue when the area is secure, \nwhen our people are safe and when responsible \nelements in the MILF regain control. \n There is no alternative to peace. I stand before the \nAssembly today to declare loud and clear that we are \ncommitted to the process of peace in Mindanao. We \ngratefully acknowledge here today the central role of \nso many friends and allies, including the United \nNations; Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Libya, \nMalaysia, Saudi Arabia and others in the Organization \nof the Islamic Conference; Australia, New Zealand, the \nUnited States and other bilateral partners supplying \nofficial development assistance; and the European \nUnion and Sweden. All have played a big role in \nadvancing peace and development in Mindanao. \n We will refocus the peace talks from an approach \nthat is centred on dialogue with rebels to one of \nauthentic dialogue with the communities. The context \nof our engagement with all armed groups will \nsubscribe to the United Nations-recognized principle of \ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration. We \nmaintain high hopes in interfaith dialogue as a means \nof building bridges rather than barriers between \ncommunities of different cultures and ethnicity. In \nfurtherance of this effort, the Philippines will host the \nfirst-ever Special Ministerial Meeting of the \nNon-Aligned Movement on Interfaith Dialogue and \nCooperation for Peace and Development in May next \n  \n \n08-51570 16 \n \nyear. We will also cooperate with the Alliance of \nCivilizations. \n We are also pleased that the Secretary-General \nwill join us in Manila during the second Global Forum \non Migration and Development. Our overseas Filipino \nworkers are true global pioneers. There is no ship \nabroad that does not have a Filipino crew or a nation \nthat does not have highly skilled Filipino workers. The \nmovement of people from one country to another will \nsurely increase as globalization continues to erase \nborders. This fact should be recognized as having \nimplications for the growth and development of both \nsending and receiving countries. \n In many troubled places of our world, the United \nNations is the last great hope for peace and security. \nFor this reason, the Philippines contributes one of the \nlargest police contingents to United Nations \npeacekeeping operations. \n Mr. President, your leadership is more vital than \never. The Philippines will fully support you as you lead \nour General Assembly for the coming year. \n In conclusion, there are hundreds of millions of \ngood people across this globe who are struggling as \nnever before. We must hear their cry for help. It is \nwithin the collective power of the leaders at this United \nNations General Assembly to fulfil the universal dream \nof better education, better health, food on the table and \na dignified life.

        "file_text": "I wish \nat the outset to congratulate Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann on his election to the presidency of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-third session. I also pay \nwell-deserved tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Srgjan \nA/63/PV.13  \n \n08-53122 24 \n \nKerim, and thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for \nthe dignified, far-sighted and able manner in which he \nhas carried out his heavy responsibilities since his \nelection. \n The central theme of this session and the subjects \nchosen for two high-level events are a perfect \nreflection of the international community\u2019s current \nconcerns. In recent months, the world has experienced \ncrises that have revealed our collective vulnerability \nand our inability to confront those crises. As always, \nsince the world order is based on that imbalance, the \ndeveloping countries in particular pay the highest price \nby being powerless to meet the challenges that threaten \ntheir political stability and social cohesion.  \n The President returned to the Chair. \n In that regard, the consequences of climate \nchange and the food crisis caused by the scarcity and \nsoaring prices of certain basic commodities have \nplunged millions of people into extreme poverty. \nInternational financial and economic institutions, \nwhose mission it is to anticipate crises and alert the \ninternational community to their potential risk, must \nplay their proper role by undertaking the needed \nreforms without requiring developing countries, in \nparticular African countries, to abide by commitments \nincompatible with their development goals.  \n We must effectively and resolutely combat \nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We stress \nonce again the importance and urgency of adopting a \ncomprehensive counter-terrorism convention, while \navoiding any provisions or stipulations that would \nprejudice the legitimate struggle of people to reclaim \ntheir freedom or of discrediting any particular religious \ncommunity.  \n It is indispensable to continue the work of \nreforming the Organization so that it can become an \ninstrument to promote freedom, democracy, justice, \npeace, security, development and progress. Such \nreform will be fruitful and promising only if it includes \nreform of the Security Council through the equitable \nexpansion of its membership, the democratization of its \ndecision-making processes and the improvement of its \nworking methods.  \n Algeria\u2019s actions in the geographical and political \nspheres to which it belongs are based on the principles \nof good-neighbourliness, cooperation and solidarity. In \nthe Arab Maghreb, Algeria is working to ease the \ndifficulties we are experiencing, which have hindered \nthe re-launching of the Arab Maghreb Union, in the \nconviction that the destiny of our peoples and the \nrequirements of our times demand the advent of a \nunited and prosperous Maghreb. We are, however, keen \nto ensure that efforts in that regard do not meet with \nnew disappointments, and we therefore think that that \nre-launching must be undertaken on a sound, solid and \nlasting basis that takes into account the enlightened \nself-interest of all the peoples of the region. \n Inspired by its faith in that ideal of the Maghreb, \nAlgeria has sincerely supported and will continue to \nsupport efforts to find a just, lasting and internationally \nlegitimate solution to the conflict in Western Sahara \nthat will allow the Saharawi people to exercise freely \nand transparently their inalienable right to self-\ndetermination. That is why Algeria believes it vital that \nthe momentum created by the Manhasset process be \npreserved and encouraged. We cannot overstress the \nresponsibility of all the parties. We have made an \nurgent appeal to the Secretary-General to participate in \nactions to remove obstacles to the negotiating process \nand to bring about conditions that will permit the \nholding of the fifth round of the process as soon as \npossible, as required by the relevant resolutions of the \nSecurity Council. Algeria, for its part, will continue to \nassume fully the role dictated by its status as a \nneighbourly country and an observer of the process. \n On the Middle East, Algeria is pleased to note the \npositive developments in Lebanon and encourages all \nparties to persevere on the path of unity and national \nreconciliation. It is obvious that the Middle East will \nknow no peace without a settlement of the Palestinian \nquestion, which is at the core of the Israeli-Arab \nconflict. There is no need for me to remind the \nAssembly that the advent of a just, comprehensive and \nlasting peace in the Middle East will inevitably require \nrestoring to the Palestinian people their national and \nhistoric rights, including their right to an independent \nState, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, the return \nof refugees and the restoration of all the other Arab \nterritories occupied by Israel. On that basis, we appeal \nto the international community to fully shoulder its \nresponsibilities towards the Palestinian people, to \nsupport their just cause politically and to step up its \nhumanitarian assistance in order to ease their suffering.  \n The African continent has been experiencing \nprofound and promising changes. Undeniably, it is in \nthe field of peace that the continent\u2019s achievements \n A/63/PV.13\n \n25 08-53122 \n \nhave been the most remarkable. Thus, the African \nUnion and other regional organizations have become \nrespected and necessary partners, particularly in \npreventing and settling African crises. Algeria \nwelcomes these positive trends. We regret, however, \nthat the support and commitment of Africa\u2019s partners \nremain below the agreed objectives, both with respect \nto restoring peace and to economic and social \ndevelopment programmes.  \n We believe it is of the greatest importance to \nrefrain from any action likely to thwart current peace \nefforts or to undermine the unity, territorial integrity \nand sovereignty of the Sudan. We must therefore \nmobilize the international community to promote the \npolitical process, which remains the only way to ensure \nthat the Sudanese people can benefit from the \nrestoration of peace and national reconciliation. In that \nregard, we reiterate our support for the efforts and \nproposals of the League of Arab States, the African \nUnion, the Organization of the Islamic Conference and \nthe Non-Aligned Movement, calling on the Security \nCouncil to freeze the decision of the Chief Prosecutor \nof the International Criminal Court and to promote and \nconsolidate the dynamics of peace and national \nreconciliation.  \n Similarly, with regard to the situation in \nZimbabwe, Algeria can only welcome the approach \nadopted by the African Union and the Southern African \nDevelopment Community to enable the people of \nZimbabwe to overcome their current difficulties.  \n We are solidly behind Africa\u2019s efforts to settle the \nSomali crisis by means of unreserved support for the \npolitical process and the dispatch of a peace mission to \nhelp the transitional authorities to restore peace and \nsecurity in the country.  \n There is no way to overcome the dangers to peace \nand harmony in the world other than concerted efforts \nand consultations on the basis of a renewed equitable \nand effective multilateral system that places the \nnon-discriminatory fulfilment of human needs and the \npreservation of human dignity at the heart of its \nconcerns. From that standpoint, the fight against all the \nills that afflict large swathes of humankind \u2014 whether \nextreme poverty, endemic disease, environmental \nproblems or clandestine immigration \u2014 can be won \nonly if we all, and in particular the developed \ncountries, join our efforts. The two high-level meetings \nduring this session, and others to be held over the next \nfew months will undeniably test our capacity to \nrespond collectively and solidly to the challenges of \nour time.

        "file_text": "Allow me first of all to congratulate you, \nMr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, on your election to \nthe presidency of this Assembly. It is truly an honour \nfor Latin America to have you leading our work. \n I have come to the United Nations to reaffirm \nMexico\u2019s permanent commitment to strengthen our \nmultilateral system and to build a world order that is \nmore human, more just, more prosperous, cleaner and \nmore secure. \n The problems and challenges that are faced today \nby humankind demand a renewed and strengthened \nUnited Nations. Mexico is convinced that the United \nNations is at a definitive historical moment. Global \nchallenges of the twenty-first century are testing the \nleadership and the vitality of the Organization. \n Threats to global security are not only the result \nof conflicts between States, but of the challenges posed \nby the activities of non-State actors such as \ninternational organized crime groups dealing in \nterrorism and drug trafficking. Those threats also \ninclude the degradation of the environment, pandemics, \nextreme poverty and massive violations of human \nrights. \n I would like to start with a first challenge for our \ngeneration and our civilization. Few challenges are as \nurgent as reversing the effects of climate change. This \nphenomenon affects indiscriminately rich countries as \nwell as poor, and paradoxically those that have \ncontributed the least to it are often those that are the \nmost vulnerable. \n Climate change is not a problem to be faced by \nnations according to their degree of development. It is \na task that requires moving from words to action \nsubstantiated in concrete proposals that are based on \nthe principles of common, but differentiated \nresponsibilities. \n Mexico has accordingly proposed the \nestablishment, within the United Nations of a Green \nFund that will provide incentives for States to redouble \ntheir efforts in this area. It is a great satisfaction for us \nto see that organizations like the World Bank have \nalready taken the initiative to broaden the availability \nof resources for the benefit of the countries that need \nthem. \n And so today, before this Assembly, I reaffirm on \nbehalf of my country the proposal of Mexico to set up \nsuch a Green Fund to which each State can all \ncontribute according to its economic capacity and that \nall of us could use in order to finance programmes to \ncut emissions, increase energy efficiency or establish \nmeasures for adapting to climate change. \n I respectfully call upon all nations, especially the \nmost developed, to contribute to the establishment of \nthis Green Fund for the creation of financial \ninstruments to protect the world\u2019s environment. \n As the Mexican Nobel Prize winner Octavio Paz \nsaid:  \n\u201cWhatever the form of political and social \norganization adopted by nations, the most \nimmediate and pressing issue is the survival of \nthe natural environment. To defend nature is to \ndefend humankind.\u201d \n We have no time or margin of error to avoid our \nresponsibility with regard to another global challenge \nthat particularly affects the poor: the international rise \nof food prices. We must act decisively to prevent that \nsituation from annulling the efforts we have made to \novercome poverty. \n In order to guarantee food security, the \nGovernment of Mexico has developed an action plan \nthat aims to facilitate access to the supply of food and \nincludes a sharp reduction of taxes on commodity \nimports, the enhancement of production, irrigation \ninfrastructure and productivity in the countryside, the \nestablishment of a national strategic reserve of \ncommodities and an increase in direct and conditional \nfinancial grants to the 6 million poorest families in the \ncountry as compensation for the rise in food prices. \n Indeed, many countries not only will be unable to \nmeet the targets set at the 2000 World Summit, but \nhave already experienced setbacks in the fight against \npoverty because of the phenomenon of high food \nprices. Despite that unfavourable environment, Mexico \nis achieving practically all of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. In fact, we have set additional \nobjectives that are reflected in our national \ndevelopment plan. To meet that challenge, Mexico has \npromoted a significant increase in its social spending, \n  \n \n08-51749 24 \n \nincluding in education, health and human development. \nNext year, we shall allocate $125 billion, or 60 per cent \nof our budget, to social spending.  \n Let me cite some examples. A conditional direct \ntransfer programme known as Opportunities, which \nenables families belonging to the most vulnerable \ngroups of the population to send their children to \nschool or to make regular visits to the doctor, has made \nit possible to reduce the country\u2019s rate of extreme \npoverty. Over the past 10 years, the number of persons \nliving in extreme poverty has fallen from 38 million to \nfewer than 15 million. We have also achieved universal \ncoverage in basic education. In addition, we have set a \nvery clear goal of achieving, by 2011, every country\u2019s \nideal in the area of health: universal coverage, \nincluding medical care, medicine and treatment, for all \nMexican women and men.  \n We are living in an era of shared responsibility. \nEveryone knows that, in a globalized world, the \nconsequences of our actions transcend the territories of \nour countries and affect the entire planet. The security \nthreats faced by Mexico and Latin America are a good \nexample of shared challenges; the illicit trade in drugs, \nweapons and human persons knows no borders. Today, \nLatin America is one of the regions with the highest \nnumbers of violent deaths in the world, and that has \nbecome one of the major limitations to our \ndevelopment. \n In Mexico, we are decisively addressing the \ndelinquency and organized crime that threaten our \nsociety and our democratic institutions. Mexican \nfamilies have decided to live in a Mexico of peace and \nlaws \u2014 a Mexico in which neither impunity nor crime \nis tolerated. That is why we have begun to tackle crime \nhead on. However, that requires shared international \nresponsibility. Mexico reiterates its appeal to all \nnations to seek new forms of cooperation against those \nthreats. The eradication of those scourges is a guiding \nprinciple of Mexico\u2019s national security policy and of \nthe international agenda that we are promoting. \n In addition to those problems, there is an \nincreasing questioning of the principles and values \ndefended by the United Nations \u2014 principles and \nvalues that were once believed to have taken root in the \ncommunity of States. Some have called into question \nthe fundamental principles of democracy and human \nrights, citing security requirements or the pre-eminence \nof economic and social rights. In commemorating the \nsixtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights, Mexico calls on Member \nStates to defend the universal values that are a \nprecondition for human development and the rule of \nlaw. \n Migratory flows are another global phenomenon \nof our time. In today\u2019s world, more than 200 million \npeople live outside their countries of origin. The causes \nof international migration are complex, ranging from \nthe consolidation of integration processes to the \ndemand for labour, the lack of adequate economic \nconditions and the persistence of internal or inter-State \nconflicts. Included in that population are millions of \nMexicans living here in the United States, who have \nsought opportunities for a dignified life for their \nfamilies. \n Migration cannot be reduced to the issue of \nsecurity, nor can it be managed as merely an economic \nphenomenon. That is why Mexico believes that the \ninternational community must view it in a \ncomprehensive manner that permits migratory flows to \nbe legal, safe, orderly and respectful of human dignity. \nThe United Nations must fully shoulder its \nresponsibility in the light of that global phenomenon, \nguided by the principle of shared responsibility among \nthe countries of origin, transit and destination. \n Terrorism, regardless of its justifications or \nideological motivations, has no place in the community \nof values that we have forged with such great \ndifficulty. Mexico condemns it and reaffirms its \nreadiness to cooperate on the basis of international law \nto prevent terrorist acts and punish their perpetrators.  \n The paradox is that all those problems can be \ndealt with and resolved only through global action, \nwhich requires the mediation of the United Nations. \n We Mexicans do not wish to shirk our global \nresponsibilities, nor will we do so. We want to be \nactors in \u2014 not observers of \u2014 the world\u2019s \ntransformations. We have decided to strengthen our \nactivism. Mexico has the eleventh largest population \nand the twelfth largest economy in the world, and we \nhave a long tradition of contributing to peace and \ninternational law. \n Therefore, we want to occupy a place of \nresponsibility and commitment to the common good of \nnations. That is why Mexico has submitted its \ncandidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security \n \n \n25 08-51749 \n \nCouncil for the period 2009-2010. If elected, my \ncountry will commit itself to acting on the basis of the \nfundamental values of the international community: the \nprevention and peaceful settlement of disputes; \nprohibition of the use or threat of use of force; and \ncompliance with the principles of the Charter of the \nUnited Nations, international law and human rights. \n We aspire to participate in the Security Council in \norder to promote Mexico\u2019s democratic ideals, which \nuphold the rule of law. We would strive to support the \nCouncil\u2019s efforts to rebuild societies and institutions \ntorn apart by war and by emerging threats. We would \nwork to ensure the settlement of disputes between \nStates at the earliest possible stage before the \nInternational Court of Justice, as well as compliance \nwith its decisions.  \n Our generation has a historic responsibility to act, \nhere and now, to meet the challenges of humankind in \nthe twenty-first century. It is our conviction that the \nUnited Nations is the forum that best represents the \ndiversity of human beings, the plurality of nations and \nour civilization\u2019s collective aspirations to well-being \nand progress. It is a privileged alliance formed to \nensure a world of peace and justice, security and \ndevelopment, with well-being and opportunities for all.  \n Multilateralism is the path of the twenty-first \ncentury. It is a comprehensive response to globalization. \nIn the new global era, we also need a strengthened and \nrenewed global Organization. We must join forces in \norder to make it possible for the United Nations to turn \ninto reality the dream of its founders: peace, security \nand development for all the peoples of the planet."

        "file_text": "These days, on our \ntelevision screens, images of thousands of parents \nconcerned about the health of their babies and children \nremind us of what lies at the very heart of our work \u2014 \nbuilding a better future for the coming generations, at \nhome as well as here in the United Nations. \n Armed conflict, climate change, poverty, hunger \nand the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \nare the bleak challenges we face today, together with \nnew global challenges such as increasing food and \nenergy prices and financial turbulence. A sense of \nshared responsibility and true partnership based on \nequality are the key qualities that must guide our \nefforts to meet these challenges. \n All inhabitants of the global village have the right \nas well as the duty to contribute to the well-being of \nour community. At the global level, that needs to be \ndone in the framework of an effective world \norganization that enjoys the trust of States and \nGovernments but also of societies and individual \ncitizens. \n A just and effective international order needs to \nbe based on rules equally applicable to every member, \nbig or small, strong or weak. Respect for the rule of \nlaw is indispensable if we want to prevent conflicts and \npromote peace and sustainable development. Austria \nhas therefore consistently promoted efforts to develop \ninternational relations based on the principles of the \n  \n \n08-52272 40 \n \nCharter of the United Nations and all the other \ninstruments that form our international legal system. \n Three weeks ago, 130 human rights experts and \npractitioners from around the world came together in \nVienna 15 years after the World Conference on Human \nRights held in Vienna in 1993. They formulated \nrecommendations on how to overcome the gap between \nhuman rights standards and the reality of their \nimplementation on the ground. Those recommendations \nhave been submitted to the General Assembly and the \nHuman Rights Council, and I hope they will contribute \nto the deliberations on the occasion of the sixtieth \nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights on 10 December. \n One of the basic threats to the rule of law is \nimpunity. Today, international criminal justice, as \ndispensed by the International Criminal Court as well \nas by the special tribunals established by the Security \nCouncil, has become a major tool for bringing to \njustice those responsible for war crimes and crimes \nagainst humanity.  \n Nowadays, some speak about the \u201cpeace \u2014 \njustice dilemma\u201d. I personally remain convinced that \npeace and justice are complementary objectives, both \nare equally essential. There can be no lasting peace \nwithout justice, and international justice will serve its \npurpose most fully and effectively if it helps societies \nadvance reconciliation and overcome the wounds of the \npast. As women and children are often the most \nvulnerable in our societies, they deserve our special \nattention in this context. \n No country, no society can succeed without \nrecognizing the contribution of women. Worldwide, \nwomen are the politically and socially most relevant \nemerging power of the twenty-first century. Their \ncontribution must be valued publicly, their \nparticipation encouraged, their potential fully used. \nThere are countless success stories of women leaders \nwho make a difference in their communities as \nbusinesswomen, mothers, teachers, farmers, workers, \npeacemakers and lawmakers. \n At the same time, we hear appalling reports from \naround the world of discrimination and violence \nagainst women. How can we speak of human rights for \nwomen as long as one out of every three women \nworldwide has been beaten or abused? It is the \nresponsibility of each and every Government to act on \nthis. The United Nations must take the lead by setting \nclear targets and establishing a network to share best \npractices in combating violence against women. \n Last year, the Women Leaders Network called on \nthe Secretary-General to appoint more women to \nleadership positions in the United Nations, in particular \nin mediation and peacebuilding. I am pleased that the \nSecretary-General has since entrusted a number of \noutstanding women with key positions both at \nHeadquarters and in the field, and I encourage him to \ncontinue this policy. \n With regard to Security Council resolution 1325 \n(2000) on women, peace and security, the European \nUnion (EU) policy of targeted support for women in \nand through peace missions could be extended to other \nregional organizations such as the African Union. To \nassess the practical results of resolution 1325 (2000), I \npropose a thorough review process on the occasion of \nits tenth anniversary in 2010. \n Recent events in Georgia are a stark reminder that \nthe scourge of war still haunts our European \nneighbourhood. The European Union is ready to work \ntogether with the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe, the Council of Europe and the \nUnited Nations so that Georgia can return to peace, all \ninternally displaced people can return safely and a \nlasting solution based on full respect for the \nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia is \nfound. I also call upon the Security Council to decide \non a timely prolongation of the United Nations \nObserver Mission in Georgia. \n As for the Western Balkans, I am heartened that \nwe are moving from the crisis management phase to \nthe integration phase. Today, thanks to the stabilizing \nrole of the EU, the peoples of the Western Balkans \nenjoy peace. Their future lies in the European Union. \n Austria welcomes the progress recently achieved \nin Zimbabwe. We hope that this will become another \nlasting example of the capacity of Africa for the \npeaceful resolution of conflicts on its continent. \nRegional ownership is the best option for success. \n Austria continues to actively support efforts to \nbring an end to decades of conflict in the Middle East. \nThree months ago, we hosted a donor conference in \nVienna for the reconstruction of the Nahr el-Bared \nrefugee camp in northern Lebanon in order to improve \nthe fate of the Palestinian refugees there and to support \n \n \n41 08-52272 \n \nstability, the rule of law and economic development in \nLebanon. \n I commend the Israeli and Palestinian leadership \nfor their commitment to dialogue and negotiations \ndespite repeated efforts by radical forces to undermine \nthe process started in Annapolis nearly a year ago. \nOngoing settlements and expansion, however, put our \ncommon vision in question. The two-State solution \nremains the only possible path towards a peaceful and \nprosperous Middle East that can provide lasting \nsecurity to all its inhabitants. \n I remain convinced that in international relations as \ninside our own societies, we must always support \ndialogue. Austria will continue her long-standing \ncommitment to the dialogue of cultures and religions with \na clear focus on the contribution of religious leaders, \nwomen, young people, the media and educators. \n With some 500,000 victims each year, small arms \nand light weapons are today\u2019s real weapons of mass \ndestruction. Africa is the continent most heavily \naffected by this problem. Together with her African \npartners, Austria works for real progress on the \ndestruction of small arms as well as on the fight against \nthe illicit arms trade. We also cooperate in developing \nsuitable legal instruments. \n Austria is also deeply involved in establishing an \ninternational legally binding ban on cluster munitions. \nThe Convention on Cluster Munitions that we adopted \nin Dublin this year is a milestone in the field of \ndisarmament and humanitarian law. Austria will sign \nthe Convention in Oslo on 3 December 2008. I appeal \nto all other countries to sign as soon as possible so that \nthis treaty can enter into force swiftly. \n The need to prevent nuclear proliferation at a \ntime when an increasing number of countries are \nlooking towards nuclear power as a means to produce \nenergy calls for courageous and creative solutions. \nAustria has presented a proposal in the framework of \nthe Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that aims \nat the comprehensive multilateralization of the nuclear \nfuel cycle. The goal is a fair system under which all \nStates who wish to receive nuclear fuel for an \nexclusively peaceful use can do so under equal \nconditions through the IAEA. \n With regard to the Iranian nuclear programme, we \nare convinced that the double-track approach is the \nbest way forward. At the same time, it is indispensable \nthat Iran fully complies with the relevant Security \nCouncil resolutions. In this context we commend and \nstrongly support the efforts of the IAEA Director \nGeneral, Mohamed El Baradei. \n Let me draw the Assembly\u2019s attention to the new \npartnership we developed and adopted at the Lisbon \nSummit in December 2007: the Joint Africa-European \nUnion Strategy based on the three aims of peace, \nsecurity and development. Without peace and security \nthere can be no sustainable development, and there is \nno security without human security. Human trafficking, \ndrugs, proliferation of weapons, unemployment and \ncrime \u2014 they all affect the very cohesion of our \nsocieties. \n In order to better address the challenges faced by \nAfrica, Austria, together with the Economic \nCommunity of West African States and the Southern \nAfrican Development Community, respectively, \nrecently organized a conference on peace and security \nin West Africa, in Ouagadougou, and a seminar on \npeace and development in Southern Africa, in \nJohannesburg. \n We need the turbo power of innovation to address \nglobal challenges. Climate change is not only \nresponsible for natural disasters but poses what is \nperhaps the most serious threat to the achievement of \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). For some \nsmall island States climate change and the resulting sea \nlevel rise are threats to their very existence. Austria \ntherefore welcomes the initiative by the Pacific island \nStates for a General Assembly resolution on the threat \nof climate change to international peace and security. \nUrgent action towards a global climate agreement by \nthe end of 2009 is the only way forward. We also \npropose to develop the United Nations Environment \nProgramme into a fully fledged World Environment \nOrganization. Furthermore, we support the creation of \na new International Renewable Energy Agency. Vienna \nis a suitable location to host such an agency, as many \nof its United Nations offices already deal with energy \nquestions. \n Eradicating extreme poverty and hunger \ncontinues to be one of the main challenges of the \ninternational community. At the midpoint towards \n2015, success in achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals has been uneven. While many \ncountries have made significant progress in attaining \n  \n \n08-52272 42 \n \nsome of the Goals, only a few are likely to reach all of \nthem. Urgent and increased efforts by the international \ncommunity are, therefore, needed. The active \ncontribution towards this global effort is a priority for \nthe Austrian Government. \n As a matter of urgency we also have to tackle the \nmultiple and complex causes of the current global food \ncrisis. We welcome the High-Level Task Force set up \nby Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, which aims to \ncreate an international strategy for food security, and \nwe eagerly await the first concrete results. \n Small and medium-sized countries have a specific \ninterest in an international system based on effective \nmultilateralism and the rule of law. They form the \nbackbone of the United Nations. They can make a \ndifference and act as a driving force on many issues \nbeneficial to the world community. \n Since joining the United Nations more than \n50 years ago, Austria has consistently worked for \nmultilateral solutions to global challenges. Our \ncandidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security \nCouncil is one expression of our determination to serve \nthe world Organization. That is the most important \nresponsibility that can be entrusted to a Member of the \nUnited Nations. We stand ready to assume that \nresponsibility and ask Members for their support. We \npledge to work for common solutions to our common \nglobal challenges in a sense of true partnership."

        "file_text": "My \ndelegation welcomes your inspired election, Sir, to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at this session, \nwhich is being held at a particularly important moment \nin the life of our Organization, given the numerous \nchallenges that we have to face. The robust messages \nthat you yourself have issued here clearly indicate that \nyou are fully aware of the magnitude of what is at \nstake. As is so well suggested by the Secretary-General \nin his report on the activities of the Organization \n(A/63/1), more than ever before the world\u2019s problems \nrequire concerted and coordinated actions. \n We commend the Secretary-General on the \nresolute action that he has undertaken since the \nbeginning of his mandate. We highly appreciate his \ndynamism, his realism and the increasing interest that \nhe brings to matters of peace, security and sustainable \ndevelopment. \n His Excellency Mr. Denis Sassou Nguesso, \nPresident of the Republic of the Congo, who was \nunable personally to attend this general debate, has \ninstructed me to share with the members of the \nAssembly a few thoughts on developments in our \nworld. \n The challenges that we have to tackle \nimmediately are numerous. They are related to peace, \nsecurity, and threats to people\u2019s lives and to nations, \nheightened by the food, energy and financial crises, as \nwell as natural disasters and climate change. \n By placing emphasis on the notion of solidarity, \nwhich we fully support, you have certainly illustrated, \nMr. President, the risk we run of losing our identity, an \noption that can only offer partial, even uncertain, \nsolutions to the challenges that confront us. Here, we \nreaffirm that the United Nations offers us the ideal \nframework to work together in search of lasting \nsolutions. That is the meaning underlying our ongoing \nattachment to multilateralism. \n Recent events in different parts of the world, \nparticularly in Europe, remind us that peace and \nsecurity rest on a fragile foundation, even where such \nmatters seem to have been solved definitively. Africa, \nstill at the heart of the concerns of the international \ncommunity and top of the agenda of the Security \nCouncil because of the conflicts that continue to \njeopardize progress and to hinder implementation of \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), will not \nsolve its problems with declarations of good intentions. \n The high-level meeting on Africa\u2019s needs that \nwas held on 22 September revealed that it is time to \nmove from promises to sustainable action. That is why \nwe welcome the adoption of the declaration that \nmarked that important event. Similarly, we salute the \nhigh-level meeting for the MDGs that concluded here \non 25 September.  \n As we all know, the stabilization of the situation \nin countries in conflict and the building of peace in \nothers would not have been possible without the \nsustained efforts of the United Nations and other \nbilateral and multilateral partners. The African Union \nand subregional African organizations continue to act \nresolutely and often with limited resources to meet \nthose challenges. Thanks to all such efforts, the Central \nAfrican Republic, to cite the example of our \nneighbouring country, is working to restore peace and \nsecurity through dialogue among the Government, the \nopposition and rebel movements. \n Still with respect to our subregion of Central \nAfrica, we call on the international community to step \nup its efforts to help stabilize the situation in the \neastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, particularly \nby supporting the Government of that country in its \nfight against rebel movements and other negative \nforces. In that context, the entry into force in June of \nthe Pact on Security, Stability and Development in the \nGreat Lakes Region will usher in a new climate of \nconfidence in that nerve centre of our continent. My \nGovernment is committed to fully playing its role in \nthat process, which will greatly contribute to \nstabilizing to the situation. \n With regard to the crisis between Chad and the \nSudan, we encourage those two countries to pursue \nevery effort to normalize their relations and consolidate \npeace in the region. In that regard, we welcome the \nresumption of diplomatic relations between the two \ncountries \u2014 an initiative that must be consolidated \nthrough the establishment of military monitoring units \nalong the common border. Those units need to be \nadequately equipped, in implementation of the Dakar \nAgreement signed in March 2008. \n As African Union co-mediator with Libya in that \ncrisis, Congo will spare no effort in helping to bring \nthose two brotherly countries to respect the \nengagements undertaken and to act always in good \nfaith in order to establish a definitive peace between \nand around them. \n \n \n27 08-53135 \n \n Solving the conflict in Darfur would contribute \nlargely to that end. That is why we make an urgent \nappeal for the effective deployment of the troops of the \nAfrican Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in \nDarfur (UNAMID), which should be supplied with all \nnecessary equipment to become operational and \nefficient. \n For its part, my country recently completed the \npreparatory phase for a police unit composed of 140 \npersonnel that is now at the disposal of UNAMID. \nHowever, the international community should also \nwork tirelessly to implement of the Abuja Agreement \non Darfur. Non-signatories who are violating that \nAgreement must be strongly pressured to return to the \nnegotiating table. In that context, we believe that it is \ncounterproductive to carry out the indictment against \nthe Head of State of the Sudan. \n With respect to Africa yet again, we welcome the \nsettlement of the crisis in Kenya and the process of \nreconciliation in Zimbabwe, and call on African \npolitical actors in power and in opposition to respect \nthe verdict of the ballot box. \n In its desire to participate in the collective effort \nin the area of peace and security, my country reaffirms \nits full commitment to the fight against terrorism, the \nproliferation of small arms and light weapons, drug \ntrafficking and human trafficking. Congo remains fully \ncommitted to strict compliance with the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in all its facets. \n Congo calls on the international community to \nconsider as a matter of urgency the resolution of the \nMiddle East conflict on the basis of commitments \nalready undertaken, particularly the road map of the \nQuartet and the Arab peace initiative.  \n Our commitment to multilateralism leads us to \nbelieve that there is a pressing need to pursue the work \nof United Nations reform, and particularly that of the \nSecurity Council. In keeping with the African position \non that issue, my country welcomes the decision to \nlaunch, before 31 January 2009, intergovernmental \nnegotiations that should finally enable that matter to \ngenuinely move forward. \n It is right that our present agenda includes the \nmatter of the effects of climate change on the \nenvironment, which is one of the major challenges of \nour times. My country is particularly sensitive to that \nissue since it has within its borders a part of the \nenormous Congo basin, the world\u2019s second ecological \nlung after Amazonia. The countries bordering the basin \nhave a great responsibility to humanity in the \nmanagement and sustainable exploitation of these \necosystems, which they are shouldering in a \ndetermined and encouraging manner. \n While endorsing the conclusions of last year\u2019s \nBali Conference, which laid the groundwork for the \npost-Kyoto period, the States of the Congo basin \nbelieve that global policies on the preservation of \nforest equilibriums should establish compensation \nmechanisms. Those would include the creation of \nsubstitute economies to benefit the populations in the \nareas involved. \n In expressing those concerns, I take the \nopportunity to announce that Congo will host in \nBrazzaville, from 27 to 30 October 2008, the sixth \nWorld Forum on Sustainable Development, devoted to \nassessing the progress achieved in the implementation \nof Agenda 21 and the Johannesburg Plan of \nImplementation, particularly concerning strategic, \ncredible and pertinent partnerships towards achieving \nthe Millennium Development Goals. \n On the economic and social front, we welcome \nthe focus at this session on sustainable development \nand implementation of the Millennium Development \nGoals. The analyses carried out here last week indicate \nthat African States have made significant progress, \nwith a rate of growth of approximately 6 per cent per \nannum, and that, as emphasized in the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s report, Africa is resolutely on the right path \nand should continue to pursue those commendable \nefforts, particularly since it varies between countries \nand regions. \n Nevertheless, such efforts and the promising \noutcomes they may yield require genuine, continuous \nand tangible international support. That is why our \npartners must keep their promises. \n The current Chair of the African Union, President \nKikwete of the United Republic of Tanzania, brilliantly \ndescribed to the Assembly the situation in our \ncontinent and indicated the way forward. We fully \nendorse the presentation he made here and on other \noccasions. We welcome the different partnerships that \nAfrica has established with its traditional friends and \nwith new ones. Here once again, the commitments need \nto be brought to fruition. \n  \n \n08-53135 28 \n \n Our continent is resolutely committed to the \nbattle for progress, which has several facets. That is \nwhy we attach great importance to matters of \ndemocracy, good governance and respect for human \nrights in the framework of the African Peer Review \nMechanism, a pillar of the New Partnership for \nAfrica\u2019s Development. Several African countries have \nagreed to submit to periodic evaluations that represent \na sort of right to positive interference in the affairs of \nother member States in matters that normally fall under \nnational jurisdiction. Congo has voluntarily subscribed \nto the process, illustrating Africa\u2019s devotion to the fight \nagainst bad governance, corruption, human rights \nviolations and impunity. \n It is therefore inconceivable that certain foreign \njudges should confer upon themselves the right to drag \nAfrican leaders to their national courts in the name of \nthe principle of universal jurisdiction \u2014 a rule that \nseems to be applied exclusively to Africa since, as we \nhave already seen, the same principle was soon \ndropped when it targeted leaders of powerful States. It \nis regrettable that international jurisdiction, while \nremaining respectable, seems to be following a path of \njudiciary spite against African leaders. \n In that regard, Africa has become an \nexperimentation ground for dangerous and even hateful \npractices. The sad memories of such other negative \nexperiences as slavery, the slave trade and colonization \nare enough for us. President Kikwete was right to raise \nthis issue here, in application of a decision taken \nduring the summit of the African Union held in Sharma \nel-Sheikh in Egypt. \n The Republic of the Congo had a particularly \nrough patch in the 1990s and managed, thanks to the \npolitical will of the Government, all political actors \nand the civil society, to achieve national reconciliation. \nThat climate of peace made possible the organization \nof legislative elections in 2007 and municipal and local \nelections in 2008 in an atmosphere of calm and \nserenity, despite irregularities identified during the \nvoting process. Nevertheless, the transparency and \ncredibility of the process were not disputed by the \ninternational observers. \n With the irregularities corrected, it is in the same \nclimate of calm and serenity that we are organizing the \n2009 presidential election, in accordance with our \nConstitution. The climate of restored peace has led to \nan increasingly reassuring economic situation that is \nsupported by improved budgetary planning and better \ndebt management within the framework of the Heavily \nIndebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative and the \nrigorous measures that today have enabled Congo to \nfocus more ambitiously on its development and on the \nprogressive achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. Within that framework and in a \nparticipatory manner, with the assistance of the United \nNations Development Programme, we drafted a \npoverty reduction strategy paper that was approved by \nthe World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. \n By way of illustration, the principle measures \ntaken towards the attainment of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals in the sensitive areas of education \nand health care focus on from free access to education \nand textbooks, the establishment of a drug purchase \ncentre, the distribution of treated mosquito nets to the \npopulation, and free access to HIV/AIDS testing, \ncheckups and anti-retroviral medication. \n Such efforts, however encouraging they may be, \ncan bear fruit in the long run only with the support of \nexternal partners and in a favourable international \ncontext as regards such thorny issues as debt, trade, \nofficial development assistance, financing for \ndevelopment and, above all, international peace and \nsecurity. \n Members may now easily understand why a \nmodest member of the international community such as \nCongo is so deeply invested in the existence and the \nwork of our collective home, the United Nations.

        "file_text": "I wish first to extend \nsincere congratulations to Mr. D\u2019Escoto Brockmann on \nhis election as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-third session and to express my appreciation for \nthe work done by his predecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim. I \nwould also like to thank the Secretary-General for his \nreport (A/63/1) on the work of the Organization, and I \nwelcome his comprehensive approach to threats and his \nfocus on recently emerged challenges. \n It is an honour for me to address the General \nAssembly for the first time as President of the Republic \nof Cyprus. Maintaining the effectiveness of multilateral \ndiplomacy and strengthening the relevance of the \nUnited Nations has been one of the cornerstones of the \nforeign policy of the Republic of Cyprus since it won \nits independence in 1960. \n The United Nations is important to the \ninternational community and particularly important to \nCyprus. It is an essential institution for our global \nsurvival and for the further development of humankind \nin a balanced and fair way in increasingly difficult \nconditions. Our peoples look to the United Nations as \nthe best forum for addressing such global problems as \npoverty, climate change, rising energy and food prices, \ndiseases, natural disasters, human rights abuses and \nmany other pressing global problems. Either we do \nthings together in a collective, coordinated way or the \nproblems will persist and become even less \nmanageable. \n This week, two important issues are being given \nparticular attention \u2014 the achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals and the special needs \nof Africa. I applaud the focus being given to both, \nhighlighting the imperative need for collective action \nby the international community. However, we must \nmatch our words with deeds. \n Cyprus emerged from colonialism as an \nimpoverished independent State in 1960. Despite the \nfact that Cyprus has suffered greatly, we have managed \nto improve our economy. Today, Cyprus is firmly \ncommitted to the achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and maintains an emphasis on \nAfrica in its overseas development assistance projects. \nOur approach is to focus on a small number of \ncountries, concentrating our efforts on infrastructural \ndevelopment in the health and education sectors. \nCyprus is gradually intensifying its efforts by \nincreasing the level of assistance to additional \ncountries. \n Small States have higher stakes in multilateral \ndiplomacy and in a fair and functional system of \ncollective security, based on the principles of sovereign \nequality and respect for territorial integrity. \n There is no clearer example of that than Cyprus \nitself. From the earliest days of its independence, \nCyprus was forced to appeal to the world community \nfor support in defending and preserving its \nindependence, its sovereignty and its territorial \nintegrity. It became a victim of foreign interference, \nwhich sowed the seeds of domestic problems for the \nnew State. Those difficulties were exploited in the \nservice of strategic interests alien to our independence \nand our territorial integrity. The culmination was the \nmilitary coup instigated by the military junta of Athens \nand the Turkish military invasion of July and August \n1974.  \n However, Cyprus survived. The will of the \ninternational community for Cyprus to survive is found \nin the plethora of Security Council and General \nAssembly resolutions \u2014 most of them, regrettably, not \nimplemented. However, the moral support and resolute \n  \n \n08-51839 12 \n \nstance provided Cyprus with a sword and shield that \nhave ensured that it has remained and will continue to \nremain an undivided independent country with a single \nsovereignty, single citizenship and single international \npersonality. \n In addition, the resolutions of the United Nations \non Cyprus contain two other important elements. They \nprovide for a process of negotiations in the form of a \ngood offices mission of the Secretary-General and, \nvery importantly, they define the legal and political \nframework on which the discussions for the federal \narchitecture of the Cypriot State will be built. Both of \nthose elements are crucial. I firmly believe that our \nsuccess in the new effort that is now beginning will \ndepend upon respecting those essential conditions. \n The President returned to the Chair. \n With regard to the process of the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s good offices mission, it entails negotiations \nwith the Cypriots themselves in which they are the \nprincipal players. They are the owners of the process. \nThe Cypriots themselves must build the State they \nenvision for their society. The role of the Secretary-\nGeneral and of the international community is to assist \nand to support. We are grateful for that. Good offices \nare not arbitration; they are not mediation. Recent \nexperience has shown that any attempt to impose \u2014 \nand even to import \u2014 non-Cypriot-inspired and \nimprovised models will meet with rejection by the \nCypriot people. \n The relevant Security Council resolutions are also \nimportant for the new effort because they provide the \nlegal political framework within which the effort must \ntake place. That framework prescribes a bizonal and \nbicommunal federation with a single international \npersonality, single indivisible sovereignty and single \ncitizenship. The federal institutions will embody the \nprinciple of political equality as defined by the relevant \nSecurity Council resolutions, in terms not of numerical \nequality but of effective participation by the Greek \nCypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities in all organs \nof the federal State. \n It is important to remind ourselves that a bizonal \nand bicommunal federation has been the only mutually \nagreed basis since 1977. It was reaffirmed as recently \nas a few weeks ago. It represents a compromise, and \nindeed the only possible compromise, on which a \npolitical arrangement can be built. The relevant \nresolutions of the Security Council and the \nConstitution of Cyprus exclude partition, secession or \nunion with any other country. \n The kind of solution we agree to must take into \naccount not only our history and international legality, \nbut also the kind of society we are and the kind of \nsociety we want to bequeath to our children. In that \nsociety, all Cypriot children must be born free and \nequal. Human rights and the fair satisfaction of human \nneeds must take precedence over strategic \nconsiderations dictated by political expedience. \n A new intensive effort started on 3 September \nwith the aim of overcoming the impasses of the past \nand achieving progress that will lead to the \nreunification of Cyprus under mutually agreed terms \nand the withdrawal of foreign troops after 34 years of \ndivision and foreign occupation. If that effort is to \nsucceed, there is a need for political will on the part of \nCypriots, as well as the positive engagement of other \nimportant players, which for historical reasons have \nbeen part of the problem and need to become part of \nthe solution. \n For my part, I want to assure the General \nAssembly from this rostrum that my political will to do \nwhat is necessary to solve the problem is firm and \ndeep-rooted. My origins are in the Progressive Party of \nWorking People of Cyprus and in the popular \nmovement of the island, which prides itself on a long \nhistory of struggles, and indeed sacrifices, in defence \nof friendship, cooperation and peaceful coexistence \nbetween Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots. On the \nother hand, I am one of those Cypriots who was deeply \nand directly affected by the foreign military invasion of \n1974, because I myself and my family are internally \ndisplaced persons \u2014 refugees in our own country. The \nrole of Cypriots is to agree on what they want. We \nmust try to achieve that with the leader of the Turkish \nCypriot community, Mehmet Ali Talat. I believe that \nwe can achieve it. \n But that is not enough to achieve a solution. \nTurkey should contribute to the process in a positive \nway. Turkey still maintains over 40,000 troops and tens \nof thousands of settlers in Cyprus and can, without a \ndoubt, determine the outcome of the issues under \ndiscussion. We believe that the solution should benefit \neverybody and will benefit everybody. It would allow \nCypriots \u2014 Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots \nalike \u2014 to live together and work together in an \nindependent, prosperous country within the family of \n \n \n13 08-51839 \n \nthe European Union, without the presence of foreign \narmies and illegal colonists and under conditions of \nsecurity and respect for their identity and their rights. \n Our world faces many problems, which are \nbecoming increasingly complex. It is our conviction \nthat those problems can be solved and that new threats \ncan be prevented only through effective multilateral \ncollective action. Peace must prevail \u2014 a true peace \nbased on respect for international law and not the right \nof might. A response to the problem of international \nterrorism will be effective only if our world becomes \nless unjust. If hunger and poverty are not tackled, if \nregional disputes are not resolved on the basis of \ninternational legitimacy, and if global wealth is not \ndistributed more fairly, peace cannot grow strong roots. \n The United Nations is an achievement of our \nfathers and a necessary tool for ensuring a more stable, \nfair and prosperous world. Ultimately, the United \nNations is only as successful as we, the Member States, \nallow it to be. I wish our community of nations a \nsuccessful sixty-third session of the General Assembly."

        "file_text": "At the outset, Sir, \nallow me to offer the warm and sincere congratulations \nof Solomon Islands on your election as President of the \nAssembly at its sixty-third session. I am confident that \nwith your vast experience and able leadership you will \nguide this session to a fruitful outcome. You can rest \nassured of Solomon Islands unwavering support and \ncooperation during your tenure of office. \n Through you, I acknowledge the good work of \nyour predecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, who has shown \ngreat leadership on issues of global concern, in \nparticular on climate change, financing for \ndevelopment, United Nations reform and the \nMillennium Development Goals.  \n My delegation is pleased to see you, \nMr. President, take such issues head on, presiding over \nthe high-level event on the Millennium Development \nGoals as we arrive at the midpoint of our time-bound \ncommitments. Unfortunately, many countries, including \nmy own, are off track in terms of achieving the Goals. \n My delegation also wishes to join others in \nconveying its gratitude and appreciation to our \nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, who has worked \ntirelessly and diligently to protect and preserve the \nprinciples and purposes of the Charter during his first \nyear in office. We wish him well as he carries on the \ngood work he has begun \u2014 in particular, his regular \nbriefings of the membership, making his office \naccountable and transparent in carrying out its \nactivities. \n This year our multilateral institution is being \nrevisited by history and challenged by the changing \ninternational system. Unilateralism and changing \npostures by big Powers are creating a new global order. \nThe creation of new fronts in Asia, the Pacific and \nEastern Europe is coupled with the ongoing conflicts in \nthe Middle East and parts of Africa. Above all, the \narms race is no longer a threat, but a reality. \n The structural imbalances of the international \nfinancial architecture have exposed the inability of the \nmajor developed markets to respond to the volatility of \nthe international financial system, resulting in State \ninterventions. The world economy is looking more \nprecarious and unequal. For small open economies the \nresults are catastrophic. Hence, we must be cautious in \nusing the free market approach and recognize its \nlimitations. \n The increasing cost of food and energy is causing \nmacroeconomic instability throughout the world today. \nThis speaks of the complexity and weakness of the \ninternational system. It reflects the uneven distribution \nof wealth that continues to fail the developing \ncountries, generating instability across the world. This \ncan only be corrected by having an open rule-based, \nnon-discriminatory and equitable trading system.  \n Furthermore, market speculation and agricultural \nsubsidies continue to pose major risks to the global \neconomy. The failure of the recent Doha Round is of \nconcern to my delegation, as it further marginalizes the \nsmall economies from globalization. The issue of the \nfood crisis now deserves our immediate and most \nserious consideration at this session. \n My delegation deeply regrets that the recently \ndiscussed United Nations food crisis Comprehensive \nAction Plan is not matched by the required resources. \n \n \n5 08-52265 \n \nCountries will therefore need to look at their own \nresources for solutions. To this end, Solomon Islands is \nworking on short-, medium- and long-term solutions. \nThe population is encouraged to eat locally produced \nfood and to undertake community-based rice growing \nprogrammes. Solomon Islands hopes to further \nstrengthen its relations with rice-growing countries. \nMy Government commends the Republic of China on \nTaiwan for supporting Solomon Islands rice-growing \nprogrammes. \n Dependency on imported fossil fuel and food is \nreversing Millennium Development Goals gains, \npainstakingly achieved over the last decades. Solomon \nIslands is no exception. Thus, cleaner energy to power \nthe world economy is the way forward. In this \nconnection, we look to both the North and the South \nfor solutions. I wish to thank the Republic of China on \nTaiwan, Turkey, Italy and Austria for coming forward \nwith community-based renewable energy programmes. \nSuch cooperation preserves the indispensable character \nof our noble institution and translates into action the \nSolomon Islands rural electrification policy of bringing \naffordable electricity to 80 per cent of its population in \nthe rural areas.  \n We are also exploring bulk purchasing \narrangements with Venezuela, using the models of the \nPetro Carribe arrangement. We hope, having spent a \nthird of our national budget on fuel alone, that this will \nprovide Solomon Islands with some breathing space. \n Climate change and natural disasters continue to \ncreate anxiety and cast a dark cloud over the future and \nsurvival of humanity, in particular of the 50 million \npeople of small island developing States. The \nmagnitude of climate change has outgrown the existing \ncapacity of the United Nations system. Our multilateral \ninstitution is heavy on providing technical support and \nanalytical data and less weighty with regard to on-the-\nground activities. Regional and subregional \nintergovernmental organizations are also going in the \nsame direction, leaving countries to fend for \nthemselves. Solomon Islands hopes that the Small \nIsland Developing States Unit within the United \nNations will be strengthened to effectively coordinate \nimplementation of meeting the special needs of small \nisland developing States. \n Today there is already within Solomon Islands a \nsteady migratory pattern of movements of indigenous \npopulations from their ancestral low islands to larger \nislands as sea levels rise. This has placed much stress \non the diverse fragile land tenure system, causing \nfriction between ethnic groups. Climate change is for \nSolomon Islands a sustainable development, security \nand poverty issue \u2014 all are interlinked. It is about \npreserving our forests, about our reforestation \nprogramme and about providing environment-friendly \nopportunities for the resources owners in our rural \nareas. \n On this note, Solomon Islands is embarking on an \nambitious programme of scaling down logging, which \nis the country\u2019s major export income-earner. My \nGovernment has earmarked funds for community-based \nreafforestation and reforestation programmes. It is \nhoped that over time the agriculture, tourism and \nfisheries industries will fill the forestry vacuum within \nthe country\u2019s economy, and that sustainable harvest of \nforests will become the norm. \n The increased frequency and magnitude of \nnatural disasters remind us that no country will be \nspared. Solomon Islands is still recovering from last \nyear\u2019s tsunami. We feel the pain and suffering of the \nGovernments and peoples of Myanmar and the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, hit by Cyclone Nargis and \nearthquake respectively.  \n More recently the three hurricanes that battered \nour fellow islanders in the Caribbean speak of our \ncommon vulnerability to natural disasters.  \n My delegation hopes that a more committed \noutcome will emerge from the Bali Action Plan.  \n Solomon Islands further notes with concern the \nproliferation of climate change financial mechanisms \noutside the multilateral process. This will once again \ndisadvantage the most vulnerable countries \u2014 small \nisland developing States and least developed countries. \nClimate change for us requires new and additional \nresources. Accessibility to the Adaptation Fund and \nfunds for mitigation and technology transfer are at the \nheart of the solutions to climate change challenges. \n In this light, Solomon Islands fully associates \nitself with the Alliance of Small Island States \nDeclaration on the issue, as well as the recently \nadopted Pacific Islands Forum Leaders\u2019 Niue \nDeclaration on Climate Change. We further call on the \nUnited Nations membership to support the draft \nresolution on climate change and security. \n  \n \n08-52265 6 \n \n On the issue of terrorism, Solomon Islands is \nconcerned about the lack of progress on the draft \ncomprehensive terrorism convention. The absence of a \nlegal definition of terrorism is creating gaps in our \nglobal fight against terror. We continue to condemn \nterrorism in whatever form and manifestation. We urge \nthe international community to weed out the evils that \nbreed terrorism. Our fight against terrorism must be \nresponsible and humane. \n I take this opportunity to sincerely congratulate \nthe Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands, \ncommonly referred to as RAMSI. The Government and \npeople of Solomon Islands value its partnership with \nthe Regional Mission, and I thank all participating \nPacific Islands Forum Countries for their ongoing \ncontribution and commitment. RAMSI continues to \nenjoy popular support, as it provides a unique \nopportunity and an enabling environment to rebuild \nSolomon Islands. Since assuming office nine months \nago, my Government, the Coalition for National Unity \nand Rural Advancement, has defined its relationship \nwith RAMSI and the Pacific Islands Forum through \nconsultation and dialogue. This is done through \nregional and national processes. \n Solomon Islands and RAMSI will soon \ncommence negotiations on a proposed Government-\nRAMSI partnership framework, which will form the \nbasis of future cooperation. The guiding principles of \nthe framework are that it should be people-centred, \nnationally owned and driven and aligned to \nGovernment priorities and policies. This should \nguarantee its sustainability and long-term success. \n Meanwhile, our Parliamentary Foreign Relations \nCommittee has been mandated by our National \nParliament to review RAMSI. The Committee is \nexpected to report its findings to Parliament next year. \n Solomon Islands is establishing a Truth and \nReconciliation Commission, modelled on South \nAfrica\u2019s experience, to address people\u2019s traumatic \nexperience during the three years of ethnic conflict. It \nis our hope that the process will rebuild confidence, \ntrust and unity among the diverse cultural communities \nin Solomon Islands. \n More than 80 per cent of the country\u2019s resources \nand land are traditionally owned. Last month the \nSolomon Islands National Parliament passed a Secured \nTransactions Bill, which will make traditional assets \nbankable to allow more investment in the informal \nsector. Solomon Islands is also considering putting in \nplace a Political Parties Integrity Bill to instil national \nstability and nurture its growing democracy. \n On the issue of achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, as a small island developing State \nwith least developed country status, we find that much \nof our achievement rests on partnership with all \nstakeholders at all levels. Solomon Islands is one of the \nhighest foreign aid recipient countries. This \nunfortunately has overstretched and crowded our \nnational policy space in strengthening and maintaining \ngood relations with all donors. Meanwhile, the \nGovernment welcomes new approaches by \nnon-traditional donors of providing direct assistance \nusing existing national institutional frameworks. This \nstrengthens governance and democracy, as provided for \nunder the Paris Declaration, allowing the State to \nincrease its legitimacy and reach out to its population \nmore meaningfully. \n My delegation remains concerned that much of \nthe debate on the Millennium Development Goals is \ncentred on social commitments, from health to gender \nand from HIV/AIDS to education. Economic issues are \ngiven no attention, placing countries with huge youth \nand unemployed populations in an awkward and fragile \nsituation. We consider such a gap as a time bomb that \nwill explode and trigger more instability in the future if \nit remains unaddressed.  \n Educating our youth is the way forward. We are \ntherefore grateful to those countries that continue to \ntrain our young people. This year a new partner, Cuba, \nis offering medical training opportunities for more than \n60 students. Solomon Islands will make every effort to \nutilize these training opportunities. \n Within my subregion of the Pacific, the \nMelanesian Spearhead Group, after some 20 years of \ninformal existence, has established a secretariat, \nlocated in Vanuatu. This should further strengthen \nrelations among the subregion\u2019s countries and its wider \nneighbours, as we continue to address our collective \ndevelopment aspirations. \n We have only eight months left to register our \ncontinental shelf, as required by the United Nations \nConvention on the Law of the Sea. We are working \ndiligently on the matter, having just accessed the \nDivision for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea \nTrust Fund four months ago. Solomon Islands \nwelcomes the recent decision by the eighteenth \n \n \n7 08-52265 \n \nMeeting of States Parties to the Convention \nrecognizing the technical and resources constraints on \nmany developing countries in meeting the required \ntime frame of May 2009. We are determined to keep \nworking on this very important issue, which will \nredefine our territorial waters. \n I turn to sustainable development issues. Hailing \nfrom the world\u2019s largest ocean, countries of the Pacific \nhave relied on the ocean for their livelihood and \neconomic sustenance. This has prompted certain \ncountries of the Pacific, including Solomon Islands, to \ninitiate sustainable management arrangements to \nprotect our juvenile tuna stocks by closing pockets of \nhigh seas adjacent to our respective exclusive \neconomic zones. \n The review of the implementation of the \nMonterrey Consensus scheduled for late this year \nshould promote global growth and better international \ndevelopment support, especially for the least developed \ncountries which remain on the periphery of the \ninternational system. Solomon Islands hopes the \nreview will also reinvigorate the operations and \ngovernance of the Bretton Woods institutions, to make \nthem more responsive to the changing character of the \ninternational financial system and become an effective \npart of the multilateral system. \n As one of the least developed countries, Solomon \nIslands looks forward to the Fourth United Nations \nConference on the Least Developed Countries, \nscheduled for 2010, which will provide an opportunity \nto address the special challenges of the least developed \ncountries. My delegation joins other least developed \ncountries in looking to you, Mr. President, for \nleadership to work on the modalities of the conference \nduring this session. \n On the issue of democratization of the United \nNations, Solomon Islands believes that our \nOrganization must play a prominent role in influencing \nand shaping the dynamics of the international system. \nThis can be achieved only by increasing the legitimacy \nof our premier Organization through wider \nparticipation of its membership. This means that \nstrengthening the General Assembly is crucial. \nEnsuring that the Secretariat is representative of the \nmembership is a must.  \n We also call for a genuine attempt by the \nSecretariat to undertake a universal recruitment drive, \nin particular among those that remain underrepresented \nin the Organization. This could be achieved through \nannual country competitive recruitment exams. \nSolomon Islands welcomes the recent recruitment \nexams held in Honiara, and would like to see them held \nannually. \n On the issue of system-wide coherence, Solomon \nIslands notes the establishment five months ago of the \njoint office arrangement between the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), the United Nations \nPopulation Fund (UNFPA) and the United Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF). Having one of the largest \nUNDP country programmes in the subregion of the \nPacific, we note with concern that more than 70 per \ncent to 80 per cent of the programmes are spent on \nconsultancy, making country-United Nations relations \ndistant.  \n In this regard, my delegation welcomes the \nappointment of an in-country UNDP Deputy Resident \nRepresentative. However, we renew our call for a fully \nfledged in-country Resident Representative. \n Security Council reform continues to elude the \nOrganization. It is like a process that has never started \nand takes the longest to finish. We have over the years \nidentified elements for negotiations, yet remain \nreluctant to move into intergovernmental negotiations. \nI am confident that you will give us leadership, \nMr. President, and plough deep in facilitating an \nintergovernmental process on Security Council reform \nby February 2009. In this connection, Solomon Islands \nreiterates its support for Japan, Brazil and India as \npermanent members in an enlarged Security Council. \n On the issue of Taiwan, Solomon Islands \ncongratulates the Government and people of Taiwan on \nthe successful free and fair election of President Ma \nYing-jeou in March this year. My delegation \nacknowledges the goodwill shown by Taiwan in \ndeveloping an atmosphere of trust, flexibility, \npragmatism and a positive spirit to reduce tension \nacross the Taiwan Strait with greater economic \nengagement through trade, tourism and cultural \nexchange.  \n We also note the intention to replace armed \nconfrontation with negotiation, and isolation with \nengagement. Resumption of direct flights between the \ntwo countries, increased dialogue, and people-to-\npeople interaction are all positive developments that \nshould be encouraged. Above all, much has happened \nsince the March election. \n  \n \n08-52265 8 \n \n Solomon Islands calls on the international \ncommunity to recognize the Republic of China on \nTaiwan\u2019s good faith and build on the positive \nmomentum. The international community must provide \nthe Republic of China on Taiwan with the necessary \nand appropriate international space if we are to be \nresponsible and contribute to the maintenance of \ninternational peace, stability and security along the \nTaiwan Strait. \n Solomon Islands welcomes the 47-day Annapolis \ntalks held from December 2007 into January this year. \nMy delegation shares the Quartet\u2019s support for ongoing \nPalestine and Israel negotiations to realize the shared \ngoal of establishing a Palestine State by December \n2008 as a just, permanent and long-lasting solution to \nthe Middle East conflict.  \n Solomon Islands further salutes Turkey for \nmediating talks between Israel and Syria in April, and \nsalutes the courage of the two countries in discussing \nissues that are difficult and sensitive. \n In conclusion, as we reflect on the range of the \nglobal agenda before us, we must honour and act on \nour collective commitments. We must also define a \npath that offers our people human security \nguaranteeing freedom from want, freedom from fear \nand freedom to live in human dignity. "

        "file_text": "I wish at \nthe outset to extend heartiest congratulations and \nassurances of my cooperation and highest esteem to \nMr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann on his election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \nsession. Antigua and Barbuda looks forward to his \nleadership and guidance throughout this session. Our \ncongratulations also go to his predecessor, Mr. Kerim, \non a job well done and for his service to the \ninternational community.  \n I venture to express the hope that the Group of 77 \n(G-77) and China will find in the President a vigorous \nadvocate for heightened focus and meaningful action in \npursuit of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \nand other agreed development goals. \n The sixty-third session of the General Assembly \nis taking place against a backdrop of escalating \nchallenges to international peace and security: \nunalleviated poverty and diminishing food supplies for \nmuch of the world\u2019s population; mega-disasters \ninduced by climate change; and impending meltdown \nin the world\u2019s largest economy. These times and \ncircumstances call for a heightened sense of urgency \nand a stronger will among all nations to work with and \nthrough the United Nations in embracing \nmultilateralism in the fullest sense.  \n The climate crisis is a clear and present threat to \nthe security of small island States like ours and a major \nobstacle to the achievement of our sustainable \ndevelopment goals and objectives. The international \ncommunity is not short of rhetoric on the climate issue, \nnor is it short of ideas, but we have come up woefully \nshort of political will on the part of those whose \nactions matter most.  \n The nexus of climate change and natural disasters \nis indisputable. Natural disasters are increasing in \nfrequency and devastation around the globe. Such \ndisasters are especially catastrophic for the small \ncountries of the Caribbean, whose economies are \n  \n \n08-51845 32 \n \nlargely dependent on the natural environment. I \ncommend the United Nations and its organs for the \nwork they are doing in Haiti and elsewhere in the \nCaribbean, which was severely affected by hurricanes \nover the past weeks. I must, however, call on the \ninternational community to lend additional support to \nthe United Nations in its humanitarian efforts in the \ndeveloping world. \n The emerging focus on new energy sources in the \nUnited States and elsewhere is also happening to small \nnations. We are encouraged by the promise of a \nrollback of the primary contributors to the causes of \nclimate change. The responsibility to provide the \nnecessary resources to do that must be born primarily \nby those developed countries which contribute most to \nthe causes of climate change.  \n In a similar context, vulnerable developing \nsocieties are victims to the globalization of crime, \nnotably in the havoc wrought by handguns in the \npossession of criminal elements, the trafficking of \nnarcotics destined essentially for markets in developed \ncountries, and the deportation of criminals to our \nshores. We urge the international community, in \nrecognition of the link between globalization and \ncrime, to provide greater support for the efforts of \nsmall island States to fight crime, strengthen the rule of \nlaw and combat international drug trafficking. We also \ncall on developed countries to stop the practice of \ndeporting violent criminals to our shores. \n Antigua and Barbuda is also keenly concerned \nabout the issue of nuclear disarmament and \nnon-proliferation. The Caribbean is a zone of peace, \nbut none of us is beyond the impact and effect of \nweapons of mass destruction. The Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons should be fully \nimplemented and adhered to by all countries.  \n The constant threat that terrorism poses in today\u2019s \nhighly globalized world makes nuclear disarmament \neven more imperative. We will continue to promote a \nnuclear-free zone in Latin America and the Caribbean, \nand encourage all countries, particularly the leading \nindustrialized nations, to vigorously pursue and support \ndisarmament.  \n I have looked critically at some of the problems \nfacing the global family of nations. I conclude on a \nnote of optimism.  \n We have recently seen a number of leaders \napologizing to the African diaspora, to indigenous \npeoples and to former colonies for past wrongs and \ninjustices. We have even seen binding commitment to \nreparation, as in the case of Italy and Libya. I salute \nthose leaders who have demonstrated such \nenlightenment.  \n More Governments are accepting the inevitability \nof democratic political change and are showing a \ngrowing commitment to good governance, fair and free \nelections and the orderly transfer and sharing of power. \nKenya, Zimbabwe and South Africa come to mind \nimmediately and deserve commendation. \n Finally, it is fascinating how both candidates in \nthe United States presidential election are vying for the \nchange franchise in that country. As a representative of \nthe Government and people of Antigua and Barbuda, I \ncall on the United States administration and its future \nleadership to effect change in its dealings with our \nbrother nation of the Republic of Cuba.  \n I call on the United States to end the economic, \ncommercial and financial embargo imposed on our \nbrothers and sisters in Cuba. As a world leader and \ndefender of justice, the United States must embrace \nchange fully in the interests of the men, women and \nchildren of Cuba.  \n I firmly believe that the United Nations would be \na more potent entity and the world could be infinitely \nbetter placed if the next president of the United States \nin his inauguration address gave an irrevocable \ncommitment to multilateralism in all its dimensions. \n Permit me in my capacity as the Chair of the \nG-77 and China to offer a few comments on behalf of \nthe group. \n The United Nations and the broader international \ncommunity have spent much time and other resources \nover two decades identifying, defining and reaching a \ncommon understanding on major challenges to global \nsociety. We have passed resolutions and declarations in \nwhich we have defined the challenges, identified the \nresources needed and resolved and committed to \nmeeting and overcoming the challenges as a global \ncommunity through international cooperation. In some \ncases, we have agreed and set binding time frames to \nachieve results. \n Many of these commitments, timetables and \nproposals for action have been repeated in annual \n \n \n33 08-51845 \n \nresolutions of the General Assembly. Unfortunately, \nmany have become more technically complicated, \nwhile there has been less and less political commitment \nto action supporting their unified and mutually \nreinforcing implementation. \n We have had some modest gains, as, for example, \nin our fight against HIV/AIDS and malaria. However, \nin general, our record of implementation and delivery \non commitments is a source of embarrassment to us as \nleaders. \n We are confronted by an endemic crisis of \ndevelopment, including the failure of development \npolicies and approaches that do not take into account \nthe specific situation of countries and regions. \n This has resulted in growing inequities within and \nacross countries, an environmental and climate change \ncrisis with unsustainable pressures on production and \necosystems, a global economic and financial crisis \nspreading from the major economies, a crisis of \nconfidence in global governance and institutional \ncapacity for managing international trade, finance and \ndevelopment policies, a worsening energy crisis, an \nunprecedented food crisis, and a looming water crisis. \n We recognize that each country has the primary \nresponsibility for its development. However, the \ninternational community must create a conducive, \nsustainable, fair and predictable environment and \nprovide the necessary policy space to stimulate and \nfacilitate the discharge of this responsibility. \n We must all move immediately into \nimplementation mode \u2014 a mode where our focus is on \nhow to do rather than how not to do. We have some \nimportant strategic opportunities ahead to begin to do \nso. \n The G-77 and China believe that we could begin \nwith today\u2019s high-level meeting of the General \nAssembly on the Millennium Development Goals. \n At the midpoint we, as an international \ncommunity, are in danger of missing most of the MDG \ntargets. We have not provided the resources, the \nconducive international environment and the \ncooperation to ensure that all developing countries can \nmeet their specific targets. \n Several sources were identified in Monterrey \nthrough which the financing could be mobilized to \naddress the commitments to tackle many of the \nchallenges, including those summarized in the \nMillennium Development Goals. \n Let us use the process leading up to the Follow-\nup International Conference on Financing for \nDevelopment, and the Conference itself, to offer \nspecific proposals on how we will provide and use \nresources, and on how we will set about shaping the \ninternational economic environment in order to speed \nachievement of those objectives and targets, as well as \nincrease the participation of developing countries. \n In December 2007, the Bali process reaffirmed \nthe international community\u2019s resolve to ensure that, \nby the end of 2009, it will have a clear idea about \ncommitments from Annex 1 Parties to the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \n(UNFCCC) on greenhouse gas-reduction for the second \ncommitment period, as well as their commitments on \nfirm actions and resources to facilitate adaptation, \nmitigation, technology transfer and financing for \nNon-Annex 1 Parties. \n The outcomes of the United Nations Climate \nChange Conference to be held in Copenhagen in 2009 \nmust be robust and implementation-driven. The various \nintergovernmental activities on the energy and food \ncrises scheduled for the coming months should be \nfocused not only on solutions to the immediate \nproblems of food insecurity and energy issues, but also \non long-term sustainable developmental imperatives. \n These are illustrations of the opportunities which \ncan and should be used by the international community \nto foster implementation of both outstanding and new \ncommitments. They are by no means exhaustive. The \nGroup of 77 and China would urge the General \nAssembly to resolve to promptly send a message \ncommunicating the urgency of implementing those \nvarious processes and activities. "

        "file_text": "First of all, allow me to \ncongratulate Mr. D\u2019Escoto Brockmann on his election \nto the office of President of the General Assembly and \nto express the hope that, under his leadership, the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-third session will achieve \nits goals, the most important of which are the further \nstrengthening of the United Nations system for the \nsake of peace and international security and addressing \nthe global issues that are becoming the challenges of \nthe twenty-first century. \n This year, humankind has faced a number of \ninterrelated crises, including the energy, food, climate \nand financial crises that have combined to cause a \ngeneral development crisis. The consequences of those \nnewly emerged challenges have had the most severe \nimpact on the social conditions of millions of people in \nthe developing countries and on States with transitional \neconomies, my country among them. \n However, people have not lost their hope for a \nmore just and fruitful world. They pin their hopes on a \npowerful and efficient United Nations capable of \nmobilizing and focusing its resources on solutions to \nthe most urgent issues of the day. We believe that there \nis an urgent need to efficiently develop dialogue and \ncooperation among all the entities of this multipolar \nworld and to avoid applying double standards in \ninternational relations. It is equally important not to \nallow people of different races, religions, continents \nand regions to be set against one another. \n No single country in the world, not even the most \npowerful, is capable of meeting single-handed the \nchallenges of our time, which range from climate \nchange to the necessary uncompromising fight against \ninternational terrorism. Today more than ever before, \nthe new generation of global issues requires a \ncollective response and the United Nations, entrusted \nwith a broad mandate, is the only existing instrument \ncapable of addressing them. \n One example of the new generation of global \nissues is the human right to an adequate food supply. \nThe dramatic rise in the cost of food and energy has \n  \n \n08-51845 2 \n \ncalled into question the achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). The food crisis has \naffected the poorest populations in the most negative \nway. In Tajikistan, 93 per cent of whose entire territory \nis mountainous and only 7 per cent suitable for \nagriculture, the food crisis has affected two thirds of all \nhouseholds. Additional coordinated efforts and \nefficient measures are called for if we are to avert a \nfurther degradation of the situation of global food \nsecurity. In the present circumstances, the use of food \nfor biofuel production is inhumane and immoral. \n Our hope is that donor States will undertake all \nthe necessary political, financial and economic \nmeasures to prevent a worsening of the food crisis. If \nthey do not, millions more could suffer further \nimpoverishment. We also expect that official \ninternational assistance will be increasingly allocated \nto the development of agriculture and that artificially \ncreated barriers in trade will eventually be removed. \n It is quite obvious that the United Nations should \nplay the key role in addressing the food crisis and \nrelated world agricultural policy. Tajikistan supports \nthe activities of the United Nations High-level Task \nForce on the Global Food Security Crisis mandated to \ndesign urgent response measures to the food crisis. The \nefforts of the Task Force should also be focused on \nassistance and on developing joint agreed long-term \napproaches to ensuring food security throughout the \nworld. The High-Level Conference on World Food \nSecurity in Rome and the resulting adoption of a \ndeclaration were important steps in that direction. \n Within the Food and Agriculture Organization, it \nis necessary to revitalize activities in the transfer of \nadvanced technologies and seeds and in the provision \nof financial and technical assistance to developing \ncountries. We call for enhanced support for the \nassistance programmes being implemented through the \nWorld Food Programme. \n The lives of millions of men, women and children \non Earth depend on their ability to exercise their \nhuman right to an adequate food supply. That issue \nrequires not protracted discussions, but resolute \npractical action, since the food crisis, which deprives \nhuman beings of their dignity, is no less of a threat than \nterrorism itself. We believe that the world\u2019s leading \ncountries should act more responsibly to mitigate the \nconsequences of the global energy, food, climate and \nfinancial crises, particularly with regard to the poor \nand developing States, which are most affected by the \ndevastating consequences of those phenomena. \n Tajikistan, which has fertile soil and is rich in \nwater resources, can make its own contribution to the \nresolution of that problem. More than 55 per cent of all \nwater resources in the Central Asia region originate in \nTajikistan. Not only is that amount of water sufficient \nto meet the freshwater needs of agricultural irrigation \nand related economic sectors in the region; it can also \nserve as a major source for the generation of \necologically sound electrical energy. Tajikistan\u2019s \nhydropower capacity, in particular, is estimated at \n525 billion kilowatt-hours, and only 5 per cent of that \ncapacity is currently being utilized. \n It is only by taking a comprehensive and mutually \nbeneficial approach to the use of hydropower and other \nnatural resources that the States of Central Asia can \nensure sustainable development in the region and help \nto resolve its food and environmental problems, \nnotably through the efficient use of those resources. \nOnly mutually beneficial cooperation aimed at such \nuse can bring well-being to the peoples inhabiting that \nvast region. We hope that our plans will be supported \nby the Bretton Woods institutions and by United \nNations partners in the private sector. \n I believe that we need to create an economic \nmechanism for the transfer of water and energy \nresources, which would serve the interests of both \nupstream countries, which are rich in water resources, \nand downstream countries, most of which are rich in \nhydrocarbon raw materials. \n The problem of climate change is already \naffecting our region, in particular its water resources. \nAs a result of global warming, Tajikistan\u2019s glaciers \nhave diminished in size by more than 30 per cent. That \nhas produced low water levels in our rivers over the \npast three years, which in turn has caused grave social \nand economic problems by triggering drought, a locust \ninvasion and other difficulties. Without the \nimplementation of hydropower projects, our country \nwill be unable to achieve the MDGs or arrive at \nsustainable growth, as shown clearly last winter, when \nweather of unprecedented severity revealed all the \ndifficulties of the transitional period. Next winter and \nsummer are expected to be even more challenging. \n Obviously, water is an essential resource, because \nit is needed not only to sustain human life, but also for \nindustrial purposes, environmental protection and the \n \n \n3 08-51845 \n \nentire development process. Addressing urgent water-\nrelated issues and promoting international cooperation \nin meeting the water challenge are the goals of the \nInternational Decade for Action, \u201cWater for Life\u201d, \n2005-2015, which was initiated by the Republic of \nTajikistan. I invite Member States to designate \nrepresentatives to participate in the International \nFreshwater Forum, to be held in Dushanbe in 2010, to \nreview the practical implementation of the \ninternationally agreed water agenda. \n Despite the many water-related events held \nthroughout the world at various levels in recent years, \nthe issue of water remains urgent. For that reason, in \norder to ensure that water issues are comprehensively \naddressed and that efforts taken at the national, \nregional and global levels are strengthened, the \nRepublic of Tajikistan proposes that a special session \nof the General Assembly be convened to review \nprogress made in achieving the goals set for the Water \nDecade and identify areas for further action. \n Today, in addition to the general debate, a high-\nlevel event on the Millennium Development Goals is \nbeing held at United Nations Headquarters. My country \nregards timely achievement of the MDGs as a priority \nissue. The Government of Tajikistan has been \nimplementing its national development strategy up to \n2015. The strategy, developed at the initiative of the \nUnited Nations and with its direct involvement, reflects \na largely new approach to development. It takes into \naccount global experience in the area of development, \nthe implementation of similar strategic documents, \nlessons drawn and conclusions reached during the \nprevious stages of the country\u2019s development, current \nrealities and development prospects. However, I must \nnote that the federal financing of the country\u2019s social \nprogress is limited by the growth rate of our economy. \n It is obvious that, in many respects, achievement \nof the MDGs depends on the approach taken by the \ninternational community to the provision of assistance \nto developing countries and the timely mobilization of \ninternal and external resources. In that respect, \nTajikistan associates itself with the appeals made to the \ndonor community to double its development assistance, \nwhich is vital for the support of sustainable growth and \nfor the achievement of internationally agreed goals. \n The proposal that debts accrued by developing \ncountries be relieved in exchange for the \nimplementation of national projects in the area of \nsustainable development remains relevant. The soaring \ncosts and, in many cases, artificially inflated prices of \nhydrocarbon raw materials and food have considerably \nworsened and complicated the financial situation of \npoor and developing countries. Even partial \ncancellation of their debt would help, since it would \nrelease funds that could be invested in education and \nthe entire social sector, environmental protection, the \nfight against HIV/AIDS and other areas. \n The forthcoming Follow-up International \nConference on Financing for Development to Review \nthe Implementation of the Monterrey Consensus, to be \nheld in Doha, will provide a good opportunity for the \nfurther development of effective measures to provide \nthe resources needed to achieve the MDGs. Our hope is \nthat the Doha Conference will provide new impetus for \nthe implementation of the Monterrey Consensus and \nthat it will enhance the spirit of global partnership and \nsolidarity. \n The situation in Afghanistan, which has been \ndevastated by a long period of conflict and violence, is \na source of grave concern. Afghanistan needs not only \na larger military presence on its territory, but also \ntargeted economic, technical and humanitarian \nassistance. Experience has shown that military action \nagainst terrorist groups is often far less effective than \ncarefully thought-out non-violent political and \neconomic measures. We must, as a matter of urgency, \nrealistically consider involving other influential \nregional actors, including the Shanghai Cooperation \nOrganization, in resolving the Afghan issue. \n Strengthening international cooperation in the \nfight against terrorism is inseparable from \ncounteracting the trade in illicit drugs. It is essential \nthat we assist the Government of Afghanistan in \ndestroying the technological and financing links of the \nmodern illicit-drug industry. Consolidated efforts to \nthat end will enhance the achievement of the goals set \nout in the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism \nStrategy and the Paris Declaration. \n The global system of fighting terrorism, \ntransnational organized crime and illicit drug \ntrafficking which is currently being shaped cannot be \nbuilt without support from regional organizations. In \nthis regard, Tajikistan salutes the efforts of the United \nNations to expand its cooperation with relevant \nregional organizations. These are powerful structures, \nand involving them in addressing global issues will \n  \n \n08-51845 4 \n \nprevent modern challenges and threats from taking on \nundesirable dimensions. \n The United Nations and peacebuilding are \ninseparable. We appreciate the devotion of those who \nselflessly worked at the United Nations Tajikistan \nOffice of Peacebuilding and pay tribute to those who \nlost their lives while performing their professional \nduty. The settlement model for the inter-Tajik conflict, \ninvolving assistance from the United Nations and \nguarantor States, has been acknowledged as a unique \nexample of both peacebuilding and preventive \ndiplomacy. \n We support the Secretary-General\u2019s initiative to \nreform the peacekeeping machinery, and we believe \nthat it is essential to continue providing the relevant \npolitical, financial and logistical support to \npeacekeepers in order to help them cope with their \ndifficult missions. \n Tajikistan endorses the priority attention given by \nthe United Nations to enhancing the effectiveness of \nassistance to countries that have endured internal \nconflicts and supports the activities of the \nPeacebuilding Commission, which is mandated to \ncontribute to ensuring coordination and enhancing the \neffectiveness of international assistance to such \ncountries. In order to strengthen peace and stability, \ncountries that have suffered internal conflicts need not \nonly humanitarian assistance but also concrete help in \ndealing with their economic and social problems, along \nwith support for their efforts to establish the foundation \nthat is essential for a transition to sustainable \ndevelopment. \n This year the international community celebrated \nthe 1,150th anniversary of the birth of Abuabdullohi \nRudaki, the founder of Tajik-Persian literature. The \nessence of his moral philosophy can be described as \npraise for such eternal spiritual values as kindness, \nbeauty, tolerance and mutual assistance. Centuries \nlater, the poetry of Rudaki continues to call for \nstrengthening friendship among nations and expanding \ndialogue among civilizations; it sings a hymn to \nhumanism and harmony. As noted by the Secretary-\nGeneral, \n \u201cRudaki\u2019s timeless and profound writings provide \nan inspiration for the Alliance of Civilizations, \nour initiative to counter extremism and heal the \ndivisions that threaten our world\u201d. (Press release \nSG/SM/11646) \n I am confident that the common human values \npraised by Rudaki are in harmony with the objectives \npursued today by the United Nations worldwide. I am \nvery optimistic about our ability to make the world a \nbetter place and to meet the aspirations and hopes of \nour peoples. "

The Darfur crisis and the constant \nincursions of irregular armed bands in the north-east \nand north-west and of the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army on \nthe southern frontier, bordering on the Sudan and the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, have been \naccompanied by plunder, rape, deportation and the \nconscription of children under the age of 10. \n The use of that part of the Central African \nRepublic territory as a rear base for non-State armed \nelements represents a danger of the same type as those \nthat led to Security Council resolution 1778 (2007). \n I welcome the mandate given to the United \nNations Mission in the Central African Republic and \nChad (MINURCAT) as part of a multidimensional \noperation to restore the safety and security conditions \nneeded for a voluntary and lasting return of refugees \nand persons displaced by the conflicts in that area of \nthe three frontiers that straddle the Central African \nRepublic, Chad and the Sudan.  \n However, with the mandate of the European \nUnion Force (EUFOR) ending in March 2009, and \nbecause of the fragility of the situation in the north-east \nand growing insecurity in the south-east, it is highly \ndesirable that MINURCAT\u2019s mission be revised and \nenlarged. We earnestly hope that it will go beyond its \n  \n \n08-51839 34 \n \ncurrent framework to become an operational force of \nthe United Nations, and that cooperation between \nMINURCAT and the other forces involved at the \nregional and community levels will continue. \n Referring to the situation in my country gives me \nthe opportunity to emphasize that the recurrent \npolitical and military crises have further increased \npoverty and food insecurity, particularly in the rural \nand agricultural areas. \n A suggested theme for this year\u2019s general \ndebate \u2014 the impact of the world food crisis on \npoverty and hunger throughout the world \u2014 in addition \nto the need to democratize the United Nations, is at the \nheart of the international community\u2019s concerns, and \nhas been for some decades. The first matter involves \nthe following questions: climate conditions, \ndemographic problems, indebtedness, free and \nequitable trade, redirecting the agricultural sector \ntowards biofuels, the price of oil and armed conflicts. \n In the current context of world trade and the \nworld economy, there is a tendency for natural \ndisasters and armed conflicts, because of their effect on \nsocio-economic structures, to accentuate the impact of \nthe food crisis on developing countries. \n For the Central African Republic, the food crisis \ncan be seen as somewhat paradoxical, in view of our \nnatural potential. The climate throughout the country is \nfavourable to pluvial agriculture, with an enviable \nannual rainfall of 800 millimetres in the extreme north \nand more than 1,500 millimetres in the south, and an \navailability of fresh water estimated at 37,000 cubic \nmetres per inhabitant.  \n Of more than 15 million hectares of arable land, only \n600,000 to 700,000 are cultivated. That is 1 per cent of our \nnational territory and 4.4 per cent of the total arable \narea. Less than 0.5 million hectares are being actively \nexploited by agricultural workers. \n Stock-raising land represents 9.3 million hectares \nout of a total of 16 million, with livestock totalling \nabout 3.2 million head of tropical breeds. \n The challenges to be overcome are the insecurity \nof rural areas, the disorganization of agricultural \nproducers, the low degree of support for the rural \ncommunity, the fact of being landlocked, the lack of \nbasic economic and social infrastructures, the exodus \nfrom the countryside and the impact of HIV/AIDS and \nmalaria, which have reduced the labour force and \nresulted in limited access to credit and fostered social \ndiscrimination. \n One of the Millennium Development Goals is to \nhalve, between 1996 and 2015, the number of those \nsuffering from hunger, and to halve, between 1990 and \n2015, the degree of poverty. \n There are a number of causes of the problems:  \nso-called natural causes and human causes. The natural \ncauses result from natural disasters: drought, \ndesertification, degradation of the environment and \nfloods, resulting in the erosion of arable land. Human \ncauses are regarded as having been responsible for \nmore than 35 per cent of the food emergencies in 2004, \ncompared with only 15 per cent in 1992. Wars and \neconomic and social upheaval have caused or worsened \nthe food situation. \n The General Assembly is the appropriate forum \nin which to raise and debate the problems confronting \nour world today. That is what is expected of us in the \nAssembly. \n There is no human endeavour that will not \nrespond to application. Therefore, it is possible to meet \nthe challenge of the food crisis. But our weakness is \nabove all our lack of the technical, economic and \nstructural capacity to create the conditions for \nagricultural production and productivity. \n I welcome the measures taken in June this year at \nthe World Food Summit of the Food and Agriculture \nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO), held in \nRome, on the food crisis. The initiative on the upswing \nin the price of foodstuffs should mainly be based on \nstimulating food production in our countries. For that, \nwe look forward to implementation of the International \nMonetary Fund proposal to double its aid to agriculture \non the African continent, in the hope of strengthening \nthe productive capacity of our farmers and creating the \nstructural conditions for the production and marketing \nof agricultural goods. \n As part of regional talks on the food crisis, held \nin Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \non 29 July this year, under the aegis of the Economic \nCommunity of Central African States (ECCAS), it was \nagreed to make effective the Maputo Declaration and \nthe Abuja Declaration on, respectively, allocating \n10 per cent of our national budget to agriculture and \nassuring our countries better access to resources for \nagriculture. \n \n \n35 08-51839 \n \n We have also given ECCAS a mandate to, among \nother actions, accelerate implementation of a common \nagricultural policy. Relaunching the agricultural sector \nis one of the priorities of my mandate as President of \nthe Central African Economic and Monetary \nCommunity (CEMAC). At the Yaound\u00e9 summit in June \nthis year we decided to put that concern at the centre of \nthe regional economic programme. \n None of these good resolutions can become \nreality for our farmers unless the support promised to \nthem actually reaches them. Particularly in Central \nAfrica, if these promises are kept they will speed up \nthe putting into place of regional focal points for \ndevelopment that will help to reduce the shortfalls in \nagricultural activity and the disparities between rural \nand urban areas. \n Food security has become a matter of concern for \nthe world. Hunger continues to be the worst weapon of \nmass destruction. The social crises seen in many places \nresult from the realization that food insecurity is \nworsening with the rising cost of living and other \nuncertainties, such as climate change and natural \ndisasters. \n In Central Africa, because of the destructive \naction of irregular military rebel groups, many \nmanipulated from outside, food insecurity, particularly \nin rural areas, is often provoked by lack of security. \nThat led the Government to organize, in April this year, \na national seminar on reforming the security sector, \nwhich was an important step towards peace. \n In the light of this, the process of inclusive \npolitical dialogue, which I have pledged to carry \nthrough to its conclusion, should be seen by all Central \nAfricans as a categorical imperative. \n Today, millions of people throughout the world \nare increasingly losing their means of subsistence \nbecause of the impact of food insecurity and of the \nsteep rise in oil prices on the world economy, with \nunprecedented consequences for world order and \npeace. \n Hunger, the environment, corruption and civil \nand ethnic conflicts are a burden for the most \nimpoverished peoples on earth. \n Other threats, such as terrorism, poverty and \nmisgovernment, also contribute to making the world \neven more vulnerable, and demand from us responses \nand methods that will bring about a lasting solution. \n In this age of interdependence of States, the \nprime solution and imperative need seems to be a \ncollective decision-making forum and an instrument \nfor rapid action. That was the vision of the founders of \nour Organization in 1945. \n But we must recognize today that the various \ninstitutions that make up the United Nations have their \nlimitations, and we must agree on the need for reform \nto make the Organization much more effective in order \nto achieve the Millennium Development Goals and \nseek the kind of peace that meets the current situation. \n My country is convinced of the importance of \ngenuine democratization of the United Nations system. \nIn that connection, particular attention should be given \nto the functioning of the Security Council, the \nEconomic and Social Council, the Bretton Woods \ninstitutions and the General Assembly. If together we \ntake courageous decisions to implement this ambitious \nproject, we shall give the world an ideal structure that \ncan tackle all international questions. This is an \nopportunity to build a world that is more secure, more \nequitable, more balanced and freer for all peoples. "

        "file_text": "Let me begin by \ncongratulating Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann on his \nwell-deserved election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-third session. I would like to \nthank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his very \neffective leadership in promoting global peace, security \nand development. \n I take this opportunity to deliver this statement \nalso on behalf of the least developed countries (LDCs). \nThis has been a difficult year for many LDCs, amid \nrising food prices and a looming economic slowdown. \nBut we have remained resolute in confronting the crisis in \na spirit of mutual understanding, support and cooperation, \nas enshrined in the United Nations Charter. \n My statement today will address three \ninterrelated issues: food security, democracy and \ndevelopment. These issues are inextricably linked to \none another and are of fundamental importance to the \nwelfare of the citizens of Bangladesh as well as other \nLDCs.  \n We have witnessed during the course of this year \nan extraordinary rise in food and energy prices, which \n  \n \n08-52272 12 \n \nhas undermined the food security of many least \ndeveloped economies. This experience should \nstrengthen our resolve to look for long-term solutions \nleading to a world free of hunger. In the twenty-first \ncentury, food security for all citizens in the world must \nbe acknowledged not just as a development imperative, \nbut as a moral imperative. Each and every human life \nis sacred, and it is our collective duty to provide \nadequate food and nutrition to people throughout the \nworld. \n The recent global rise in food prices has been \nacutely felt in Bangladesh, even though imports \naccount for a very small percentage of our total cereal \nconsumption. Domestic rice prices spiked by nearly \n60 per cent during the year through February 2008, \nagainst the backdrop of two devastating floods and a \ntropical cyclone that destroyed one of our key harvests. \nFor a country like Bangladesh, where roughly 40  \nper cent of the population lives below the poverty line \nand where poor households spend as much as \n70 per cent of their income on food items, such a steep \nincrease in food prices has had significant adverse \neffects on food security, poverty alleviation and human \ndevelopment. \n Food insecurity can disrupt the core of a \ndemocratic polity and derail its development priorities. \nThe cost of food insecurity is measured not only by \ndeprivation, but also by increased instability, which \ncan be very costly for a society. While the free market \nremains an incomparably powerful tool for the efficient \nallocation of resources, markets are often imperfect, \nand no Government can stand idle and hope that the \nprivate sector will resolve a food crisis. Making food \navailable to all, and at affordable prices, remains a \ncardinal responsibility of all Governments. In \nBangladesh, we took this responsibility very seriously \nand delivered rice to our citizens through a public \ndistribution system, in an effort to ensure that no one \nwent to bed hungry. \n Soon after assuming office in January 2007, our \nGovernment announced a road map for holding a truly \ndemocratic and meaningful election. That was no easy \ntask, as decades of corruption had seriously \nundermined both our democracy and our economy. \nCorruption\u2019s ill effects corroded our vital public \ninstitutions, and the cost was ultimately borne by the \nordinary citizens of Bangladesh, who could ill afford it. \nMy Government is determined to ensure that \ncorruption does not imperil the rights of the \nunderprivileged and that, in future, our democracy \nensures the good of all Bangladeshis. Our fight against \ncorruption has been the first step in a long and difficult \nprocess, and we believe that the work will continue \nunder the auspices of the Independent Anti-Corruption \nCommission, which was created as an institutional \nbulwark against corruption. Legal action was initiated \nagainst corrupt individuals, but we never compromised \ndue process and judicial independence. \n The foundation of a democracy rests on a \ncompact between the State and its citizens. That begins \nby ensuring that each and every eligible citizen can \nvote, freely and without fear, and that each and every \nvote is counted. To that end, my Government has \ncompleted the monumental task of electronically \nregistering over 80 million voters with photographs \nand fingerprints. That was achieved in just 11 months \nand is a feat that I believe is without precedent \nanywhere in the world. Our Election Commission \ntrained over 500,000 election workers, deployed over \n10,000 laptop computers, webcams and fingerprint \nscanners and set up over 90,000 registration centres to \nensure that every eligible voter could have his or her \nphotograph and fingerprints digitally captured. \nMultiple layers of safeguards were put in place to \nensure that the new voters list was flawless. \n In addition to creating a world-class photo voters \nlist, we issued national identity cards to all those who \nregistered. The Election Commission, with the \nnewfound independent authority granted to it by our \nGovernment, completed that task in record speed with \nthe support of the Bangladesh army. Our armed \nservices personnel \u2014 many of whom have shown their \ndeep and abiding commitment to the ideals of the \nUnited Nations through their service in United Nations \npeacekeeping operations \u2014 provided critical logistical \nsupport. Their experience, we believe, could be \ninvaluable to supporting and strengthening democracy \nin post-conflict environments. Our success with the \nvoters list was the result not just of civil-military \ncooperation, but also international cooperation. We are \ndeeply appreciative of the technical assistance of the \nUnited Nations Development Programme for that \nproject and the financial support of our development \npartners. \n An election is only the first pillar of democratic \ngovernance. During the past 20 months, my \nGovernment has relentlessly worked to shore up \ndemocracy\u2019s other pillars. We have made the judiciary \n \n \n13 08-52272 \n \nfully independent. My Government has established the \nNational Human Rights Commission to protect and \npromote the fundamental rights of all our citizens. We \nhave enacted a right to information law, which will \nhelp provide the transparency that is necessary to a \nwell-functioning democracy. We have, in consultation \nwith the political parties, amended and strengthened \nthe Representation of People\u2019s Order, under which \nforthcoming elections will be held. That law and \nregulations under it will require the registration of \npolitical parties for elections, ensure intra-party \ndemocracy and implement campaign finance reforms \nthat will limit the influence of corrupt money in our \npolitical system. \n Just last month, the Bangladesh Election \nCommission organized the successful holding of some \nlocal and mayoral elections. That marked a new \nbeginning in our electoral process, and our citizens \nwere able to exercise their franchise without undue \ninfluence of money or muscle power. The elections \nwere held without disruption and drew an \nunprecedented number of voters. Let me reiterate here \nthat my Government is fully committed to holding free \nand fair parliamentary elections on 18 December 2008, \nas announced last week. We are confident that all \npolitical parties will participate in the elections. \n Few nations face the challenges that we face in \nBangladesh for mere survival. Our development gains, \nachieved through the work of years and decades, can \nbe wiped out in a matter of hours. One cyclone can \npush hundreds of thousands of people back below the \npoverty line. Bangladesh is particularly vulnerable to \nclimate change, given that we are a low-lying delta in \none of the highest rainfall regions of the world. There \nis growing concern that an irreversible climatic shift \nwill displace tens of millions of our people. By some \nestimates, a one-metre sea-level rise would submerge \nabout one third of the total area of Bangladesh. Given \nour population and its vulnerabilities, that would result \nin the greatest humanitarian crisis in history. Inaction is \nsimply no longer an option. It is nothing less than a \nbasic moral imperative that countries that have \ncontributed little to this crisis, such as Bangladesh, not \nbe left alone and unsupported to suffer the most from \nits consequences. \n Adaptation is necessary, but it may not be \nsufficient to cope with the unavoidable impacts of \nclimate change. Countries like Bangladesh will face \nthe worst consequences in the absence of a legally \nbinding commitment on mitigation. International \nefforts to minimize emission levels should not, \nhowever, disproportionately tax poorer nations. We \nmust have guaranteed access to appropriate mitigation \ntechnologies and know-how on affordable terms. We \nstrongly feel that the post-Kyoto agreement should set \nup a technology transfer board, in order to ensure that \nthe least developed nations have access to affordable, \neco-friendly technologies. Bangladesh will not be able \nto attain sustainable development without appropriate \ntechnological support in that regard. \n We would not have discussed the food crisis issue \nhere in the Assembly, if we had believed that it was a \none-off event. The crisis will revisit us, perhaps with \ngreater intensity and frequency, unless we put in place \nboth short- and long-term measures to prevent its \nrecurrence. Many of us in the developing world were \ndeeply encouraged when the Secretary-General \nresponded to our urgent request for a high-level task \nforce to address the current food crisis. It was also \ntimely and appropriate that the Food and Agriculture \nOrganization of the United Nations convened the High-\nLevel Conference on World Food Security in Rome in \nJune 2008. The Conference afforded us the opportunity \nto deliberate on systemic and non-systemic issues that \nexacerbated the current food crisis. \n Bangladesh, as representative of the least \ndeveloped countries, also urged the Secretary-General \nto look into the possibility of creating a global food \nbank. We suggested that the food bank could allow \ncountries facing a short-term shortfall in production to \nborrow food grains on preferential terms. Once they \novercame the shortfall, those countries could return the \nquantum to the food bank. We could also explore the \npossibility of determining special drawing rights for \neach country, using criteria such as population, level of \npoverty and annual variation in their level of food \nproduction. Such an arrangement would allow us to \nprevent hoarding and price gouging by speculators in \nanticipation of, and during, a food crisis, and we \nbelieve that a mechanism can be put in place to guard \nagainst any moral hazard issues that might arise. \n Since the adoption of the Brussels Programme of \nAction in 2001, LDCs as a group, have made some \nprogress in their macroeconomic performance and on a \nfew social indicators. The progress is, however, \ninsufficient and uneven. More important, their \neconomic growth has made only a little dent in poverty. \nLDCs continue to face serious structural hurdles in \n  \n \n08-52272 14 \n \ntheir development efforts. They remain acutely \nsusceptible to external economic shocks and natural \nand man-made disasters.  \n The full and effective implementation of the \nBrussels Programme of Action has now become an \neven greater necessity. However, it is unlikely that we \nwill achieve the overarching goals of the Programme of \nAction and the MDGs, unless international \ncommitment to the LDCs in the areas of aid and trade \nis fully delivered.  \n The Brussels Programme of Action will conclude \nin 2010. The General Assembly is in the process of \npreparing for the fourth United Nations Conference on \nthe Least Developed Countries, to be held towards the \nend of the current decade. The upcoming conference \nwill provide an important opportunity for LDCs and \ntheir partners to review critically past performance, \nespecially in the areas of failures and weak \nimplementation. That will help us develop a new, \naction-oriented strategic framework for the next decade \nto assist the LDCs in their development efforts. I call \nupon Member States to extend full and effective \nsupport for the successful holding of the next United \nNations conference on the LDCs. \n Bangladesh is in the midst of a profound change \nthat we believe is also relevant to people all around the \nworld, especially to those fighting poverty, corruption \nand underdevelopment. As with any process of change, \nit is not without setbacks and will take time to \ncomplete, but in the end we remain confident of our \nsuccess. Our goal is to strengthen democracy in \nBangladesh, and my Government has done everything \nin its power over the course of the past 20 months to \nwork towards that end. \n I have spoken about the remarkable achievement \nwith our voters list, which will ensure that the elections \nthis December and every election thereafter can be free \nand fair; and I have also discussed some of the \nfundamental institutional reforms that we have \nundertaken to bolster the foundations of democracy. \nMany countries around the world are in their own ways \ngoing through similar processes, and we hope to share \nour experiences in order to help them, as we ourselves \nhave benefited from the support of the international \ncommunity and organizations like the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme.

Brunei \nDarussalam wishes him every success in the coming \nyear and we offer him our full support. \n My congratulations also go to the Government \nand people of Nicaragua. I offer them my very best \nwishes for peace, happiness and prosperity. That is a \nwish, of course, that we also offer all our fellow \nmembers. We very much enjoy working with them, \nsharing experiences, voicing concerns and hearing each \nother\u2019s thoughts and ideas. I say that because the \ncoming year is a very special one for Brunei \nDarussalam. In September of next year, we celebrate \nthe twenty-fifth anniversary of our membership in the \nUnited Nations. We thank the Organization and fellow \nmembers for giving us the opportunity to play a part in \na world we all share. \n The global challenges we now face demand that \nevery nation, big and small, work together. That is why \nwe will offer whatever we can to support this world \nOrganization. We will also support all its efforts to \naddress political, economic and social concerns. We \nwill help with recovery from natural disasters. We will \njoin fellow Members in protecting not only the \nenvironment but also the cultures of small societies \nlike our own. We will respect the values of the various \nfaiths held by the people this Organization represents. \n In more specific terms, that is why Brunei \nDarussalam strongly supports the role of the United \n \n \n35 08-51851 \n \nNations in the Quartet working to establish a just and \nlasting peace in the Middle East. It is why we ask the \nWorld Trade Organization to recognize the impact its \nwork has on the stability of small, fragile societies. We \nask its strong and influential members not to give up \nthe search for a fair formula for an equitable world \ntrading system acceptable to all nations. \n That is also why we acknowledge the work of the \nSecretary-General with the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN) to help our neighbour \nMyanmar recover from the terrible effects of Cyclone \nNargis this year. It is the reason behind our work with \nour neighbours in Indonesia and Malaysia to conserve \nthe priceless heritage of the Borneo rainforests by \nplacing over half our territory under environmental \nprotection in the heart of Borneo projects. It is why we \naffirm the right of all small nations and fragile \nsocieties, with all the values they uphold, to continue \ntheir way of life with security today and hope for the \nfuture. It is why we have supported worldwide \ndialogue between faiths to promote tolerance and \nrespect for each other\u2019s deepest beliefs. \n I offer this appreciation and support for a \nparticular reason. A new generation of international \nleaders is slowly beginning to shape the future. It is my \nprivilege here to speak not only on behalf of all our \npeople, but especially on behalf of that new generation \nin our country. The twentieth century is, indeed, \nhistory. The twenty-first century is plainly here, \ncreating its new set of internal and external dynamics. \nWe clearly recognize that in my region. That is why \nASEAN\u2019s leaders have signed a new charter. We and \nour fellow members of the Organization of the Islamic \nConference (OIC) have acknowledged that fact by \namending the OIC charter and accepting the far-\nreaching objectives of the Makkah programme of \naction. \n Underlying both those moves is the deep desire of \nleaders who are passing the baton to their successors to \nensure that their people have hope and confidence in \nthe future by being given the chance to join the twenty-\nfirst century. Our people must be able to participate to \nthe fullest. The new generation of leaders must have \nthe opportunity to help them do so. We have to provide \nthat confidence; by that I mean the confidence that \ncomes from education, modern training, health care \nand the knowledge that their culture, values and faith \nare safe.  \n If there is one broad lesson to be learned from the \nsecurity crises that have marked the start of the \ncentury, it is that security is not an abstract concept, \nnor is it simply the traditional tasks of upholding the \nlaw and fighting crime. At its heart, it is a deeply felt \nfeeling of unfairness. What we are asking for is the \nchance to address those causes at a very basic level. \n In that task, we therefore turn to the United \nNations for help. We deeply acknowledge the work of \nthe United Nations agencies in the field and their \nexpert staff and selfless volunteers. In particular, we \nthank the United Nations Educational, Scientific and \nCultural Organization (UNESCO) and the World \nHealth Organization (WHO). We see the success of \nboth of these organizations as essential to providing \nour people with the confidence I have mentioned.  \n In Brunei Darussalam, we had the privilege of \nhosting our first UNESCO science and technology \ncamp in 2006 and we have been deeply impressed by \nthe agencies\u2019 relevance to the needs of ordinary people \ntrying to meet the challenges of the modern world. We \nespecially support the commitment of UNESCO to the \nprocess of dialogue and negotiation as the only lasting \nmeans of resolving confrontation, no matter how \npainstaking the process may be at times. In similar \nfashion, we have also long supported the invaluable \nwork of WHO. We and our neighbours have greatly \nbenefited from the exceptional international research, \nadvice and technical assistance that this organization \nhas constantly offered, and for which we are all most \ngrateful. \n I have briefly outlined Brunei Darussalam\u2019s \nsupport for the United Nations and its current \nobjectives. Above all, we are committed to the work of \nits agencies as they attempt to help us all achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals. I have spoken of how \na new generation of leaders can offer their people the \nhope that comes from confidence in the future. The \nUnited Nations is the organization that gives us a fair \nchance to deliver on this hope. That is all we ask, \nbecause for us the twenty-first century presents a \ndifficult journey, and the United Nations is the \ncompass that directs us towards a hopeful future. "

        "file_text": "The Malaysian delegation \ncongratulates you, Mr. President, on your election as \nthe president of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \nsession. \n We are in a situation of unprecedented crisis. The \nskyrocketing prices of fuel and food have caused us \ndistress and widespread hardship. Beyond that, the \ncurrent financial and climate crises continue to tear the \nsocial fabric of Member States. To term it merely an \neconomic crisis is to understate the case. Indeed, the \nsheer complexity and connectivity between food, fuel \nand energy, between finance and climate change, make \nthe task of addressing those convergent crises so \nbedevilling.  \n It is here at the United Nations that the crises \nmust be faced and resolved. If we fail to address and \nremedy those calamities, our role and responsibility in \nthis body will be called into question. \n Some have called the current situation, \nparticularly the food crisis, a silent tsunami. I beg to \ndiffer. It has not been and is not silent. Instead, the \nrumblings have been heard for some time, most \nparticularly in Africa. In 1974, the international \ncommunity gathered in Rome to address the global \n \n \n35 08-53129 \n \nfood crisis, and in 1996, again in Rome, we dedicated \nourselves at the World Food Summit to eliminating \nhunger and malnutrition and to achieving sustainable \nfood security for all.  \n We adopted seven commitments towards that end. \nIt was estimated in 1974 that, if action was not taken, \nthere could be 680 million hungry people in the world \nin 2010. The latest figure shows that, at present, \n850 million people face hunger on a daily basis. \nClearly, we have failed to take heed of the warnings \nmade 34 years ago. Can we now ask what happened to \nthose resolutions that we made? \n Liberalization has fundamentally changed the \nmarket structure for food and energy sources. Those \nchanges have allowed for greater international \nspeculation. A clear evidence of speculation on the \nprice of food can be found in the dramatic rise in \nprices. An increase of close to 40 per cent has been \nrecorded within a six-month period, in some cases. In \nview of the volatility of food prices, Malaysia strongly \nsupports efforts to promote agriculture and food \nproduction. \n It is generally assumed that rising food prices \nautomatically benefit all farmers equally. That is not \nthe case. Due to the concentrated and vertically \nintegrated nature of the global food trade, a good \nnumber of agribusiness companies control all aspects \nof cultivation and distribution. We are therefore now \nwitnessing smallholders being squeezed out. They are \nunable to benefit from rising prices. At the same time, \nironically, many have to purchase food items that are \navailable in the market at very high prices. \n The energy crisis has some of the same causes as \nthe food situation. Underinvestment is one of those \ncauses. Expectations of continued ample supply have \nbeen dashed due to speculation and increased demand. \nThe causes of the fuel, food and climate change crises \nclearly lie in the unfulfilled hopes and broken promises \nof sustainable development. In Rio almost a decade \nand a half ago, the human family agreed that we would \nundertake concerted action to address the sustainable \ndevelopment challenge based, inter alia, on the \nprinciple of common but differentiated responsibility.  \n Yet, we are facing a crisis that could have \ncatastrophic consequences. It would appear that we \nhave not learned the lessons of history or avoided the \nhabit of producing resolution after resolution minus the \nrequisite pursuit and follow-up. Indeed, that is the root \ncause of our stagnation in many areas of the \nOrganization\u2019s responsibilities.  \n Therefore, the question is: what needs to be \ndone? Allow me to make six suggestions.  \n First, the international community, in particular \nthe developed world, should demonstrate greater \npolitical commitment. The focus of the countries of the \ndeveloped world should be on fulfilling their 2008-\n2012 commitments and, in so doing, setting a standard \nfor the entire world, rather than on trying to pass the \nburden of action on to the developing world. \n Secondly, we must find the right mix in balancing \nthe competing interests of the three pillars of \nsustainable development, namely, economic growth, \nsocial development and environmental protection.  \n Thirdly, the optimal mix between governmental \nand private-sector action must be found. Clearly, \nmarket forces and the private sector have a role to play \nin overcoming these convergent crises. However, the \nrole of the Government is critical in terms of providing \npolicy integration as well as balancing the competing \ninterests of the three pillars of sustainable \ndevelopment.  \n Fourthly, further infrastructure development and \nthe transfer of technology are critical elements in \novercoming the present crises.  \n Fifthly, we must resolve long-standing issues that \nlie at the heart of world geopolitics today. In particular, \nwe must resolve the problems in the world\u2019s most \nvolatile regions \u2014 which, coincidentally, are some of \nthe world\u2019s largest producers and distribution channels \nof oil. The United Nations must make a forward thrust \nin meeting the need for peace and security. Energy and \nfood are truly needs of humanity. Therefore, the United \nNations must introduce a synergy of human rights into \nthe matter so that oil and food become basic rights of \nhumanity. \n And sixthly, long-term solutions must be found in \norder to stabilize the price of commodities. More \nparticularly, the futures market must be organized and \nduly regulated so that it becomes a force of stability, \nnot volatility, in prices. That must be coupled with \ncontinued research and development related to \nalternative energy, be it solar, nuclear or derivative \nfuel. \n  \n \n08-53129 36 \n \n Malaysia recognizes certain realities. In the face \nof vehement protests, we have taken measures to \nreduce the level of fuel subsidies, which could have \nbeen untenable in the long run. We have also \nundertaken measures to reduce Government spending \nand to promote greater energy efficiency. Last July, \nleaders of the Developing 8 Countries, of which \nMalaysia is now Chair, agreed in Kuala Lumpur to \nmake serious efforts to cooperate in increasing \nagricultural production and achieving greater food \nsecurity. We urge the countries of the developed world \nto play their rightful greater role in addressing those \nconvergent crises, given their greater wealth and \ncapacities.  \n The present financial crisis being suffered by the \nUnited States threatens to engulf the entire world, \nalthough the vast majority of us did not enjoy the \nbenefits when times were good. Somehow, the \nfinancial mantra of the United States has lost its magic. \nCasting our minds back to the Asian financial crisis in \n1997, we cannot help but compare the scenarios. The \ntroubles of Asian companies then were the result of \noutside forces, while the present troubles of United \nStates financial companies are entirely of their own \ndoing. It must be asked: why were the actions taken by \nthe Governments of Asia \u2014 in particular, that of \nMalaysia \u2014 to save our own companies a decade ago \ndeemed so wrong, while the present bailout of United \nStates financial companies is deemed to be right? To \nensure that such a debacle does not recur, let us today \nresolve to check the excesses of the so-called financial \nwizards whose alchemy has resulted in so much \nsuffering. Malaysia supports the view that corporate \ncaptains should not sap their entities by receiving \nunbelievably high pay packages. \n New threats to peace and security continue to \npose additional challenges for the international \ncommunity. Terrorism, transnational crime and piracy \nare but a few of the challenges that confront us. \nAlready, the scourge of terrorism and piracy in \ninternational waters has taken its toll on many States. \nMalaysia, Japan and even Russia have become victims \nto acts of piracy thousands of miles away from their \nshores.  \n Just days ago, in August 2008, two Malaysian \nvessels were hijacked by pirates in the Gulf of Aden. \nSixty-five Malaysians and 15 Filipinos on board those \nvessels are being held hostage in Somalia. In order to \nsecure the release of the hostages and ensure the safe \nnavigation of our vessels in that area, Malaysia has \ntaken steps in accordance with Security Council \nresolution 1816 (2008) and international law. My \ndelegation stands ready to work closely with other \nStates that share the same predicament. We urge the \nSecurity Council to immediately address the problem \nin an effective manner. My delegation also calls on \nStates, particularly the littoral States in the region, to \nprovide the means necessary to ensure the security of \nnavigation in their waters. \n Democracy, human rights and the rule of law are \nthree important pillars of our political life. Those \npillars, enshrined in the Malaysian Constitution, have \nbequeathed to us freedom and liberty, dignity and \nharmony, peace and security. Malaysia will protect and \nstrengthen those sacrosanct pillars at all costs in order \nto ensure that all members of our multireligious and \nmulti-ethnic society can continue to live with one \nanother in peace, harmony and unity, while respecting \ndiversity. We believe that good and harmonious \nrelations among our various religious and ethnic \ngroups are our greatest asset. We respect the rule of \nlaw, and no one is above the law. \n Malaysia is concerned over recent attempts by \ncertain powerful Member States to question the \nnational laws of countries and the administration of \njustice under those laws. It needs to be restated: we \nhave no right to meddle \u2014 in any form or \nmanifestation, or under any pretext or circumstances \u2014 \nin the conduct of the internal affairs of other countries. \nIf we so chose, we could question the legal basis of the \nGuant\u00e1namo detentions without trial, but we have not \ndone so, inasmuch as we do not question societal \nbehaviour in other jurisdictions. While same-sex \nfornication and marriage are acceptable in California, \nthat does not mean that sodomy \u2014 which is a crime in \nmany countries in Asia \u2014 is to be impugned or \nderided.  \n Let us remind ourselves of the purposes and \nprinciples set out in the United Nations Charter, as well \nas of the relevant provisions of the 2000 Millennium \nDeclaration and the Outcome Document of the 2005 \nWorld Summit, which should be defended and upheld.  \n Democracy in Malaysia remains very vibrant and \nprogressive. Basic rights continue to be guaranteed for \neach and every Malaysian citizen, and the rule of law \nvia parliament remains central to our existence as a \nsovereign and independent nation. \n \n \n37 08-53129 \n \n It is here in the General Assembly that the entire \nworld comes together in a true spirit of common \nresolve and partnership. That presupposes the creation \nof an international order and a reformed United \nNations that reflect not only the current and future \nrealities, but also our resolve in fulfilling each and \nevery resolution that we have adopted here at the \nAssembly.  \n Indeed, it would be elementary at this juncture to \nanswer the question: to what extent have we fulfilled \nand satisfied the numerous resolutions that we have \nadopted over the decades? Indeed, what happens to the \nspeeches after speeches that leaders have made? Lest \nwe be blamed as a mere resolution-producing body, let \nus begin to act in concert to deliver the goods that we \nall should have delivered for the sake of the very \nhumanity that we are charged with safeguarding. Let us \nplan the work and subsequently work the plan."

        "file_text": "On behalf of the \nGovernment and people of the Commonwealth of the \nBahamas, I congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption \nof the presidency of the Assembly at its sixty-third \nsession, and I assure you of the full support and \ncooperation of my delegation. I should also like to take \nthis opportunity to commend Mr. Kerim on his \nstewardship of the Assembly at its sixty-second \nsession, which has just concluded. \n The Bahamas commends the Secretary-General \nfor this opportunity to assess our global commitment. \nWe first committed ourselves to the creation of a \nsociety for all in 1995. Five years later, we \nrecommitted ourselves to that objective and signed on \nto the development agenda, a noble objective. We are \nnow at the halfway point, and we must judge for \nourselves whether the progress made has been good \nenough. We believe that efforts to achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) and \nultimately create a society for all must be carried out in \ntandem with steps to achieve full employment and \ndecent work for all. \n The implementation of the MDGs is simply the \nimplementation of my Government\u2019s philosophy and \nprogrammes. It is with considerable satisfaction, \ntherefore, that I am able to report that the Bahamas has \nachieved many of the MDG targets and indicators. \nOver a two-year period, assistance to the poor in the \nBahamas and to low-income families is being increased \nby 45 per cent. \n The issue of international migration and \ndevelopment is of particular concern to the Bahamas. \nWe have been burdened for some 60 years now with \nirregular and unauthorized migration, which places \nincreased demands upon the education, health and \nsocial services of the Bahamas. It also represents \npotential national security threats, particularly as \norganized crime networks have become increasingly \ninvolved in the cross-border smuggling of illicit drugs, \nfirearms and human cargoes. Therefore, the Bahamas \nlooks forward to the discussion scheduled to take place \nduring this session on the follow-up to the 2006 High-\nlevel Dialogue on International Migration and \nDevelopment. \n New and emerging problems continue to slow \nglobal development, and the current food, energy and \nfinancial crises threaten to erode the gains made over \nthe past 10 years towards ending poverty, hunger and \nmalnutrition and reducing deaths. Apart from the \nconsequential increase in production costs for all \nconsumer goods, the growing cost of energy is \naffecting the travel plans of many, with direct negative \nconsequences for tourism, the primary industry of the \nBahamas. \n Of equal concern is the persistent challenge of \nclimate change, especially for small island developing \nStates such as the Bahamas, where 80 per cent of our \nlandmass is within 1.5 metres of sea level. It is no \nsurprise to find the Bahamas listed among the 100 \ncountries most vulnerable to the consequences of \nclimate change and sea-level rise. Potential impacts of \nfurther rises in temperature include not only the \nenvironmental degradation of marine and terrestrial \necosystems \u2014 loss of biodiversity and compromised \n  \n \n08-52272 32 \n \ngroundwater tables, agricultural lands and fishery \nresources \u2014 but also the social and economic losses \nthat might be expected from labour displacement.  \n My Government has recorded its commitment to \npreserve our marine and terrestrial environments and to \nmeet the targets established by the United Nations \nConvention on Biological Diversity for 2010 and 2012. \nIndeed, we fully expect to exceed our commitment to \nconserve at least 20 per cent of the near-shore marine \nresources across the Bahamas by 2020. That reality \ninforms the Bahamas\u2019 desire for urgent action on \nclimate change.  \n The increasing number and fury of tropical \nstorms and hurricanes passing through the Caribbean \nare, I believe, yet another indication of the negative \neffects of global climate change. This year alone, those \ntropical storms and hurricanes have had a devastating \neffect on a number of countries in our subregion, \nincluding the island of Inagua in the southern \nBahamas, Cuba, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, the \nTurks and Caicos Islands and Haiti. They pose a \nsingularly peculiar threat to our countries, as they are \ncapable, literally in one fell swoop, of wiping out all \nthe development gains we have achieved over many \nyears of hard work.  \n That is especially true for Haiti, where conditions \nare especially grim. The Bahamas is pleased that the \nUnited Nations has remained actively engaged in Haiti. \nThe Bahamas commends the work of the United \nNations Stabilization Mission in Haiti. As the current \nChair of the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response \nAgency, I am pleased that the Caribbean Community \n(CARICOM) has been able to contribute to the relief \nefforts in Haiti, but Haiti\u2019s needs remain at proportions \nthat can be addressed only by the international \ncommunity. We are heartened by the flash appeal for \nHaiti under the auspices of the United Nations Office \nfor the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. \n The current global economic climate presents a \nformidable challenge to both developed and developing \ncountries. The Bahamas has established a comparative \nand competitive advantage in a number of international \nservice industries by laying a solid foundation based \nupon the rule of law, with its attendant protection of \nprivate property rights, combined with sound \nmacroeconomic policies and a commitment to \ndemocratic ideals that foster an enduring political \nstability. \n Our participation in the international economic, \nfinancial and trading systems has permitted us to \nembrace opportunities presented by globalization and \nto achieve reasonable levels of growth and \ndevelopment. Nevertheless, we remain vulnerable to \nthe challenges posed by our size and the limits on our \nrepresentation in global governance. \n The Bahamas supports the strengthening of the \nUnited Nations Committee of Experts on International \nCooperation in Tax Matters and its upgrade to an \nintergovernmental body. It is the view of the Bahamas \nthat international tax matters, including issues of \nimportance to developing countries that are not \nadequately addressed in other organizations, should be \ndiscussed in an open, transparent and inclusive forum. \nFor that and other important reasons the Bahamas calls \nfor the convening of a major international conference \nto review the international financial and monetary \narchitecture and global economic governance \nstructures. The case of small developing countries must \nbe addressed in the context of international systems \nthat are fair, equitable, objective, open and inclusive. \nTherefore, effective permanent representation of \ndeveloping countries, particularly small developing \ncountries, is needed in the international economic, \ntrade and financial institutions, including the Bretton \nWoods institutions and the World Trade Organization, \nas well as other bodies, such as the Financial Stability \nForum. \n The Bahamas reaffirms its support for the \nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \nreform with a view to expanding the membership of \nthat body in both the permanent and non-permanent \ncategories, as well as improving its working methods. \nInternational peace and security is important to us all. \nThe Bahamas fully supported the General Assembly\u2019s \nadoption of the United Nations Global Counter-\nTerrorism Strategy in September 2006 as a framework \nfor collective action to prevent and combat terrorism. \n The Bahamas condemns terrorism in all its forms \nand manifestations, and we call for, and commit to, the \nfull implementation of a culture of peace, justice and \nhuman development and respect for all religions and \ncultures. I am pleased to report my Government\u2019s \nratification, since taking office last year, of the United \nNations Convention against Corruption, the \nInternational Convention on the Suppression of \nTerrorist Bombings and the United Nations Convention \nagainst Transnational Organized Crime \u2014 the Palermo \n \n \n33 08-52272 \n \nConvention \u2014 and its Protocols. The Bahamas \ncommends the Secretary-General\u2019s initiative in \norganizing the first-ever United Nations Symposium on \nSupporting Victims of Terrorism. \n Escalating acts of crime and violence, civil \nunrest, wars and internal conflicts around the world \ncontinue to threaten our efforts to create a just and \npeaceful international environment. The 2008 World \nDrug Report indicates that the supply of illicit drugs is \nincreasing. That has serious consequences for our \nsubregion. The Bahamas and members of CARICOM \nare neither significant producers nor suppliers of \nnarcotics. We are neither manufacturers nor suppliers \nof small arms and light weapons. Yet the meteoric rise \nin the illicit trafficking in drugs, small arms and light \nweapons, illegal migration and human trafficking \nthrough our subregion creates a formidable challenge \nto the national security and socio-economic growth and \ndevelopment of our countries. Therefore, the Bahamas \nreiterates the call made by CARICOM last July for the \nillicit brokering in small arms and light weapons to be \naddressed in a holistic, transparent and legally binding \nmanner, with renewed commitments for effective and \nenhanced safeguards. \n We are poised to mark, on 10 December, one of \nthe greatest achievements of this great Organization: \nthe sixtieth anniversary of the adoption of the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. The Bahamas \nreaffirms its commitment to the fundamental principles \nof human rights, dignity and freedom for all. The \nBahamas commends the entering into force of the \nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities \nand the adoption of the International Convention for \nthe Protection of All Persons from Enforced \nDisappearances and the United Nations Declaration on \nthe Rights of Indigenous Peoples. \n For more than six decades, human rights, poverty \nand development and peace and security have attracted \nthe attention of this Assembly. The complexity of those \nissues, coupled with a lack of good governance and \npolitical sensitivity, has too often impeded meaningful \nadvances. As we celebrate the Declaration\u2019s sixtieth \nanniversary, I recall the vision of a former First Lady \nof the United States of America, Eleanor Roosevelt, as \nexpressed in her address on 8 March 1960: \n \u201cWe are going to have to work for a peaceful \nworld continuously, without stopping because \ndifferences exist among people. They exist in \nfamilies, they exist within nations and they will \nexist in the world. And therefore, without any \nquestion you are going to have to work to achieve \npeace in the world much more continuously than \nyou have ever worked.\u201d \nThat is as true today as it was 48 years ago."

        "file_text": "I would \nlike to discharge my first duty by conveying to the \n  \n \n08-52265 38 \n \nAssembly, on behalf of His Excellency the President of \nthe Republic of Guinea, General Lansana Cont\u00e9, whom \nI am honoured to represent here, brotherly greetings \nalong with a strong message of solidarity from the \npeople of Guinea. On this solemn occasion, I am also \npleased to convey to Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann \nthe warmest congratulations of the Guinean \nGovernment following the election of a charismatic \nand enlightened individual of his stature to the \npresidency of the Assembly. I assure him of Guinea\u2019s \nfull and entire cooperation throughout his mandate.  \n I would also like to take this opportunity to \nexpress my country\u2019s gratitude to his illustrious \npredecessor for the skill with which he handled the \npresidency of the sixty-second session. To the \nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, we once again \nconvey our deepest appreciation for the effectiveness \nand vision with which he leads the work of our \nOrganization, which is ever more in demand, because \nof the many challenges we face in shaping a world of \npeace, security, justice and prosperity for all.  \n With regard to international solidarity, 34 years \nago the dominant groups of the world promised to \nimplement the noble commitment made by the \ninternational community to eliminate the poverty that \nundermines living conditions in poor countries, in \nparticular through the regular allocation of 0.7 per cent \nof the gross domestic product of industrialized \ncountries to official development assistance. \n In the euphoric wake of the fall of the Berlin Wall \nin 1989, that promise had received only a symbolic \nfulfilment when the leading powers predicted, in a \npremature burst of triumphalism, that budgets that had \nbeen devoted until then to the arms race would, as of \nthen, be devoted to expediting poverty eradication. \nHowever, the current configuration of our world, \ndeeply divided as it is between rich and poor, shows \nmultiple signs of how those promises \u2014which, when \nthey were made, awakened great hopes for the rapid \nachievement of an international world of peace, \neffective solidarity and shared well-being \u2014 have not \nbeen fulfilled. \n With regard to international peace, in spite of the \nsignificant reduction in the current number of armed \nconflicts, fears remain. Indeed, military expenditures \nhave increased significantly in recent years to \nproportions that hearken back to the darkest hours of \nthe cold war, times that we had hoped were left far \nbehind us.  \n The legitimate war against blind and \nunacceptable terrorism, waged on several fronts since \n2001, is unfortunately far from reassuring. The \nanachronistic Israeli-Palestinian conflict persists in \nspite of the welcome decision to seek a negotiated \nsettlement of that dispute. Tensions related to nuclear \nweapons control darken the horizon of a lasting \ninternational peace. Hegemonistic urges to control the \nstrategic resources of the planet are obvious in various \ninstances, raising legitimate fears for the security of \nthose countries that are vulnerable in military terms.  \n When it comes to combating global hunger, the \ncurrent food crisis poses an urgent and pressing \nchallenge that demands a rapid response at the \nnational, regional and international levels. Beyond the \nemergency, solidarity-based movement that has taken \nshape, that serious phenomenon requires a global, \nlong-term approach from us all. To that end, the \ninternational community as a whole must promote \npolicies and strategies geared towards returning \nagriculture to the heart of our national and \ninternational concerns. Our ability to satisfy the food \nneeds of the most vulnerable peoples and to preserve \nsocio-political stability in those countries depends on \nit.  \n With regard to poverty reduction, the results \nremain mixed, unfortunately. Indeed, poor countries \nare foundering even further, due not only to their \npopulation growth and insufficient social investments, \nbut also to the inadequate quality and inconsistency of \nofficial development assistance. In addition, all of that \nmust be viewed against the backdrop of the all-too-\ntimid engagement of their development partners and of \nglobal trade conditions that place them at a \ndisadvantage.  \n Currently, halfway to the 2015 deadline, official \ndevelopment assistance is still not being allocated at \nthe necessary pace. In spite of demonstrating their full \nresolve to take control of their destiny by enacting \nrobust measures in terms of political, economic and \nfinancial governance, poor countries must make do \nwith the drafting of new versions of poverty reduction \nstrategy papers that are unlikely to be implemented \nbecause of the lack of sufficient and appropriate \nfinancing.  \n \n \n39 08-52265 \n \n Meanwhile, the populations of poor countries \ncontinue to increase and to grow younger. They grow \nimpatient with the delay and slowness of their \nintegration into globalization. Their social needs are \ngrowing and their institutional stability, prospects for \ndemocracy and likelihood of sustainable social peace \nare faltering. The picture is one of a vicious circle \nwithin which the leaders and peoples of poor countries \nare caught. They look to their partners for an extension \nof the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative \nand the removal of the obstacles that impede the export \nof their products in order to enable their economies to \nescape marginalization in the global trade system.  \n In that context, the Guinean Government urges \nthe implementation of the outcomes of high-level \nmeetings with respect to the priority agenda of \ninternational development agencies. Those outcomes \noutline approaches and steps that could improve the \nliving conditions of hundreds of millions of \nindividuals, particularly in Africa, who feel the full \nimpact of extreme poverty, illiteracy, endemic diseases, \ninsecurity, economic marginalization and socio-\npolitical exclusion.  \n Elected in April 2008 in Dakar to chair the \nLeading Group on Solidarity Development Levies, \nGuinea devotes all its energies to consolidating \ninitiatives in that field and to overseeing the design and \nimplementation of programmes that will serve to \nsupplement traditional financing sources. I appeal to \nMember States and to development partners to join us \nin that solidarity initiative in order to pool our \ncollective efforts to fight poverty and achieve our \ncommon goals.  \n From this rostrum of international solidarity, I \nhave the pleasure of calling on global leaders, in \nparticular those of the wealthy and emerging countries, \nto increase their support for poor countries, as the \ncommunity of humankind must preserve its meaning, \nhuman solidarity must show its effectiveness, and \nhumankind must share the certain knowledge that \nlasting peace cannot be forged within the current \nasymmetrical divisions of our world.  \n More resolute than ever before to make proper \nuse of the official development assistance that they will \nreceive, the populations of poor countries are \ndetermined to emerge from the poverty afflicting them. \nTheir young people want to make their parents and \ntheir countries proud by finding decent work at home. \nThey do not want to get involved in clandestine \nimmigration networks, nor do they want to deal with \ndrug traffickers. \n Encouraging results have been achieved in \nconflict prevention and in restoring, maintaining and \nbuilding peace in the world, and in Africa in particular, \nin spite of the human tragedies taking place in Darfur. \nOur Organization deserves to be congratulated and \nencouraged for that. Indeed, significant progress has \nbeen achieved by C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire on the path towards \nrestoring peace and national reconciliation.  \n With regard to the Mano River Union, Guinea \ncalls on the international community to continue to \nsupport the efforts of the member States of that \norganization in order to prevent them from relapsing \ninto the cycle of doubt, insecurity and instability. We \nmust also welcome the successful measures initiated \nand led by the Peacebuilding Commission to \nconsolidate stability in Sierra Leone, Liberia and \nGuinea-Bissau.  \n In the Horn of Africa and in the Western Sahara, \nthrough the perseverance of the United Nations and the \nstakeholders in those crises, positive signs of \nsettlement are emerging. We urge all the stakeholders \nin those crises to engage in dialogue and coordination, \nwhich, if they are to be effective, require, of course, \nrespect for the commitments that have been made.  \n In the Middle East, it is obvious that resolving \nthe Israeli-Palestinian conflict will require a regional \nsolution based on the creation of an independent, \nsovereign and viable Palestinian State living side by \nside and in peace with Israel in accordance with the \nrelevant resolutions of the United Nations and the \nQuartet road map.  \n Moreover, Guinea reaffirms its unwavering \ncommitment to the principle of a single and undivided \nChina. \n I would now like to address the situation in my \ncountry, which for the past two years has faced a \nserious economic and social crisis, triggered by a \ncombination of internal and external factors, which I \nhave just described. I am pleased to be able to say \ntoday that through a national patriotic upsurge, \nsupported by the efforts of the international \ncommunity, including the Economic Community of \nWest African States, that situation is on the path \ntowards normalization and improvement. A \n  \n \n08-52265 40 \n \nGovernment open to all stakeholders, comprising the \nopposition, civil society and the two sides of industry, \nhas been established. That Government has drawn up \nand is currently implementing a minimum emergency \nprogramme that should pave the way for a relaunch of \nthe country\u2019s economic and social development process \nin the near future.  \n In spite of the pitfalls and unstable resources, the \nresults obtained to date are encouraging. The \ninstitutional framework for governance is improving. \nThe pace of the democratic process, in particular the \npreparation for legislative elections, is quickening. The \nindependent national electoral commission is up and \nrunning. The political parties have received subsidies \nfor election preparations. A comprehensive coordination \nmovement involving all components of the nation is \nunder way. The mining agreements are being revised \nwith a view to protecting the interests of the country \nand, naturally, those of the investors themselves. \nEconomic and financial governance is being \nstrengthened, sanctioned by the adoption on 28 July \n2008, by the Executive Board of the International \nMonetary Fund, of the conclusions of the first review \nof the formal programme, which should lead our \ncountry to the completion point under the Heavily \nIndebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative. \n Working together with all actors in the nation, the \nGuinean Government remains firmly committed to \nshouldering its full share of responsibility in tackling \nthe huge challenges posed by HIV/AIDS, drugs, lack \nof security, terrorism, the illicit circulation of light \nweapons and the structural causes underlying \nclandestine immigration. The eradication of poverty, \nmaintenance of peace, institutional stability and \npromotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms \nlie at the heart of our national priorities. \n Sixty-three years after the establishment of the \nUnited Nations, eight years after the adoption of the \nUnited Nations Millennium Declaration and at the \nmidpoint towards the implementation of the \nMillennium Development Goals, my country, Guinea, \nbelieves in the future of a world of greater solidarity, \njustice and fairness, thus safer in the context of a true \nand fair partnership. A reformed, revitalized United \nNations, adapted to new developments, remains the \nappropriate forum to meet the challenges that we all \nface. \n Before I conclude, I am pleased to report that \n2008 marks the fiftieth anniversary of both our \ncountry\u2019s independence and its accession the United \nNations. That gives me the opportunity to reaffirm to \nmy country\u2019s firm commitment, alongside the rest of \nthe international community, to achieving the noble \nideals of our Organization, and to supporting and \nrespecting all its principles and purposes, which are the \nfoundation of a true community of destiny.

        "file_text": "My Government agrees \nentirely with the Secretary-General\u2019s remarks at the \nopening of this debate. The world is on the eve of a \ngreat transition. The problems we face have grown \nmuch more complex, and our challenges are \nincreasingly those of collaboration rather than \nconfrontation. The quality of life in most parts of the \nworld has improved tremendously over recent decades, \n \n \n39 08-53135 \n \nbut challenges remain, not least in sub-Saharan Africa. \nNew challenges, such as climate change, migration, \nincreasing energy and food prices and financial \ninstability, could all potentially give rise to embedded \nconflicts and further polarization. \n As President Sarkozy said last week in his \ncapacity as President of the European Union (EU), \ncontinued reform of the United Nations is crucial to \nimproving the ability of the United Nations to carry out \nits core business, which is and remains problem \nsolving. We must continue the progress made on \nsystem-wide coherence and on the Delivering as One \nagenda. As regards Security Council reform, Denmark \nwelcomes the agreement to initiate intergovernmental \nnegotiations in the near future. At the election of \nSecurity Council members next month, Iceland is the \ncandidate for membership representing all the Nordic \ncountries. We are strongly backing Iceland\u2019s \ncandidature. \n On climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel \non Climate Change reports have served to crystallize \nan international consensus on the need for action. That \nconsensus has been nurtured by the determined \nleadership of the Secretary-General, promoting global \naction to curb global warming, with the United Nations \nat its centre. \n Economic growth and environmental protection \nare fully compatible. The challenge is to establish a \nframework for low-carbon growth, in which increased \nenergy efficiency, increased use of renewable sources \nof energy, carbon capture and storage, and the \ndevelopment of a global carbon market are vital \nelements. \n Denmark will host the United Nations Climate \nChange Conference in Copenhagen in 2009. The goal \nis to reach an agreement on a successor to the Kyoto \nProtocol, making it an ambitious and truly global \ninstrument. Momentum for a new comprehensive and \nambitious international climate agreement is growing \nday by day. \n During the past weeks, we have witnessed new \ncruel and meaningless acts of terrorism. The evil \nterrorist attack in Islamabad on the Marriott Hotel on \n20 September resulted in the loss of many innocent \nlives. Most of those who died were Pakistanis, but \nother nationalities were also included, one Danish \nperson among them. That attack and others came only a \nfew weeks after United Nations Member States had \nreaffirmed their commitment to the United Nations \nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy. We must respond \nto such despicable acts of fanaticism with great \ndetermination to strengthen international cooperation \nin that area. All United Nations bodies must join in the \nfight against terrorism. We hope that, at its present \nsession, the General Assembly will finally agree to a \ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism. \nIn addition, we must focus on due process and \nsanctions, as it is becoming increasingly clear that a \nlack of adequate due process is hampering the \nefficiency of the sanctions system. \n Sixty years after the adoption of the Universal \nDeclaration on Human Rights, severe violations of \nhuman rights continue to take place. Extremists are \ntrying to instigate a clash of civilizations by creating \nmistrust and polarization among various civilizations, \ncultures and religions. It is a major challenge for the \nUnited Nations to counter those trends and to promote \nthe universality of human rights. \n The number of armed conflicts is steadily \ndecreasing. The United Nations has played a major role \nin ensuring that positive trend. However, several \nbloody and difficult conflicts remain high on the \ninternational agenda. \n In Afghanistan, measurable progress has been \nmade, but the security situation remains challenging. \nCorruption and drugs are undermining the \nachievements made and the long-term development of \nthe country. Denmark has significantly increased its \nengagement in the United Nations-mandated, NATO-\nled mission, and we have doubled our development \nassistance to Afghanistan. Much has been achieved, but \nthe United Nations needs to play a much stronger role \nin coordinating the international engagement. A lack of \nsuccess in Afghanistan would have serious regional \nramifications. \n In Africa, the deployment of the African Union-\nUnited Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur has been \ndelayed owing to various factors, including actions by \nthe Government of the Sudan allowing attacks and \nkillings to go on. Those responsible for the grave \ncrimes committed in Darfur must be held accountable. \nFighting impunity is a prerequisite for sustainable \npeace. We thus stress the need to comply with Security \nCouncil resolution 1593 (2005) and express our strong \nsupport for the International Criminal Court.  \n  \n \n08-53135 40 \n \n In Zimbabwe, we hope that the power-sharing \nagreement will pave the way for durable peace and a \nreturn to democracy and rule of law, ending the \nsuffering of the people of that country.  \n In Somalia, the international community is trying \nhard to improve the deplorable situation on the ground \nand the prospects for a long-term political solution. \nThe scourge of piracy is one of the factors undermining \nstability in Somalia. The Danish navy is taking an \nactive role, together with the navies of other nations, in \naddressing that problem off the coast of Somalia and in \nthe region. We need to increase our common efforts to \naddress all aspects of fighting piracy, including \nstrengthening the international legal framework for \nhandling detained persons. Through the Copenhagen \nProcess Denmark has taken the lead on the broader \nissue of handling detainees in armed conflict. We \nbelieve that there are already valuable lessons here that \ncan also be applied in relation to piracy. \n In the Middle East, in spite of continuing \nviolence, effective regional and international \ndiplomacy has contributed to breaking the political \ndeadlock in Lebanon. The Palestinians and the Israeli \nGovernment are also making progress. We urge the \nparties to the Middle East conflict to honour road map \ncommitments and to settle their differences in \naccordance with the international agreements and the \nArab peace initiative. I should also like to take this \nopportunity to strongly condemn the unacceptable \nremarks made by the President of Iran calling for Israel \nto be wiped off the map. \n In Burma, Cyclone Nargis killed more than \n100,000 people earlier this year. The slow and \ninadequate reaction of the regime demonstrated its \ndisregard for the welfare of its own people. The United \nNations is working hard to ensure the initiation of a \ngenuine political dialogue between the Government \nand the political opposition as well as the release of all \npolitical prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi. We \nstrongly support those efforts. \n In August, war erupted in the South Caucasus. \nThe conflict in Georgia has not only dramatically \naffected the region but clearly also entails \nrepercussions that go beyond it. However, not least \nbecause of the European Union and its French \npresidency, the international community has been able \nto contribute constructively to the process. Now it is up \nto all parties to the conflict to fulfil the conditions set \nout in the six-point agreement and the Moscow \nagreement and to act in a positive spirit to find long-\nterm solutions to the conflict in a peaceful manner that \nalso respects Georgia\u2019s independence, sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity. \n This year saw a new country appear in the \nBalkans. The United Nations has played a substantial \nrole in promoting Kosovo\u2019s development and is still \npresent in Kosovo with the United Nations Interim \nAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), together \nwith a new substantial contribution from the EU \nregarding the rule of law: the European Union Rule of \nLaw Mission Kosovo. By reconfiguring UNMIK, the \nUnited Nations has demonstrated substantial \npragmatism and a willingness to cooperate actively \nwith the EU. Later this year, the United Nations is \nexpected to hand over to the EU Mission tasks related \nto the rule-of-law area, and we welcome that \ndevelopment. \n The good offices of the Secretary-General, the \nmediation and conflict prevention efforts of the United \nNations and its peacekeeping operations, which now \nentail 19 missions and more than 130,000 staff \nmembers, remain the backbone of United Nations \npeace and security efforts. However, we need to \nimprove the capacity of the United Nations system to \nassist countries in early phases of recovery after \nconflict as well as countries with very weak institutions \nthat might easily fall into conflict. That means building \na stronger bridge from humanitarian assistance, \npolitical good offices and peacekeeping efforts to early \nrecovery, peacebuilding, reconstruction and transitional \nassistance aimed at sustaining State-building and \npreventing weak States from lapsing back into conflict \nor chaos. The creation of the Peacebuilding \nCommission and the Peacebuilding Fund was \nimportant in strengthening the Organization\u2019s capacity \nand capability to build and cross that bridge, but so far \nit is only a footbridge. Much more engineering and \ncraftsmanship are needed, including on the part of \nfunds and programmes. \n At the 2005 World Summit, the concept of the \nresponsibility to protect was endorsed. We must \ndevelop that concept further and ensure that States do \ntheir utmost to protect their own citizens from \ngenocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes \nagainst humanity. We must discuss what the \ninternational community and the United Nations can do \nto assist States in meeting those obligations, and we \n \n \n41 08-53135 \n \nmust consider the means that are available to the \ninternational community when States manifestly fail to \nprotect their populations. \n Last week, an impressive number of heads of \nState and Government took part in the first high-level \nfollow-up to the Millennium Declaration and the \nestablishment of the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs). We are not on track, but we are not \nsidetracked either. We all have to make extra effort if \nwe are to succeed, and we need to get our priorities \nright. A special focus on the empowerment of women \nis essential socially, politically and economically. \nIncreased investments in women are crucial across all \nthe MDGs, across all sectors. Gender equality is a \nbasic human right, and it is smart economics, too. On \nthat basis, the Danish Government has initiated a \nspecific call to action on gender equality and the \nempowerment of women. \n Another cross-cutting factor that might determine \nsuccess or failure for all countries is governance. \nPolitical leadership, democratic institutions, the rule of \nlaw and respect for human rights and fundamental \nfreedoms are called for not only nationally, but also \ninternationally. The international rule of law, with a \nstrong emphasis on respect for the fundamental \nprinciples of international law, respect for human rights \nand fighting impunity, is a key to international peace \nand stability. The evidence is loud and clear, and we \nneed to focus our efforts. \n The evidence is equally loud and clear in another \narea. Sub-Saharan Africa is lagging behind in its \ntrajectory towards achievement of the MDGs. The \nDanish Government has therefore established an \ninternational high-level commission on effective \ndevelopment cooperation with Africa. The aim of the \ncommission, in which a number of African leaders and \nUnited Nations officials are taking part, is to present \ncreative and concrete recommendations regarding a \ncross section of young people, employment and \neconomic growth. By May 2009, the commission will \npresent its ideas and concrete proposals on how \nAfrican countries and the international community can \naddress those challenges prior to the 2010 review of \nthe status of the implementation of the MDGs.  \n In conclusion, let me reaffirm the \ninterrelationship and interdependence of the issues that \nI have addressed. There can be no development without \nsecurity and human rights, and vice versa. Progress is \nneeded in all areas if we are to advance as a global \ncommunity. And we must advance \u2014 in the area of \ndevelopment, in the area of peace and security, in the \narea of human rights and in the many areas that \ntranscend borders. That can be achieved, however, only \nthrough multilateral cooperation in areas such as \ncounter-terrorism, non-proliferation, pandemics and \nclimate change. Multilateralism is our only response to \nthe challenges, risks and opportunities of an \ninterdependent and globalized world. It is our \nresponsibility to ensure that the United Nations is \nproperly equipped to address global challenges and \nglobal opportunities. "

        "file_text": "First of all, on behalf of the people of \nEquatorial Guinea and the delegation with me today, I \nshould like to congratulate Mr. D\u2019Escoto Brockmann \non his fitting election as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-third session. His election bears \n \n \n17 08-51845 \n \nwitness to the trust and credibility with which all States \nMembers of the United Nations view the sister \nRepublic of Nicaragua. We wish him every success and \nassure him of our full cooperation during his time in \noffice. \n I would also like to pay tribute to the outgoing \nPresident, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, for the excellent work he \ncarried out at a crucial time in the history of the United \nNations. \n The sixty-third session allows us a new \nopportunity to share our views on the common \nconcerns of all peoples in the world. We would like to \nsay how pleased we are to see that the agenda of this \nannual debate includes subjects such as the \ndemocratization of the United Nations system, \nincluding the necessary reforms in the functioning of \nthe Security Council and the Bretton Woods \ninstitutions; funding for the development of Africa; the \nfood crisis and world hunger; climate change; human \nsecurity as part of international peace and security; and \nthe fight against terrorism. \n The world harboured the hope that after the cold \nwar mankind would achieve peace and live more \nharmoniously together in greater solidarity. However, \nwe are extremely saddened to note the differences \nseparating the rich from the poor countries, causing \nhunger, poverty, war and destabilization. In other \nwords, today we are facing new challenges that \njeopardize the budding institutions of developing \ncountries in many ways.  \n For that reason, it is necessary to adopt \nmechanisms and strategies that enable us to ensure that \nour experiences can provide a bridge to a new form of \ncooperation among peoples. Indeed, in the six decades \nof the existence of the United Nations, we have seen \nthat only the establishment of a new, more open and \nrespectful global framework for cooperation will lead \nto the stability, peace and progress of all nations. \n We have seen that the use of force by the strong \nhas not only failed to solve the problems affecting the \npeople of the world today, but has made them worse. \nWe know from experience that conflicts and threats to \nworld peace arise from a patent lack of dialogue among \nthe countries making up the international community. \nNot only do many peoples and nations continue to face \nold conflicts, but every day new tensions and threats to \nworld peace emerge.  \n In addition to those challenges are the issues that \nare the focus of our debate, such as injustice, poverty, \nthe energy and food crises, climate change, inequality \nand poor access to the education, health care and new \ntechnologies needed for poor countries to develop.  \n Thus, Equatorial Guinea believes it appropriate \nthat the new strategy the world needs today must start \nnot only with the reform of our multilateral \ncooperation institutions, but also with a change in the \nmentality and behaviour of those who today hold \neconomic power, so as to achieve a manifestation of \ndemocracy that fosters dialogue and cooperation \namong peoples. \n In the recent past, our efforts to bring about a \nbetter world have been based on the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, which were intended to strengthen \ninternational cooperation towards universal and \nsustainable development. Achieving those Goals \nrequires, inter alia, the reform of the world economic \nsystem, based on respect for different development \nmodels, so that each may choose what is most \nhistorically, politically, socially and culturally fitting.  \n Clearly, that troubled global situation affects all \ncountries to different degrees and with varying impact. \nIn that regard, the African continent is the most \nvulnerable in terms of economic and social \ndevelopment, and it is not surprising that its peoples \nare more affected by the widespread crisis threatening \nthe world. \n That which is presented to us today as a world \nfood crisis is not merely temporary but is one of the \nmany paradoxes of our time. For it seems \ninconceivable that in an era of abundance the \nunderdeveloped countries of the South are confronted \nby a deficit in a right so crucial to human beings, \nnamely, the right to food. Statistics published by the \nFood and Agriculture Organization indicate that nearly \n900 million men, women and children suffer from \nhunger, with almost 80 per cent of them living in \ndeveloping countries.  \n The supposed food crisis and other current \nphenomena in our globalized world are the result of the \nimpact of the neoliberal policies that have been applied \non a global scale for more than four decades. I am \nspeaking in particular about the prescriptions advanced \nby institutions of the international commercial and \nfinancial system, namely, the World Bank, the \nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Trade \n  \n \n08-51845 18 \n \nOrganization. In fact, they act as the voice of their \nmasters in erecting discriminatory barriers that impede \nour ability to produce and trade. \n One of the consequences of the food crisis has \nbeen the no-holds-barred liberalization of trade \nimposed by those institutions. That has permitted the \nflooding of African markets with highly subsidized \nfood products, which is destroying agriculture in our \ncountries. In that regard, Africa today is a continent \nthat produces and exports things that it itself does not \nconsume, while at the same time it imports from the \ncountries of the North things that it could produce for \nits own use but does not.  \n If there is any good in the food crisis it is the fact \nthat none of the countries of the South, and especially \nthose in Africa, has any interest in continuing to \ndepend upon food imports in order to ensure the \nsurvival of its citizens, either as food aid or through an \nunfair trading system. In that connection, what Africa \nneeds today is development based on solidarity and the \nstrengthening of its socio-economic fabric. A large part \nof Africa\u2019s fertile land is still not cultivated, but \nstatistics on Africa\u2019s productivity are among the lowest \nin the world. That is due to the exodus from the \ncountryside and the few incentives available to farmers \nbecause of the high cost of agricultural inputs and the \nrelative prices of agricultural products on the \ninternational market.  \n With regard to the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s \nDevelopment and the delay in its implementation, \nEquatorial Guinea would like to propose the \nestablishment of an international steering committee \nmade up of experts from both donor and African \ncountries. The purpose of the committee would be to \nidentify mechanisms and projects that could contribute \nto the economic integration of African countries. The \ncommittee would also be in charge of implementing \nprojects and programmes at the continental, regional \nand subregional levels, including the programme to \ncombat HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other \ndiseases endemic in Africa; identifying and financing \nof energy resources in order to electrify countries in \nlandlocked regions; building a trans-African network \nof roads and railways so that countries that are \nenclaves and without access to the sea can transport \ntheir goods; launching a satellite that ensures \ncommunications for Africa; establishing an African \nuniversity to train our human resources; establishing \nindustries in countries experiencing emigration to \ndeveloped countries in order to create jobs for their \nworkforce; and granting low-interest loans in order to \npromote development in Africa\u2019s least favoured \ncountries.  \n I should like to conclude my statement by \nrecalling the commitment of the international \ncommunity to preserve the environment and protect \necosystems that have an impact on climate change, \nwhich today poses a threat to humankind. Equatorial \nGuinea is among the countries of equatorial Africa \nmaking great efforts to preserve the forest ecosystems \nof the Congo River basin, which, along with the \nAmazon, serves as the lungs of humankind.  \n Moreover, Equatorial Guinea would like to \nreiterate its commitment to combating international \nterrorism and organized crime in all their forms and \nmanifestations.  \n With regard to national policy, Equatorial Guinea \nis experiencing an unprecedented period of freedom \nand development. Our people are flourishing and \ndeveloping in an atmosphere of peace, democracy and \nstability. We look forward to a future of well-being and \njustice for all our citizens.  \n From this podium, I would like to reiterate the \ncommitment of my Government to promote and protect \nhuman rights. We do not need anyone to give us \nlessons about elections, or to attempt to usurp the \nsovereign will of the people of Equatorial Guinea.  \n Equatorial Guinea is proud to be part of the \nUnited Nations. We believe this universal Organization \nis today, and will continue to be, the sole option for \nstrengthening peace and stability and for achieving \ndevelopment, to which we all aspire. "

        "file_text": "Allow me to congratulate the President and \nhis friendly country, Nicaragua, on his election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \nsession. I wish him every success in his mission and \nexpress our satisfaction with the message of his \nintroductory remarks at the opening of the general \ndebate. I would also like to thank his predecessor, \nSrgjan Kerim, for successfully steering the work of the \nprevious session. I extend to Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon our best wishes for success in the realization \nof the purposes and principles of the Charter of our \ninternational Organization. \n The Middle East region is one of the most \nvolatile regions of the world, and it continues to face \nmounting challenges. Daunting as those challenges \nmay be, they must not deter us from moving forward \ntowards the light at the end of the tunnel and from \nseeking better conditions. Syria is an essential part of \nthe solutions sought by the peoples of the region, by \nvirtue of its geographic location and the aspirations of \nits people.  \n For that reason, President Bashar Al-Assad took \nthe initiative to convene the Damascus Quartet \nSummit, attended by President Sarkozy of France, the \nEmir of the State of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa \nAl-Thani, and the Prime Minister Recep Tayyip \nErdogan of Turkey. All of those States have a stake in \nthe security and stability of the Middle East region. \nEach and every one has made constructive \ncontributions, despite differing perspectives and \npositions. The four leaders probed the issue of peace \nand stability in the Middle East and stressed the need \nfor consultations and coordination and joint pursuit of \nthose objectives. They recognized that inaction, the \nsuffering resulting from the Israeli occupation of Arab \nterritories that has continued since 1967 and disregard \nfor the Palestinian people\u2019s rights have driven the \npeople of the region into a state of despair. Under those \ncircumstances, attaining a just and comprehensive \npeace becomes untenable and the region becomes a \nfertile ground for anger and turmoil. In the final \nanalysis, that situation does not serve the best interests \nof the world or of the countries of the region. \n By convening the Quartet Summit, Syria stressed \nthat a just and comprehensive peace is its strategic \nchoice and that it is striving to attain it in cooperation \nwith regional and international partners who share its \nvision. The realization of peace requires all of those \nwho have a direct stake in the matter, or those who \nhave the power or who can influence the outcome, to \nevince the necessary political will.  \nA/63/PV.13  \n \n08-53122 18 \n \n Years after the will to build peace lost its priority \nstatus in the policies that influence the situation in the \nregion, we were asked to go to Annapolis. We all went \nto Annapolis, despite the ambiguity of the undertaking. \nWe wonder what Annapolis achieved. Where exactly \ndo we stand? Have the Annapolis promises to establish \na Palestinian State before the end of the current year \nbeen fulfilled? Has Israel stopped building settlements \nin the occupied Arab territories? \n Despite all that, given that the withdrawal of \nIsrael from our occupied Golan to the line of 4 June \n1967 and making peace are Syrian national priorities, \nand notwithstanding the circumstances to which I just \nreferred, we entered into indirect negotiations with \nIsrael, with commendable mediation by Turkey.  \n As President Al-Assad said, we wanted the \nnegotiations to establish the grounds and pave the way \nfor direct negotiations that would ultimately be \nsponsored by many international parties. Peacebuilding \nrequires, however, genuine Israeli will that is capable \nof accommodating the exigencies of peacemaking. It \nalso requires the American will to include peace in the \nMiddle East on its list of priorities after years of \ndeliberately ignoring and dodging the question, which \nhas exacerbated the situation in the region. \n Syria stresses once again its firm and consistent \nsupport for the Palestinian people\u2019s rights to recover \ntheir occupied land and establish their independent \nState with Jerusalem as its capital. Syria underlines the \nneed to restore Palestinian national unity through \nnational dialogue and is working towards that end in its \ncapacity as the current Chair of the Arab Summit. \n The Iraqi situation is a matter of prime concern to \nSyria because Iraq is an Arab fraternal country and \nbecause, as a neighbouring country, we are affected by \nthe negative and positive developments there. We have \nalways stressed the need to preserve the unity of the \npeople of Iraq, its territorial integrity, non-interference \nin its internal affairs and the need to preserve its \nsovereignty, independence, its Arab and Islamic \nidentity, and to oppose the calls to divide it. We have \nrepeatedly declared that the solution in Iraq begins \nwith national reconciliation built on the principle of \nrespect for the will of all Iraqis. We have reiterated the \nneed for foreign troops to withdraw from Iraq in line \nwith agreements reached with the Iraqi Government. \nWe have always condemned all terrorist acts \ncommitted in Iraq, resulting in the deaths of many \ninnocent civilians. We believe that the stability that \nIraq longs for requires an Iraqi consensus to overcome \nthe obstacles barring its realization. \n It is regrettable that the abnormal circumstances \nthat prevailed in Iraq as a result of the United States \ninvasion in 2003 have prompted a great number of \nIraqis to leave their country in pursuit of safety and \nsecurity. Syria hosts many Iraqi brothers and sisters. \nTherefore, we are deeply aware of the humanitarian \ncrisis that has forced Iraqis from their country and \nexacerbated the situation in their country. We hope that \nan improved security situation will permit all Iraqis to \nreturn to Iraq. \n We in Syria are pleased that the situation in \nLebanon is being resolved after the conclusion of the \nDoha Agreement, which enabled the Lebanese to elect \na consensual President, establish a Government of \nnational unity and initiate a national dialogue. Despite \nunfounded claims to the contrary, we have consistently \nsupported all measures that could assist the Lebanese \nin arriving at consensual solutions built on dialogue \nand the affirmation of national unity. During the recent \nvisit of the Lebanese President Michel Sleiman to \nSyria, we declared that we had jointly decided to \nestablish diplomatic relations between our two \ncountries with a view to maintaining and supporting \nmutual, deep and wide-ranging relations and interests \nbetween our two fraternal peoples. We also agreed to \nresume the work of the joint Lebanese-Syrian border \ndemarcation commission in accordance with \nmechanisms and priorities to be agreed upon by the \ntwo parties. The two countries also agreed to entrust to \ntheir respective authorities the task of continuing to \nwork together to control their common borders, fight \nsmuggling, undertake the necessary measures to \npromote trade, create the conditions for economic \nintegration and establish a common economic market. \n Syria supports efforts aimed at guaranteeing the \nSudan\u2019s unity and territorial integrity and promoting \npeace and stability in that country. In that context, we \nare completely opposed to the decision of the \nProsecutor of the International Criminal Court and call \non the Security Council to suspend it with a view to \ncreating favourable conditions for pursuing the \ninitiative endorsed by the Council of Ministers of the \nLeague of Arab States on 9 August 2008. The initiative \ncalled for establishing an Arab ministerial committee \nunder the chairmanship of Qatar and entrusting it with \noverseeing comprehensive peace talks between the \n A/63/PV.13\n \n19 08-53122 \n \nGovernment of the Sudan and the armed groups in \nDarfur. The committee would sponsor those \nnegotiations in cooperation and coordination with the \ninternational mediator of the African Union and a \nUnited Nations representative. It would also seek to \nimprove the humanitarian situation and to promote \ndevelopment in Darfur.  \n Syria, a member of the committee, calls on all \nStates concerned and on the international community to \nsupport the committee in its efforts to fulfil its \nmandate. In that regard, Syria welcomes the \nnormalization of relations between the Sudan and Chad \nas a positive contribution to the solution of the Darfur \nquestion. \n The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons (NPT) guarantees the right of all States to \npossess nuclear technologies for peaceful purposes. \nMuch has been said about the Iranian nuclear issue, \nwith some advocating a diplomatic solution while \nothers promote the use of force. Meanwhile, Iran has \ntime and again stressed that it is solely dedicated to the \npeaceful uses of nuclear power. Deep mistrust between \nIran and its interlocutors complicates matters and \nprevents the stakeholders from reaching an \nunderstanding. We seek a political understanding of the \nIranian nuclear issue. Any other option is not in the \ninterests of any of the stakeholders and will only inflict \ncatastrophic losses on the region and the world. \n In that context, and in line with our principled \nposition, we call for declaring the Middle East a zone \nfree from all weapons of mass destruction. Similarly, \nwe recall the draft resolution that Syria submitted to \nthe Security Council on 29 October 2003. At the same \ntime, we stress the need to compel Israel to dismantle \nthe hundreds of nuclear warheads in its possession, to \nsubmit its nuclear facilities to the safeguards regime of \nthe International Atomic Energy Agency and to accede \nto the NPT. \n The crisis that erupted in the Caucasus region \nwas an extremely ominous event. It is impossible to \nignore its dimensions and repercussions on \ninternational relations. By now, we know who sowed \nits seeds and are aware of the provocative acts \nassociated with it, prompting Russia to exercise the \noption it chose. We appreciate Russia\u2019s positive \nresponse to the efforts of France in its capacity as \nPresident of the European Union to arrive at a \nsettlement of the crisis that will guarantee regional \nstability and spare the world a revival of the \ninternational relations that prevailed in the past. \n Much has been said about the war on terror. Years \nafter waging that war, some issues still prompt us to \nask: Is terrorism less widespread today than it was \nbefore? Can we claim to have prevailed over that \nextremely dangerous phenomenon? Accusing countries \nof sponsoring terrorism for ulterior political motives is \na desperate attempt by those promoting those claims to \njustify the failure of their approach.  \n The right approach requires us to address the root \ncauses of terrorism. How can we overcome terrorism if \nwe continue to conflate terrorism with the right of the \nindividual to live on his land, free from occupation or \nthreat of war and aggression? We call upon all States to \ncooperate in the fight against terrorism. We particularly \nstress the need to avoid confusing terrorism with \nfundamental rights, because doing so gives terrorism \nan opportunity to strike. \n Experience demonstrates that unilaterally \ndictating the world\u2019s political agenda is wrong. The \nwars and the financial and food crises raging \nthroughout the world today require us to work together \nto address that malfunction by seeking to engage all \nregional and international stakeholders through active \ndiplomacy and dialogue as the means to settle \ncontroversial questions. \n Closing the door to dialogue and imposing \nisolation, unilateral sanctions and diktats have never \nbeen successful tools in the exercise of sound \ninternational relations. Contrary to claims made from \nthis very rostrum a couple of days ago, all attempts at \nisolation are doomed to failure. Respect for the \nprinciple of democracy in international relations that \ntakes into account the vision and interests of all States, \nlarge and small, will contribute to the realization of \nsecurity and stability in the world and help it solve the \nproblems it faces.  \n The Charter of our international Organization, in \nwhich States of different perspectives and interests \nenjoy equal membership, has set forth formulas that \nremain valid and could be used to build a world in \nwhich justice reigns supreme, based on mutual \nunderstanding \u2014 a world free from the threat of terror \nand in which there is no place for inciting hatred \namong cultures and religions. Promoting those values, \nprinciples and objectives and using them as guidelines \nfor our work will serve the interests of peace and \nA/63/PV.13  \n \n08-53122 20 \n \nstability in the world and contribute to the good of \nhumanity at large.

In \nSan Francisco, my country proudly sat among the \nOrganization\u2019s founders. \n Our courageous political ancestors created this \nOrganization in the belief that international law, based \non the doctrine of sovereign equality of States, must \nsupplant the use of force to settle differences between \nnations. This core abiding conviction of the founders \nmust be repeatedly reconfirmed. The founders\u2019 sense of \npurpose must also be reaffirmed. And the obligation \nthey handed down to us must continue to be exercised \nby all with a solemn sense of responsibility. \n However much the world has changed since \n1945, the United Nations remains the only universal \nintergovernmental institution that unites us as a global \ncommunity of sovereign States. And standing at the \nvery heart of this indispensable Organization is the \nGeneral Assembly, the ultimate source of the \ninternational system\u2019s legitimacy. The unique world \nforum that is the General Assembly brings us together \nas sovereign equals, each acting on behalf of a country, \nwith one vote, as guaranteed by the Charter of the \nUnited Nations. \n The sacrosanct character of the foundational \ndoctrine of sovereign equality and its accompanying \nbinding obligation to respect each other\u2019s sovereignty \nand territorial integrity constitutes the very nature of \nthe enduring legitimacy of the United Nations. \n This arrangement has not changed, and I believe \nit must not change \u2014 unless we seek to overthrow the \nCharter and overturn the global legal order upon which \nit is built. \n I come before the General Assembly as the \nPresident of a country that has become caught up at the \nheart of one of the most dangerous challenges to the \n \n \n29 08-51570 \n \nnature of the international system since the founding of \nthe United Nations. I speak of the unilateral, illegal and \nillegitimate declaration of independence by the ethnic \nAlbanian authorities of our southern province of \nKosovo and Metohija, a territory that stands at the \ncrucible of the identity of the Serbian people. It is the \nessential link between our proud national past and our \nproud European future. It is what ties the living \ntradition of Serbia to itself today. \n The attempt at secession took place on \n17 February 2008, in direct violation of the Charter of \nthe United Nations, the Helsinki Final Act and Security \nCouncil resolution 1244 (1999). Kosovo\u2019s ethnic \nAlbanian leaders chose to take that unilateral step after \nwalking away from the negotiating table. They \nbelieved that if they walked away, the path to securing \nindependence would open up before them. They \nbelieved it because that is what they were told. And \nthey believed it because an artificial deadline on the \ntalks was affirmed from the outside, after which, if no \ncompromise solution was reached, Kosovo\u2019s \nindependence would be imposed. \n Under such circumstances, a negotiated solution \nwas never a realistic option. With a fixed deadline and \na default position that fulfilled the maximalist demands \nof Kosovo\u2019s ethnic Albanians, what incentive did they \nhave to negotiate with Serbia in good faith? All they \nhad to do was to pretend to engage in a process \npredetermined to fail and wait out the clock. \n The incentives for compromise were far \noutweighed by the incentives for maximalism. The \nresult was the rejection of Serbia\u2019s reasonable offer of \nalmost unrestricted self-government, the broadest \npossible autonomy one can imagine. \n Kosovo\u2019s unilateral declaration of independence \n(UDI) amounts to an attempt to partition a State \nMember of the United Nations against its will, and \nwith disregard for the firm opposition of the Security \nCouncil, in order to appease a volatile and threatening \nethnic minority. As a result, the very nature of the \ninternational system has been called into question. \n We all know that there are dozens of Kosovos \nthroughout the world, just waiting for secession to be \nlegitimized, to be turned into an acceptable norm. \nMany existing conflicts could escalate, frozen conflicts \ncould reignite, and new ones could be instigated. \n We have heard the argument that Kosovo is sui \ngeneris, that it is a unique case. But the truth is, that is \ntantamount to saying that Kosovo is an exception to \ninternational law, that Kosovo should stand beyond the \nrules that govern the behaviour of the international \ncommunity. \n The Republic of Serbia rejects that claim, \nbelieving that no people is authorized to declare itself \nan exception, especially when doing so is in defiance \nof the position taken by the Security Council. \n We face a defining moment. We must stand \ntogether in steadfastness and determination against a \nfundamental violation of international law. \n Serbia responded to Kosovo\u2019s UDI with utmost \nresponsibility and restraint. Despite political turmoil, \nour country continued to work hard to contribute to \nmaintaining regional stability. From the very onset of \nthis grave crisis, Serbia has ruled out the use of force. \nAnd we have not exercised other unilateral options, \nsuch as the imposition of economic sanctions against \nour breakaway province. Instead, we have opted for a \npeaceful and diplomatic approach, the result of which \nis that a vast majority of States Members of the United \nNations have refrained from recognizing Kosovo\u2019s \nUDI. They have continued to abide by their obligations \nunder the Charter of the United Nations to respect the \nsovereignty and territorial integrity of my country. On \nbehalf of the Republic of Serbia, allow me once again \nto sincerely thank these countries for their adherence to \nthe principles of international law. \n Serbia proposes a non-confrontational way to \nrespond to the threat posed to its territorial integrity. \nWe have chosen to use the law. While rejecting \nviolence and unilateralism categorically, we are equally \nemphatic in demanding that justice be delivered \nthrough the proper legal means at the disposal of any \nState Member of the United Nations. To that end, the \nRepublic of Serbia has submitted a draft resolution to \nbe considered at this session of the General Assembly. \nLet me make it clear that the text of the draft resolution \nrefrains from taking political positions on Kosovo\u2019s \nUDI. Instead, in simple and direct language, it asks the \nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations \u2014 the \nInternational Court of Justice \u2014 to render an advisory \nopinion on the following question: \u201cIs the unilateral \ndeclaration of independence by the Provisional \nInstitutions of Self-Government of Kosovo in \naccordance with international law?\u201d \n  \n \n08-51570 30 \n \n We believe that sending the Kosovo question to \nthe International Court of Justice would prevent the \ncrisis from serving as a deeply problematic precedent \nin any part of the globe where secessionist ambitions \nare harboured. We also believe that an advisory opinion \nfrom the Court would provide politically neutral yet \njudicially authoritative guidance to many countries still \ndeliberating on how to approach Kosovo\u2019s UDI in line \nwith international law. \n Members\u2019 votes in support of the draft resolution \nwould serve to reaffirm another key international \nprinciple at stake: the right of any State Member of the \nUnited Nations to pose a simple, elementary question \non a matter it considers vitally important to the \ncompetent court. To vote against is in effect to vote to \ndeny the right of any country, now or in the future, to \nseek judicial recourse through the United Nations \nsystem. To vote against means to accept that nothing \ncan be done when secessionists in any part of the world \nproclaim the uniqueness of their cause and claim \nexception to the universal scope of international law. \nSuch an attitude could lead to the end of the United \nNations system as we know it. Allow me therefore to \nformally ask for the support of each and every Member \nState for Serbia\u2019s proposal before the General \nAssembly. \n While the International Court of Justice \ndeliberates on the legality of UDI, Serbia will remain a \ngood-faith partner in the interim administration of our \nsouthern province. The functionality of a reconfigured \ninternational civilian presence under the overall \nauthority of the United Nations, as defined by \nresolution 1244 (1999), is of great importance to my \ncountry. It must remain status-neutral and cannot \ntherefore be based on the so-called Ahtisaari proposal, \nwhich was rejected by Serbia and not approved by the \nSecurity Council. \n It is well known that the European Union (EU) \nhas committed itself to building the much-needed \ninstitutional and societal fabric of our southern \nprovince. Let there be no doubt: My country supports \nthe deepening of Europe\u2019s engagement in any part of \nSerbia, including Kosovo. In order for Europe\u2019s \npresence in Kosovo to be fully anchored within an \nacceptable, legitimate framework, it is vital that its \nmandate be approved by the Security Council. We will \nwork with the Member States and the Secretariat to \nensure that we achieve consensus in the near future on \nthe international civil presence in our southern \nprovince. \n In conclusion, I want to emphasize that the \ncentral strategic priority of the Republic of Serbia is \nrapid accession to the European Union. Serbia will join \nthe EU not only for reasons of geography, heritage, and \neconomic prosperity, but also because of the values we \nhold in common. They constitute the intangible \ngreatness of twenty-first-century Europe and they form \nthe foundation of our democracy, our society and our \nbeliefs in what we can accomplish. \n Our common values also point to the significance \nof reconciliation \u2014 an important reason why Serbia is \nfully cooperating with the International Criminal \nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. We have \ndemonstrated our unequivocal commitment time and \nagain. We will continue to do so because it is our  \nduty \u2014 our legal, political and moral duty \u2014 to the \nvictims, to ourselves and, most of all, to the \ngenerations to come. \n Europe has become the unifying force of the \nregion. My country\u2019s absolute dedication to joining the \nEU is shared by all the countries of the western \nBalkans. If we choose, as democracies, to belong to \nsomething that is greater than the sum of its parts, the \nbalkanization of the Balkans can be reversed. \n Serbia\u2019s European vision is complemented by our \nstrong desire to continue restoring and deepening the \nmany close friendships that Yugoslavia made across the \nglobe during the post-Second World War period. It will \nbe one of the key priorities in the years to come for my \ncountry and my Government. As a country that is the \nlargest successor to a co-founder of the Non-Aligned \nMovement, Serbia will work hard to contribute to a \nmore equitable global community, devoted to \nadvancing the democratization of international \nrelations, economic and social development, and \nhuman rights. \n I close by saying that my country remains ready \nto further promote a nobler form of intergovernmental \ncooperation that truly addresses challenges, alleviates \ndivisions, and reduces tensions. Such a vision can be \nbuilt only on the firm foundation of the universal \nprinciples of sovereign equality, solidarity and \ninternational law within the framework of the United \nNations. "

        "file_text": "This meeting of the United Nations is being held at a \ntime when there is a rebellion of peoples throughout \nthe world, a rebellion against poverty and destitution \nand against the effects of climate change, against the \nprivatization policies that have caused the financial \ncrisis. \n  \n \n08-51606 30 \n \n I wish to tell the Assembly that in Bolivia in \nrecent years we have experienced great uprisings by \nour people, social movements from the countryside to \nthe cities, of indigenous workers and farmers \nquestioning economic models and systems that simply \nprivatized natural resources and steadily sacked the \ncountry. The privatization of basic services and the \npolicies imposed by the World Bank and the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) did not solve \nanything for the majority of Bolivians. I came to the \npresidency in 2005 and 2006 as a result of that struggle \nby the social movements, which was accompanied by \nan ongoing labour and social struggle by our Bolivian \ncomrades and brothers who were seeking equality and \nsocial justice.  \n With a little experience I can say that in the two \nand a half years of my Government we have \nnationalized the natural resources, such as oil and gas, \nand the economy is beginning to change profoundly. In \n2005, before I was elected President, the Bolivian State \nreceived only $300 million for its oil and gas \nresources. Last year, 2007, after nationalization and \nafter we changed the hydrocarbons law, the Bolivian \nState received $1.93 billion. Being a small country \nwith about 10 million inhabitants, that enabled us to \nimprove the national economy. The recovery of our \nnatural resources is so important that that has been the \ngoal of a historic fight by our peoples.  \n I wish to speak about some results with regard to \nsocial issues and about some profound changes in \ndemocracy that took place with the participation of the \nworkers in various social sectors. However \u2014 and I am \ncertain that in the last few days the world has been able \nto grasp this \u2014 there is an ongoing conspiracy of small \ngroups against this process of change. I want it known \nthat since the first day of my Government some \nconservative parties that favour imperialism have \nconsistently tried to weaken us and to wear us down. \nLast year they requested a referendum to recall the \nPresident. I accepted that calmly, and instead of my \nbeing recalled, some prefects and some opposition \nauthorities were recalled by the Bolivian people. I \nreceived the support of 67 per cent of the people in the \nrecall referendum of 10 August 2008.  \n I should like to recall something important that \nour forefathers used to say \u2014 our leaders who fought \nfor control of our land, people such as Tupac Catari. In \n1741 we were cut into pieces by the Spanish invasion. \nBefore Bolivia was founded and before dying, our \nleader said, \u201cI die, but I will return transformed into \nmillions of people\u201d. For the first time a President of the \nBolivians has received more than 2 million votes. So \nthe statement of Tupac Catari, the leader of our \nancestors, has come true. But that was part of a process \nof change in the democracy, with the awareness of the \nBolivian people.  \n After 13, 14 and 15 August, that small group of \nconservatives began to organize a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat of \nmunicipal authorities and prefects against the \nGovernment and the State. I will quickly list some of \nthose events. On 14 and 15 August there was a meeting \nof a so-called national coordinating committee of the \nright, which attempted to prevent the national \nauthorities from reaching four regions of the country. \nThey attacked the departmental command of the \nnational police, and there was an attack on the police \nsubcommander. A roadblock was set up in four regions \nto cut off food supplies for the population. Oil \ninstallations were surrounded. There was a general \nattack on institutions, and in four departments \n75 government offices were taken over. The State radio \nand television were silenced, especially the community \nradios. The airports were taken by those groups. \n I remember that, when I was a boy, in the military \ndictatorships the coups d\u2019\u00e9tat began with takeovers of \nthe State television stations. History is repeating itself, \nbut thanks to the conscience of the Bolivian people this \ncivil coup in Bolivia has been defeated. Thanks to the \nparticipation of the nations that have now come \ntogether in the Union of South American Nations, this \nattempted civil coup d\u2019\u00e9tat has been defeated. \n Here, I would like to say something. Surely, some \nparticipants are waiting for me to tell them why we \nexpelled the United States ambassador. Europe and \nLatin America repudiated the attempted civilian coup, \nbut the Government of the United States did not, nor \nhas it denounced those acts of terrorism. This morning \nI heard the statement of the President of the United \nStates condemning terrorism. In Bolivia, right wing \ngroups are setting fire to gas pipelines and cutting off \nthe valves for the export of gas to Brazil and Argentina, \nbut the embassy of the Government of the United \nStates does not condemn such acts of terrorism.  \n It is not hard to imagine that, if some social \nmovement were to steal his country\u2019s national wealth, \nthe United States ambassador would condemn, \ndenounce and repudiate such an act. I would like to \n \n \n31 08-51606 \n \nhear the representatives of the United States \nGovernment denounce these acts of terrorism. Of \ncourse, the terrorists know that the United States is \ntheir ally. It is never going to condemn them. The \nambassador of the United States was clearly the \nprimary human element conspiring against the United \nStates Government. I remember perfectly the year \n2002, when I was a parliamentarian. On the \ninstructions of the United States embassy, I was \nexpelled from Parliament. I was accused of drug \ntrafficking and of being an assassin. In 2002, the \nUnited States created a governance programme through \nthe United States Agency for International \nDevelopment (USAID) to finance the strengthening of \nthe conservative political parties and put the brakes on \na growing political liberation movement, a political \nmovement for the sovereignty of our peoples, a \npolitical movement that was designed to bring an end \nto injustice and to seek equality for Bolivians.  \n I also remember \u2014 some participants may not \nrecall it clearly \u2014 that in 2002, when I was called for \nthe first time to be a candidate for the presidency, the \nUnited States ambassador said: \u201cDo not vote for Evo \nMorales. If you vote for Evo Morales, there will be no \ninternational aid or international cooperation\u201d, thereby \ninstilling fear in the Bolivian people. And they did not \nstop there. They also said: \u201cEvo Morales is the Andean \nBin Laden, and these farmers are the Taliban\u201d. Hence, \nstanding before this Assembly is an Andean Bin Laden \nwho represents the Taliban, which is the indigenous \nfarmers\u2019 movement that historically fought for its \nclaims. \n There are so many accusations of that kind. When \nwe came to power, we found a CIA office in the \nGovernment palace. After we discovered it, we had no \nproblem getting rid of it because we had no need for a \nCIA office in the palace. Obviously, they were \noperating from there. For example, in 2004, they \nwanted to force the National Congress to give \ndiplomatic immunity to civilians or members of the \nBolivian military. We rejected that, of course, thanks to \nour social cohesion. In 2005, they began dismantling \nthe military\u2019s missiles, together with some commands \nand, of course, the administration in place at that time.  \n Dismantling the military is treason; it is not \npossible that the Southern Command of the United \nStates armed forces would practice such a policy. \nHowever, they continuously tried to control some \nmembers of the military. For example, in previous \nGovernments, they created a special counter-terrorism \nforce, the F-10, and at one point in time their \nrepresentatives informed me that, in 2005 or 2004, they \nwere prepared to kill labour or political leaders who \nopposed capitalism and imperialism.  \n When I appointed a commander, he was vetoed \nby the United States embassy. Of course, we are not \ngoing to allow any more vetoes. Last year, special \nfirearms munitions were illegally brought into the \ncountry at the instigation of the commander of the \nUnited States military group, Colonel Campbell. We \nwere told that these were missiles for training \npurposes. Moreover, they illegally employ young \nstudents belonging to United States peace groups to \ncarry out spying activities on officials of the \nGovernments of Cuba and Venezuela. They are \nworking in secret against the Government of Bolivia, \nthus violating the constitutional rights of their own \nUnited States citizens who come to Bolivia on \nscholarships. \n I would point out that when one works for \nequality and for social justice, one is persecuted and \nconspired against by certain groups. These groups are \nnot concerned about human equality. It is clear that this \nis a historic fight for our peoples and that it is nothing \nnew. We can speak about the economy, or about the \ncost of silver as an industrial commodity, but what we \nare talking about is the fight between rich and poor. It \nis the fight between socialism and capitalism. That \nhistoric struggle is being resumed now, but I feel that \nthese battles are uprisings and rebellions of peoples \nagainst an economic model \u2014 against the capitalist \nsystem. If we do not understand that capitalism is \ndestroying humanity, then I am sure \u2014 and I hope that \nno one will be offended \u2014 that we will not solve the \nproblems of life, the problems of the planet or the \nproblems of humanity.  \n I am not accusing anyone of being an accomplice \nof capitalism. From a communal and labour struggle to \nan electoral one, from organizer to President, I have \nbecome perfectly aware that capitalism is the worst \nenemy of humanity. As I said a few days ago, with \ngreat sincerity, while touring my country, I was \nbrought up in social movements among workers, \nfarmers and indigenous peoples. More than 500 years \nago, our forefathers fought colonialism and \nimperialism, and that is why I am anti-imperialist \ntoday. No one is going to move me from that position. \nIf people like me, they like me a lot, but if they do not \n  \n \n08-51606 32 \n \nlike me, so be it. What the world is going through is \nunjust.  \n So much has been said about climate change, \nflooding, droughts, how our mountains are losing their \nsnow. If we continue in this way, we will all be \nresponsible for destroying the planet, and thus \nhumankind.  \n I have heard good statements from other \npresidents participating in this debate, from which I \nhave learned a great deal; but I am sorry to say that I \ndo not believe that it is enough to simply raise the \nproblems unless we also provide the solutions. I would \nlike to say that some blacklists have been drawn up to \npunish Governments.  \n It is difficult to imagine that those terrorists \ngroups are not condemned, while the national \nGovernment is decertified for supposedly being \ninvolved in drug trafficking. According to United \nNations reports, some countries are increasing their \ncoca plantations, but they are not on decertified lists \nbecause they are pro-capitalist. To those countries that \nsupport the counter-narcotics struggle by reducing their \ncoca cultivation, we did not say that there would be no \ncoca, but that there would be no free cultivation of \ncoca, since the coca leaf does have medicinal and \nnutritional benefits. Once we clearly defined our \nanti-imperialist position, we were decertified. \nHowever, I am quite sure that this is not about \ncertification or decertification, terrorist or non-terrorist \ncountries.  \n Mr. Bush, President of the United States, sent me \na message recently in which he wrote: \u201cIf I am not a \nfriend, I am an enemy\u201d. I do not care whether I am a \nfriend of the President of the United States, but I am a \nfriend of the people of the United States. I have had \nmany meetings with representatives from social \nmovements in the United States and we agree on our \napproach to life and humankind. That is why we have \nto put an end to blacklists. We are living in times where \nthere are no empires, no dominance or imposition of \neconomic models that can greatly harm countries or \ncontinents or the whole world.  \n I wish to say that we have begun to work on a \nproposal. It is called \u201cTen commandments to save the \nplanet, humankind and all life\u201d. I hope that my \ncolleagues will distribute this document, and with the \nparticipation of all it will help us save the planet, \nhumankind and life. One of the first subjects we raise \nhere is how we can put an end to capitalism. Wherever \nthere is capitalism, there is exploitation. Wherever \nthere is capitalism, our natural resources are plundered. \nThat is what we have seen and experienced. \n Our second point is that we must denounce war. \nAs everyone knows, we are working arduously to put \nBolivia back on track by drafting a new constitution. In \nthat new political constitution for the Bolivian state, \nfor the first time the State and the people of Bolivia \nwill constitutionally pledge never to initiate war. That \ndoes not mean that we renounce defending ourselves. I \ndo not believe in wars. \n Speaking of war, I am sure that peoples do not \nwant wars. They do not want the military intervention \nof any country in any part of the world. In our new \npolitical constitution for the Bolivian State, we propose \nthat Bolivia should not accept the military base of any \ncountry of the world on its territory. In that way, we \nshall assert our dignity and defend the sovereignty of \nBolivia and of other peoples. I have very respectfully \nsuggested to the people and the Government of the \nUnited States that it would be best to withdraw their \nmilitary from Iraq and Afghanistan and other parts of \nthe world as soon as possible. If they do not, the \npeoples themselves will expel them because \ninterventionism and war are no solution for life and \nhumanity.  \n Our third point is a proposal for a world without \nimperialism and colonialism. Last year, I heard a \ncritical issue discussed here by several heads of State. \nThat issue was water \u2014 water as a right of all living \nbeings. We also heard discussions on energy and how \nimportant it is to have clean, environmentally friendly \nenergy.  \n Speaking of nature, the indigenous peoples have \nexperience living in harmony with Mother Earth and \nnature. Mother Earth is neither a shopping centre nor a \ncommodity. Thus, the historic struggle of our peoples \nis for land and territory, and that struggle is being \nrepeated in our country.  \n Our next point, as I said earlier, is to Mother \nNature within the United Nations. I hope that can be \ntaken into account. I would also note that the new \nBolivian political constitution incorporates the ten \ncommandments to save humanity and the world. \n Basic services should be human rights. Water, \nlight and telecommunications cannot be in private \n \n \n33 08-51606 \n \nhands. If they are human rights, they should be a public \nservice and not left to the private sector. To be sure, we \nhave many differences with multinationals. Investment \nis certainly important, but we need investors in Bolivia \nwho are not the owners of our energy and our oil, but \nwho are our partners.  \n My next point is that we should consume only \nwhat we need and prioritize local consumption in the \ncontext of food sovereignty. We also need to respect \nthe diversity of cultures and economies. \n Our final point concerns how to live well. What \ndoes it mean to live well? Living well is living in \nequality, solidarity and complementarity, eliminating \ninequalities between families and the deep-rooted \ndisparities that exist among countries and continents. \nWhen we try to live better, sometimes all we do is to \nbecome selfish and ambitious. We never think about \nthe larger family, which, for us in Bolivia, is the whole \nof Bolivia.  \n The struggles of peoples for democracy and for \nthe re-establishment of the rule of law is being \nrepeated in Bolivia. In the past, great social movements \nled by indigenous farmers brought down dictatorships. \nIn recent days, they defeated an attempted coup in \nBolivia, and we hail them. We have just been informed \nthat social movements are wisely mobilizing \nthemselves in a search of peace and asking that new \nstandards be adopted to ensure equality be for all \nBolivians. \n In conclusion, I wish to say that I am convinced \nthat only the conscience of the people can defeat the \ninterests of certain groups and United States \nimperialism. I heard some leaders this morning sue for \npeace with a regulated, moderate form of capitalism. I \ndo not believe in that. There will be peace only when \nthere is equality among all human beings; there will be \npeace only when our identity and the dignity of every \npeople are respected. \n I do not think there can be peace with capitalism, \nno matter how moderate or regulated. We need to work \ntogether, we need to participate in the struggles of our \npeoples for equality. Only Governments and leaders \nworking together with their peoples can find equality. \nWhen we have equality, there will be social peace \nthroughout the world. "

        "file_text": "May I first \ncongratulate Mr. D\u2019Escoto Brockmann on his \nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-third session. I am sure that he will lead our \ndeliberations with great wisdom and skill. I also wish \nto congratulate his predecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, for \nably guiding our sixty-second session. \n It is timely and wise that we focus our \ndeliberations on the global food crisis and on the \ndemocratization of the United Nations. While those \ntwo issues appear to be vastly different, they have \nmore to do with each other than meets the eye. For \ndemocracy means nothing if a part of humankind is \nwell fed while a larger part of it goes to bed hungry \nevery night. Human equality is a mirage in any country \nwhere a part of the population struggles against obesity \nwhile a larger part of it wonders where the next meal is \ncoming from. \n I do not exaggerate. According to the Food and \nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations, food \nprices will remain high for the next three to five years. \nRice stocks are falling to their lowest level since the \nmid-1970s. Wheat stocks are sinking to their lowest \nsince 1948. Compounding the situation is the explosive \ngrowth of the world population. \n There is a huge unfilled demand for food. Food \nriots have already erupted in parts of the Middle East, \nAfrica, Asia and the Caribbean. In 33 countries, \nespecially those with fragile States, there is a real and \npresent danger of social and political unrest because \npeople are hungry. We must vigorously address the \nproblem of global food insecurity. Otherwise, peace is \nat risk in the developing world and in pockets of \npoverty in the developed world. What the world needs \ntoday is a new Green Revolution \u2014 a Green \nRevolution that this time embraces the entire \ndeveloping world, especially Africa. Developing \ncountries must now put agriculture, especially food \nproduction, back into the core of their development \nagenda. For their part, the developed countries must \nput agriculture and food production into the core of \ntheir trade and aid programmes. \n In that regard, the experience of Indonesia may \nbe instructive. It is not easy to feed a population of 230 \nmillion, the fourth largest in the world, but there are no \nfood riots in Indonesia. Last year, we had a surplus \nproduction of rice. We used that surplus to bolster our \nnational stockpile. That has contributed to national \nstability. This year, we expect another surplus of 5 per \ncent, which brings production to 36 million tons. We \nare going to export part of that as our contribution to \nglobal food security. \n We can do that because we have vastly improved \nour rice productivity by providing our farmers with \nmicrofinancing, improved seed varieties, cheap but \nappropriate farm technology and affordable fertilizers. \nWe have thus developed some experience and expertise \nthat worked for us and can work in other developing \ncountries. We will continue to share those in the spirit \nof South-South cooperation. \n Food security is a cause in which everyone must \nbe involved. In that light, I firmly believe that this \nGeneral Assembly of ours is called upon to take a \nnumber of concrete measures.  \n First, we can task the World Bank and the \nrelevant United Nations bodies to develop ways and \nmeans of helping national Governments to spend more \non agriculture and on rural infrastructures to empower \nsmall farmers. \n Secondly, let us ensure that the appropriate \nUnited Nations bodies link up with regional \nmechanisms for food security, such as common food \nreserves and early warning systems on regional food \n  \n \n08-53129 16 \n \ncrises. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations has \nsuch an arrangement and so do other regional \narrangements. The United Nations can serve as the \nhub, while the regional arrangements serve as the \nspokes of a global wheel for food security. \n Thirdly, let us establish the framework for a \nglobal partnership on food security. We should ensure \nthat the World Trade Organization Doha development \nnegotiations reach a conclusion that supports increased \nfood production. Let us make use of the forthcoming \nreview of the Monterrey Consensus on financing for \ndevelopment as an opportunity to devise ways to fund \nthe Green Revolution. \n Let us be mindful, however, that agriculture does \nnot always lead to a food harvest. It is even possible \nthat an imprudent rush to produce biofuels will lead to \na severe reduction of the food supply. It is true that by \nswitching from fossil fuels to biofuels, we can cushion \nthe impact of the skyrocketing of the world price of oil \nand thereby address the energy crisis. It is also true \nthat, by making that switch in fuels, we reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions and thereby address the \nchallenge of climate change.  \n It would be unwise and reckless, however, to \naddress two crises by aggravating a third. We cannot \nallay the energy crisis and the crisis of global warming \nby deepening the global food crisis. That will only \nworsen the plight of humankind, but we can carry out a \nbroad range of rational and coordinated policies and \ninitiatives that address those crises systemically. We \ncan address the energy crisis by developing all \nalternative sources of available energy, which will help \nmitigate global warming. \n Moreover, in the next 16 months we can advance \nthe climate change agenda through the Bali Road Map, \nall the way from Bali to Copenhagen through Poznan. \nIndonesia is fully committed to that process. After \nhosting the Bali conference that produced the Road \nMap, we have joined the troika of host countries to \ngive the process a push among world leaders. By 2009, \nwe should produce an ambitious post-2012 global \nclimate regime that will contain global warming to \nwithin two degrees Celsius in the next 20 years. But \neven before the process is concluded in Copenhagen, \nwe in Indonesia are partnering with other countries to \nenhance our topical forests and coral reefs in an effort \nto reduce carbon emissions. \n Even as we face the challenge of global warming \nin the physical world, we must also deal with the \nreality of a global chill in the politico-security field. \nSymptoms of that chill are the military tensions that \nhave arisen in Eastern Europe. \n There is also a new arms race. There is more \nmilitary spending now than there was at the end of the \ncold war. Moreover, the conflicts and tensions of a year \nago are still with us. The dream of establishing a \nPalestinian State by the end of this year has virtually \ncrumbled. The Iraqi and Afghan conflicts keep raging \non. North Korea, the subject of so much uncertainty \ntoday, is backsliding from its commitment to dismantle \nits nuclear weapons programme. The nuclear issue in \nIran remains unresolved.  \n In the face of those conflicts and tensions, the \nSecurity Council should have been more decisive. That \nthe Council has failed to resolve them is a cause for \nconcern. Of the issues that the Council has failed to \nresolve, two are of great concern to Indonesia, namely, \nthose recent cases that directly infringe on the principle \nof the territorial integrity and political independence of \nStates, both involving external intervention that led to \nthe secession of a part or parts of a State. Both cases \ninvolved major Powers. \n It is of the greatest importance to Indonesia and, I \nbelieve, to many developing countries that those recent \ncases do not set an ill-advised and dangerous \nprecedent. Developing countries in the midst of nation-\nbuilding and State-building would be extremely \nvulnerable to such precedents. The danger is that it \ntakes only one misstep to kill principles that have been \nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, such as \nthe principle of the sovereignty and territorial integrity \nof States. If we kill those principles, we have killed the \nideal that holds the United Nations together. \n The sovereignty of States must be preserved if \nthere is to be a democratic spirit in international \nrelations. That idea is essential because, without \ndemocracy, a world organization like the United \nNations cannot be effective. Indeed, the failure of the \nSecurity Council to come to grips with recent \nchallenges to global security is due largely to the fact \nthat it is not democratic enough. \n To make the Council more democratic, the use of \nthe veto power of the permanent five must be \nregulated. The misuse of the veto by any one \npermanent member should no longer be allowed to \n \n \n17 08-53129 \n \nparalyse the entire Council. Democratization of the \nCouncil also means an equitable distribution of its \nmembership, not only in terms of geographical \nrepresentation, where we already have imbalances, but \nalso in terms of constituencies. Hence, the world\u2019s \nmajor civilizations should be proportionately \nrepresented. The world\u2019s community of 1.1 billion \nMuslims must be represented on the Council if it is to \nbe truly democratic. \n The need for democratization is also deeply felt \nat the regional level. In the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN), I am pleased to say, we have \nresponded to that need. The cause of democracy is \ngaining ground in the region as we transform ASEAN \nfrom a loose association into a true community that is \nfirmly committed to the promotion of democracy and \nhuman rights. All members, without exception, \nstrongly share that commitment. \n It is in that spirit that Indonesia is launching the \nBali Democracy Forum this December. It will be not an \nexclusive forum among democracies, but an inclusive \nand open forum for the countries of Asia to share their \nexperiences and best practices in fostering democracy. \nA true democracy is always homegrown; it is never \nanything that is imposed from outside. \n Meanwhile, we in Indonesia continue to tend to \nour young democracy. We are seeing to it that \ndemocracy takes root, not only by holding free \nelections, but also by working hard to provide good \ngovernance, to sustain a system of checks and balances \namong the three branches of Government, and to \nstrengthen the roles of the mass media and civil society \nin our national life. Thus we pursue the democratic \nideal: democracy at the level of the United Nations, \ndemocracy at the regional level and democracy within \nthe nation. \n At each of those levels, we hope to see nations \nand people taking control of their lives and taking part \nin the decision-making processes that shape their \nfuture. The realization of that ideal will give full \nmeaning to the first three words of the Charter of the \nUnited Nations. Indeed, \u201cWe the peoples\u201d is what \ndemocracy is all about. "

        "file_text": "On 11 September 2001, the world changed, \nand it rallied together in the fight against the threat of \nterror, a threat that was common for all and knew no \nboundaries. I am referring to threat of terrorism. The \nworld displayed an unprecedented level of solidarity by \nrejecting old phobias and stereotypes. It seemed that \nthe global counter-terrorism coalition became a new \nreality that from then on would define the development \nof a system of international relations free from double \nstandards and beneficial to all. \n The cohesion in the face of the deadly threats \nemerging from Al-Qaida and other elements of \ninternational terrorism made it possible to achieve \ntangible success during the initial stage. But later, \nproblems began to appear. A painful blow to the unity \nof the anti-terrorism coalition was delivered by the war \nin Iraq, when \u2014 as it turned out later, under the false \npretext of the fight against terror and nuclear arms \nproliferation \u2014 international law was violated. The \ndeepest crisis was thus created in a completely \nartificial way and even today it is far from being \nresolved. \n Ever more questions are being raised about what \nis going on in Afghanistan. First and foremost, what is \nthe acceptable price to pay in terms of the loss of \ncivilians\u2019 lives in the ongoing counter-terrorism \noperation? Who decides on criteria for determining \nproportionality in the use of force? And why are the \ninternational contingents that are present unwilling to \nengage in the fight against the proliferating drug threat \nthat causes increasing suffering in the countries of \nCentral Asia and Europe? These and other factors give \nus reason to believe that the counter-terrorism coalition \nis faced with a crisis.  \n Looking at the core of the problem, it seems that \nthis coalition lacks the requisite collective \narrangements: equality among all its members in \ndeciding on strategy and, especially, operational \ntactics. But in order to control the entirely new \nsituation that evolved after 9/11, which required \ngenuine cooperative effort, including joint analysis and \ncoordination of practical steps, mechanisms designed \nfor a unipolar world began to be used; decisions were \ntaken in a single centre of power, while the rest merely \nhad to follow. \n We ended up with a privatization of the \ninternational community\u2019s efforts in the fight against \nterrorism. The inertia of the unipolar world also \nrevealed itself in other spheres of international life, \nincluding unilateral steps taken in anti-missile defence \nand the militarization of outer space as well as in \nattempts to bypass parity in arms control regimes, \nexpansion of political-military blocs, and politicization \n  \n \n08-53129 2 \n \nof the issues of access to and transport of energy \nresources. \n The illusion of the existence of a unipolar world \nconfused many. For some people, it generated a desire \nto place all of their eggs in one basket. In exchange for \nabsolute loyalty, there was an expectation of carte \nblanche to resolve all problems, using any means. The \nemerging syndrome of complete permissiveness that \ndeveloped led to a rampage on the night of 8 August, \nwhen aggression was unleashed on South Ossetia. The \nbombing of the sleeping city of Tskhinvali and the \nkilling of civilians and peacekeepers trampled under \nfoot all existing settlement agreements, thus putting an \nend to the territorial integrity of Georgia. \n Russia helped South Ossetia to repel that \naggression, and carried out its duty to protect its \ncitizens and fulfil its peacekeeping commitments. \nRussia\u2019s recognition of the independence of South \nOssetia and Abkhazia was the only possible step to \nensure not only their security, but also the very survival \nof their peoples, considering the previous record of \nchauvinism of the Georgian leaders \u2014 starting with the \nGeorgian leader Zviad Gamsakhurdia who, in 1991, \nunder the slogan of \u201cGeorgia for Georgians\u201d, ordered \nthe deportation of Ossetians to Russia, abolished the \nautonomous status of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and \nlater unleashed a bloody war against them.  \n That war was brought to an end at the cost of \ninnumerable human lives, and peacekeeping and \nnegotiation mechanisms were established with the \napproval of the United Nations and the Organization \nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). \nHowever, the current Georgian leadership has pursued \na persistent policy of undermining those mechanisms \nthrough relentless provocation, and finally nullified the \npeace process by launching a new murderous war on \nthe night of 8 August. \n This problem is now closed. The future of the \npeoples of Abkhazia and South Ossetia has been \nreliably secured by the treaties between Moscow and \nTskhinvali and Sukhumi. With the implementation of \nthe Medvedev-Sarkozy plan, to which we are strongly \ncommitted, the situation around the two republics will \nfinally be stabilized. It is important that this plan \nshould be strictly and unswervingly implemented by all \nparties. We are concerned, however, by the attempts to \nrewrite it after the fact. \n I believe that everyone here has tired of playing \nthe role of extras for the Georgian regime, whose \nwords contain not a shred of truth and whose foreign \npolicy is aimed exclusively at provoking confrontation \nthroughout the world in the pursuit of their own \nobjectives which invariably run counter to the \nobjectives of the Georgian people and to the goal of \nensuring security in the Caucasus. \n Today, it is necessary to analyse the crisis in the \nCaucasus from the viewpoint of its impact on the \nregion and the international community as a whole. \nThe world has changed yet again. It has become \nabsolutely clear that the solidarity demonstrated after \n9/11 must be revived through approaches untainted by \ngeopolitical expediency and built on the rejection of \ndouble standards when fighting against any violations \nor breaches of international law \u2014 whether on the part \nof terrorists, political extremists or any others. \n The crisis in the Caucasus has proved again that \nit is impossible to resolve the problems we face when \nblinded by the mirage of a unipolar world. The price \nwe will have to pay in terms of human lives and \ndestinies is too high. We cannot tolerate any attempts \nto resolve conflict situations by violating international \nagreements or by the unlawful use of force. If we allow \nthat to occur once, then we run the risk of unleashing it \nin the future. \n One cannot invoke the duty to defend in the \nabstract, and then be outraged when that principle is \nused in practice \u2014 and in strict conformity with Article \n51 of the United Nations Charter and other norms of \ninternational law. In South Ossetia, Russia defended \nthe highest of our common values, the most essential \nhuman right: the right to live.  \n The existing security architecture in Europe did \nnot pass the test of recent events. Attempts to adjust it \nto the rules of a unipolar world led to a situation where \nthat architecture proved incapable of containing an \naggressor or  preventing the supply of offensive \nweapons to it, contrary to all existing relevant codes of \nconduct. \n We propose that this issue should be addressed in \na comprehensive manner. President Dmitry \nA. Medvedev, of Russia, speaking in Berlin on 5 June, \nproposed an initiative on developing a Euro-Atlantic \nsecurity treaty, a type of \u201cHelsinki II\u201d. This work could \nhave been started at the Pan-European summit with the \n \n \n3 08-53129 \n \nparticipation of all States as well as all organizations \nworking in the region. \n The treaty which we are proposing is meant to \ncreate a reliable collective security system that would \nensure equal security for all States and set out, in \nlegally binding form, the bases of relations among all \nparticipants, with a view to strengthening peace, \nensuring stability and promoting integrated and \nmanageable development efforts across the vast Euro-\nAtlantic region. This would be a process in which all \nparties would reaffirm their commitment to \nfundamental principles of international law, such as the \nnon-use of force; peaceful settlement of disputes; \nsovereignty; territorial integrity; non-interference in \ninternal affairs; and the inadmissibility of \nstrengthening one\u2019s own security by infringing upon or \nendangering the security of others. We also need to \nconsider together new mechanisms to ensure \ncompliance with those fundamental principles. \nNaturally, such a treaty should organically fit into the \nlegal framework of the United Nations Charter and its \nprinciples of collective security. \n The cold war distorted the nature of international \nrelations and turned them into an arena for ideological \nconfrontation. Only now, after the cold war has ended, \ncan the United Nations, created on the basis of a \npolycentric vision of the world, fully realize its \npotential. Today as never before, it is important that all \nStates reaffirm their commitment to the United Nations \nas a global forum, to which there is no alternative and \nwhich possesses a universal mandate and generally \nrecognized legitimacy, and as a centre for open, candid \nand frank debate and coordination of world policies on \na just and equitable basis free from double standards. \nThis is an essential requirement to ensure that the \nworld regains its equilibrium. \n The multitude of challenges that humanity is \nfacing require comprehensive strengthening of the \nUnited Nations. In order to keep up with the times, the \nUnited Nations requires further rational reform to be \nable to gradually adapt itself to existing political and \neconomic realities. On the whole, we are satisfied by \nthe progress of the reform, including the initial results \nof the activities of the recently established \nPeacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights \nCouncil.  \n With regard to expansion of the membership of \nthe Security Council, we will, of course, welcome \nproposals that do not divide United Nations Member \nStates but rather facilitate the search for mutually \nacceptable compromises and lead to a broad-based \nagreement. \n Of increasing importance in the reform process is \nthe promotion of dialogue and partnership among \ncivilizations. Russia supports the Alliance of \nCivilizations and other initiatives in that regard. We \nreiterate our proposal that a consultative council of \nreligions be established under United Nations auspices, \ntaking into account the increasing role of the religious \naspect in international life. That would assist in \nstrengthening moral principles and incorporating them \ninto international affairs.  \n Among the priorities of United Nations activities, \na number of urgent issues have recently appeared on \nthe Organization\u2019s agenda, including climate change \nand food and energy security. Those problems are \nglobal and interrelated, and they can be addressed and \nresolved only through a global partnership at a \nqualitatively new level, with active involvement by \nGovernments, the scientific and business communities \nand civil society. \n In particular, the current financial crisis requires \nurgent attention and synergy of efforts. From this \nrostrum, the President of France has put forward \nimportant initiatives aimed at a cooperative search for \nways to revitalize the international financial system \nthat involve the world\u2019s leading economies. In that \ncontext, we support the further development of \npartnerships between the members of the Group of \nEight and key States in all developing regions. The \nEconomic and Social Council could also play a role \nhere. Russia will continue to participate responsibly in \nthe work of various bodies of the United Nations \nsystem and in other contexts to help find an equitable \nsolution to all those problems. \n The international development assistance \nmechanisms being established in Russia will help us to \nincrease the extent and effectiveness of our \nparticipation in international efforts to fight hunger and \ndisease, to promote broader access to education and to \novercome energy shortages, which will be our \nadditional contribution to the achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals. It is only natural that, \nin so doing, we should pay particular attention to \nassisting nearby countries. All countries have partners \nwith which they share traditional friendly relations \n  \n \n08-53129 4 \n \nbased on a common history and geography. It is wrong \nto artificially undermine such relationships for the \nbenefit of geopolitical schemes and against the will of \nthe people.  \n We will continue to work together with all our \nneighbours. First and foremost, along with the other \ncountries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, \nwe will continue to develop the integration processes \nwithin the Collective Security Treaty Organization and \nthe Eurasian Economic Community in order to \npreserve and promote our common heritage of culture \nand civilization, which, in a globalizing world, is a \nmajor resource of the Commonwealth and of each of its \nmember States. That is why we have a particular \ninterest in cooperating with those countries, and it is \nalso why they view Russia as an area of special \ninterest. We will therefore base our relations on the \nprinciples of equality, mutual benefit, respect for and \nconsideration of one another\u2019s interests and compliance \nwith existing agreements, in particular those on the \npeaceful settlement of disputes. That is also the way in \nwhich we intend to develop our relations in other \nregions of the world: openly, on the basis of \ninternational law and without any zero-sum games. \nThose principles were set out in the foreign policy \nconcept approved by President Medvedev in July this \nyear.  \n Russia is consistently implementing its network \ndiplomacy and promoting cooperation in various \nformats: the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the \nBRIC countries \u2014 Brazil, Russia, India and China \u2014 \npartnership mechanisms with the European Union, the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations, the \nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, the League of \nArab States and regional organizations in Latin \nAmerica. \n The developments that occurred in August gave \nus yet another occasion to think about the \nresponsibility to report events accurately. Distortions \nof reality hamper international efforts to settle conflicts \nand crises and revive the worst practices of the cold-\nwar era. If we wish to prevent the truth from becoming \nthe first casualty of war, we must draw the appropriate \nconclusions, in particular in the light of a provision of \nthe 1970 Declaration on Principles of International \nLaw concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation \namong States in accordance with the Charter of the \nUnited Nations, which states that States have the duty \nto refrain from propaganda for wars of aggression. \nThat is in line with the Guidelines on protecting \nfreedom of expression and information in times of \ncrisis, recently adopted by the Committee of Ministers \nof the Council of Europe. I propose that the United \nNations also issue a statement on that issue, this time \nin a universal context.  \n The obvious global effects of the crisis in the \nCaucasus show that the world has changed for \neveryone. There are now fewer illusions and fewer \npretexts for refusing to respond to the most urgent \nchallenges of modern times. That is precisely why we \nhope that the international community will, on the \nbasis of common sense, finally manage to develop a \nprogramme of collective action for the twenty-first \ncentury. "

        "file_text": "Eight years ago in this very Hall, we, the leaders of the \nworld, solemnly adopted the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs). Three years ago, we reviewed the \nGoals to assess the progress made thus far. We realized \n  \n \n08-51570 26 \n \nthat the Goals were in danger of not being attained by \nthe year 2015, and we all acknowledged that we would \nbe able to achieve them only through a considerable \nincrease in our efforts. \n Have we been able to deliver on those promises \nand commitments? I am afraid that we have not. In \nfact, the situation is more complex now than it was \nthree years ago. We are facing a global food crisis, a \nglobal economic crisis and a global security crisis, with \nwar and political hostilities spreading throughout the \nglobe. In spite of efforts to reduce the divisions \nbetween the rich and the poor, the progress we have \nmade so far on the MDGs has fallen far short of the \ntargets we established. \n Those global crises are of such importance that \nthey are threatening to delay the achievement of the \nMDGs beyond 2015. It would be a major mistake if we \nwere to do nothing to prevent that from happening. We \nmust remain focused on the achievement of the MDGs. \nI highly appreciate the aid and assistance provided by \ndonors and international organizations. Those \ninstitutions and their programmes are making a \ndifference in the daily lives of people throughout \nAfrica, including in Madagascar. \n In Madagascar, for example, under-five mortality \nrates have dropped from 159 to 94 per 1,000. Primary \nschool enrolment has increased from 67 per cent to \nmore than 92 per cent. A million Malagasy have risen \nout of poverty in the past five years. None of that \nwould have been possible without the support of the \ninternational community. \n Unfortunately, official development assistance \ncontinues to shrink, while the aid provided by the \ninternational community remains insufficient. The \ntarget of 0.7 per cent of gross national income \nallocated to official development assistance was set \nwith a view to achieving the MDGs in the developing \ncountries. In his report on Africa\u2019s development needs \n(A/63/130), the Secretary-General rightly stresses that \nmost of the wealthy donor nations have failed to \ndeliver on their promises to help the world\u2019s poorest \ncountries. The same report estimates that donor \ncountries must increase aid by $18 billion a year in \norder to honour their pledge to provide $50 billion \ndollars by 2010. \n In Africa, we continue to bear the consequences \nof those broken promises. Africa cannot break the \nvicious cycle of poverty: families have difficulties \nfeeding themselves and the number of families with \naccess to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation \ninfrastructure is very small. I call upon all donor \ncountries to honour their promises and to demonstrate \nleadership by explaining to their people why \nsupporting the MDGs and the fight against poverty is a \nmoral obligation and essential to creating a more stable \nand peaceful world. \n We are all aware of the current world food crisis. \nFor us and other countries, it is a heavy burden that \nposes many new challenges. The global food crisis is \npartly the result of the domestic agricultural subsidies \nand tariff protection practices of developed countries, \nwhich for many years have discouraged agricultural \nproduction in developing countries. In Africa, we find \nourselves in very difficult circumstances. Because we \nhave such low agricultural output, we are dependent on \nthe global marketplace to feed our people. With \ncommodity prices soaring, however, we cannot afford \nthe basic food items needed to survive. We are in an \nunprecedented crisis. Rising food prices are pushing \nmore people into absolute poverty. \n The international community needs to take urgent \nand coordinated action to counter the negative impacts \nof increasing food prices on poor and vulnerable \ncountries. Global trade policies must foster food \nsecurity for all. Developed countries must reform their \nagricultural subsidy policies and amend the strategies \nand practices that increase the volatility of \ninternational prices. The international community must \nalso help African countries to expand agriculture and to \nstrengthen agricultural investment and the infrastructure \nneeded for rural development. \n The new agricultural development strategies must \naddress the need for environmental management, \nsustainable development and the resistance of crops to \ndisease and climate change. Given the impact of global \nclimate change, maintaining healthy biodiversity is \ncritical to sustaining future production performance. \n Small subsistence farmers, representing 80 per \ncent of Africa\u2019s population, are key to its development. \nWe must support them through a variety of \nprogrammes focused on training, access to finance and \nequipment, and marketing and distribution processes. \nThose small subsistence farmers must be an integral \npart of, and benefit from, a new model of agricultural \nproduction, economic development and environmental \nmanagement. In that regard, I appreciate the true value \n \n \n27 08-51570 \n \nof the new dynamic of the Food and Agricultural \nOrganization\u2019s pragmatic approach.  \n I would like to speak about what we are doing in \nMadagascar to address the challenge of food security. \nOur chief intention is to make Madagascar\u2019s \nagriculture more productive, more sustainable and \nmore open to innovation and entrepreneurship, as the \ninitiative Future Farmers of Madagascar shows.  \n For example, we are promoting the widespread \nuse of the System of Rice Intensification, developed in \nMadagascar in the 1980s, an eco-friendly method of \nproduction that is an important part of the natural \nrevolution, recently launched in Madagascar. That \nrevolution is based on sustaining our natural resources \nand maintaining an ecological balance. It respects the \nsoil, the environment and the people. At the moment, \nas rice is the staple food of the people of Madagascar, \nwe are trying to keep the domestic rice price at an \naffordable level to protect the most vulnerable layers of \nthe population.  \n In addition to that food crisis, we are confronted \nwith other important challenges: climate change, \nincreasing energy prices, unpredictable financial \nmarkets and other threats to our peace and security. \nWhat are the consequences of those threats and \nchallenges?  \n First, those threats have a severe impact on the \neducation, health and well-being of the population. In \nshort, they have a very negative impact on our \ndevelopment. Secondly, those challenges are now \ncompeting with the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs). Many of the resources dedicated to achieving \nthe MDGs are now being directed elsewhere. They are \nbeing used to reconstruct countries destroyed by war or \nthat have collapsed as a result of social conflicts. They \nare also being used to stabilize the food markets, meet \nenergy demands and tackle climate change issues.  \n I understand that countries devastated by wars \nand other armed conflicts, by environmental disasters \nor by famine need assistance. I understand, and I \nsupport reforestation efforts and the need for new \nhydro-energy plants. What I do not understand, \nhowever, is that all those challenges and threats offer \nreasons for countries to abdicate on their promises of \ndoubled aid for education, health and infrastructure, in \norder to achieve the MDGs in developing countries, \nespecially in Africa.  \n For that reason, I have repeatedly stressed the \nimportance of international assistance, especially the \nneed to increase, improve and better coordinate that \nassistance, if donors are to meet their previously \nagreed pledges. There are links between the MDGs and \nthe political, economic, environmental and other \nchallenges I have mentioned. Therefore, more \ninvestment towards achieving the MDGs will \ncontribute to addressing those challenges. In fact, \nimproving the situation of the most dominated is one of \nthe best means to solve them.  \n However, we must realize that those challenges \nwill not be solved by simply shifting resources from \none problem to another. It is clear that those other \nchallenges require additional resources and a better \ncoordination of efforts. Africa has been hit harder than \nany other continent by the food crisis, by higher energy \nprices, by environmental degradation, by disease and \nby social and political destabilization. That is why I \nwould like once again to reiterate the need for a new \nMarshall Plan for Africa.  \n It seems that many world leaders, and public \nopinion, have forgotten or neglected the MDGs. We \ncannot fill one group\u2019s basket with the advantages of \nglobalization while we empty the basket of another \nthrough the cost of globalization. It is increasingly \nclear that domestic interests are serviced at the cost of \ninternational needs. The outcome of the latest round of \nthe World Trade Organization proved that. The lack of \nshared decision-making power in international \ninstitutions and global forums is a significant obstacle \nto making progress in developing countries and to \nachieving the MDGs. I would like to see a United \nNations that can mobilize the resources and political \nwill to tackle the toughest of problems \u2014 and succeed. \n I am optimistic. I believe that we can turn the \nsituation around. I appeal to you as leaders of the \nworld. Everyone needs to contribute more goodwill, \nmore motivation, more technical assistance, more \ncoordinated efforts and, above all, more financial \nresources to the international basket. If you want to do \nso, if we are all committed to doing so, we shall be \nable to confront those crises together and achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals, and I am sure that we \nare going to win.  \n The recent fourth Tokyo International Conference \non African Development provides an encouraging and \npromising example of our partners\u2019 commitment and \n  \n \n08-51570 28 \n \nwillingness to advance the development agenda of \nAfrica and to achieve the MDGs. More and more \nfoundations, such as the Gates, Rockefeller, \nMacArthur, Better U and Clinton Foundations, and \nothers, are playing a vital role in Africa. All those \ninitiatives are much appreciated.  \n Madagascar has embarked on the path of \ntransformation. To accelerate and better coordinate our \ndevelopment process and to make a quantum leap \nforward, we have created the Madagascar Action Plan, \nor MAP. It is a bold and ambitious, five-year plan that \naims to promote rapid growth, lead to the reduction of \npoverty and ensure that the country develops in \nresponse to the challenges of globalization and in \naccordance with the national vision, Madagascar \nNaturally, and with the Millennium Development \nGoals. To implement the plan we have mobilized the \nwhole population, whose active participation \nstrengthens its sense of national pride and country \nownership.  \n To help it move further on that path and to \nachieve the MDGs, the international community must \ndouble its efforts in Madagascar. For our part, we are \nresolved to assume our responsibilities, build trust with \nour partners, strengthen our capacities, promote \ndemocracy and good governance and take control of \nthe future of our country.  \n It is crucial to share the responsibility and to \nprove our ability for leadership in achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals. I am calling on the \nleaders of the world to confront the challenge of \ntransforming our thinking and our actions towards \ndevelopment to build a new Africa that becomes a \ncontinent of hope and opportunity.

        "file_text": "Allow me to begin by \ncongratulating Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann upon \nhis assumption of the office of President of the General \nAssembly. I wish him success in his responsibilities \nand endeavours. I also wish to express my appreciation \nand respect to his predecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, for \nhis effective leadership during the sixty-second session \nof the General Assembly. \n I shall be brief. I would like to speak today about \nthe following three issues: the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and the prospects for \nrealizing them; natural disasters and humanitarian \nassistance; and the war between Georgia and Russia, \nalong with some of the conclusions that can be drawn \nfrom it. \n Let me begin with the Millennium Development \nGoals. We must bear in mind that over half of the time \noriginally allotted for achieving the Goals is already \nbehind us. Yet, have we actually reached half our \ngoals? As Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon reported \nhere 20 days ago, there are reasons to doubt that we \nhave. Some achievements can be regarded as \nnoteworthy progress, for example greater access to \neducation, a marked reduction in infant mortality, debt \nrelief for developing countries, an increase in access to \ninformation and communication technology for people \nin developing countries, and so on. We have also made \ncertain progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS. \n At the same time, however, progress in the \nspheres of trade and development cooperation has been \nmodest. From the Secretary-General\u2019s report, it is clear \nthat, although the donor States have increased their \nofficial development aid, the actual flow of financial \nassistance in the course of the past two years has \nactually decreased. \n The European Union, of which Estonia is a \nmember, is on the whole, on track towards increasing \nits development aid to 0.7 per cent of its gross national \nincome, the objective agreed at the United Nations. \nEstonia has steadily increased its share among \ninternational donors; our development aid has grown \nfourfold since 2004. \n In addition to the actual decrease in development \naid, we suffered a serious setback when the Doha \nDevelopment Round of trade negotiations stalled and \nwhere the main theme has been a more efficient \nintegration of developing countries into a world trading \nsystem based upon equality and regulations. \n I would now like to set forth several positions \nbased upon matters of principle that Estonia regards as \nessential, and which are also part of the United Nations \nMillennium Declaration. \n First, every nation is primarily responsible for its \nown development. In order to ensure their proper \ndevelopment, developing countries must strengthen \ntheir administrative infrastructure and capacity, \nintensify their fight against corruption and put their \neconomic  environment in order. That is the only way \nto create conditions suitable for an efficient mode of \n  \n \n08-51839 8 \n \ntransferring development aid and for increasing the \nbenefits of the aid received. \n High levels of corruption, inefficient \nadministrative capacity and an unresponsive economic \nclimate make it difficult for donor-nation public \nopinion to support increases in development aid. In a \nword, our electorates \u2014 and here I am of course \nspeaking of democratic countries with free and fair \nelections \u2014 do not understand why their taxes are \nspent that way. \n Secondly, donor States and organizations can \nenhance the effectiveness of development cooperation \nby mutually coordinating and standardizing the \nprocedures involved in development cooperation. \n Finally, I would like to stress that Estonia \nstrongly supports British Prime Minister Gordon \nBrown\u2019s and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon\u2019s \ninitiative, the Millennium Development Goals Call to \nAction. The objective is to inform the general public of \nthe importance of fulfilling the objectives of the \nMillennium Development Goals programme. This year, \nEstonia also joined that initiative. I personally hope \nthat Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was right when he \nsaid that the MDGs are still achievable if we act now. \n The second Wednesday of October is the \nInternational Day for Natural Disaster Reduction. In \nthat connection, as opposed to the fight against poverty \nor diseases, we cannot of course set objectives for \nourselves that can be expressed in monetary amounts. \nWe can, however, formulate and implement measures \nthat can help to minimize the dangers and threats to \npeople and their property, and to avoid or reduce \ndestruction to physical infrastructure and the \nenvironment. We can thereby limit losses and alleviate \nthe suffering of people. That, in turn, can prevent the \nsocial and economic convulsions that natural \ncatastrophes have on repeated occasions triggered \nthroughout history. \n In the case of humanitarian catastrophes, be they \nnatural or man-made disasters, it is of the utmost \nimportance that help arrive on the scene as quickly as \npossible and that the access of humanitarian experts be \nensured, regardless of their nationality or the State or \norganization that they represent. Unfortunately, there \nhave recently been a number of occasions when \nvarious countries have permitted help from abroad only \nunder very specific conditions. As a result of such \npolicies, it is the weakest and the most vulnerable who \nsuffer the most. \n As I said earlier, I would like to talk about recent \nand ongoing events in the southern Caucasus, \nspecifically the military conflict between Georgia and \nRussia. There are a series of complex issues involved, \nbut here in the General Assembly I would like to raise \none fundamental question: What do those events mean \nfor us, the United Nations? \n To begin with, we must realize that the principles \ngoverning relations between States have been seriously \ndamaged. It is regrettable in the extreme that the basic \nprinciples of the United Nations as enshrined in the \nCharter, such as the unacceptability of threatening the \nuse of force or actual aggression against a nation\u2019s \nterritorial integrity, were grossly and grotesquely \nviolated. Those principles must be and must remain the \nbases for the activity of the United Nations and the \nSecurity Council. Therefore, we have the right to \ndemand and ensure that the United Nations be capable \nof convincing one Member to withdraw its military \nforces from the territory of another sovereign Member \nState and to terminate its aggression. \n The capacity of the United Nations to fulfil the \nexpectations placed upon it cannot be dependent upon \nwhether said Member nation chooses or not to act \naccording to the good practices of international law. In \nthe alternative case, the United Nations loses its reason \nfor existence. We cannot allow international law to be \nfollowed selectively and only when convenient, for \nthen it is no longer law.  \n Russia\u2019s behaviour in the weeks following the \ncessation of combat activity showed us that, \nunfortunately, even in the first decade of the twenty-\nfirst century, it is possible to refuse to adhere to \ninternational treaties, to interpret them arbitrarily and \nto observe international laws only when it serves one\u2019s \ninterest. A permanent member of the Security Council \nshould be especially committed to fulfilling the \nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. That \nforces us once more to conclude that, in the interests of \nthe international community, it is imperative to \nimprove the capacity of the United Nations to regulate \nand resolve conflicts. Looking at recent events, it has \nbecome quite clear how important it is to proceed with \nthe reform of the Security Council.  \n The previous month\u2019s events in the southern \nCaucasus raised another issue. Even before the armed \n \n \n9 08-51839 \n \nconflict broke out, Georgia was the target of a \ncyberwar aimed at Government websites, as well as \nthose of news agencies and banks. In the case of \ncyberattacks and cyberwarfare, it is becoming ever \nmore difficult to determine and apprehend the \nperpetrators. As I stated last year from this very \nrostrum, cyberattacks are an international problem \u2014 \nindeed, a form of aggression \u2014 that no nation is able \nto deal with on its own. Cyberattacks can be launched \nagainst any nation on any continent, and from any \ncontinent.  \n Administering and policing the cyberworld to \navoid criminal and hostile attacks requires extensive \ncooperation and the standardization of relevant \ninternational regulations. I call upon all United Nations \nMember nations to deal with the risks associated with \ncybersecurity with the utmost seriousness. Estonia, \nwhich has extensive experience dealing with and \nrepulsing cyberattacks, is ready to contribute its \nexpertise to thwarting that new form of criminal \nwarfare. "

        "file_text": "It is a \nspecial pleasure for me to address the General \nAssembly at its sixty-third session. Allow me to \ncongratulate the Assembly President on his election to \nhis high position. Albania welcomes cooperation with \nhim. I would like to take this opportunity to assure the \nPresident of the full support of my country. I would \nalso like to express my highest praise to Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his vision and continuous \nefforts to revitalize and to reform our Organization, the \nUnited Nations.  \n Allow me also to confirm Albania\u2019s commitment \nto a strong and coherent United Nations, capable of \nsuccessfully tackling the challenges we currently face. \nWe fully support the joint initiatives and actions aimed \nat strengthening collective peace and security in order \nto achieve sustainable and long-term development to \npromote human rights and international cooperation. \nWe consider that reform of the Organization in all its \naspects is possible only through cooperation, dialogue \nand consensus.  \n The global fight against terrorism, especially \nthrough guaranteeing an effective response to this \ncollective threat, demands that the United Nations \ncontinue to play a very important role. My country, \nAlbania, has very actively met its responsibilities in the \nglobal fight against terrorism. In compliance with the \nUnited Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, \nwhich the General Assembly unanimously passed on  \n8 September 2006, Albania continues to be a stability \nfactor in the region and beyond through its moderating \nand constructive policy. It contributes with \npeacekeeping troops in the framework of the United \nNations and other security organizations in \nAfghanistan, Iraq, Georgia and Bosnia and \nHerzegovina. It recently deployed 68 troops to Chad as \npart of the European Union-led peacekeeping force. \nAlbania is also working to enhance its domestic \ncapacities to enable a greater presence in aiding global \n  \n \n08-51839 38 \n \npeace and security by deepening its cooperation with \nthe United Nations in the field of peacekeeping \noperations.  \n Albania has already become part of the United \nNations system-wide coherence effort for reform of the \nOrganization by willingly joining the One United \nNations initiative. It fully supports this project and is \nactively working with United Nations agencies to secure \nnew ways of partnership in the fields of development, \nhumanitarian assistance and the environment. One United \nNations is being carried out in full respect for national \nsovereignty and national ownership of development and \nin compliance with the needs and priorities of our \ncountry, especially of the integration to the European \nUnion (EU) and meeting the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs).  \n As a pilot country, we are aware of this \nresponsibility, and we will do everything possible to \nturn this initiative into a tangible success. In my \ncountry the MDGs are not viewed simply as \ndevelopment objectives, but also as a means for \ngrowth. Albania has nationalized the MDGs by drafting \nand following step-by-step implementation instructions \nfor the zonal strategies of development. It has also \nadded one more objective: that of good governance. \nKeeping in mind experiences to date, meeting the \nMDGs in countries with small and medium incomes \ndemands continuous support from the national \nleadership, a more efficient use of resources and a \ncloser partnership among all the players \u2014 in \nGovernments, the international community and civil \nsociety.  \n We are very active in the framework of the \nAlliance of Civilizations, and we are convinced that \nthis initiative already presents a political instrument of \nthe United Nations to build peace in the broader \nmeaning of the term. Following up that commitment, \nAlbania has compiled a national strategy of \nintercultural dialogue, which reflects the centuries-old \ntradition of full religious harmony and understanding.  \n Climate change presents a global concern and \nthreat, and as such it affects my country as well. \nAlbania considers it a priority issue and assesses it in \nthe framework of the implementation of the One \nUnited Nations initiative. It joins the international \ncommunity with determination in the challenge of \nglobal climate change and modestly contributes to \nreducing emissions quotas to secure a better and a \nmore developed future.  \n The world food crisis continues to be one of the \nmost complex challenges faced by humanity. It not \nonly affects the health and survival of millions of \npeople all over the world, but directly threatens \npolitical and economic stability by seriously putting \ninto question the achievement of the MDGs. The \ncauses of this crisis are numerous and complex. As \nsuch, they demand a multilevel, coherent and well-\ncoordinated response. My country hails the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s establishment of the High-Level Task Force \non the Global Food Security Crisis.  \n Albania is undertaking a full programme of \ninstitutional, economic and legal reforms through \nwhich we aim to transform Albania into a country \nattractive to foreign investments, with a market open to \nfree enterprise. I have the pleasure to point out that the \nlatest World Bank report listed Albania as second \namong countries that have implemented successful \nreforms to facilitate business practices during 2007 and \n2008.  \n Albania has gained the status of a medium-\nincome country, and I believe that this progress must \nbe consolidated in compliance with the new challenges \nof development. The national strategy for development \nand integration has determined our vision for the next \nseven years of Albania as a country of high democratic \nstandards, fully guaranteeing the fundamental human \nrights, with its sustainable economic and social \ndevelopment aimed at integrating into NATO and the \nEuropean Union, as well as harmonizing with the \nMDGs \u2014 a country providing a better and safer life to \nfuture generations.  \n Albania enjoys a solid and irreversible \nrelationship with the EU. The Stabilization and \nAssociation Agreement serves as our guide, and the \nprimary objective is the conclusion of the ratification \nagreement by the end of this year. The European \ncountries and the European Commission have invested \nconsiderably in Albania. We have responded to this \ncontribution not only with natural gratitude, but also \nwith concrete commitments and with joint and \ncoordinated work programmes in the fields of good \ngovernance, institutional functioning and economic \ngrowth and in the fight against organized crime and \ncorruption.  \n \n \n39 08-51839 \n \n Albania\u2019s path towards full Euro-Atlantic \nintegration is widely supported by the Albanian public \nand its political spectrum. In particular, the invitation \nto join NATO at the Bucharest Summit, the signing of \nthe alliance and the protocols on 8 July 2008 and the \nongoing ratification process all mark historic \nachievements for Albania and are a positive assessment \nof the new and tangible Albanian reality. Albania will \nrespond to this assessment with greater responsibility \nand determination in the face of the obligation that \nstems from full-fledged membership in the alliance, \nwhich will serve peace and security not only in the \nBalkans, but in the Mediterranean region and beyond.  \n Albania pays particular attention to the \nstrengthening of multilateral regional relations. It \nseriously encourages the process of regional \ncooperation by being an active partner in all of the \ninitiatives undertaken in South-East Europe. That \nengagement serves to promote good neighbourliness, \nstrengthening security, building trust among the \nregional countries, stability and full integration of all \nthe countries in the region in the Euro-Atlantic \nstructures.  \n Challenges such as the fight against terrorism, \norganized crime, arms proliferation and border \nmanagement have an interlinked character that can be \novercome only through joint actions, initiatives and \ncommitment. We will continue to play the same \nconstructive role for our benefit and for that of the \nwhole region.  \n Albania considers the foundation of the \nindependent and sovereign State of Kosovo as the most \nimportant historical event and development of our \nregion at the beginning of this century. An independent \nand democratic Kosovo, oriented towards Euro-\nAtlantic integration, is the just and most sustainable \nsolution. It is an example of the most successful \ninvestment made by the international community \ntowards the implementation of the rule of law, to long-\nterm stability and peace and development in the \nBalkans and beyond.  \n The independence of Kosovo finally frees that \npart of Europe from the nightmare of war, of  \ninter-ethnic conflicts and of ethnic cleansing and \ngenocide. It fulfils and respects the free will of the \npeople to break free from political oppression, \nhistorical injustices and the inability to develop. \nKosovo is no longer being led by the failed Yugoslavia, \nnor by the new moderate Yugoslavs. It is being led by \nthe principles of a civilized Europe and those of the \nuniversalized United Nations.  \n Albania encourages the people and the \nGovernment of Kosovo in their commitment to build a \ndemocratic and multi-ethnic society in which, \nregardless of ethnic considerations, its every citizen \nwill feel like a free man in his home and on his \nproperty. The new constitution of Kosovo and the \nAhtisaari package meet the highest standards of human \nrights and offer widespread protection to all the \ncommunities living in Kosovo, especially to the Serbs \nof Kosovo.  \n We are convinced that, following the guidelines \nof the Secretary-General of the United Nations, all \nnecessary actions will be taken as soon as possible: the \nUnited Nations presence will be reconfigured and the \nEuropean Union Rule of Law Mission Kosovo \u2014 \nEULEX \u2014 will be spread over the entire territory of \nKosovo, thus avoiding any vacuum of power and \nimposition of competences on top of each other and \npreventing any possible regressive attempt, regardless \nof where it may have originated, against this Euro-\nAtlantic process.  \n Albania deems as unfounded the efforts to draw \nparallels between Kosovo and the regions of Georgia \u2014 \nAbkhazia and South Ossetia. Numerous historical, \njudicial, constitutional, political and demographic \narguments demonstrate that Kosovo is a unique case \u2014 \na sui generis case \u2014 and the solution implemented is \nunique as well. As such, it does not and cannot serve as \na model to solve other conflicts either in the region or \nbeyond it. Any political, economic, military or \ndiplomatic endeavour against the consolidation or \nsoundness of the State of Kosovo would be a hopeless \nattempt against its process of integration to NATO and \nthe EU, a regressive move against the investments and \nprogress that we so direly need, and it could not be \nsold as valuable to the European Union. Historical \ndreams must not darken the vision of the future.  \n Albania is convinced that the recognition of the \nnew State of Kosovo is in the interests of Kosovo, \nAlbania, Serbia and of all its close and distant \nneighbours. It is in the interest of the European and \nMediterranean region. That is why Kosovo \u2014 this new \npolitical, economical and social reality \u2014 fully \ndeserves to be a Member of our United Nations as soon \nas possible. I call upon the Assembly to admit with \n  \n \n08-51839 40 \n \nrealism this irreversible development by recognizing \nand supporting, without any reserve, the Republic of \nKosovo.  \n Albania continues to remain committed to \ncooperating with and enriching and fulfilling the \nUnited Nations ideals by fully believing in the active \nrole of the international community as it faces the \npresent global challenges. In order to fulfil this \nmission, we must all together give our support and \nreadiness to this Organization, which embodies not \nonly universal values, but also the aspirations of \nhumanity.  "

        "file_text": "I am pleased to address this \nAssembly on behalf of my delegation from the \nKingdom of eSwatini. The Assembly gives us the \nopportunity as Heads of State and Government to share \nideas and experiences. It enables us to shape the future \nof our countries and pave a way for a better world, \nwhere we can all live with each other in harmony. Let \nme extend our appreciation to Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon and to the entire staff of the United Nations \nfor their efforts in carrying out the vision and \nprogrammes of the United Nations. \n The world continues to face many challenges, \nwhich include the catastrophic effects of climate \nchange, complicated diseases such as tuberculosis, \nmalaria and the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and food \nshortages. That situation is further compounded by \nhigh prices for fuel and food and the instability in \ninternational finance, which slow down our efforts to \nfight poverty and attain sustainable development. \n It is encouraging to note that the United Nations, \nin particular the Food and Agriculture Organization \nand the World Food Programme, continues to assist \ndeveloping countries to find lasting solutions to the \nfood crisis. In the light of that, my country has put in \nplace various strategies to ensure food security. The \nnation continues to hold consultations on those issues. \nFor instance, we had a national agricultural meeting \nlast year and the Sibaya \u2014 the people\u2019s parliament \u2014 \nthis year, which looked at ways of increasing our food \nproduction and other issues of national interest. The \nnation came up with different suggestions, and we are \nin the process of implementing them. \n We developing countries were looking forward to \npositive results from the Doha round of negotiations, \nparticularly on agriculture. Developing countries were \nhoping for secure and increased market access for their \nagricultural products. Unfortunately, that has not been \nthe case. We hope those talks will be concluded soon \nfor the benefit of the developing countries. \n Swaziland fully supports the global dialogue to \nensure that the world is rescued from the dangers of \nglobal warming and other damage to the environment. \nIt is true that global warming is a major contributor to \nthe many calamities such as earthquakes, flooding and \npersistent droughts that threaten the very existence of \nthe human race. \n Swaziland, like many other countries of the \nworld, continues to be a victim of the devastating \neffects of climate change. We continue to suffer from a \npersistent drought. We continue to be hit by strong \nwinds that cause wildfires. Those fires often destroy \nvast acres of our man-made forests, resulting in \neconomic disruption, the waste of many years of \ninvestment and loss of life and property. We fully agree \nwith the United Nations that failure to respond in a \ntimely way and decisively to that threat will undermine \nnational and international efforts to achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), which aim to \nimprove the living standards and welfare of all our \npeoples. \n The high-level meeting on Africa\u2019s development \nneeds came at the most opportune time. We are pleased \nwith the adoption of the declaration (resolution 63/1) \nand we are looking forward to its effective \nimplementation. There is indeed urgency in addressing \nAfrica\u2019s special needs, in particular economic \ndevelopment, poverty reduction and issues of peace \nand security. \n It should be noted that the cooperation and \nsupport of the international finance institutions is \npivotal, for instance by ensuring improved accessibility \nto finance for Africa. That should also include making \ngrants and loans available to African countries under \npreferential rates to fund infrastructure development, \ntechnology transfer, tourism and other projects that are \nmeant to create wealth and economic growth. \n As we pass the midpoint to the 2015 deadline for \nthe MDGs we still face many challenges. This is more \nso because many of our people are still living in \npoverty and we continue to face a high unemployment \nrate. Notwithstanding, the commitment of the Kingdom \nof Swaziland to the achievement of the MDGs is \nunwavering. The MDGs are anchored within our \nnational development strategy and the poverty \nreduction strategy and action plan, which aspire, \namong other things, to reduce poverty by more than \nhalf by 2015. All Government programmes are geared \ntowards that vision and are being implemented with the \nguidance of all stakeholders and the nation at large. \n Like many other countries, the Kingdom of \nSwaziland is on track for some of the MDGs. We are \n \n \n7 08-51851 \n \ndoing everything possible to achieve universal \neducation and are providing resources for every child \nto go to school. Efforts are being made to achieve \ngender equality and the empowerment of women, \nensure environmental sustainability, reduce child \nmortality and to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and \nmalaria, among other targets. \n Peace, stability and security, which form the \nprimary goals of the United Nations, remain key pillars \nof meaningful development. When those conditions \nprevail, our peoples can concentrate their energies and \nresources on the pursuit of productivity and wealth \ncreation. \n Members of the Southern African Development \nCommunity (SADC) are committed to upholding those \npillars for a better life for all. We have put in place \nstructures such as the SADC Organ on Politics, \nDefence and Security to ensure their preservation and \npromotion. For that reason, we applaud the recent \nsigning of the power-sharing agreement and the \nestablishment of a Government of national unity in \nZimbabwe. We look forward with optimism to the \nrebuilding process and the removal of all bottlenecks. \nIn that regard, we urge the international community \nand the developed world to fully support the people of \nZimbabwe. In the same spirit, we wish to see \npeacefully negotiated settlements for all conflicts that \nprevail in Africa and in different parts of the world. \n The Kingdom of eSwatini joins the rest of the \nworld in condemning all forms and acts of terrorism. \nWe support efforts for the full implementation of the \nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy in order to send a \nclear message to all perpetrators of terrorism. In line \nwith the United Nations convention on terrorism, our \nparliament has recently promulgated the anti-terrorism \nact. \n If the United Nations is to have a more effective \nrole, its structure must be reformed to adapt to a world \nthat has been constantly changing since the adoption of \nthe Charter. These reforms should of course take place \nin a fair, just and balanced manner. It has been \nobserved in the past that one of the most important of \nthe reforms that require urgent attention is that of the \nSecurity Council. The widely held view is that the \nSecurity Council as constituted at present falls short of \nproper demographic representation of United Nations \nMembers. The Kingdom of eSwatini looks forward to a \nspeedy conclusion to the discussions on the reform of \nthe United Nations. \n We welcome the recent handshake between the \nsenior leadership of the Republic of China on Taiwan \nand that of mainland China. This handshake gives us \nhope that the two are now talking to each other. \nHopefully, this might lead to an amicable resolution of \nthe cross-Strait relations, such that perhaps one day we \nmight see them sitting next to each other here at the \nUnited Nations. It should be noted that the people of \nTaiwan have expertise and experience, which they are \nready to share with the United Nations family. That is \nwhy Swaziland requests the United Nations to allow \nTaiwan to participate in its specialized agencies. \n The Kingdom of Swaziland has just held a \nsuccessful parliamentary election under a new \nconstitution. The voter turnout was most impressive as \nthe people exercised their right to vote for a \ngovernment of their choice. As the nation continues to \nappreciate the power of parliamentary representation in \na complex globalized world, we note that the electorate \nunderstands the importance of choosing candidates of \nhigh calibre with the capacity to handle the issues at \nhand. That gives us confidence that the new Parliament \nwill assist with strategies that will further improve our \nsocio-economic climate for the betterment of the living \nstandards of our people. \n The Kingdom of eSwatini reaffirms its \ncommitment to the purpose and preservation of the \ncentral role of the United Nations in multilateral \naffairs. We treasure peace and development and \namicable regional and international relations and, \ntogether with all nations, will work towards a peaceful \nand prosperous future for all humankind. "

        "file_text": "I wish \nat the outset to sincerely congratulate you, Sir, on your \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-third session. We are convinced that your \ndiplomatic ability and skill will help us to ensure the \nsuccess of this session and to attain the objectives to \nwhich we all aspire. I should also like to thank \nMr. Srgjan Kerim for his excellent work and his \nvaluable contributions to the smooth conduct of the \nprevious session. Our sincere thanks go also to the \nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his generous \nefforts to promote the work of the Organization and to \nenhance its performance in addressing various issues of \nimportance to our countries and peoples. \n The choice of the main theme of this year\u2019s \ngeneral debate \u2014 the impact of the global food crisis \non poverty and hunger in the world \u2014 reflects the \nimportance of that issue and the growing awareness \namong all countries of its seriousness and of the need \nto work together to find effective solutions to reduce \nits impact and repercussions on national economies, \nparticularly those of developing and poor countries, \nand on the increasing rates of poverty and hunger \nthroughout the world. \n In that context, the central role played by the \nUnited Nations is of crucial importance in addressing \nthose issues and in striving to achieve a better balance \nin international relations and greater solidarity, justice \nand equality. That requires that we enhance the \n \n \n5 08-53129 \n \nOrganization\u2019s reform process and strengthen its \ncapacity to keep abreast of international developments. \n In recent years, the world situation has been \ncharacterized by increasingly swift change, which has \ndisrupted international balances and undermined \nprevailing development formulas. It has also created \nmany problems and difficulties that have clearly \naffected the economies and development processes of \nmany countries. In addition, it has weakened their \ncapacity to make progress and increased their \nvulnerability. Furthermore, the world has recently \nwitnessed serious economic problems, in particular an \nexcessive rise in oil and basic food prices, which has \nthreatened world food security and reduced the \npurchasing power of individuals, thus hampering the \nachievement of the goals and approaches set at the \nMillennium Summit. If we are to address this grave \nsituation, we must step up international efforts by \nadopting development strategies based on the noble \nhuman aspects of world solidarity. In that context, \nTunisia has called on international financial institutions \nand other organizations that specialize in economy and \ntrade to establish and implement agricultural and \nproduction policies that guarantee the availability of \nfood, which is a fundamental right enshrined in \ninternational human rights instruments. \n I should like to take this opportunity to reiterate \nour call for intensified efforts to operationalize the \nWorld Solidarity Fund, endorsed by the General \nAssembly in 2002 (resolution 57/265) on the initiative \nof Tunisia as a mechanism to address the issues of \npoverty and privation in the world and to reduce \ndisparities among peoples. \n In order to keep abreast of the profound changes \non the international scene and the new realities they \nhave produced in international relations, along with the \nvarious challenges and complexities those changes \nrepresent, we must act to strengthen the capacity of the \nUnited Nations to act more efficiently. We must also \nendeavour to reform the Organization, develop its \nstructures and enhance the role it is expected to play to \nameliorate the current international situation and turn \nglobalization into a process that helps to guarantee \npeace and development for all peoples. \n In that context, Tunisia supports all efforts and \ninitiatives aimed at establishing new frameworks and \nmechanisms for action that can help to find collective \nsolutions to common challenges in the vital fields of \nsecurity, peace, development, the environment and \nfood security, as part of an appropriate approach to \ninternational relations founded on the complementarity \nbetween peace, security and development. However, \nthat should be accompanied by strengthened \nmultilateral action on the basis of cooperation, \nsolidarity and a constructive dialogue among all \ncountries. \n Despite efforts to contain it, the heightened \nproblem of terrorism in the world strengthens our \nbelief in the need to unify the international approach to \nfighting that scourge and finding adequate solutions to \nit. Since the early 1990s, Tunisia has warned the \ninternational community against the dangers of \nterrorism and has called for the adoption of a \ncomprehensive and efficient approach that takes into \nconsideration the root causes of the scourge. Today, we \nrenew the call of His Excellency President Zine El \nAbidine Ben Ali to convene an international \nconference under the auspices of the United Nations to \ndevelop an international code of conduct for the fight \nagainst terrorism to which all parties shall commit \nthemselves. \n Climate change and the resulting intensification \nof the problems of desertification, drought and the lack \nof drinking water pose a threat to all humankind today \nand are a source of great concern to all. While \naffirming the close link between the environment and \ndevelopment and the crucial importance of promoting \ncooperation and solidarity to respond to the challenges \nin that regard, we should like to emphasize the need to \ninclude concerns about the potential effects of climate \nchange, particularly in the African and Mediterranean \nregions, among the international community\u2019s \npriorities, as called for in the Tunis Declaration \nadopted by the International Solidarity Conference on \nClimate Change Strategies for the African and \nMediterranean Regions, which was held in Tunisia in \nNovember 2007. \n We would also like to reiterate the need to \nmobilize the necessary financial resources to promote \nresearch into climate monitoring and meteorology and \nthe development of natural disaster early warning \nsystems, in addition to the need to invest in reducing \nthe greenhouse gas emissions that cause global \nwarming. \n We are convinced that the success of \ndevelopment efforts and the strengthening of \n  \n \n08-53129 6 \n \ncooperation among our countries depend on providing \na secure and stable international environment. \nObstacles to success in that effort include the \nintensification of tensions and conflicts and the \npersistence of unresolved problems. In that regard, we \nreaffirm Tunisia\u2019s commitment to the values of peace \nand to the principles of international legality as the \npath to achieving just and lasting solutions to pending \ninternational issues. We also renew our determination \nto promote the values of moderation, tolerance and \nmutual respect in relations among countries and \npeoples and to establish bridges of communication and \ndialogue among all civilizations, cultures and religions. \n In that context, while reaffirming Tunisia\u2019s \nposition in support of our Palestinian brothers and their \njust cause as a people, we renew our call to the \ninternational community, especially its most influential \nmembers and the Quartet, to increase their efforts to \nbring Israel to end its aggressive practices and \nsettlement activities. We call on them to intensify their \nwork to reinvigorate the peace effort and to facilitate \nthe resumption of negotiations between Palestinians \nand Israelis on the basis of the relevant international \nterms of reference, the Arab Peace Initiative and the \nresults of the Annapolis Conference, with the aim of \nachieving a just, lasting and comprehensive solution to \nthe Palestinian question.  \n Such a solution would guarantee that the \nPalestinians regain their legitimate national rights and \nestablish an independent Palestinian State on their \nnational territory. It would also guarantee the \nwithdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab territories, \nincluding Syrian and Lebanese land. That solution \nwould also provide security and stability for all the \npeoples of the region. \n We also call for joint regional and international \nefforts to address the deterioration of security and \nhumanitarian conditions in Iraq and to help the \nbrotherly Iraqi people to restore security and stability \nso that they may devote their energies to reconstruction \nefforts while preserving their national and territorial \nunity. \n We wish to take this opportunity to express our \nsatisfaction with the recent positive developments in \nour sisterly country of Lebanon, namely, the election of \nthe country\u2019s President and the establishment of a \nGovernment of national unity. We trust that our \nLebanese brothers will further strengthen that process \nin order to preserve Lebanon\u2019s security and stability. \n Since the change of 7 November 1987, and under \nthe wise leadership of President Zine El Abidine Ben \nAli, President of the Republic of Tunisia, we have \nsucceeded in accomplishing remarkable achievements \nin every area, due to substantial reforms that have \nstrengthened the democratic process, promoted \nmechanisms to protect human rights and culture and \nconsecrated public freedoms. Those reforms have \nenabled us to expand the scope of consultation and \nparticipation by the various sectors of civil society in \nidentifying major trends and determining crucial \nnational options within the framework of the rule of \nlaw and respect for institutions. \n Those reforms have also made it possible to \nachieve many of the Millennium Development Goals, \nwhich has led to the improvement of living standards \nand the well-being of all segments of Tunisian society. \nThose achievements reflect the sound development \nchoices and approaches implemented in Tunisia, which \nhave allowed us to reach a high position on the list of \ncountries with the highest human development \nindicators. That has earned Tunisia the respect of \ninternational financial institutions and the specialized \nagencies of the United Nations. \n In its various development plans, Tunisia has \ncontinued to work for development and modernization \nin order to strengthen its capacity to keep up with \ninternational changes and actively contribute to \nbuilding a world of peace and security and to make \ninternational relations more balanced and based on \nsolidarity. \n Based on its desire to achieve a higher level of \nintegration at the regional and international levels, \nTunisia is working to expand its participation in \nregional and international organizations and to develop \npolitical relations with friendly countries. It also \nendeavouring to expand and diversify its scope of \ncooperation with them so as to establish an effective \npartnership based on mutual respect and common \ninterests. In that regard, Tunisia firmly believes that the \nArab Maghreb Union is a strategic and crucial choice \nfor all peoples of the region. In cooperation and \ncoordination with the other friendly Maghreb \ncountries, we are sparing no effort to speed up the \nestablishment of the Union.  \n \n \n7 08-53129 \n \n Tunisia is also eager to promote joint Arab action \nand to enhance its ability to interact with regional and \ninternational bodies in order to address the changes \ntaking place in the region and to contribute to the \npromotion of the reform and modernization process in \nthe Arab world, in conformity with the decisions of the \n2004 Arab summit held in Tunis. \n With regard to Africa, Tunisia is contributing to \nthe achievement of peace and security in the continent \nby participating in United Nations peacekeeping \noperations and by developing economic relations with \nfriendly African countries. Based on our belief in the \nimportance of joint African action and the fact that the \nAfrican Union is the ideal framework to address the \ncontinent\u2019s problems and achieve the integration to \nwhich our peoples aspire, Tunisia reaffirms its strong \ndetermination to pursue the process decided within the \nframework of the African Union to establish and \noperationalize its institutions, enhance its role in the \nresolution of conflicts and promote the development \nprocess in Africa. \n With regard to Europe, Tunisia attaches strategic \nimportance to its relations with the European Union \n(EU) and is continuing to work to develop those \nrelations on the basis of a solidarity-based partnership \nwith EU countries on the basis of dialogue, cooperation \nand mutual respect. The building of a Euro-\nMediterranean cooperation framework is one of \nTunisia\u2019s priorities and a tenet of its foreign policy. \nTunisia has therefore supported every initiative and \nmechanism that contributes to the promotion of peace, \nsolidarity and development in the Mediterranean \nregion \u2014 including the Barcelona process, the 5+5 \nDialogue, and the Mediterranean Forum. \n Tunisia was among the first countries to welcome \nthe French initiative on the establishment of the Union \nfor the Mediterranean. We are convinced that the future \nof that initiative depends upon an effective partnership \nthat guarantees the active participation of the countries \nof the southern Mediterranean in establishing the \nfoundations of the Union and in the taking of decisions \nof concern to the region. \n Meeting the challenges posed by the new \ninternational situation and the profound changes taking \nplace on the world scene requires us all to step up \nefforts to further entrench the noble universal \nprinciples and humanist values on which the United \nNations was founded. It also requires perseverance in \nenhancing the process of United Nations reform to \nmake its work more efficient and to ensure its active \ncontribution to providing optimum international \nconditions that can help us find collective solutions to \ncommon challenges and current international issues, \nrespond to our peoples\u2019 aspirations for stability, and \nprovide the appropriate conditions for prosperity and \nwell-being in an environment of cooperation and \nsolidarity-based development.

        "file_text": "I offer my congratulations to \nMr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann on his election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \nsession. I can assure him that Nauru will lend its full \ncooperation to him as he leads our work during this \ntime. Also, allow me to take this opportunity to \ncommend his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Srgjan \nKerim, for his leadership of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-second session. \n I wish to reaffirm Nauru\u2019s commitment and \nabiding faith in the ideals and objectives of the United \nNations. We declare our support for the Organization\u2019s \nefforts to resolve the multiple humanitarian, peace and \nsecurity and development challenges confronting our \nworld today. \n I am grateful for this opportunity to address the \nAssembly for the first time as President of the Republic \nof Nauru. I took the challenge of the office fully \ncognizant of my responsibilities to the people of \nNauru. Despite knowing that the road to our economic \nrecovery will be slow and painful, I have committed \nmy Administration to carrying out its duties based on \nthe fundamental principles of democracy, good \ngovernance and sound socio-economic policies. \n At the beginning of this decade, Nauru was at the \nbrink of total economic collapse. Much has been \nachieved to improve our economy and to address the \nresulting social problems. That has been accomplished \nby implementing a range of fiscal, economic and \ngovernance reforms. I am happy to say that Nauru \ntoday has stabilized. We are now at the beginning of a \nrebuilding phase in our history. However, I say this \nwith a degree of caution and regard for the fragility of \nour situation. \n \n \n19 08-51839 \n \n In order to secure Nauru\u2019s recovery and to ensure \nrebuilding and development, we will need ongoing \nassistance from our development partners. We need \ncoordinated assistance targeted at our priorities and in \nline with our strategies so that we may fulfil our \npromise for a better quality of life for my people.  \n Nauru appreciates the financial and material \nassistance from our development partners, in particular \nAustralia, Taiwan, Japan, New Zealand and the \nEuropean Union. We appeal for such cooperation to be \ncontinued in order to strengthen our nation-building \nefforts. \n Since assuming office, I have been determined \nthat Nauru learn from, and not repeat, the mistakes of \nthe past. As a consequence of mismanagement and \ncorruption, past Administrations took Nauru from what \nthen seemed to be a bright future to standing on the \nbrink of collapse. In that process, national reserves and \nassets were all lost, and we have been left with an \nunmanageable burden of domestic and external debt. \nNauru will only ever be able to service a very small \nportion of that debt if we are to ensure ongoing \nrecovery and sustained development. We therefore seek \nthe understanding and consideration of those countries \nand institutions to which we owe money and appeal to \nthem to allow debt forgiveness or major write-downs. \nAt the same time, we are implementing financial, \nlegislative and constitutional measures to ensure that \nthis never happens again. \n Our limited human resources capacity, relative to \nthe enormity of the tasks yet to be accomplished, is a \nfurther impediment to our development goals. \nImproving the quality of education in our schools, \npromoting trade and skills training, certifying existing \nskills and encouraging ongoing professional and job-\nrelated development are therefore high priorities for \nmy Government. Increasing our human resources \ncapacity will not only serve to address the risk to \nsustaining our development, but will increase job \nopportunities for my people, domestically and abroad. \nWith unemployment overall estimated above 30 per \ncent, and worse among our youth, labour migration and \nthe associated remittances must be seen as part of the \nrange of measures to secure Nauru\u2019s recovery and \nfuture. \n I appeal to all developed countries with major \nworkforce requirements to open up their job \nopportunities, reduce barriers to trade in services and \npromote labour mobility. That can contribute far more \nto the development of small States than many other \ntraditional forms of aid. Moreover, such measures can \nbe targeted at specific sectors and activities, for fixed \ntime periods and with certain conditions. The New \nZealand and Australian unskilled labour schemes for \nPacific workers are two prime examples. The United \nStates military expansion in Guam provides another \nopportunity for significant development assistance to \nthe Pacific. We call on the United States for \npreferential access to those opportunities. That will \nrequire special trade, labour and immigration \nconditions. \n We need to build our human resources capacity to \nshift Nauru away from its historical reliance on \ngovernment and public sector employment. Likewise, \nwe must develop the private sector in Nauru. We \nencourage foreign direct investment, and we welcome \nassistance in developing diversity and new industries in \nNauru. My Government is focused on creating the \nenvironment to encourage and facilitate the growth of \nour private sector. \n Nauru\u2019s recovery and future development are \nparticularly vulnerable to external factors. Pacific \nisland developing States are greatly exposed to both \nthe food and the energy security crises. Dependence on \nimported foods, our remoteness and rising fuel and \ntransport costs have made both food and energy \nsecurity particularly critical issues for our region. \n That is especially true for Nauru. Consider our \nsituation: our island home is fringed by a narrow rim, \nwhere my people live just a couple of metres above sea \nlevel. The mining of phosphate on Nauru has left large \npinnacle rocks covering 80 per cent of the island, \nwhich prevents agriculture and contributes to \ndesertification and drought. \n Although we place a high priority on the \nproduction of nutritious traditional staples, arable land \nis just too scarce to achieve a sustainable level of food \nsecurity. The Secretary-General stated in his address \nyesterday (see ) that at this time last year rice \ncost $330 a ton and that today it is now $730. Nauru is \npaying nearly double that. Our imported rice costs us \n$1,340 a ton. Rice and other staples are simply \nbecoming unaffordable. Without urgent attention to our \nregion, it is estimated that an additional 5 per cent of \nour people will slip into poverty because of high food \nprices. \n  \n \n08-51839 20 \n \n We need the world to increase food production. \nThat requires investment in training and in \nimplementing appropriate farming techniques, together \nwith efficient seed and fertilizer distribution. We also \nneed increased access to food. That includes reviewing \ntrade policies on food aid. \n The energy crisis is anther significant external \nfactor that has an impact on our recovery and the \nsecurity of our future. Nauru already cannot afford the \ncost of the fuel required to provide for all its energy \nneeds. As a consequence, my people suffer, with \nscheduled power cuts of up to eight or more hours \nevery single day. That has an impact on parents\u2019 ability \nto care for and feed their children. Without power, \nhouses have no running water, adding to health and \nsanitation problems. Power shedding limits business \ndevelopment and impedes government services and \nproductivity. \n The energy crisis is further disproportionately \nimpacting Nauru in terms of transport services. Sea, \nland and air, passenger and freight: all are fast \nbecoming unaffordable for my people, further isolating \nour island nation and hindering our sustainable \ndevelopment. We need urgent assistance, both to \ndevelop immediate alternative sources of energy and to \naccess economically viable sources of fuel. \n The current reliance on fossil fuels for energy has \nfurther particular significance for the Pacific small \nisland developing States. It has resulted in emissions \nthat are causing sea-level rise and climate change. This \nis not scientific theory: we are experiencing the effects \nright now. \n As with the food crisis, Nauru and the Pacific are \nnot contributors to the causes, but we are particularly \nvulnerable. We will pay the highest costs and are the \nfirst countries to feel the direct consequences. Global \nwarming is predicted conservatively to raise sea levels \nby one metre in this century. That will flood our only \nhabitable land. Our people will be literally trapped \nbetween the rising sea and an ancient, uninhabitable \ncoral field. \n Despite our many challenges, we are working \nhard to create a safe and sustainable haven from the \nrising sea. We must rehabilitate our mined phosphate \nlands and return them to a habitable, arable state. The \ncost of rehabilitating 80 per cent of our island is well \nbeyond our immediate means. Rehabilitation of the \nisland is a high priority, and, as part of climate change \nadaptation, we call for sufficient funding mechanisms, \nincluding support from the United Nations and \nfinancial and private sector institutions, to help restore \nour nation and improve our resilience. \n To address climate change as a world society, we \nneed to meet much of our energy needs through \nrenewable energy sources, and by reducing emissions \nfrom fuels and using cleaner fuels. But as critical as \nthat is for my nation, it is clear to me that the emitting \ncountries have yet to do all they can. We all share the \nsame global climate. It is therefore vital that all \ncountries give much greater impetus to developing \nalternate energy sources, increase investment and \nimplement real measures to address climate change. \n The issue of climate change for Pacific island \nnations is a threat to international peace and security. \nThe preamble to the United Nations Charter stipulates \nthat a primary purpose of the United Nations is to \nmaintain international peace and security. The Security \nCouncil is charged with protecting human rights, \ntogether with ensuring the integrity and security of \nStates. It is the paramount international forum \navailable to Pacific island countries in which to draw \nattention to the dangers that their islands and \npopulations face due to the adverse effects of climate \nchange. \n We do not expect the Security Council to become \ninvolved in the details of the discussions in the context \nof the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change, but we do expect the Security Council \nto keep the matter under continuous review so as to \nensure that all countries contribute to solving the \nclimate change problem and that their efforts match \ntheir resources and capacities. We also expect that the \nSecurity Council will review particularly sensitive \nissues such as the implications of the loss of land and \nresources and the displacement of people for \nsovereignty and international legal rights.  \n Nauru has incorporated the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) into its national \nsustainable development strategy. Pacific island \ncountries, including Nauru, are struggling in many \nareas of the MDGs as a consequence of the recent fuel \nand food crises and the effects of climate change. \n We lament the fact that the gap between promise \nand implementation continues to frustrate our \nachievement of the full range of internationally agreed \ndevelopment goals that are particularly relevant to \n \n \n21 08-51839 \n \nsmall island developing States. It is extremely \ndistressing that those goals were determined by \nconsensus of the international community yet \ndeveloped countries have yet to contribute the 0.7 per \ncent of gross national income committed to assist \ndeveloping countries in meeting their targets. \n On the eve of the high-level event on the \nMillennium Development Goals, may I call on the \nUnited Nations once more to rededicate itself to \nmaking development one of the highest priorities of the \nOrganization. I would remind the United Nations of its \ncommitment to open a total of eight new offices in \nPacific island countries. We hope that the Organization \nwill not waiver in its commitment to support our \nnational priorities in meeting the MDGs and provide us \nwith the urgently needed international civil servants to \nhelp with our pursuit of sustainable development and \npoverty alleviation. \n Sixty-three years after the United Nations was \nfounded on the noble ideals of establishing a peaceful, \nfree and tolerant global order, the world community \nstill suffers from the scourges of war, poverty, \noppression and discrimination, even as it faces today\u2019s \ncolossal global challenges that threaten our very \nexistence. If the United Nations is to remain devoted to \nthe ideals upon which it was founded, it is absolutely \ncritical that it be reformed through the revitalization \nand empowerment of the General Assembly. If the \nUnited Nations is to remain a defender of human rights \nand international peace, it is crucial that the Security \nCouncil be expanded to better reflect geo-political \nrealities of the modern world. That would mean giving \npermanent seats to Japan, India, Germany and Brazil. \n If the United Nations prides itself on being an \ninclusive Organization that champions the rights of \neveryone, it cannot continue to deny the fundamental \nright of Taiwan\u2019s 23 million people to participate in the \nspecialized agencies of the United Nations. It is clear \nto all of us that cross-Strait relations have been \nimproving since May 2008 and that leaders from both \nsides have openly shown a willingness to work \ntogether to create a positive atmosphere. It is now time \nfor the United Nations to find a solution to the \nexclusion of Taiwan. Only by allowing Taiwan to \nparticipate meaningfully in the specialized agencies of \nthe United Nations can the principle of universality and \ndemocratization of the Organization be fulfilled, and \nregional peace and prosperity ensured. \n It is very simple and straightforward: we have \nvowed to the people, now let us keep our promise.

That \ninternational bill of rights contains a forceful reminder \nthat force can and will be checked, and that the prime \npurpose of our work here is to keep the strong just and \nthe weak secure.  \n We will celebrate the anniversary of the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights later this fall, \nand we shall be guided by its wording in everything we \ndo. The rights and opportunities of individuals, groups \nand countries are fundamental, and the United Nations \nis at the top of the system that oversees those superior \nrules.  \n When I come here every year, I am struck by the \nbroad span of items that are discussed in the United \nNations. We need to ask, are we focusing on the truly \nessential, most serious issues of our times? This year, \nwe left on the table the unfinished business of the Doha \nRound of trade negotiations. The break-up of those \ntalks has stalled our efforts to provide billions of \npeople with increased economic opportunity. It is \ncrucial that we restart this process. \n We face a global food crisis. The Secretary-\nGeneral has described the effect of that crisis on \nhundreds of millions of people who do not know if \nthey will have enough to eat tomorrow.  \n Climate and energy are among the biggest issues \nof our time. They must be on the top of our agenda.  \n These big issues are also all about poverty, \ninequity and gender. Leadership is called for \u2014 \nleadership here at the United Nations. \n I believe we face not only a food crisis, an energy \ncrisis, a climate crisis, a trade-talk crisis, but a larger, \ndecision-making crisis.  \n We have great institutional capacity. We discuss, \nwe deliberate and we study, but we are too often unable \nto decide. Often, those countries that want the least are \nthe countries that decide the most. Those that want the \nleast amount of change and progress are able to slow \nus down and block decisions. Now also the Security \nCouncil seems to face difficulties after many good \nyears. \n All countries, all Member States share the \nresponsibility for the functioning of the United Nations \nas a decision-making body that serves us, that is for \npeople, that solves global problems and that allows all \npeople to benefit from the rights with which they were \nborn and which are written in the Declaration on \nHuman Rights. \n To become more effective, the United Nations \nmust reform. The Secretary-General addressed this \nissue with strong conviction on Tuesday (5th meeting). \n \n \n45 08-51851 \n \nWe should support him in that process. I am vesting \nhope in the ongoing deliberation on system-wide \ncoherence. I co-chaired the High-level Panel on \nSystem-wide Coherence, and I am heartened that more \nand more countries seem to be opting in on the \u201cOne \nUN\u201d approach. \n Some organizations, funds and programmes are \nmaking efficiency gains. They are truly exceptions. \nStill, Norway is committed to using the United Nations \nas the arena for our most important international \npolicymaking activities. We allocate 0.98 per cent of \nour national income to official development aid. We \nare the seventh largest contributor to the United \nNations in absolute terms. That is why we will be \nkeeping a watchful eye on how the funds and \nprogrammes manage their resources and our \ncontributions. We and other donor countries will have \nto require improved accountability, transparency and a \nresults-based management system. \n Reaching the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs) is our foremost priority. We have assumed a \nspecial responsibility regarding MDG 4 on child \nmortality and MDG 5 on maternal health. We must all \ndedicate the next seven years to the bottom billion. \nSeveral leaders joined me today in presenting a report \nfrom the Global Campaign for the Health Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. We also presented a plan for the \nnext seven years \u2014 an exceptional plan that can allow \nus to save 10 million lives. If we succeed, we will \nbuild more sustainable societies, reduce conflict \npotential and provide a better basis for growth. \n We are making progress towards the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. Poverty is being reduced. Child \nmortality is falling. But we have not made any progress \nat all with regard to maternal health. That is appalling. \nThere can be only one reason for this awful situation, \nand that is a persistent neglect of women in a world \ndominated by men. Just think of all the millions of \nyoung girls and young women who know, and who fear \nand dread, that giving life may cause their own death. \nAll this human tragedy is avoidable by simple means, \nbut we have not taken the problem seriously. \n Money does not seem to be a problem when the \nproblem is money. Let us look for a moment at what is \nhappening on Wall Street and in financial markets \naround the world. There, unsound investment threatens \nthe homes and the jobs of the middle class. Something \nis fundamentally wrong when money seems to be \nabundant but funds for investment in people seem so \nshort in supply. Market mechanisms will not fund \nschools in Afghanistan, hospitals in Rwanda, vaccines \ngiven in the slums and the ghettos. That kind of \ninvestment requires political will and decisions. And \nwe must provide the framework that will direct \nresources towards those ends. \n When Robert Kennedy was running for president \n40 years ago, he said in a speech that a country\u2019s health \ncannot be measured simply by its economic output. \nThat output, he said, \u201ccounts special locks for our \ndoors and the jails for those who break them \u2026 yet ... \ndoes not allow for the health of our children, the \nquality of their education or the joy of their play\u201d. And \nstill I would add that health, education and the joy of \nplay form the capital that must grow and spread. Then, \nand only then, will we reach more equal levels of \ndevelopment and opportunity. \n I have come here directly from a visit to the great \nrainforests of the Amazon, in Brazil, a country whose \npresident is committed to lifting his people out of \ndestitution. That has been President Lula\u2019s leitmotif \nthroughout his political life. \n Norway is a fortunate and developed country. \nFrom that follows a moral responsibility. We pursue \nwider development goals and seek to generate positive \nincentives for change and improve climate change \npolicies.  \n Efforts against deforestation may give us the \nlargest, quickest and cheapest reductions in greenhouse \ngas emissions. In the years leading up to 2015 Norway \nwill contribute up to $1 billion to reduce deforestation \nin the Amazon. This contribution makes Norway the \nfirst contributor to the Amazon Fund. The size of \nNorway\u2019s contribution will depend on how successful \nBrazil will be in reducing deforestation. \n In Bali last December, Norway announced a \nmajor initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \nfrom deforestation and forest degradation. \nDeforestation must be included in a new global \nagreement on climate change. Addressing climate \nchange in a fashion that will stand the test of time and \nthe scrutiny of future generations ultimately boils down \nto us versus the sand in the hourglass. It is a test of \nmaturity for international cooperation. \n Finally, I would like to say a few words about a \nfellow Nordic country. For the first time since \n  \n \n08-51851 46 \n \nbecoming a Member State of the United Nations in \n1946 \u2014 after 62 years \u2014 Iceland is a candidate for the \nSecurity Council. Iceland\u2019s candidature reflects the \nlong-standing commitment of all the Nordic countries \nto international peace and the vital work of the United \nNations. Iceland enjoys the active support of its \npartners in the Nordic group: Denmark, Finland, \nSweden and Norway. I urge members to take that into \naccount. "

He now lives in \nquiet retirement at the grand old age of 53. \n The King has shown that, if leaders themselves \nare committed to democracy, the transition can be \nsmooth and peaceful. Likewise, if leaders elected to \ngovern believe in it, democracy provides the best \nmeans to serve the people. That is the conviction with \nwhich my Government will fulfil the powerful mandate \nthat the people have given to us. \n As a representative of a country that is deeply \ncommitted to multilateralism and that believes firmly \nin the indispensability of the United Nations system, I \nseek the indulgence of the Assembly as I offer \nBhutan\u2019s perspective from the high Himalayas of our \ntroubled world today. \n We are confronted with a host of serious \nchallenges that are testing the relevance of the United \nNations and the resolve of its Member States to work \ntogether. Natural disasters, food, fuel and financial \ncrises, deepening poverty, failing States, dwindling \nwater resources, diseases, human trafficking and even \nmaritime lawlessness afflict our society. And then there \nis terrorism and extremism of the most barbaric and \ncowardly kind, using the weak and the deranged to kill \nand maim the innocent. \n All those challenges threaten to undermine what \nwe have achieved collectively and as individual States. \nThey directly thwart our slow progress in the pursuit of \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which I \nbelieve are among the most laudable consensual \nagreements achieved by this Assembly to bring about a \nmore just and equitable world, indeed, a more civilized \nworld. \n Bhutan does not look at those developments as \nseparate, disconnected events. Rather, we see them as \ndirectly interconnected symptoms of a larger and \ndeeper malaise that threatens our collective well-being \nand survival. Responding to each of the challenges \nseparately will most probably be useful in the short \nterm, but piecemeal efforts will not lead to permanent \nsolutions. We need to treat the disease beyond the \nsymptoms. And the disease, we believe, has to do with \nour way of life, which is simply not rational and \nsustainable. \n One does not need to be an economist to \nunderstand that the oil crisis, soaring price of metals \nand diminishing water reserves have to do with the fact \nthat for too long we have been exploiting and wasting \nour scarce natural resources. At the very least, these \ndevelopments are market reactions and attempts to \nreflect the true value of these resources. \n As for the financial crisis, it is becoming quite \nclear that its main cause lies in our culture of living \nbeyond our means, of private profiteering, of \nsocializing risks. Unfortunately, the possible solution \nseems to lie in transferring our debt to future \ngenerations, who are not here to argue against it. \n It is not difficult to see how all these crises are \nthe result of a way of life that is dictated by the \npowerful ethics of consumerism in a world of finite \nresources. Our life is all about fear of not having \nenough, about wanting more and doing better than our \ndear neighbour and friend. We spend and consume far \nbeyond our means and those of generations unborn. \n As we go on expanding our economies by \nextracting natural resources, raising productivity, \nincreasing consumption and discharging immeasurable \nvolumes of polluting waste, the climate is changing. \nStriking unpredictably, unseasonably and with greater \nfury and frequency, natural disasters such as drought, \ncyclones, hurricanes, floods and landslides are \ndestroying life, property and crops. Weather patterns \nhave changed and continue to change, with far more \nprofound implications for our civilization than we can \nfathom. We even wonder whether earthquakes and \ntsunamis may have something to do with climate \nchange. \n Yesterday, we huddled together to find solutions \nto the food crisis and the danger of growing hunger in a \nworld where already too many are starving. Diseases \nabound and new epidemics threaten humanity, other \nlife forms and crops even as medicine and technology \ncombine to conspire against mortality. Are these not \nsignals from a planet grossly abused? Could these not \nbe pleas to mend our ways and to search for a more \nsustainable way of life? \n \n \n25 08-52272 \n \n Deepening poverty, not unlike the food crisis, is \nalso a sign of the disintegration of communities. As \ncommunities die, so does the spirit of sharing, \nborrowing and giving amid good neighbourliness in \ntimes of need, as opposed to competing and making \ngains at the cost of community, neighbour and even \none\u2019s own family. It is about the failure of human \nrelationships, including between and among States. \nThis, I believe, lies at the root of the poverty, hunger, \ninstability and insecurity that plague much of the world \ntoday. \n These multiple crises bring into sharp focus the \nshameful inequities of our society, which fails to share \nand to distribute the enormous wealth it has created to \nsatisfy man\u2019s insatiable greed. People suffer from \nhunger, thirst and exposure to the elements and die \nwithout treatment not because we do not have enough \nfood, water, clothes or medicine, but because we do not \nhave the will to share and the care to distribute. \n Only yesterday, I was wondering how many tons \nof food and medicine must be taken off the shelves of \nManhattan stores and put into the incinerator at the end \nof each day as they become stale or reach their date of \nexpiry. On the other hand, even to this day, few \ndeveloped countries have fulfilled their pledge to share \nless than 1 per cent of their gross national product \n(GNP) with developing countries. Likewise, the \npharmaceutical companies have convincing arguments \nto offer against lowering the cost of medicines. \n We need to wake up from our narcissistic slumber \nand self-indulgence and realize that economic well-\nbeing is not human well-being. We must break away \nfrom the shackles of the powerful forces of the market. \nFor that matter, could the unravelling of the market-\nbased economy, as evident in the financial crisis, be a \nglimpse of the truth that mindless and irresponsible \neconomic growth and expansion cannot go on? It is \nneither sustainable nor fair to future generations. \nAbove all, we could be condemning our own selves to \nan old age of burdensome debt and regret. \n That brings us to the question of whether our \nfundamentals are sound. Is the GDP-led growth that \nhas served as our measure of progress good enough for \nthe future? What are the foundations of our \ncivilizations and the values that guide us? As we get \nricher and live by the terms that we have set for \nourselves, are we truly becoming more civilized, or are \nwe trapped in a downward spiral of de-civilization? \n I ask again: does economic growth translate as \nhuman development? Are we mutating to become \nsenseless robots programmed to be materially \nproductive, to earn more, to want more, to consume \nmore and more of what we do not need and will \nultimately destroy us? \n As human beings, should we not search for and \nbe driven by higher values? Do we not have needs \nbeyond material ones, beyond that of the body alone? \nCan we conceptualize a holistic alternative paradigm \nfor meaningful and sustainable development that places \nthe well-being of the individual and community at the \ncentre and gives cause for true happiness, as opposed \nto fleeting pleasures? \n I am pleased to submit that many academic \ninstitutions and researchers across the world are \nengaged in such a search and are making progress. The \nlatest to join is the Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development, which has hosted a \nseries of regional and world conferences to develop \nindicators to measure true human progress. \n My country, Bhutan, is one such entity. While \nbeing actively involved as a partner in the global \nefforts in this regard, we have pursued a unique \ndevelopment path, guided by our former King\u2019s \nphilosophy of Gross National Happiness (GNH), since \nthe early 1970s. GNH is based on the belief that \nhappiness is the single most important goal and \npurpose in life for every individual and that the end of \ndevelopment must be the promotion and enhancement \nof happiness. It must, therefore, we believe, be the \nresponsibility of the State to create an enabling \nenvironment within which its citizens can pursue \nhappiness. \n The concept emphasizes a balanced life, \nmatching the material needs of the body with the \nspiritual, psychological and emotional needs of the \nmind. To that end, the Royal Government structured its \ndevelopment programmes around four broad themes, or \npillars, that constitute a paradigm for holistic and \nsustainable development. These are: sustainable and \nequitable socio-economic development, not growth; \nenvironmental conservation; the promotion of culture; \nand good governance. Since the 1970s we have never \nwavered from that path, thanks greatly to the \ngenerosity and support of our development partners. \nThe former King never faltered, sacrificing his own \n  \n \n08-52272 26 \n \nreign to leave the legacy of a unique democracy and a \ncountry that is peaceful, progressive and happy. \n I urge the members of the Assembly to reflect on \nthose and other considerations so that such crises as have \nnow stricken us may never reappear, so that we can return \neach year to this Assembly and find reasons to smile and \nto be happy. To that end, Mr. President, please be assured \nof Bhutan\u2019s fullest support for and cooperation with you \nand the Secretary-General."

        "file_text": "It is with great \npleasure that I associate the delegation of Barbados \nwith previous speakers who have congratulated the \nPresident on his election to the presidency of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-third session. We are \nparticularly proud to see a fellow member of the Latin \nAmerican and Caribbean group assume that high \noffice, and I pledge to him the full support of the \nBarbadian delegation as he carries out his most \nimportant mandate. We wish also to commend his \npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Kerim, for leading the \nAssembly over the past year through complex \ndiscussions on a range of global challenges.  \n I also extend the good wishes of the Barbadian \nGovernment to the Secretary-General. We offer him \nour continued support as he leads the United Nations at \nthis critical juncture in world affairs and seeks to \nidentify meaningful pathways to progress for Member \nStates with differing interests and national priorities.  \n On 15 January 2008, the citizens of Barbados, in \nexercise of their democratic right, which they hold \nsacred, voted in general elections to bring into office \nthe Government of the Democratic Labour Party, which \nI have the honour to lead. It is a tribute to the good \nsense of the Barbadian people and to the maturity of \nour democracy that in our country free and fair \nelections take place every five years and that the \ntransition to a new Administration is seamless, orderly \nand peaceful. That exemplary process affords me the \nopportunity to address the Assembly for the first time \ntoday as Prime Minister of Barbados. I am humbled by \nthe confidence the Barbadian people have shown in me \nand am conscious of the responsibility that now falls \nupon my Government to respond to the overwhelming \ncall for change that brought us to office.  \n Barbados is a stable, progressive small State \nwhose high human development rating can be \nattributed to the emphasis successive generations have \nplaced on the development of social capital. Our \ncountry is not endowed with abundant natural \nresources, and it is therefore our human resources that \nare our greatest asset.  \n Within our well-developed social democratic \nsystem, the new Barbadian Government will place the \ngreatest priority on policies that nurture the talents and \nenterprise of individuals and continue to assure our \npeople universal access to quality education, health \ncare, adequate housing and decent working conditions, \nall within an environment of respect for human rights \nand the rule of law.  \n We are well aware that we are now called upon to \ndo that in a time of unprecedented global, economic \nand social volatility, which is shaking the foundations \nof societies far larger and more powerful than our own. \nIn these circumstances, my Government\u2019s immediate \nfocus must be on policies that seek to address the high \ncost of living, which is driven largely by high energy \nand food prices, to reduce the levels of domestic and \ninternational debt and to stabilize the national economy \nwhile keeping it competitive. Barbadians are a resilient \nand resourceful people. We have weathered \ninternational storms before, and with strong and \ncompetent leadership we will do so again.  \n In international affairs, Barbados cherishes the \nreputation it holds as a successful small State whose \npositions are based on principle and whose actions \nreflect a profound respect for democratic values. In its \nengagement with the rest of the world, the \nGovernment, which I have the honour to lead, pledges \n  \n \n08-52265 20 \n \nto uphold and carry forward the proud traditions of the \nfather of our independence and national hero, the Right \nExcellent Errol Barrow.  \n His address to this Assembly as we joined the \nranks of sovereign States remains as relevant today as \nit was when it was first delivered 42 years ago. His \nclear definition of the parameters of Barbados\u2019 foreign \npolicy is the creed by which our Government and \npeople continue to live. It is perhaps appropriate if I \nquote his words directly, \n\u201cWe will support genuine efforts at world peace, \nbecause our society is stable. We will strenuously \nassist in the uprooting of vestigial imperialism, \nbecause our institutions are free. We will press \nfor the rapid economic growth of all \nunderdeveloped countries, because we are busily \nengaged in building up our own. \n \u201cWe have no quarrels to pursue and we \nparticularly insist that we do not regard any \nMember State as our natural opponent. We shall \nnot involve ourselves in sterile ideological \nwranglings because we are exponents, not of the \ndiplomacy of power, but of the diplomacy of \npeace and prosperity. We will not regard any \ngreat Power as necessarily right in a given \ndispute unless we are convinced of this, yet at the \nsame time we will not view the great Powers with \nperennial suspicion merely on account of their \nsize, their wealth, or their nuclear potential. We \nwill be friends of all, satellites of none.\u201d \n(A/PV.1487, paras. 76 and 78) \n The position of the new Government of Barbados \nwill be guided by that enduring philosophy. Because \nwe are a small island, we will champion the issues of \ngreatest concern to small island developing States. We \nwill argue for the need for special recognition of their \ninherent vulnerabilities and for sensitive responses to \nthe critical challenges, such as climate change and \nsusceptibility to natural disasters, which constrain their \nsustainable development. \n Because a one-size-fits-all mentality threatens to \nfurther marginalize us in the new international trading \narrangements, we will continue to show leadership \nwithin the group of small vulnerable economies in \nadvocacy efforts to create a regime of special and \ndifferential treatment to cater to our unique \ncircumstances. \n Because we are a middle-income developing \ncountry deemed too successful to qualify for \nconcessionary financing but too high-risk for \nfavourable terms on the capital markets, we will join \nwith like-minded colleagues to lobby for adequate \nsupport mechanisms to ensure that our development \nprocess is not derailed. Because we are a Caribbean \ncountry, we will partner with our fellow Caribbean \nStates to protect our shared patrimony \u2014 the \nCaribbean Sea \u2014 from over-exploitation and \nenvironmental degradation and to secure our borders \nfrom the threats of drug and arms trafficking, money-\nlaundering and terrorism. We are fervent advocates of \nthe notion of the Caribbean as a zone of peace, and we \nview with great concern any action, from whatever \nquarter, that seeks to reintroduce the anachronism of \ncold-war rivalry into our peaceful regional community \nof nations.  \n Finally, because we are a responsible member of \nthe international community, and because we believe in \nthe positive role that small States can play in advancing \nthe cause of international peace and equitable social \nand economic development, we rededicate ourselves to \nthe building of an international system that operates on \nthe principle of multilateralism and that respects the \nsovereign equality of States and the tenets of genuine \nnon-alignment. \n Whatever semantics are used, there is little doubt \nthat we have entered an international economic crisis \nof grave proportions which threatens to derail the \nprogress of many States and to worsen the already \ndesperate circumstances of the most vulnerable among \nus. The volatility of oil prices makes managing the \neconomic affairs of our countries a daily challenge, and \nthe escalating cost of basic foods has had immense \npolitical and social consequences throughout the world. \nThe signals could not be clearer. Investment in \nrenewable sources of energy such as wind, solar, \ngeothermal and biofuels is imperative. National efforts \nwill certainly not be sufficient, and we will therefore \nneed to forge global partnerships, with increased \ninvestment in research and development and \nmeaningful incentives to reverse our excessive \ndependence on fossil fuels. \n The issue of food security is now at the centre of \nour national and international policy agenda. The \nmeasures proposed by United Nations agencies and \nthose agreed upon at the High-level Conference on \nWorld Food Security, held in Rome, must now find \n \n \n21 08-52265 \n \nexpression in specific programmes and projects. In \naddition to immediate humanitarian relief for the most \nseverely affected countries, policies must be put in \nplace urgently to boost production and productivity in \nagriculture and to correct distortions of the market that \njeopardize the global supply of food. Crisis situations \nare often catalysts for creative national action. But the \nenormity of the current crisis means that for many \ndeveloping countries national action will have a limited \nimpact unless it is accompanied by a supportive \nframework of international cooperation and the \nhonouring by the donor community of past \ncommitments for increased resources for development. \nA successful outcome to November\u2019s Doha Review \nConference on Financing for Development must \ninclude a genuine global partnership to provide the \nrequired financial resources for the achievement of \ninternationally agreed development goals, including \nthe Millennium Development Goals. \n The availability of additional financial resources \nis not, however, the only requirement. Meaningful \nchanges must also be made that will allow for a greater \nvoice, representation and effective participation of \ndeveloping countries in international decision-making \nwithin the international financial institutions. The \ncauses of the present global financial crisis are firmly \nrooted in the failure of the international community to \nreform an undemocratic and antiquated system of \ninternational economic governance that has not kept \npace with the rapid growth of global interdependence. \nBarbados believes that those responsible for the crisis, \nand who also created, controlled and manipulated the \nglobal financial system for their own advantage, cannot \nnow be trusted to heal it. Developing countries must \ndemonstrate leadership in the search for a lasting \nsolution to the global financial crisis and insist that any \nexercise to institute reforms must strictly adhere to the \nprinciples of openness, transparency and inclusiveness, \nwith the United Nations taking the lead. \n The Economic and Social Council must be \nempowered to play a more meaningful role in global \neconomic decision-making, consistent with the \nmandate entrusted to it by the United Nations Charter. \nEven with the recent strengthening of the Council, its \ncurrent responsibilities fall short of the role envisaged \nfor it by the founders of this Organization. As a \nmember of the Economic and Social Council, Barbados \nis ready to work with other member States to end the \nmarginalization of the Council from the global economic \npolicy-setting and decision-making processes.  \n The Economic and Social Council is by no means \nthe only principal organ of the United Nations that is in \nurgent need of reform. The Security Council as it exists \nis not representative of the current realities and \ndynamics of international politics and must be \nreformed to reflect the situation today. We join those \nwho have called for the start of intergovernmental \nnegotiations on Security Council reform during the \nsixty-third session. \n As Prime Minister of a small island developing \nState in a region at the epicentre of the global climate \ncrisis, it is my hope that the current international \nefforts within the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to respond \nto the scientific evidence on climate change prioritize \nthe concerns and needs of these vulnerable developing \ncountries, which are already being affected by the \ndangerous impacts of climate change. Failure to take \nurgent, ambitious and decisive action would be nothing \nshort of reckless indifference. \n In the wake of the destruction and devastation of \nthe 2008 hurricane season, we in the Caribbean are \nacutely aware of the precarious nature of our very \nsurvival, as well as the urgency attached to action to \nmitigate the causes of climate change. At the \nCopenhagen Climate Change Conference in 2009 we \nmust deliver an agreement that is comprehensive, \nambitious and inclusive, which adopts a package of \nmitigation-related activities that will ensure that long-\nterm temperature increases are stabilized well below \n2 Celsius degrees above pre-industrial levels, and also \nprovides small island developing States and other \nvulnerable developing countries with new, additional, \npredictable and easily accessible sources of funding for \nadaptation. Time is not on our side. \n During the sixty-third session the Assembly will \nconsider a draft resolution entitled \u201cTowards the \nsustainable development of the Caribbean Sea for \npresent and future generations\u201d, which will again seek \nto gain international support for the initiative of States \nmembers of the Association of Caribbean States to \nhave the Caribbean Sea recognized as a special area \nwithin the context of sustainable development. Since \nthe adoption by the General Assembly of resolution \n61/197 two years ago, the States members of the \nAssociation of Caribbean States have made significant \n  \n \n08-52265 22 \n \nstrides in developing the institutional and legal \nframework for Caribbean Sea governance and have \ncollaborated with various civil society stakeholders on \nmeasures to ensure sustainable management and \nconservation of our most precious natural resource. We \nlook forward to continued assistance from the \ninternational community in helping us to achieve the \nobjectives of that initiative. \n The Government of Barbados looks forward to \nmaintaining the excellent relations that we have \nenjoyed over these many years with the United \nNations. We pledge to continue to uphold the principles \nof its Charter and will do everything to assist in \nmaintaining an international system and community in \nwhich all nations can make their own contribution to \nthe betterment of mankind.

        "file_text": "The United Nations was \nbuilt on common values and norms. The United \nNations Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights and other key documents not only express those \nvalues and norms, but also constitute international law, \nthe foundation upon which every attempt to build a \nlasting peace must rest. Rules of international law \napply equally to all States, large and small. According \nto the United Nations Charter, \u201cMembers shall settle \ntheir international disputes by peaceful means\u201d and \n\u201crefrain \u2026 from the threat or use of force against the \nterritorial integrity or political independence of any \nState\u201d. We look to the United Nations, and in particular \nto the Security Council, to uphold those rules. The five \npermanent members have a special responsibility in \nthat regard. \n Russia\u2019s invasion of Georgia \u2014 a sovereign State \nand a Member of the United Nations \u2014 using massive \nmilitary force, is a clear violation of the United \nNations Charter. Russia\u2019s subsequent recognition of \nparts of Georgia as independent States stands in stark \ncontradiction to international law, including principles \nand commitments agreed in the context of the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, \nincluding the Helsinki Final Act. Sweden unreservedly \nsupports the territorial integrity of Georgia. We call on \nRussia to fulfil its obligations in accordance with the \nsix-point plan brokered by the European Union and to \nwithdraw all forces to their positions before 7 August. \n This year marks the sixtieth anniversary of the \nadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights. While celebrating the achievements, we \nrecognize the challenges that remain. The Declaration\u2019s \nhistoric article 21 on democracy, which reads in part: \n\u201cEveryone has the right to take part in the government \nof his country, directly or through freely chosen \nrepresentatives\u201d, is a perfect illustration of that point. \nSince 1948, millions of people have gained the \nfreedom of democratic choice, while millions of others \nare still denied that freedom. \n Sweden places a strong emphasis on democracy \nand human rights in our development cooperation. Our \nefforts to make the Universal Declaration and other \nhuman rights norms a reality everywhere must also \ninclude the United Nations itself. Human rights should \nbe an essential part of all United Nations activities, \nincluding conflict prevention, peacekeeping and \npeacebuilding efforts, as well as in the work of the \nfunds and programmes. \n To fight terrorism is to defend human rights. \nHuman rights are the key also to countering terrorism. \nMeasures against terrorism will be effective and \nlegitimate only when they are taken within a clear \nframework of international law. It is essential that the \nSecurity Council have fair and clear procedures in \nmatters of listing and delisting when targeted sanctions \nhave been imposed. The fight against impunity has to \ncontinue. We must support the International Criminal \nCourt. Bringing to justice those responsible for the \nmost serious crimes is vital to building sustainable \npeace. At the same time, justice should be pursued in a \nmanner that supports peace processes. \n States have a responsibility to protect people \nwithin their own borders from massive violations of \n  \n \n08-53141 48 \n \ntheir human rights. If a State is not capable of doing so, \nit should ask the international community \u2014 the \nUnited Nations or regional organizations \u2014 for help. \nWe must all be ready to assist. Not long ago, the \nUnited Nations and the African Union were able to \nhelp Kenya to prevent a frightening crisis from turning \ninto the worst possible nightmare. If a State is \nunwilling to protect people within its borders, the \nSecurity Council must assume its responsibility to \nprotect. We need a Security Council that is ready to \nshoulder that responsibility and to work together, \nbecause unilateral action might run the risk of \naggravating the problem and undermining international \nlaw and legitimacy. \n Violence against women and girls is a major \nobstacle to the full enjoyment of human rights and \nfundamental freedoms by all people. Efforts to combat \nsuch violence must not end with a peace agreement. \nWe must ensure that women have full access to justice, \nalso in the transition from war to peace. Last June, the \nlandmark Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on \nwomen and peace and security was followed up by \nSecurity Council resolution 1820 (2008) on sexual \nviolence. It reaffirms that rape and other forms of \nsexual violence can be war crimes or crimes against \nhumanity. It obliges Governments to combat such \nbehaviour by all necessary means. Although the United \nNations has made considerable efforts in that area, \nmore needs to be done, both in the field and at \nHeadquarters. \n The European Union and the Council of Europe \nhave established 10 October as the European Day \nagainst the Death Penalty. I hope that before too long \nwe shall be able to agree on a United Nations day \nagainst that inhumane form of punishment. \n We face a growing danger of nuclear \nproliferation. Iran, though not the only case, is the \nmost worrisome at present. Recent developments in the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea also give cause \nfor concern. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons (NPT) is the cornerstone of \nnon-proliferation and the foundation for the pursuit of \nnuclear disarmament. Sweden is strongly committed to \nupholding and further strengthening existing \nmultilateral disarmament and non-proliferation \nobligations. The nuclear Powers have taken on special \ncommitments within the NPT process. In order not to \nundermine the Treaty, they must demonstrate their \nreadiness to substantially reduce their nuclear arsenals. \n More efforts are needed, in particular in Africa, to \nachieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \nby 2015. Therefore, Sweden is increasing its support to \nAfrica. We encourage others to do the same, as well as \nto deliver on the aid commitments already made. In the \nlong run, the rise in the price of energy and food could \nhave a positive effect on development in the \nagricultural sector. In the short run, however, it could \njeopardize the fulfilment of the MDGs and threaten \nprogress already made. Communicable diseases, not \nleast HIV/AIDS, are another obstacle to the \nachievement of the MDGs that we must address. The \nAccra meeting on the Paris Declaration took important \nsteps towards better aid effectiveness and reconfirmed \nthe shared responsibility for development. However, \nmuch more must be done in areas such as democratic \ngovernance and human rights, the role of women in \ndevelopment, and the impact of global climate change. \n That is a challenge for developing and developed \ncountries alike. The world economy is facing \nturbulence and uncertainty. A more open trade regime \nwould bring increased economic growth and \ninterdependence, which in turn would have a \nsignificant stabilizing effect. Trade policy is one of the \ntools to help developing countries become integrated \ninto the world economy and reap the benefits of trade. \nTrade reforms are fundamental for sustainable \neconomic growth and poverty reduction. We regret the \nfailure to reach a breakthrough in the World Trade \nOrganization Doha Round. We all share a \nresponsibility to resolve the few remaining issues. \n The United Nations system \u2014 both in the field \nand at Headquarters \u2014 must be reformed in order to \nensure coherence and effectiveness. Reforms must also \nenable the United Nations to work more effectively on \ngender issues and for the promotion of equal rights and \nopportunities. \n The United Nations needs to bolster its capacity \nto handle the unprecedented demand for peace \noperations. Cooperation with regional organizations \nand arrangements, such as the European Union, NATO \nand the African Union, is essential. \n Sweden strongly supports efforts to bridge crisis \nmanagement and long-term development in post-\nconflict situations. By chairing the Burundi \nconfiguration of the Peacebuilding Commission, we \nhope to be able to contribute to further developing the \nrole of the United Nations in peacebuilding. \n \n \n49 08-53141 \n \n Sweden was proud to host the first annual review \nmeeting of the International Compact with Iraq. The \npartnership between the Government of Iraq and the \nUnited Nations is crucial. It is therefore imperative to \ncontinue strengthening the role of the United Nations \nin Iraq. \n It is the poorest who are the hardest hit by climate \nchange. Therefore, Sweden is providing additional \nresources for a special climate initiative in our \ndevelopment cooperation. It aims to contribute \neffectively to long-term efforts to combat climate \nchange and its effects in developing countries. \n Climate change is a crucial challenge facing our \nplanet. We recognize our responsibility to take concrete \nsteps at home and to show the leadership necessary to \nachieve broad and long-term international consensus. \nOne year from now, Sweden will hold the presidency \nof the European Union. In that capacity, Sweden will \ntake on a special responsibility regarding efforts to put \nan international climate agreement in place by 2009 in \nCopenhagen. The key to a successful conclusion of \nthose negotiations, however, rests with each and every \none of us. \n It is time to once again remind ourselves of our \nmutual commitments and to stand up for the universal \nprinciples underpinning international cooperation. It is \ntime to muster the political will to reassert our shared \nvalues. It is time to show that we are determined to \nwork jointly to foster peace, democracy and \ndevelopment worldwide. "

        "file_text": "I wish to \ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann on his election as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-third session. I wish him every \nsuccess in leading us as we work to strengthen the role \n \n \n15 08-53135 \n \nof the United Nations in promoting international \nrelations in the spirit of the Charter, which is the most \nimportant international pillar of the rule of law. I also \nthank his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Srgjan \nKerim, for his good efforts to ensure the success of the \nprevious session. In addition, I wish to commend the \nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his efforts to \nreform the Organization so that it can play a more \neffective role in addressing emerging global \nchallenges. \n In his introductory statement on 16 September \n2008 (see A/63/PV.1), the day he assumed the \npresidency of the Assembly, Mr. d\u2019Escoto Brockmann \nreferred to many important political and humanitarian \nissues. For example, he mentioned the need to improve \nUnited Nations organs to enable them to adapt to the \nmajor changes that have occurred in the international \nsphere in the 63 years since the Organization was \nestablished following the Second World War. He also \nstated that the Organization should be improved so that \nit can better address the accelerated changes that have \ntaken place since the end of the cold war and the era of \npolarization \u2014 changes whose effects have begun to be \nfelt over the past two decades.  \n In that context, Jordan believes it is essential to \nrevitalize the role of the General Assembly as \nenvisaged in the Charter, so that the international \ndecision-making process can be further democratized. \nJordan supports the trend towards rebalancing the \nrelationship between the General Assembly and the \nSecurity Council. \n A week ago, at the 5th meeting, the Secretary-\nGeneral introduced his report on the work of the \nOrganization (A/63/1), in which he assessed the world \nsituation. In the report, he made clear that we face \nchallenges that encompass all human activities, \ntranscending individual countries and regions. Hence, \nwe must examine the dangers posed by those \nchallenges \u2014 many of which have their roots in \nideology and similar motivations \u2014 in order to find \nappropriate solutions and move effectively forward \ntogether. Among the challenges cited by the Secretary-\nGeneral are the lack of progress in international trade \nnegotiations, high energy costs and basic food prices \nand climate change. While we support the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s assessment, we should like to add that \nadditional challenges are posed by continued military \noccupation, denial of the rights of peoples to self-\ndetermination and freedom of expression, the growing \ncrisis of intercultural conflict and the scourge of \ninternational terrorism and extremism. \n The most important role being played by the \nUnited Nations in the Middle East region has been and \nremains that of the custodian of international law. On \nthe one hand, it governs international relations and is \nthe standard by which we measure progress made in \nthe international community; on the other, it embodies \na strong, objective approach to the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security.  \n Because of our strong belief in the role of the \nUnited Nations, we view the Organization as the basic \nframework for finding a solution to the Arab-Israeli \nconflict, putting an end to the occupation of Arab lands \nand redressing the injustices suffered by the Palestinian \npeople. For decades, the Arab States have taken many \ninitiatives and made many proposals, based on \ninternational legitimacy, to achieve a peaceful solution \nto the conflict so that the Palestinians can be liberated \nfrom Israeli occupation and can live in dignity in their \nown homeland.  \n To that end, in 2002 the Arab States jointly \nsubmitted a comprehensive Arab Peace Initiative. It \nsought to end the 60-year-old conflict as well as \nIsrael\u2019s occupation of Arab lands \u2014 Palestinian, Syrian \nand Lebanese territories \u2014 since 1967, in exchange for \na comprehensive peace that would include mutual \nrecognition between Israel and the Arab States, \nincluding the State of Palestine, and the establishment \nof normal relations between them. The Arab Peace \nInitiative was and continues to be an open and clear \ninvitation to Israel to become part of our region \nwithout conditions or restrictions. \n While the Initiative was widely welcomed by the \nnations of the world and was adopted by 57 States \nmembers of the Organization of the Islamic \nConference, Israel ignored it and began to build the \nwall of separation, in defiance of the Advisory Opinion \nof the International Court of Justice, and intensified its \nsettlement activities, which threaten its chances to \nmake peace with the Palestinian people and the Arabs. \n The President took the Chair. \n The efforts of the Quartet are essential to move \nthe political process forward and to find a solution that, \nin accordance with international legitimacy, ends the \nIsraeli occupation, dismantles the settlements, fulfils \nthe aspirations of the Palestinian people to establish \n  \n \n08-53135 16 \n \ntheir own State in their homeland, including East \nJerusalem, and enables the refugees to return to their \nhomes and villages, from which they were expelled in \n1948. \n From this rostrum, Jordan affirms that it supports \nthe negotiations that resumed at Annapolis and values \nthe strategic option of peace reaffirmed in the Arab \nPeace Initiative and the two-State solution. At the same \ntime, we believe that the challenges faced by the \nnegotiations as we approach the end of the year require \nthe international community to demand that the parties \nto the negotiations meet their commitments and that \nthe Quartet make further efforts to achieve the desired \nresults regarding final status negotiations and the \nfulfilment of the Road Map obligations. \n The final months of 2008 will be a critical period \nin the course of those negotiations. Therefore, it is \nimperative that Israel have the political will to resolve \nthe ongoing conflict, after more than six decades. In \naddition, the Palestinian people should be supported on \ntheir own land and the Palestinian National Authority \nshould be strengthened to help it to continue fulfilling \nits obligations, improving the conditions for \nPalestinians in the occupied Palestinian territories and \nbuilding State institutions. That also requires \nPalestinians to bridge their differences against the \nbackdrop of the Arab Peace Initiative and to promote \nthe position of the Palestinian National Authority both \non the international scene and in the context of the \nnegotiations. \n While all parties strive to reach a final solution to \nthe Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Israel continues its \nillegal practices of seizing Arab land in order to change \nthe demographic make-up of the occupied territories \nthrough the building of settlements and the separation \nwall, and changing the status of Jerusalem, in clear \nviolation of international law, the principles of \ninternational legitimacy and the provisions of the \nFourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of \nCivilian Persons in Time of War. Recent speed in \nbuilding Israeli settlements threatens to erode all \nprogress achieved so far in the peace process.  \n We reject all Israeli measures that aim to create a \nnew status quo in the occupied Palestinian territories, \nparticularly in East Jerusalem, including threats to the \nIslamic and Arab character of the holy city. We \nreaffirm that Israeli violations in the holy city, and \nparticularly in the Bab al-Magharibah area, contradict \nthe norms of international law, the Fourth Geneva \nConvention, The Hague Convention of 1954, as well as \nthe July 2008 decision of UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage \nCommittee. As Jordan has played a historic role in the \nsupervision and maintenance of Islamic holy places in \nJerusalem, we call upon Israel to comply with its \npledges and obligations and to put an end to those \nillegal practices.  \n Unless there is justice for the Palestinian people, \nour region will be subjected to a long era of \ndestabilization. But ours will not be the only region \naffected by that destabilization, because the feelings of \ninjustice, disappointment and anger will increase as a \nresult of stagnation in the peace process. This will fuel \nextremism in its various forms and manifestations and \nwill be used as a pretext by those who would like to \ndestabilize the region and the world beyond.  \n I would like to congratulate the brotherly people \nof Lebanon on having achieved national reconciliation, \non the election of a President and the formation of a \nGovernment of national unity. I also congratulate them \non embarking on an extensive and profound process of \nnational dialogue aimed at strengthening Lebanese \nState institutions and seeking ways to defend Lebanese \nterritory and sovereignty. \n Concerning Iraq, we welcome the remarkable \nprogress made in that brotherly country and the \nimprovement of the situation at all levels. Jordan \nrecently reopened and adequately staffed its embassy \nin Baghdad. His Majesty King Abdullah II of Jordan \nrecently visited the brotherly country of Iraq; his visit \nwas widely welcomed at the Arab and international \nlevels. We encourage all channels of political and \neconomic communication between Iraq and other Arab \ncountries, and we encourage the Iraqi Government to \ncontinue its approach to developing channels of \nnational reconciliation in order to build upon the \nprogress achieved so far in the areas of politics and \nsecurity. Such progress encourages Iraqis to return to \ntheir country from neighbouring States and the \nbuilding of a society based on political diversity and \nfree of sectarianism, factionalism and other harms to \nsociety. \n Making the Middle East a zone free of weapons \nof mass destruction is a prerequisite for ensuring the \npeace and stability of the region. In 1970, based on our \nbelief in and support for the preventive goals of \nnuclear non-proliferation, we, joined other countries in \n \n \n17 08-53135 \n \nthe world and the region, with the exception of Israel, \nin acceding to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons. We call upon the international \ncommunity and influential States to bring pressure to \nbear in order to ensure accession by all countries to \nthat international Treaty in order to achieve a nuclear \nweapon-free zone in the Middle East in accordance \nwith international agreements, and to put an end to \nnuclear military programmes in the region once and for \nall. \n Concerning the Iranian nuclear issue, we believe \nthat every nation should exercise its right to the \npeaceful use of nuclear energy. But, at the same time, \nwe call for a resolution of that issue, based on a \npeaceful approach and on negotiations. In that regard, \nJordan attaches great importance to promoting security \nand stability in the Arabian Gulf area in accordance \nwith the principles of international legitimacy, good-\nneighbourliness and non-interference in the internal \naffairs of States. We welcome any effective \ncontribution by Arab States that would maintain \nundiminished security and stability in our region. \n Jordan and the whole region have suffered from \nthe scourge of international terrorism. That has made \nus more vigilant, cautious and determined to \neffectively combat terrorism with a view to eradicating \nit. Jordan upholds international counter-terrorism \nconventions and values international cooperation in \nthat area. We have also taken the necessary national \nmeasures, including legislative measures, to combat \nthat scourge effectively and to support international \nefforts to combat it.  \n Manifestations of extremism in the region are \noften based on politicized pretexts that serve the \nnarrow interests of certain groups. Such groups \nmisrepresent the true Islamic religion and use it as a \ncover for their deeds, thereby threatening the forces of \nmoderation and projecting an incorrect image of Islam \nto the world. In that regard, His Majesty King Abdullah \nII, in his Amman message, called upon all Muslim \nnations to project the proper image of Islam.  \n As we are about to celebrate the first decade of \nthe auspicious reign of His Majesty King Abdullah II, \nwe are very proud of the great achievements made \nduring his reign and look forward to even greater \nachievements in the years ahead. During that decade, \nJordanian participation in peacekeeping operations \nexpanded, reaching a cumulative total of 60,000 men \nand women who have served in 20 missions on four \ncontinents. That contribution reflects our serious and \nunreserved commitment to enhancing international \npeace and security. \n By the end of 2008, our economy will have \ndoubled in size since a decade ago. Per capita income \nwill have grown by 65 per cent. Exports and \ninvestment will have increased threefold. Jordan has \nimplemented ambitious reform plans towards the \nliberalization of foreign trade and the enhancement of \nthe business environment. We have strengthened the \nprogrammes and institutions of good governance and \npolitical development, enhanced the role of women and \nthe protection of human rights, combated corruption \nand made breakthroughs in the areas of health and \neducation. The Government is also carrying out \nambitious programmes towards political, economic and \nsocial reform and development in accordance with the \nnational agenda, with a view to achieving a better \nfuture for the country. This is of particular importance \nbecause young people represent 60 per cent of our \npopulation. \n In spite of all those efforts, programmes and \nsuccesses, successive crises in our region continue to \npresent great challenges to our development process. \nThose challenges are exacerbated by the severe current \neconomic crises and increased prices of food and fuel, \nleading to increased inflation of about 15 per cent. \nHere I would like to reaffirm that international efforts \nto address economic challenges should take into \naccount the voices of countries such as Jordan so that \nall may benefit from international efforts to address the \nchallenges of the international economic, food and \nenergy crises, in particular through programmes and \nmechanisms that take into consideration the specific \nsituations of those States.

        "file_text": "As the first female head of State in the \nhistory of my country, I would like to address this \nAssembly by speaking first on the issue of human \nrights. Members know that, for my country, the policy \nof unrestricted respect for and promotion of human \nrights is one of our State policies.  \n In that context, I would like to urge that the \nInternational Convention for the Protection of All \nPersons from Enforced Disappearance \u2014 which was so \nenergetically promoted by our country and which I  \nco-signed, as First Lady of the Argentine Republic, in \nParis last year together with 73 other delegations \u2014 be \nratified by all countries that have signed it. Thus far, \nonly four countries \u2014 Argentina, Albania, Mexico and \nHonduras \u2014 have ratified it. I know that the Republic \nof France will soon be ratifying it, but it is \nindispensable that we all strongly commit to ensuring \nthat the inviolability of persons be one of the guiding \nprinciples for all States.  \n In this context, I would also like to put forward \nthe Latin American Initiative for the Identification of \nDisappeared Persons. I would like to say that, together \nwith the Guatemalan Foundation for Forensic \nAnthropology, the Argentine Forensic Anthropology \nTeam and the Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team, \nwe are promoting this initiative to establish genetic \nidentity banks to enable us to report precisely on \nviolations of human rights and properly identify \nvictims.  \n We deem invaluable the testimony of the women \nwho are with us here at the Assembly today, members \nof Las Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo \u2014 the Grandmothers \nof the Plaza de Mayo \u2014 who envisioned the creation \nof this genetic information bank. They have been able \nto recover, from oblivion and disappearance, 95 of the \n500 grandchildren who disappeared, children of those \npolitical prisoners who disappeared under the former \ndictatorship in Argentina.  \n The work of these women is living witness to \nhow, even amidst adversity and against all that State \nterrorism \u2014 not just in my country but in other \nrepublics \u2014 has meant, it is possible to overcome \ndeath and fight for life. The recovery of these children \nshows how important \u2014 how crucial \u2014 it is to support \nthis type of initiative and underlines the importance of \nthe work that has been done to identify the victims of \nthe Balkan wars and those of the 11 September attack \non the World Trade Center.  \n In the fight against impunity, which is a State \npolicy in the Republic of Argentina, we cannot fail to \nmention an issue that, for us, is undoubtedly another \ncornerstone of this inexhaustible struggle. My country, \nthe Republic of Argentina, suffered two attacks, in \n1992 and 1994: the 1992 bombing of the Israeli \nEmbassy and the 1994 bombing of the Argentine \nIsraelite Mutual Association (AMIA) building.  \n Last year, before this very Assembly, former \nPresident Kirchner asked INTERPOL to ratify the \narrest warrants issued by my country\u2019s Ministry of \nJustice against Iranian citizens accused of participating \nin the AMIA building bombing. Days later, INTERPOL \nratified them, and international arrest warrants were \nissued accordingly. I call upon the Islamic Republic of \nIran, in compliance with international law, please to \nagree that the Argentine justice system can bring to \ntrial in public, transparent courts, and with the full \nguarantees given by a democratic system, those \ncitizens who stand accused.  \n Before all the countries of the world brought \ntogether in this Assembly, and with the conviction I \nhave always held that innocence must be respected \nuntil an individual has been convicted and sentenced \nby a competent judge, I would like to affirm that, in my \ncountry, those citizens will have a fair and public trial \nwith their full participation, with all the guarantees \nafforded by Argentine law and by the oversight of the \ninternational community. Given the gravity of these \nevents, this would guarantee to the Islamic Republic of \nIran that there would be fairness, truth and justice in \nthat trial. \n I would thus urge once again that, in compliance \nwith international law and because ensuring access to \njustice is what truly shows how we respect truth, \njustice and freedom, this request from the Argentine \njustice system, accepted by INTERPOL, be respected. \nThat would undoubtedly contribute to providing truth \nfor all \u2014 not just for Argentines, but for the entire \ninternational community \u2014 at a time when truth and \njustice are elusive values internationally.  \n  \n \n08-51570 24 \n \n In this Hall, as we have been doing since 2003, I \nwould also like to call for the reform of our \nmultilateral bodies \u2014 not only of the United Nations, \nwhich includes us all, but also of the multilateral \nfinancial institutions as well. That involves us all, and \nit is necessary to recreate a multilateralism which has \nbeen lost, leading to a far more insecure world. The \nOrganization needs to be reformed, not just from the \npoint of view of dogmatic approaches to the world, but \nto meet the real need of all States to ensure the \nfunctional, operational and results-oriented character of \nthe activities and interventions of the Organization. \n In this context, I would modestly like to put \nforward an example from our region, South America, \nof how we were recently able to demonstrate that \nmultilateralism can be achieved, despite differences of \napproach and vision that different Governments in our \nregion may have.  \n Here I am looking at the President Evo Morales \u2014 \nthe legitimate President of our sister Republic of \nBolivia. I would like to say that, a few days ago, the \nUnion of South American Nations (UNASUR) met in \nsupport of the democratic legitimacy of that country. In \na concrete multilateral exercise, heads of State, who do \nnot always share the same viewpoints or interests when \nwe take decisions, were able to work unanimously to \nforge a resolution and plan of action to help our sister \nRepublic of Bolivia, affected by those who do not \nrespect the democratic will of the people freely \nexpressed through elections.  \n That is not our only experience of \nmultilateralism. Previously, at the meeting of the Rio \nGroup in the Dominican Republic, at the time of the \nincident between the sister Republics of Ecuador and \nColombia, heads of State intervened and were able to \nnavigate a conflict which, on the basis of history, in \nother situations would surely have degenerated into an \narmed conflict between two sister countries.  \n What I want to say with this is that, for us, the \nexercise of multilateralism is not simply a hackneyed \nspeech. It is a deeply-held conviction and a concrete \nand objective policy, showing results in what are \nnormally called emerging regions, where we are \ncapable of giving examples of multilateral \ncollaboration in overcoming conflicts.  \n The other reform that we have always promoted \nis that of the multilateral credit institutions, but \nfundamentally the reform of an economic model that \nplaced the generation of wealth at the centre of the \nfictional economy and of the world of finances. Recent \ndays show that those matters, those positions, were not \nthe result of an ideological bias or closed dogmas but \nof objective and timely observation of what was going \non.  \n Today, we cannot speak of the \u201ccaipirinha effect\u201d \nor the \u201ctequila effect\u201d or the \u201crice effect\u201d, or the effect \nthat always showed that the crisis moved from the \nemerging countries towards the centre. Today, if we \nwere to give it a name, we would have to say, perhaps, \nthe \u201cjazz effect\u201d, which moves from the centre of the \nfirst economy of the world and spreads to the rest of \nthe world. That situation does not make us content or \nhappy. \n Quite the contrary, we consider this an historic \nopportunity to review behaviour and policies, because \nduring the period of the Washington Consensus, we \u2014 \nthe countries of South America \u2014 were told that the \nmarket would solve everything, that the State was not \nnecessary, that State intervention was something for \nwhich groups that had not understood how the \neconomy had developed were nostalgic. However, now \nwe are seeing the most formidable State intervention in \nmemory from exactly the place where we had been told \nthat the State was not necessary, in the framework, \nmoreover, of an incredible fiscal and trade deficit.  \n My country, the Argentine Republic \u2014 which, if \nit continues to grow at the rates at which it has been \ngrowing since 2003, will this year be completing the \nlargest economic growth cycle of its almost 200-year \nhistory \u2014 has always upheld the need for a State \npresence, fundamentally because the market does not \nassign resources to the most vulnerable sectors and \nbecause we see the State as connecting the interests of \nsociety and market interests.  \n Since 2003, an Argentina that had been in debt up \nto as much as 160 per cent of its GDP has today \nreduced its debt to almost 50 per cent of GDP. We have \nfully paid our debt to the International Monetary Fund \n(IMF), and about 15 days ago we announced that we \nwill settle our debt with the Paris Club, which had a \ncut-off date of 10 December 1983 \u2014 the very year \nwhen the first democratic President took office, after \nthe dictatorship. Here in New York yesterday, in the \nCouncil on Foreign Relations, I announced that \nArgentina has received a proposal from three very \nimportant banks that represent bond-holders who did \n \n \n25 08-51570 \n \nnot participate in the 2005 bond exchange and who are \nproposing to do so in conditions more favourable for \nmy country, Argentina, than those of the 2005 \nexchange.  \n Thus we believe not only that our strategy has \nbeen correct but that it is absolutely necessary for all of \nus to review, with a great deal of intellectual humility, \nwhat is happening today in the markets and see what \nare the possible solutions for overcoming the situation. \nWe emerging countries have a great advantage in what \nwe do not have: no credit risk agency will come, \nnobody from the IMF will come tell us what to do, a \ngreat country that has grown on the basis of its real \neconomy and today really has problems on the basis of \na casino economy or a fictional economy, where it was \nthought that only capitalism can produce money. I \nalways say that capitalism was invented in order to \nearn money, but on the basis of the production of \ngoods, services and knowledge. Money alone does not \nproduce more money. It has to go through the circuit of \nproduction, work, knowledge, services and goods so \nthat there can be a virtuous cycle that can generate \nwell-being for the whole of society.  \n Finally, I want to mention a matter that affects \nnot only my country, beyond its geographical location, \nbut also concerns this Assembly and also the need to \nface the twenty-first century without colonial enclaves. \nHere I refer to the issue of our Malvinas Islands, \nwhere, despite the resolutions of this body, despite all \nthe measures taken here for the United Kingdom to \nagree, in virtue of what is set out in Article 33 of the \nCharter of the United Nations, to negotiate in peace \nbetween the parties, that country resolutely refuses to \ndiscuss with the Argentine Republic the issue of the \nMalvinas Islands.  \n I believe that a member of the Security  \nCouncil \u2014 one that is among the principal nations of \nthe world in the defence of freedom, human rights and \ndemocracy \u2014 should give concrete proof that it is not \njust talk but that it is truly convinced that it is \nnecessary to end this shame, that of a colonial enclave \nin the twenty-first century. I want to request again, as \nhave the different Presidents who preceded me \u2014 \nbecause Malvinas is for Argentineans a State policy as \nwell \u2014 the cooperation that this body has always \nprovided to once again urge the United Kingdom to \nagree to comply with international law and to \ndemonstrate that it is serious in wishing to build a \ndifferent world and a different citizenry.  \n Lastly, I wish to speak to all those men and \nwomen who have institutional governmental \nresponsibilities in any of the branches of the State in \ntheir respective countries to once again advocate for \nthe transformation of an international policy that has \nits fullest expression in this House. The reform of the \ninstruments that we are requesting is not simply a \nquestion of cosmetics and formulas and changes that \nbarely conceal that everything is continuing as it \nstands. The present situation, the complexity of the \nworld that is coming, in terms of food and energy, \nrequires all of us to re-examine our behaviour and our \nparadigms. We must accept with humility that it is \nnecessary to build a world that is different from the one \nwe have had to date \u2014 one in which respect for human \nrights, for the will of peoples and for those who are \ndifferent, do not think as we do or who pray to a \ndifferent god is not merely a catalogue of good \nintentions set out in the United Nations Charter, but a \nreality that is experienced a little more concretely \nevery day.

        "file_text": "May I first congratulate you, \nSir, on your election as President of the Assembly at its \nsixty-third session. I am sure that your wisdom and \nvast experience will guide us as we deliberate the many \nchallenges that the world faces today. \n The United Nations is the embodiment of our \nfaith in the benefits of collective action and of \nmultilateral approaches in resolving global issues. At \nthe 2005 World Summit we pledged ourselves to an \nagenda for early and meaningful reform of the United \nNations. However, we must acknowledge frankly that \nthere has been little progress on the core elements of \nthe reform agenda. \n We need to make more determined efforts to \nrevitalize the General Assembly to enable it to fulfil its \nrightful role as the principal deliberative organ of the \nUnited Nations system. The composition of the \nSecurity Council needs to change to reflect \ncontemporary realities of the twenty-first century. Only \na truly representative and revitalized United Nations \ncan become the effective focal point for the \ncooperative efforts of the world community. We need \nto expeditiously hold negotiations towards this end. \n Globalization has contributed to ever-widening \ncircles of prosperity, and we in India have also \nbenefited from it. But its benefits have not been \nequitably distributed. Ensuring inclusive growth within \nnations, and inclusive globalization across nations, is a \ncentral challenge facing us all. \n The development gains that many countries have \nmade are today threatened by a possible food crisis, a \nglobal energy crisis and, most recently, unprecedented \nupheavals in international financial markets. \n The net impact of these problems is that both the \nindustrialized economies and the developing \neconomies face inflation and a slowdown in growth \nafter several years of robust expansion. Industrialized \ncountries can afford periods of slow growth. \nDeveloping countries cannot. There is therefore an \nurgent need for coordinated action by the global \ncommunity on several fronts. \n The explosion of financial innovation \nunaccompanied by credible systemic regulation has \nmade the financial system vulnerable. The resulting \ncrisis of confidence threatens global prosperity in the \nincreasingly interdependent world in which we all live. \nThere is, therefore, a need for a new international \ninitiative to bring structural reform in the world\u2019s \nfinancial system, with more effective regulation and \n \n \n9 08-52265 \n \nstronger systems of multilateral consultations and \nsurveillance. This must be designed in as inclusive a \nmanner as possible. \n The world food crisis is the cumulative \nconsequence of the neglect of agriculture in the \ndeveloping world, exacerbated by distortionary \nagricultural subsidies in the developed world. \nDiversion of cultivable land for producing biofuels is \ncompounding the problem. \n The world needs a second green revolution to \naddress the problem of food security. We need new \ntechnologies, new institutional responses and above all \na global compact to ensure food and livelihood \nsecurity. This will require transfer of technology and \ninnovation from developed to developing countries. \nIndia is very keen to expand cooperation with Africa in \nAfrica\u2019s quest for food and livelihood security for its \npeople. \n Trade liberalization in agriculture can help, \nprovided it adequately takes into account the livelihood \nconcerns of poor and vulnerable farmers in the \ndeveloping and least developed countries. \n It is feared that many of the conflicts of the \ntwenty-first century will be over water. We must \ntherefore reflect on how to use this scarce resource \nmost efficiently. We need to invest in new technologies \nand new production regimes for rain-fed and dryland \nagriculture and explore cost-effective desalination \ntechnologies. \n Poverty, ignorance and disease still afflict \nmillions and millions of people. The commitment to \nachieve the ambitious targets set as part of the \nMillennium Development Goals was an \nacknowledgement by the international community that \nglobal prosperity and welfare are indivisible and that \naffluence cannot coexist with pervasive poverty. \n Unfortunately, solemn commitments made for the \ntransfer of financial resources from the developed to \nthe developing world have remained largely \nunfulfilled. The commitment of developed countries to \nmove to the target set long ago of 0.7 per cent of gross \nnational income as official development assistance \nneeds to be honoured as a matter of priority. In this \ncontext, special efforts have to be made to address the \nconcerns of Africa for adequate resource flows to \nsupport its development. \n Poverty alleviation and livelihood security are \nclosely linked to energy security. We need a much \ngreater measure of predictability and stability in the oil \nand gas markets. We need to think of ways and means, \nsuch as early warning mechanisms, to help countries \ncope with oil shocks. \n We must put in place a global cooperative \nnetwork of institutions of developed and developing \ncountries engaged in research and development in \nenergy efficiency, clean energy technologies, and \nrenewable sources of energy. \n India is registering rapid economic growth, and \nhas combined it with declining energy intensity of its \neconomy. However, our total demand will keep \nincreasing, and we are actively looking for all possible \nsources of clean energy. \n The opening of international civil nuclear \ncooperation with India will have a positive impact on \nglobal energy security and on the efforts to combat \nclimate change. This is a vindication of India\u2019s \nimpeccable record on non-proliferation and testifies to \nour long-standing commitment to nuclear disarmament \nthat is global, universal and non-discriminatory in \nnature. The blueprint for this was spelled out by Prime \nMinister Rajiv Gandhi in this very Assembly 20 years \nago. \n I reiterate India\u2019s proposal for a nuclear weapons \nconvention prohibiting the development, production, \nstockpiling and use of nuclear weapons and providing \nfor their complete elimination within a specified time \nframe. \n Climate change can be overcome successfully \nonly through a collaborative and cooperative global \neffort. \n We support the multilateral negotiations now \ntaking place under the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change. The outcome must be \nfair and equitable and recognize the principle that each \ncitizen of the world has equal entitlement to the global \natmospheric space. \n I believe that the pursuit of ecologically \nsustainable development need not be in contradiction \nto achieving our growth objectives. As Mahatma \nGandhi once said, \u201cThe earth has enough resources to \nmeet people\u2019s needs, but will never have enough to \nsatisfy people\u2019s greed.\u201d  \n  \n \n08-52265 10 \n \n India has unveiled an ambitious national action \nplan on climate change. Even as we pursue economic \ngrowth, we are committed to our per capita emissions \nof greenhouse gases not exceeding those of the \ndeveloped countries. \n The growing assertion of separate identities and \nethnic, cultural and religious intolerance threaten our \ndevelopmental efforts and our peace and stability. It is \nvital that we strengthen international cooperation to \ncombat terrorism and to bring the perpetrators, \norganizers, financers and sponsors of terrorism to \njustice. We should conclude expeditiously the draft \ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism. \n In this context, the situation in Afghanistan is a \nmatter of deep concern. The international community \nmust pool all its resources to ensure the success of \nAfghanistan\u2019s reconstruction efforts and its emergence \nas a moderate, pluralistic and democratic society. \n We welcome the return of democracy in Pakistan. \nWe are committed to resolving all outstanding issues \nbetween India and Pakistan, including the issue of \nJammu and Kashmir, through peaceful dialogue. \n We also welcome the coming to power of \ndemocratically elected Governments in Nepal and \nBhutan. We seek to expand areas of cooperation with \nall these countries to deal with the challenges of \nsustainable development and poverty eradication. \n The United Nations is a living symbol of \npluralism. It has weathered many storms. It is the \nvehicle through which our combined will and efforts to \naddress global challenges must be articulated and \nimplemented. Unless we rise to the task, we will \nbequeath to succeeding generations a world of \ndiminishing prospects. "

        "file_text": "At the \noutset, I congratulate you, Sir, on your election as \nPresident of the General Assembly for this session. We \nwish you every success and express our confidence that \nyou will continue to pursue the great mission \nundertaken by the United Nations, which constitutes a \nmonumental achievement in the history of humankind \ntowards the promotion of dialogue and understanding \nand the resolution of issues and conflicts. That mission \ncontinues to be carried out in accordance with the rules \nand principles of international law, including \nhumanitarian law, and on the basis of covenants that \nare consistent with the spirit of the times and the needs \nof the Organization in resolving problems and conflicts \nand confronting the enormous challenges before us, \nincluding poverty, hunger, the environment and climate \nchange. \n On this occasion, I also wish to commend the role \nand positive contributions of your predecessor, \nMr. Srgjan Kerim, during the sixty-second session of \nthe General Assembly. I would also like to express our \ndeep appreciation for the efforts, positions and \ninitiatives of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. They \nreflect his foresight and pragmatism regarding the \nvarious issues before us and in all regions that are \nsuffering crises and that pose threats to world peace, \nincluding in particular in the Middle East region.  \n \n \n37 08-52272 \n \n I highly value the Secretary-General\u2019s \nunderstanding of the need to address the political and \nhumanitarian issues concerning the Palestinian people \nand our region, along with the important role that \ncontinues to be played by various United Nations \nagencies, including the United Nations Relief and \nWorks Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East \n(UNRWA), which continues to shoulder great burdens, \nespecially in the Gaza Strip and in the refugee camps \nin the West Bank, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria. In the \nabsence of such a continuous, outstanding role, we \nwould have suffered even more severe and perilous \ncrises than we have experienced to date. \n This year, I should have liked to bear news of the \nachievement of a comprehensive agreement between us \nand our Israeli neighbours, bringing an end to the \nIsraeli occupation of our land since 1967 and to the \nsuffering of the millions of our people living as \nrefugees and displaced persons in exile from their \nhomeland. I believe that the entire world, with its \ndiffering alliances and trends, shares that desire with \nme, especially following the Annapolis conference late \nlast year and the relaunching of the political process. \nThat set the necessary guidelines for the advancement of \nnegotiations towards the conclusion of a comprehensive \nand complete agreement on all final status issues. Such \nan agreement would lead to the realization of peace \nwithin our region and allow it to enter a qualitatively new \nera of relations characterized by good-neighbourliness, \nmutual recognition, security and open borders, and not \nby walls and barriers. \n I am certain that never in the history of the \nconflict in our region have so many countries gathered \nas those that attended the Annapolis conference or \nparticipated in the consensus that arose there. Those \nwho met not only demanded vigorous action to \naccelerate and advance negotiations towards the \nachievement of a final peace agreement, but also \nexplicitly emphasized the need to remove all of the \nobstacles that have continuously impeded the \nnegotiating process and cast doubt on its credibility, \nusefulness and ability to actually resolve all aspects of \nthe conflict. The main obstacle I refer to is that of the \nIsraeli settlement campaign and its continuation \nthroughout the occupied Palestinian territory, \nparticularly in East Jerusalem. \n All of the participants in Annapolis took a united, \nfirm and unprecedented stand calling for the immediate \ncessation of illegal settlement activities. It was \nrecognized that this was a prerequisite for allowing the \nnegotiations to resolve the conflict to lead to an end to \nthe occupation and the grave, historical injustices \ninflicted on our people over the long decades. \n The participation of most brotherly Arab \ncountries in the Annapolis conference was not merely a \nsymbolic gesture. On the contrary, their participation, \nin terms of both the level of attendance and the \nsubstance of positions, was a reflection of their \ngenuine desire to embrace and support the political \nprocess and to address it in real earnest on the basis of \nthe Arab peace initiative adopted at the Arab summit in \nBeirut in 2002. \n Allow me, from this rostrum to recall once again \nthe special importance of the Arab peace initiative. I do \nthis personally in order to draw attention to the \nsignificance of each of its platforms, because it \nrepresents a major joint Arab undertaking and offers a \nhistoric opportunity for us to achieve peace, security \nand mutual recognition for all. \n Indeed, it is strange to hear comments, which we \ndo not understand or accept, that are used to justify the \ncontinuing settlements in East Jerusalem and the rest of \nthe occupied Palestinian territory and refer to the land \nas if it were not occupied territory or as if peace were \npossible without an end to the occupation of all of the \nArab territories occupied since 1967, including the \noccupied Syrian Golan and the Lebanese Sheba\u2019a \nFarms, and without an end to the occupation of East \nJerusalem, the capital of our future Palestinian State \nand a city holy to hundreds of millions of the faithful \nof the monotheistic religions.  \n For the purpose of the noble and peaceful \nobjectives of building of a new Middle East free of \ndestructive mindsets and irrational tendencies that run \ncounter to the highest human values preached by all \nreligions and creeds \u2014 a new Middle East free of \nweapons of mass destruction \u2014 we have been and \nremain committed to international legitimacy. We \nextend our hands for dialogue and negotiation to \nresolve the conflict in a way that provides all that is \nrequired for coexistence and openness to the future so \nwe can build our societies and nations in accordance \nwith the aspirations of our peoples to progress and in \nthe spirit of the times. \n In that context, we express our full support for \nthe continuation of the indirect talks currently taking \nplace between Syria and Israel with the help of sisterly \n  \n \n08-52272 38 \n \nTurkey. We hope that the process will culminate in the \nachievement of justice, the implementation of \ninternational resolutions and the affirmation of \ninternational legitimacy. \n For our part, we will continue to strive to achieve \nthe maximum possible progress in the current \nnegotiations between us and Israel through this year, \nbenefiting from past experience and relying on the \ndesire of all our peoples to realize a genuine and \ncomprehensive peace that will end decades of \noccupation and hostilities and result in the attainment \nof the two-State solution \u2014 the State of Palestine \nliving alongside the State of Israel on the basis of the \n1967 borders \u2014 and a just and agreed solution to the \nplight of the Palestinian refugees in accordance with \nresolution 194 (III). In referring to the benefits of past \nexperience, I wish to convey clearly that partial or \ninterim solutions or the dropping or deferral of those \ncore issues are unacceptable and unviable and will \nmaintain the roots of the conflict, thus undermining \nany achievement on the road to peace. The solution \nmust be comprehensive, complete, detailed and \nwholehearted. \n The solution we aspire to must include a \nmechanism to ensure its full and faithful \nimplementation pursuant to the timetable agreed upon. \nAll that inevitably requires international supervision of \nthe implementation of the solution, as well as a more \neffective role for the international Quartet in \nsafeguarding the solution we will reach and an \neffective guarantor role for the Security Council and \nvarious other United Nations bodies. \n At this juncture, I would like to express our \nappreciation for the role played by the United States \nAdministration, President George Bush and Secretary \nof State Condoleezza Rice in advancing the \nnegotiations and the peace process, as well as their \nefforts to remove the obstacles that stand in its way. I \nalso wish to commend the positions taken by the Arab, \nIslamic and non-aligned countries, which have always \ntaken firm stances in support of a just peace. I would \nlike to express our appreciation for the role played by \nthe European Union, which has supported our efforts in \nevery possible way, and the role and positions of the \nRussian Federation, the People\u2019s Republic of China \nand Japan, as well as of our friends and colleagues in \nLatin America and Africa who have always supported \nthe advancement and continuity of the political \nprocess. \n As humankind celebrates the sixtieth anniversary \nof the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights, the conditions being endured by our people are \nincreasingly severe and complex. Our nation, which \npossesses only a small area of land, continues to suffer \nthe fragmentation and discontiguity of its cities and \nvillages as a result of more than 600 checkpoints and \nroadblocks on all main and secondary roads. There is \nno precedent for that in modern history. The harshest \nand most painful of those barriers are those that have \nsurrounded occupied East Jerusalem, severing the link \nbetween it and its Palestinian surroundings, not to \nmention changing the Islamic and Christian character \nof our city. \n Attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinian civilians \nhave become daily occurrences. At the same time, \nongoing tragedies strike every Palestinian family with \nthe continuing detention and imprisonment of over \n11,000 Palestinians in Israeli jails. I know of no \nsituation in today\u2019s world comparable to ours, where a \npeople is subject to the detention of such large numbers \nof its civilians and where prisons continue to be filled \nwith more and more accused who are guilty only of \nwanting to be free and of envisioning a future that is \ndifferent from the reality of occupation, siege and the \nloss of hope. \n Despite those harsh circumstances, our National \nAuthority and governing institutions have exerted \nevery possible effort to improve our conditions in all \nfields, including the security, economic, education, \nhealth and cultural sectors. \n I wish to express our gratitude to our brothers in \nthe Arab countries, to the General Secretariat of the \nLeague of Arab States, and to the whole international \ncommunity for all the important assistance extended to \nour people and our Authority in all aspects of the \nendeavour to restore the Palestinian economy, provide \nreal opportunities for its advancement, and rebuild the \nPalestinian security apparatus and the various \ninstitutions and agencies of the Palestinian Authority. \n In that regard, I wish to convey special thanks \nand appreciation to all the envoys from other countries \nwho have provided assistance in several fields, \nparticularly Mr. Tony Blair, the Quartet Special Envoy. \nIt is with pride that I can say that, even under those \nmost difficult conditions we have been able to achieve \nsecurity, the rule of law and public order for most of \n \n \n39 08-52272 \n \nour towns and districts, despite all the remaining \nobstacles we have to confront. \n However, we will continue to follow that same \npath with firm determination and resolve. In that \nconnection, the Paris Donor\u2019s Conference, followed by \nthe Bethlehem economic conference, were two special \noccasions in support of our national economy, our \nfinancial and economic institutions and treasury, and \nassistance to the Palestinian private sector, which has \nunwaveringly borne heavy burdens over the past years \nand has not failed to develop and progress. \n There is no doubt that the ongoing siege of the \nGaza Strip, where unemployment is endemic, is \ncompounding the tragic humanitarian crisis there. It is \nunprecedented in scope and scale, and the \nopportunities for education and medical care are \nscarce, punishing and causing the malnutrition of an \nentire generation with all the consequent risks for the \nfuture of the entire people. \n All of that is in addition to the transformation of \nthe Gaza Strip into a huge virtual prison holding nearly \n1.5 million Palestinians. We have exerted all efforts to \nget the siege on Gaza lifted, this dear part of our \nhomeland. In that regard, we express our deep \nappreciation for the role played by the brotherly Arab \ncountries, especially Egypt, to alleviate the suffering \nand to help us save our people from the extremely \ndifficult situation they find themselves in, including in \nparticular their efforts to end the division resulting \nfrom the bloody coup led by Hamas against Palestinian \nlegitimacy more than a year ago. \n As I have on more than one occasion, I would \nlike to reaffirm once again from this rostrum that we \nwill spare no effort to achieve Palestinian national \nreconciliation. We have already announced a \npreliminary plan that opens the door for this \nreconciliation to be realized and the formation of an \nindependent, impartial Government that is acceptable \nto all, but that will not place us back under siege again. \nThis Government will prepare for the holding of \nlegislative and presidential elections. We will continue \nbuilding a security apparatus based on professional \ntenets, with the support of Arab security. After the \ncompletion of those steps, it will be possible for us to \nproceed further towards strengthening our \nreconciliation and deepening the participation of all. If \nthat is not actualized, whoever rejects those principles \nand does not conform with them must bear the \nresponsibility before our entire people and before the \nArab and international positions that reject this \ndisintegration and division. \n In concluding my statement, I recall the words of \nour great Palestinian poet, Mahmoud Darwish, whom \nwe recently lost and whose loss was that of a great \ncultural and humanitarian symbol and icon. Mahmoud \nDarwish glorified life and cherished his homeland, \ncalling on our new generations to love life on their land \nand to preserve its continuity and to keep the torch \nalways lit. Mahmoud Darwish said,  \n\u201cOn this land there is something that deserves \nlife, on this land there was first the beginning and \nthe end \u2014 a land called Palestine \u2014 a name that \nwas and is and will endure\u201d.

        "file_text": "I should like to begin by greeting you, Sir, \ncongratulating you on your election to the presidency \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. We \nare certain that your experience will enable us to have \nfruitful and constructive exchanges on the urgent \nchallenges currently facing humanity. Thus, we \nreaffirm our commitment to contributing to the \nachievement of positive results during this session. \n Fighting poverty and creating opportunities to \npromote social inclusion are priorities of the \nGovernment of President Alan Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez, and we \nare therefore pleased that the General Assembly has \nrightly chosen the theme of poverty \u2014 a challenge \nrequiring a global and comprehensive response \u2014 as \nthe central focus of discussion for the present session.  \n Peru has been affected by the negative \nrepercussions of the increase in food and fuel prices, \nwhich are felt most intensely by the poorest \nindividuals. In my country, we are working responsibly \nto find appropriate responses that can sustainably meet \nthe challenge of enhancing food security. At the same \ntime, we are adopting urgent measures to assist those \nmost affected by rising food prices. The direct \nrelationship between poverty and rising food prices \nshould lead us to develop new and more ambitious \nformulas for international cooperation that are \ncommensurate with the magnitude of the problem and \ntake into account all aspects of poverty in a \ncomprehensive manner.  \n Against that backdrop, I wish to highlight a new \nthreat to the possibilities of development: a grave \ninternational financial crisis whose scale is still \nunknown. At its roots lies an unfortunate and \nirresponsible combination of regulatory loopholes, real \nestate inflation, reckless mortgages and financial \nleverages without a sound basis in the real economy. \nThis could lead the world into a crisis of confidence \nand undermine the considerable progress that \ndeveloping regions have made in their fight against \npoverty. Given those phenomena, we await decisive \nresponses and actions by the developed countries to \nsupport the financial system and avert the great risks of \nthis crisis.  \n In the case of Peru, I can say that this turbulence \nwill not cause us to abandon our ongoing policies of \ninvesting, creating productive jobs, increasing tax \nrevenues and promoting growth. Peru has been very \nsuccessfully implementing a programme of \ncomprehensive, inclusive and decentralized \ndevelopment based on two pillars: an economic policy \nA/63/PV.13  \n \n08-53122 6 \n \nwith the clear objectives of growth and job creation, \ntaking advantage of the country\u2019s multifaceted \npotential; and a social policy that honours the \ncommitment to reduce poverty, increase social \ninclusion and promote equality of opportunity. \n That approach has brought into our economy not \nonly financial resources, but also advanced \ntechnologies and management capacities that improve \nand stimulate the competitiveness of our production, \nthus increasing and diversifying exportation. As a \nresult of that approach, the creation of direct and \nindirect employment has increased in an unprecedented \nway in many areas of the country and thousands of \nsmall and medium entrepreneurs have been \nincorporated into the market in an economy that boosts \ninitiative and creative capacity.  \n Based on those premises, Peru has made steady \nprogress in recent years, with the growth rate reaching \n9.1 per cent in 2007 and forecast to reach over 9 per \ncent this year. There is, further, a major increase in the \ndomestic component, which is a driving force in the \neconomy. \n But to those positive macroeconomic figures we \nshould add the important results in the management of \nthe major components of the social model, such as the \nexpanding social, education and health services as well \nas basic assistance to the poorest. Through the social \npolicy, the Peruvian Government has achieved, in only \ntwo years, a remarkable reduction of more than 5 per \ncent in poverty and almost 3 per cent in extreme \npoverty. Infant mortality has also fallen by 51.6 per \ncent and illiteracy levels have also been reduced by \n5.7 per cent. We have also established an objective of \nreducing chronic child malnutrition by 5 per cent by \n2011. We are seeking to enhance the management and \nincrease the impact of the social expenditures of the \nState. \n Those achievements ensure that in the case of \nPeru the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will \nbe met prior to the 2015 deadline in areas such as \npoverty reduction, nutrition, literacy, health and \neducation, among others. We also see that the role of \ninternational cooperation was fundamental in our being \nable to bring to remote areas social, education and \nproduction projects that, in a sustainable manner, raise \nthe standard of living of members of rural \ncommunities. The combination of the national effort \nfor inclusion and international cooperation should be \nmaintained in order to achieve, as soon as possible, the \nfull involvement of the Peruvian social fabric in \nnational development.  \n In recognition of all of those advances, of the \neconomic stability of the country and of the prevailing \nlegal security, three important international risk \nindicators have given Peru its investment grade. \nConsistent with this positive evolution of the economic \nperception of my country, foreign investment increased \nby more than 23 per cent in 2007 and is expected to \nfurther increase this year. \n Our growth is also based on expanding the \nmarkets, which we have done through regional and \nbilateral free trade agreements entered into with the \nUnited States, Chile, Thailand, Canada and Singapore. \nWe hope to conclude further agreements soon with \nSouth Korea and China. We are conducting trade \nnegotiations with the European Union and the Andean \ncountries, a process that we hope will be satisfactorily \nconcluded in 2009. Furthermore, we are ready to \nengage in negotiations with as many countries as \npossible, to enable us to boost trade. \n There is a broad consensus regarding the shared \nresponsibility of countries of origin and receiving \ncountries in dealing with the phenomenon of migration. \nIts causes have a global dimension, and so should its \ntreatment. It is a tool of development, both in \noriginating and receiving countries and in the migrant \ncommunities themselves. We should look at the central \nrole of migration in terms of creating opportunities for \ngenerating wealth and progress, for diversity and for \nbuilding more tolerant multicultural spaces. \n The responsible and constructive handling of \ninternational migration should begin with the practical \nuse of international instruments for the protection of \nmigrants. Therefore, the United Nations, together with \nStates, must redouble its efforts to implement measures \nthat will make it possible to ensure respect for the \nhuman rights of migrants, migrant workers and their \nfamilies.  \n For this reason, in Peru we have been promoting \nand continue to promote the handling of this matter \nboth in the United Nations and in other forums with a \nview to establishing mechanisms for exchange of \ninformation and specialized knowledge, undertaking \nstanding consultations and forging closer cooperation \nbetween the Global Forum for Migration and \nDevelopment and the United Nations. We must make \n A/63/PV.13\n \n7 08-53122 \n \ncivil society aware of the benefits and contributions of \nmigration and continue with dialogue and coordination \nin multilateral forums, without stopping the progress \ntowards agreements. \n The concern about poverty and economic growth \nrequires an examination of the sustainability of \ndevelopment ideas and the most relevant \nenvironmental priorities. We need to deal with security \nand the rational use of water for agriculture and for \npersonal use, deforestation control, soil degradation \nand environmental pollution, among others. We are \nworking on these issues with the most advanced \nregulations, a product of our own experience. We have \nto approach these matters organically. In the case of \nPeru, we established the Ministry for the Environment \na few months ago. We insist that national development \nprogrammes take account of the quality of life and the \nsustainability of land-use models and of natural \nresources.  \n Global warming requires us to work intensively \nwith the entire international community to reduce \nemissions, which are the fundamental reason for the \nrise in global temperatures and their already visible \nconsequences. Peru is witnessing a rapid retreat of its \ntropical glaciers, which is threatening the water-supply \nregime in the most populated and heavily agricultural \nareas. We want to confirm our conviction on the \npressing importance of advancing from the platform \nadopted in Bali last year with a view to consolidating \nin Copenhagen in 2009 a comprehensive agreement for \nthe reduction of polluting emissions, in order to avoid \nthe worst natural-catastrophe scenarios for a not-so-\ndistant future. \n The current international scene presents a very \ncomplicated structure, characterized by contradictory \ntrends of globalization and fragmentation. Indeed, on \nthe one hand, we have global integration of production \nprocesses, trade, financial flows and technological \nrevolution, as well as the dissemination of values such \nas democracy and human rights. But, simultaneously, \nthere is fragmentation because of increasing social \ninequality, poverty, exclusion, proliferation of civil \nwars, genocide, terrorism, transnational crime, \ndegradation of the environment and the flouting of \ninternational law as a means for the peaceful settlement \ndisputes.  \n Those contradictory trends between globalization \nand fragmentation jeopardize the governance of States, \nthe governance of the international system and \ncollective security itself. Peru, true to its traditional \nconstructive approach, considers that the international \norder should be based on peace, cooperation, \nmultilateralism and, of course, international law. Thus \nwe are of the view that at the present time we need to \nreaffirm support for the primordial role played by the \nUnited Nations in dealing with the major subjects on \nthe international agenda, specifically those connected \nwith international peace and security, the observance of \ndemocratic order, sustainable development, the \npromotion and protection of human rights, and \nenvironmental protection. \n That approach guided Peruvian participation on \nthe Security Council and has led it to reaffirm its \ncommitment to active participation in peacekeeping \noperations in the context of respect for the principles of \nthe sovereignty of States and non-intervention in the \ndomestic affairs of other countries. Currently, my \ncountry\u2019s armed forces are in Haiti, the Sudan, the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia and C\u00f4te \nd\u2019Ivoire. Peru has a contingent in the United Nations \nStabilization Mission in Haiti and is coordinator of the \nGroup of Friends of Haiti, which is responsible for \nhelping the Security Council in monitoring this case. \n Moreover, Peru is an active participant in \nnumerous multilateral mechanisms. This year, we were \nhonoured to host the fifth Summit between the \nEuropean Union and Latin American and Caribbean \nheads of State and Government. Next November, we \nwill once again be honoured when we host leaders \nfrom the economies of the Asia-Pacific Economic \nCooperation Forum at their sixteenth summit.  \n As part of our involvement on the international \nstage, I should also like to point to our contribution to \nthe establishment of the Latin American-Pacific Arc, \nwhich aims at harnessing synergies among \nparticipating countries in economic and commercial \nfields, especially as regards promoting investments in \nthe areas of infrastructure and facilitating business, and \nin promoting cooperation to improve the \ncompetitiveness of our economies. All of that is geared \ntowards ensuring a more pronounced and effective \npresence for our region in the Asia-Pacific region.  \n In conclusion, I would like to reiterate Peru\u2019s \ncommitment to continue to support initiatives aimed at \npromoting an environment conducive to economic and \nsocial development, the full validity of democracy, the \nA/63/PV.13  \n \n08-53122 8 \n \nstrengthening of the rule of law and the promotion and \nprotection of human rights throughout the world. That \nshould take place against an international backdrop \nwhere conflicts are brought under control, security \nprevails and there is unequivocal adherence to the \nnorms of international law and the Charter of the \nUnited Nations. Those are the central priority goals of \nour foreign policy and constitute the guidelines that \nwill continue to orient Peru\u2019s participation on the \ninternational stage, and especially in this body."

        "file_text": "First, I would like to \nexpress my great respect to the leadership of the \nGeneral Assembly as it guides the Organization \nthrough global issues and challenges.  \n When I stood at this podium 10 years ago, the list \nof issues to be urgently addressed was about the same, \nyet the mood was different. The Kyoto Protocol had \njust been signed and preparations for the Millennium \nSummit, including the drafting of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, were under way. The international \ncommunity, guided by the principles and the leadership \nof the United Nations, showed the will and the \nambition to resolve global issues.  \n But did we manage to turn that collective will \ninto principled and decisive actions? I have to admit \nthat many nations, big and small, have many more \nconcerns today than they did a decade ago. Today we \nfeel less secure. The very structure of the international \nsystem seems to be fracturing, depriving us of the \nprotection provided by international law and \ninternational institutions. In my region, in Eastern \nEurope and in the eastern neighbourhood of the \nEuropean Union (EU), that is more obvious than \nanywhere else.  \n \n \n7 08-51606 \n \n Take energy security: oil supplies to Lithuania \nhave been cut off without warning, and we do not stand \na chance of conducting a normal civilized dialogue on \nhow to fix the problem. Gas supplies were interrupted \nto our neighbours Ukraine and Belarus. In that light, \nand on the eve of closing down our only independent \npower generator, we have very serious reason to worry \nabout the possible risks for the future of our economy. \nI would also say that other countries of our region also \nhave concerns about unreliable energy supplies. Such a \nsituation threatens the stability of the entire region. The \nUnited Nations cannot be a mere passive observer if, \nand when, universal values and international law are \nunder threat. Too often, we remain observers in the \nface of mounting security crises.  \n What happened to Georgia a few months ago is a \ncase in point. The United Nations largely failed to react \nto an act of aggression against a small nation that has \nbeen a Member of the United Nations since 1992. \nPerhaps we failed to react because one of the interested \nsides to the conflict is a permanent member of the \nSecurity Council, which has the responsibility to \nprotect both the letter and the spirit of the Charter of \nthe United Nations and various United Nations \nresolutions. \n But maybe we also failed to react because our \nfaith in the United Nations has weakened. It is the very \nessence of the Organization\u2019s mission to protect human \nlife and human rights, but too often voting on human \nrights receives less and less support from Member \nStates. Today, there are still about 26 million internally \ndisplaced persons in the world, including in the Sudan, \nSomalia, the South Caucasus nations of Georgia and \nAzerbaijan, and other places. Last year alone, we faced \nserious crises in different corners of the planet, \nincluding in Myanmar, the Sudan and Zimbabwe. The \nworld needed United Nations leadership, but the \nOrganization has not acted accordingly. That is because \nsome States hide behind technicalities or the shield of \nnational sovereignty, thereby paralysing the United \nNations. \n It is quite evident that the United Nations cannot \ncontinue with business as usual. It needs reform and a \ngreater role in areas that will determine the future of \nthe twenty-first century, such as energy, information \nsecurity, anti-terrorism, the fight against \nfundamentalism and the like. How long will we \ncontinue with cold-war-era security definitions, closing \nour eyes to the less visible, but no less dangerous \ndangers of the twenty-first century? When 17 years \nago, following the Soviet occupation, my country \nregained independence and joined the United Nations, \nwe were told that never again would Molotovs and \nRibbentrops dare to decide the future of other nations. \nNext year we will mark the seventieth anniversary of \nthe shameful Molotov-Ribbentrop secret protocols.  \n But Lithuania and other nations of the former \nSoviet Union still have to fight against the revisionism \nseeping down from the Kremlin\u2019s towers and the \nblatant claims that there was no occupation of the \nBaltic States and that there was no Holodomor in \nUkraine, where millions of people were starved to \ndeath by a ruthless dictator. Should not an alarm bell \nring across the entire international community when \nwe see such bold attempts to cover up crimes against \nhumanity? \n Today, my nation is commemorating the Day of \nGenocide of Lithuanian Jews. That tragedy is a \npowerful reminder to us all of the vulnerability of \nfreedom, but it also teaches us that sincere efforts to \nadmit one\u2019s crimes help nations to reconcile and create \na truly peaceful, secure and stable area. Therefore, on \nthis solemn day we not only remember but we also \nlearn. \n If we are to reform the United Nations in a \nmeaningful way, perhaps we should have a better look \nat the experience of European nations after the end of \nthe Second World War and the end of the cold war. \nBased on that experience, it is obvious that we need to \nstrengthen democracy at home in order to have good \ngovernance and responsible leadership. Perhaps \nresponsible leaders will not protect us from all global \nchallenges, but they will at least seek cooperation with \ntheir people and other nations to resolve their \npersisting problems. \n It is only through integration that truly indivisible \nsecurity can be achieved. Indivisible security has \nspecial meaning and importance for smaller nations, \nwhich have all too often fallen victim to the redrawing \nof maps. It is my conviction that the interaction of, and \ncooperation among, different organizations \u2014 like the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, \nEU, NATO and the Council of Europe \u2014 have been, \nand should remain, the foundation for security and \nstability in Europe. There are difficulties and \ndeficiencies; but there is no alternative, and new \nalternatives are not needed. I am therefore deeply \n  \n \n08-51606 8 \n \nworried by new calls to revise the institutional \nstructure of European security, rather than to abide by \ncommitments undertaken before the whole \ninternational community. \n Security based on cooperation should remain the \nbasic principle of different European organizations and \nof international relations as a whole. The philosophy of \nthe balance of power, which is again growing popular \nin some capitals, has no place in contemporary Europe. \nAnd because security is indivisible, it is in the interest \nof the international community that the United Nations \nshould play a greater role in strengthening preventive \ndiplomacy and making the principle of the \nresponsibility to protect work. \n The United Nations also has to be more \nresponsive to emerging threats, such as unreliable \nenergy supplies, fundamentalism and cyber attacks. It \ndoes not matter if the world is unipolar, bipolar or \nmultipolar. Human life and human rights remain at the \nheart of our world. Only such a world can create a truly \nviable architecture among States \u2014 an architecture \nbased on trust, openness and respect for human rights. \nBut did we see efforts to create such an architecture in \nthe Georgia-Russia conflict? What we saw instead \nwere renewed attempts to divide the world into zones \nof influence or privileged interests. That should be \nunacceptable to the international community in the \ntwenty-first century. Division and exclusion are bad \nremedies for conflict resolution. Conflict resolution in \nSouth Ossetia, Abkhazia and elsewhere should \ntherefore be the responsibility of the international \ncommunity and international institutions, not of one \nparticipating side, which hardly remains impartial. \n We also have to maintain commitments to value-\nbased policies. It is through our commitment to change \nand reform that Lithuania has become what it is today: \na consolidated democracy, a strong reformed economy \nand an active contributor to international peacekeeping \nmissions from the Balkans to Afghanistan. \n I believe that we, the peoples of the United \nNations, have to renew our commitment to universal \nvalues and principles, so that we march together and in \nthe same direction and our steps become stronger. I \nbelieve that we must learn those lessons well, so that in \nanother 10-years\u2019 time we can celebrate not only the \nfulfilled promise of the Millennium Development \nGoals but also the fulfilled promise of creating lasting \npeace and an era of progress, prosperity and human \nintegrity. It is because the United Nations consists \nprimarily not of the sum total of votes but of universal \nprinciples that those principles shall be a guiding light \nfor us in the years to come. I still believe that that is \nthe core mission of the Organization. I care deeply \nabout it. "

        "file_text": "We are starting this sixty-third \nsession of the General Assembly under the wise and \ninspiring leadership of our President, \nMr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann. We rely on your \nexperience and your political acumen, Sir, and I wish \nyou every success in your work. At the same time, I \nwish to express our sincere gratitude to your \npredecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-second session, who \nguided the Assembly with great sensitivity and \ndetermination. I also wish to pay tribute to the \nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, whose tireless \nefforts are guiding the United Nations at this turbulent \ntime.  \n  \n \n08-51749 18 \n \n Indeed, we live in a turbulent world at a turbulent \ntime. We need real answers to the accumulated global \nproblems. The era of optimism generated by \nglobalization has come to an end. The eruption of the \nfinancial crisis in recent weeks has removed the last \nshred of doubt about that. The world needs real \nanswers to big questions. \n If you asked me to identify the key policy \nrequirement for the United Nations today with a single \nconcept \u2014 and in one word \u2014 my answer would be \nthis: we live at a time requiring transformation. \nTransformation should be the key idea of policymaking \nto guide United Nations action. The United Nations \nshould look to policies with a transformational \npotential and capable of producing transformational \neffects in the not-too-distant future. Obviously, that \nambitious and general proposition begs further \nquestions. Is the United Nations capable of generating \nsocial, political and economic transformation? Does \nthe United Nations of today know what is the main \narea for the necessary strategic transformation? What \nneeds to be done, by way of transformation, in the \nmost sensitive area of the United Nations mandate, in \nthe area of the maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity? Allow me to address those questions one by \none. \n First, is the United Nations capable of generating \nsocial and political transformation worldwide? The \nUnited Nations has demonstrated such an ability in \nvarious areas of its work in the past. United Nations \naction in the field of human rights offers an excellent \nexample. Later this year we will celebrate the sixtieth \nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights, and it does not take much effort to realize how \nmuch the change that has occurred in those 60 years \nowes to the transformational energy of human rights.  \n Consider this: at the time of the adoption of the \nUniversal Declaration in 1948, the world had \nexperienced one of its most traumatic moments. The \nSecond World War was barely over, its aftershocks \nwere still strongly felt, and much of the world was \nphysically destroyed. Stalinist oppression was the \ndominant feature of the Soviet Union and of a large \npart of Europe. In Asia and Africa, large populations \nsuffered under the yoke of colonialism. The system of \napartheid was being introduced in South Africa. Yet, \nthat was the time when the authors of the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights outlined an optimistic \nvision of a just society and a better world. Human \nrights were the genuinely transformational idea of the \ntime and that idea has guided social change and \ndevelopment ever since. \n The world of today, while still far from ideal, is \nsubstantially better than the world of 1948. Human \nrights have triumphed in many parts of the world and \nare making steady progress in others. Many of the \noppressive systems have ended in the dustbin of \nhistory. The remaining ones are likely to follow. \nDemocracy has progressed globally and is today the \nway of life of more people than ever before. \n Obviously, violations of human rights still persist, \nas reported by the United Nations experts and by non-\ngovernmental organizations. Some of the causes of \nviolations, such as racial discrimination, are persistent \nand take place in new forms. New issues of human \nrights have also arisen. Concerns related to security \nand counter-terrorism seem to have contributed to a \ndiminished care for human rights in some societies. \nThe abhorrent practice of torture has gained a degree of \nacceptance, which should be a cause for serious \nconcern for all those who take human rights seriously. \nArmed conflicts continue to produce atrocities and \nmassive violations of human rights.  \n Those phenomena must be met with resolute \ncounteraction. Human rights institutions need to be \nstrengthened and supported. Human rights education \ndeserves higher priority. The principle of the \nresponsibility to protect must be given real meaning \nand real teeth through diplomatic and other action. The \nInternational Criminal Court has to be accepted and \nmade effective as the key institution for punishing \nperpetrators of war crimes, crimes against humanity \nand genocide. Violations of human rights have to be \ncombated wherever they occur. \n But in addition, there is an even more \nfundamental reality that affects the actual enjoyment of \nhuman rights by all. The Universal Declaration \nproclaimed, in its article 28, that everyone is entitled to \na social and international order in which their human \nrights can be fully realized. The authors of the \nDeclaration realistically envisaged the long-term nature \nof the effort for human rights. Guided by that spirit, the \nGeneral Assembly adopted, in 1986, its Declaration on \nthe Right to Development, a right which became \nrecognized as universal at the World Conference on \nHuman Rights held in Vienna in 1993. That was a \nsignificant and realistic recognition of the intrinsic link \n \n \n19 08-51749 \n \nbetween two fundamental human aspirations: the one \nfor human freedom and the other for human \ndevelopment. In subsequent years, the United Nations \nalso developed a comprehensive understanding of what \ndevelopment is and what it means in our era. That \nunderstanding was elaborated at a series of global \nconferences in the 1990s and summarized in the year \n2000 in the form of the agreement on global \ndevelopment goals. \n The vision exists and practical progress, while \nstill uneven, is visible. The high-level meeting on \nAfrica last Monday strengthened the existing global \nconsensus about the immediate priorities for Africa, \nincluding more effective financing for development. \nThe panel discussions on the Millennium Development \nGoals tomorrow will be an opportunity to discuss the \nkey issues of today, in particular those emerging from \nthe current food crisis. I also hope that the proposal of \nthe Secretary-General for a summit to consider \nprogress in the achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals in 2010 will gain wide support. \n Those and other discussions also help in \nanswering my second question: does the United \nNations know the strategic direction in which the \ntransformational effort must be concentrated today? \nYes, the Millennium Development Goals are part of the \nanswer, but it is already clear that global \ndevelopment \u2014 now and in the foreseeable future \u2014 \nwill vitally depend on the preservation of our natural \nenvironment and, in particular, on how we address the \nproblems of energy and global warming. The battle for \nour common, global future will be won \u2014 or lost \u2014 on \nthe environmental front, and that is where the main \ntransformational effort has to take place. There is no \ntime to lose. \n Earlier this year, the European Union, under the \npresidency of my country, Slovenia, adopted a plan of \nactivities to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. \nYesterday, President Sarkozy of France, the current \nPresident of the European Council, reiterated the \nEuropean Union commitment to the success of the Bali \nroad map and the Copenhagen conference to be held \nnext year. In the meantime \u2014 and I wish to emphasize \nthis \u2014 progress must be made at the conference in \nPoznan, Poland, and in the process leading to the \nCopenhagen conference and to the final global \nagreement. \n But those efforts will succeed only if an adequate \npartnership is established among the key economic and \npolitical players. Partnership between the European \nUnion, the United States, Japan, China, India and the \nGroup of 77 countries is essential. The existing \nenvironmental challenges call for a transformational \napproach to the way the world consumes energy, the \nway it develops technology and the way it pursues \ndevelopment. Incremental change will not do. Global \ncooperation is essential. Obviously \u2014 and I would \nunderline this \u2014 the responsibilities of the developed \nand the developing countries are not the same. They \nare differentiated. But the world as a whole has to \nmove ahead and the United Nations has to get the \ndirection right. Transformation is the order of the day. \n My third question relates to the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security and the necessary \ntransformation in that area. Allow me to state right at \nthe outset that there is a serious need for \ntransformation of the existing institutions in the field \nof international security. \n The international security landscape today offers \na mixed picture. After the end of the cold war, there \nwere moments of high hopes and moments of deep \ndisappointment. There were successes and failures, \nincluding the failure to prevent genocide. But we also \nhave to point out that the overall number of armed \nconflicts has been declining for more than a decade \nnow. That is an encouraging development indeed, and \nit is in no small measure due to the contribution of the \nUnited Nations, which has steadily increased its \nexperience and its capacity in peacekeeping, post-\nconflict peacebuilding and, to some extent, preventive \ndiplomacy. The role of the Secretary-General has been \nstrengthened in all those areas. \n The progress made so far has established a degree \nof confidence in the capacity of the international \nsecurity structures and their key players to cooperate \nand, even more, to work in partnership for the \nmaintenance of international peace and security. \nHowever, it appears that the confidence developed thus \nfar is still fragile and that remnants of the cold war \nmentality are still in existence. Further efforts are \ntherefore needed. Those efforts, in my opinion, involve \ntwo basic sets of tasks.  \n The first set of tasks relates to the development of \npartnerships to address the key security issues, in \nparticular those in the Middle East, the Caucasus, the \n  \n \n08-51749 20 \n \nBalkans and several regions of Africa. In all those \nareas, there has been a degree of success in \nestablishing cooperation and partnership among the \nkey regional and global players working for peace. \nModels of concerted diplomacy such as the one \nestablished to deal with the issues of North Korea can \nand should inspire preventive diplomacy and \npeacemaking in other parts of the world. \n The second set of tasks is equally urgent. \nImmediate consideration has to be given to a \ntransformation of the existing security structures. \nReform of the Security Council is long overdue. \nIncremental improvements of its working methods, \nwhile welcome, are far from sufficient. The time is ripe \nfor changes in the Council\u2019s structure. I believe that the \nmembership of the Security Council should be \nexpanded, and that that should be done in three \ndirections. First, there should be six additional \npermanent members from every region of the world. \nSecondly, there should be an additional category of \nnon-permanent members with a more frequent rotation, \nsix in any particular composition of the Security \nCouncil, and they should be elected in accordance with \na formula to be determined by the General Assembly \nand alternate every second two-year term. Thirdly, the \nremaining eight non-permanent members would be \nelected in accordance with the principle of equitable \ngeographic distribution. This three-point idea means \nthat the total size of the reformed Security Council \nwould not exceed 25 members; it would be a 25-\nmember Council. It would be a more representative \nCouncil and, I believe, a more effective one.  \n I offer those ideas on reform of the Security \nCouncil to you, Mr. President, to use in the coming \nefforts for Council reform. It is widely accepted that \nthat work needs to progress towards a successful \nconclusion. Success in Council reform would represent \na key contribution to the transformation of the \ninternational security architecture. Together with other \nmajor projects of the United Nations, it would \nconstitute a significant contribution to the \nimprovement of the world. \n Allow me to conclude. Is all of this new? In a \ncertain sense, yes, because some of the specific tasks \nand specific projects are new. But more deeply, the \nanswer is that all of this has to do with continuity. The \nUnited Nations has, from its inception, represented the \nhope for and the promise of an improved world. Let us \nnot betray that hope and let us live up to that promise. \nLet us work for transformation wherever necessary. Let \nus make this era the finest hour of the United Nations."

        "file_text": "I have come to this gathering \nof nations as a representative of one of the smallest \nnations on the planet. Seychelles is but a speck on the \nglobe, home to some 87,000 people \u2014 a people that \n \n \n7 08-51845 \n \nbelieves in justice, freedom and fairness. In this \nconcert of nations, every country great or small has a \nvoice. Our voice comes from the heart of a people that, \nlike countless others, lives in trepidation. I have come \nhere neither to beg nor to accuse, but to reach out to \nthe conscience of all who have gathered here at the \nUnited Nations. I ask them to feel the heartbeat of \nhumanity. \n When this great institution was founded over six \ndecades ago, its architects were motivated by noble and \njust ideals: human freedom and dignity, justice, human \nrights, peace, security, harmony and development. \nThose ideals are values that we hold dear, timeless \nvalues that are the soul of the United Nations. I have \nfaith in those values. So do the people of Seychelles. \n Have we lived up to those values? Yes, we have \naverted many wars. We have resolved many conflicts. \nBut in this age of relative peace and security, new \nenemies are staring us in the face: hunger, pandemics, \nunderdevelopment, poverty, economic turmoil, \nenvironmental degradation and the inequity of the \nglobal trading system. Those are the enemies which, if \nnot overcome, will shatter the foundation of \ncivilization. Those are the enemies that we have to \nbattle and conquer to create a better world for our \nchildren and their children. Those are the battles that \nwe have to win to save our planet. Those are the issues \nthat the modern United Nations has to grapple with and \novercome. \n Can it succeed? I believe it can. It can if we \nendow it with a new vision \u2014 a vision in which hope \nfor mankind goes beyond rhetoric; a vision that \nprovides for bold leadership, clear commitments and \ntargets so that we can focus on the greater good for \nhumankind; a vision in which leaders come together, \nsetting aside petty differences and charting a new \ncourse for the United Nations, a new road map to \nresolve the climate crisis and an appropriate framework \nfor the energy and food crisis; a vision in which \nappropriate institutional reforms are put in place and \nadequate resources mobilized to achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals; a vision that \nencompasses justice and fairness in trade and in which \nthe specificities of small island developing States are \nnot only recognized but accepted as criteria for aid to \nfurther development. \n I believe in that vision. We can all share it; we \ncan all help to make it a reality. Our deeds have to be \ngoverned by firm commitments to and perseverance in \nfinding sustainable, pragmatic and equitable solutions \nto the complex issues that threaten our very existence. \n We should abandon solutions that continue to \nenrich the rich and impoverish the poor and the \nvulnerable. When it comes to world trade, for example, \nit seems acceptable to some that wealthy countries are \nallowed to give subsidies to their farmers, as a result of \nwhich exports from developing countries become \nuncompetitive, but that developing countries are \nobliged to follow World Trade Organization rules to the \nletter, even if they undermine domestic economic \npolicies formulated to protect vulnerable sectors of \nsociety. \n We offer facilities to foreign investors to exploit \nour natural resources, which are traded for high profits \non the international market, while we receive a pittance \nin licensing fees. It is like taking a bowl of food from \nthe poor and giving them back a spoonful as a generous \ndonation. For instance, of the total value of tuna \u2014 our \n\u201cblue gold\u201d \u2014 caught and trans-shipped in our waters \nby foreign fishing vessels every year, Seychelles \nreceives only 7 per cent in revenue, comprising \nlicensing and trans-shipment fees. That situation is, to \nmy mind, unacceptable. I ask whether it is \nunreasonable to fight for a better share of the proceeds. \n On a separate but related note, while the \nprevailing situation of insecurity in international \nwaters off the coast of Somalia is of grave concern to \nthe international community, it is of graver concern to \nSeychelles, whose exclusive economic zone borders \nthat maritime zone of hazard. A little more than a week \nago, some 40 European fishing vessels lay idle in Port \nVictoria as a result of an act of piracy on one of their \nown. Such acts can have a serious impact on the \nlifeline of the second pillar of our economy at a time \nwhen we are engaging with the Bretton Woods \ninstitutions in a process of economic reforms. I wish to \nthank all our partners and friends \u2014 in particular \nFrance \u2014 for all the efforts they have deployed against \nthat scourge. \n The skewed nature of the global trade regime is \nnot the only impediment to development. I return to the \ncase of my country. The fact that we have a high \nhuman development index, ranked fiftieth in the world, \nand that we fall in the middle-income group of \ncountries excludes us from access to grants and soft \nloans that would have helped our country to develop \n  \n \n08-51845 8 \n \neven further and faster. And that is despite the fact that \ndonor organizations have confirmed that all aid, grants \nor loans that have been given to Seychelles have been \nproperly and accountably utilized for the benefit of our \npeople. It is as if we were being penalized for our \nsuccess in raising the standard of living of our people. \nWe have fallen into the so-called middle-income trap. \n Furthermore, no account is taken of the fact that \nSeychelles falls into the category of highly vulnerable \ncountries as defined by the Commonwealth \nvulnerability index. Why should our relative success be \nthe reason for the denial of access to special \ndevelopment funds, especially those addressing \neducation, water, sanitation and health? Is that the \nprice we have to pay for improving the quality of life \nof our people? Is that the price we have to pay for \ndedicating over 50 per cent of our territory to \nenvironmental conservation for the benefit of the \nwhole world? \n Our natural environment is our future, our \ntreasure trove of biodiversity. We attach the highest \nimportance to its preservation, not only for ourselves, \nbut also for the rest of the world. \n Like many other small island States, Seychelles \nremains vulnerable to the threats posed by global \nwarming, climate change and rising sea levels. These \nphenomena are linked to human activity on our planet \nthat, collectively, the nations of the world have the \npower to influence \u2014 if only we had the will to do so. \n It is not right that small island States should have \nto run the risk of being submerged by rising sea levels \nwhile some nations refuse even to acknowledge their \nresponsibility for the high levels of environmental \npollution now threatening the planet\u2019s resources. \n Despite our small size, we shall continue to lead. \nAnd we shall lead by example. By our example, we \nhave shown and will continue to show to all that \nsustainable development and the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) are achievable in our \npresent generation. \n Through our efforts and with the support of \ninternational NGOs, we have started a global \nmovement \u2014 the Global Island Partnership \u2014 to get \nall small islands and nations with islands to devote part \nof their natural resources to environmental resilience \nand sustainability. And, more recently, Seychelles set \nup the Sea Level Rise Foundation to galvanize global \naction to address the devastating impact of climate \nchange on our planet.  \n Are those worthy causes not deserving of \ninternational support, especially in the International \nYear of Planet Earth? We are running out of time, and \nwe must combine our resources and know-how to \navoid the physical damage and social and economic \ntoll that threaten us. \n Some of the greatest afflictions of humankind \ntoday are hunger, starvation and malnutrition. Today, \nfood security is our foremost concern. The challenge \nfor many Governments is to bring food to ordinary \npeople at affordable prices. The dramatic increase in \ngrain prices has led to huge increases in the price of \nbread, milk, meat and other commodities. The hungry \nare getting hungrier, more desperate and angrier. The \ndivide between rich and poor is widening day by day. \nWe are faced with the looming threat of starvation on a \nglobal scale and, with it, the prospect of violent \nupheavals. \n We can act to resolve the food crisis. First, there \nmust be political commitment. Secondly, subsidies \ngiven to farmers by the industrialized countries have to \nbe removed. Thirdly, the industrialized countries \nshould make available to the South much-needed \nresources to improve our infrastructure. Give us the \nresources, technology and infrastructure to produce \nmore food and there will be no need to help us feed \nourselves. \n Mankind has had a hand in most, if not all, of the \ncrises we face today. We gather here every year in the \nname of freedom, human rights, democracy and \nsustainable development to deliver eloquent speeches. \nIn the process, we procrastinate and bury solutions to \nour problems in reams of resolutions and declarations. \n Can we honestly say that we have got our \npriorities right? Can we say that we live in a just \nworld, where every man, woman and child enjoys the \nsame rights? Are we, as leaders, living up to the noble \ngoals for which the United Nations was set up? Let our \nconscience provide us with the answers. \n A revamped United Nations system is best placed \nto facilitate progress in all the areas I have mentioned: \nfood security, trade, climate change and energy. I am \nasking for a clear action plan. Multiple conferences and \ntalk shops are not the solution. We need a fresh and \neffective approach to global governance and I am \n \n \n9 08-51845 \n \nconvinced that with the right level of resources, and \nwith the political will and commitment, we can start to \ntackle the fundamental flaws in our global governance \nand trade regimes. I am asking the rich nations to \nsupport that endeavour and assume their collective \nglobal responsibility. \n Let those of us who believe in freedom and \ndignity show solidarity among ourselves. Let us help \neach other to overcome the obstacles in our path. Let \nus focus on a global vision for the betterment of every \nnation. \n In conclusion, I leave members with this note of \nreflection: \u201cHistory to the defeated May say Alas but \ncannot help or pardon ...\u201d W. H. Auden\u2019s words will \ndefine the future of humanity, in terms of its history. \nThe time for action is at hand. We must change, or be \nredefined by history, like many great civilizations of \nthe past. "

        "file_text": "On behalf of \nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \nthe United Nations Her Excellency Mrs. Michelle \nBachelet Jeria, President of the Republic of Chile, and \nto invite her to address the Assembly. \n \n \n15 08-51749 \n \n President Bachelet Jeria (spoke in Spanish): \nEight years ago, representatives of all the countries of \nthe planet met in the General Assembly Hall to adopt \nthe United Nations Millennium Declaration \n(resolution 55/2) \u2014 a text that is one of the broadest \nand most explicit agreements ever drafted by the \ninternational community on the subject of \ndevelopment, well-being and quality of life. The \nDeclaration set a series of very precise standards in the \nfight against hunger and poverty, education, health, \ngender equality, environment and cooperation, stating \nfor each the minimum to which nations should commit \nthemselves.  \n The world at that time announced the civilizing \nmission to which it aspired and identified the \ninescapable challenges and unavoidable tasks for any \nGovernment and for the international community. It \ndefined a real ethical vision for the leaders of the \nnations. The world has changed since then, however. \n We have witnessed, sometimes tragically, the \nemergence or reappearance of various problems of \nglobal significance, such as climate change, terrorism \nor the food crisis. At the same time, the \ninterdependence of economies and communications has \nbecome even greater over the past eight years, which \nhas undoubtedly created many opportunities but also \ngreater risks and inequities. \n In that changing context, we have witnessed \noutstanding progress towards the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals in many countries of the world, but \nwe have also witnessed many regrettable setbacks. \nWorld events over the past year give us much food for \nthought that will allow us to act decisively. The \noptimism of the turn of the century, leading to talk of \nthe \u201cmillennium of hope\u201d, seems to be dissipating. It is \nestimated that the increase in food prices alone has \ndriven more than 100 million people into extreme \npoverty. In turn, financial instability today is afflicting \nmany economies, threatening to generate a worldwide \ntrend towards recession in which \u2014 as always \u2014 those \nmost affected in the end will be the world\u2019s poorest. \n That is why it is so crucial to review our Goals. \nWe cannot remain indifferent to the deterioration of the \nbasic well-being of millions and millions of citizens all \nover the world. Those of us who share the same \nconcept of progress and have made freedom and social \njustice our watchwords must raise our voices. \n The world has managed to secure the economic, \ntechnical and scientific resources that, for the first time \nin its history, can ensure the well-being of all mankind. \nWe cannot squander that capacity. A better world is \npossible, but it requires determination to move \nforward, and the current international economic crisis \nshows that it is precisely such determination that has \nbeen lacking. \n The greed and irresponsibility of a few, combined \nwith the political negligence of others, has plunged the \nworld into a situation of great uncertainty. What a \nparadox we are witnessing today! With the money used \nto bail out the international banking system, the \nscourge of hunger on the planet could easily have been \neliminated. Thus, now is the time to reaffirm our \nresolve. \n The international economic crisis is a blow to \nthose who believe that nothing can be done, that \nnothing should be regulated or that inequality cannot \nbe remedied. That is the major lesson to be learned \nfrom what has happened over the past year. None of \nthe current problems facing mankind, and certainly \nnone of the civilizing goals that we have set ourselves, \ncan be tackled properly if the public does not have a \nclear option of collective action by States and civil \nsociety. \n That is why today I appeal to all to work together \nto support emergency measures to address the food \ncrisis and to redouble our efforts to ensure that the \ndeveloping economic crisis does not prevent us from \nattaining the Millennium Development Goals. That is \nwhy I appeal for an urgent and genuine commitment to \nmultilateralism. That is why we must undertake to \ncontinue supporting and reforming international \ninstitutions, particularly the United Nations, to make \nthem more representative, more democratic and more \nresponsive to the hopes of our peoples. \n That is also why we must reach agreement at the \nDoha Round of the World Trade Organization. That is \nwhy we must achieve concrete results at the \nforthcoming Follow-up International Conference on \nFinancing for Development. That is why we must also \nensure the success of the 2009 Copenhagen Climate \nChange Conference and convert those negotiations into \nagreements that make a decisive contribution to \ndevelopment. \n I appear before this General Assembly as the \nrepresentative of a nation that has much to contribute. \n  \n \n08-51749 16 \n \nModestly and proudly, we announce to this Assembly \nthat Chile is ahead of schedule towards achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals set for 2015. I \nemphasize that it is possible to eradicate poverty, that it \nis possible to emerge from underdevelopment and, \neven more importantly, that it is possible to do so in \ndemocracy and freedom. \n My country almost tripled the size of its economy \nbetween 1990 and 2008, which are the years of \ndemocracy in Chile. Just as we have made the economy \ngrow, we have also made social investment and equity \ngrow. We have advanced strongly on all fronts: health, \neducation, housing, quality of life, social cohesion and \ngreater gender opportunities. \n The numbers speak for themselves. At the end of \nthe dictatorship, in 1989, 4 out of every 10 Chileans \nwere living in poverty. That 40 per cent dropped to \n13 per cent in 2006. Although there is much to do, \nwhenever we achieve one goal we set ourselves a new \nhorizon of challenges. Just as we have drastically \nreduced poverty, today we aim to guarantee universal \naccess for all Chileans to a social welfare system that \nallows them to live their lives in tranquillity and \nremoves the fear of disease, poverty or old age, thus \nincreasing opportunities for all, so as to advance \nsteadily in greater equality and dignity. \n However, this morning I wish to highlight the \nreasons for those achievements. What underlies them is \na clear political determination, shared by the majority. \nThe country has freely chosen a path of economic \ngrowth, political democracy and social justice. All \npolitical sectors have converged on that path, with \ndifferences, of course, as in any democracy, but all are \naware that those are the major goals of Chilean society, \nbecause behind the achievements there is also a sad \nlearning process. \n In the past, when the country became divided, \nwhen the country became polarized in two \nirreconcilable factions, there was much suffering and \nvery great social setbacks. Democracy placed at the \ncentre of public life, as a goal for a freer and more just \nsociety, has been one of the main lessons that we \nChileans have learned and that largely explains the \nachievements of the last 18 years.  \n That same conviction led us recently to be very \nactive in coming to the aid of a friendly democracy. \nOne week ago, when there was a threat to disrupt the \ndemocratic institutional order in the Republic of \nBolivia, we nations of South America came to the \nsupport of the legitimately elected authorities and \noffered our cooperation to help in the resumption of the \ndomestic political dialogue, while condemning the \nrebellion and bloodshed. Within a few days, we \nsucceeded in convening a meeting of the Presidents of \nthe member countries of the Union of South American \nNations in Santiago de Chile, in order to agree with the \nPresident of Bolivia on a process for talks and to find \nand support a peaceful solution to the conflict in that \ncountry.  \n From this rostrum, as the convener of that \nhistoric regional meeting, I wish to express \nappreciation for the willingness displayed by all those \ninvolved, because we thereby set an example of how \nmultilateral commitment should be understood. It is a \ncommitment forged in the diversity of political projects \nbut based on shared values, such as democracy, peace \nand the defence of human rights. The La Moneda \nsummit \u2014 as that meeting was called, after the Chilean \npresidential palace \u2014 will forever symbolize the \nmoment at which the South American nations decided \nto strengthen their commitment to democracy, \nwhenever it is threatened anywhere on the continent. \n Yet what does that episode tell us? It tells us that \nthe values of democracy, dialogue, human rights and \npeace are becoming stronger than ever in Latin \nAmerica. It tells us that the region wants to leave \nbehind the dark moments of its history. It tells us that \ndemocracy is established as a system of government. It \ntells us that violence has no place in politics. And it \ntells us that those values, in addition to being widely \nshared by the citizens, are becoming entrenched in \nmultilateralism, in institutions and in international law. \n Over these years, we have learned that national \npolicies, although essential, are not enough, that there \nis no incompatibility between affirmation of one\u2019s own \nidentity and integration, and that international \nagreements must be formulated to govern globalization \nand make democracy and the social rights of the \ncitizens a universal requirement. Each country has the \nright and the duty to contribute to the creation of a \nworld in which the great values of mankind prevail, \nregardless of the country\u2019s economic or demographic \ndimension, of its influence or its power, or of how \nclose it is to or how far it is from the hubs where \ndecisions that affect the lives of each and every one of \nthe planet\u2019s inhabitants are taken. \n \n \n17 08-51749 \n \n From our position at the south of the world, Chile \nis cooperating. We have enthusiastically supported, and \nin some cases promoted, the most diverse initiatives in \npursuit of the development of our peoples. A few days \nago, in Santiago de Chile, together with the Prime \nMinister of Norway, we launched an important regional \ninitiative for the attainment of Millennium \nDevelopment Goals 4 and 5 in Latin America and the \nCaribbean. Under that initiative, Chile will cooperate \nin the assignment and training of troops in Bolivia, \nEcuador and other countries of the region. However, \nwhen we say \u201ctroops\u201d, we are not talking about \nsoldiers. It will be a force of nurses, midwives and \ndoctors specialized in maternal and child health, who \nwill travel through the fields and mountain ranges of \nour America, delivering babies, helping mothers, \nproviding vaccinations and caring for sick children. \nBecause despite the progress made in that regard in \nrecent years, which has increased the percentage of \nattended births from 78 to 89 per cent, still 22,000 \nmothers die in Latin America each year simply because \nthey received no professional care. Despite the \nimprovement in child mortality, 400,000 Latin \nAmerican children under five years of age are still \ndying each year \u2014 hence, the urgency of that initiative, \nwhich is the urgency of promoting democracy and the \nsocial development of our people. \n In just over two months, the world will have a \nnoble reason for celebration. It will be the sixtieth \nanniversary of the adoption of the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights. What a great step \nforward for mankind. That transcendental charter of \nrights marked the beginning of the end of centuries and \ncenturies of arbitrary action, death, torture and abuse \nof power. Certainly that charter did not represent an \nimmediate solution, but it did mean the beginning of \nthe largest and most effective social and political \nmobilization in favour of people\u2019s dignity. \n Today, those who violate that charter sully their \nreputation with the international community. We have \ngone even further by creating an international \narchitecture of protection and legal advancement, in \nwhich my region set a great precedent with the inter-\nAmerican human rights protection system. \n We hope that something similar will happen with \nthe Millennium Declaration. We want it to become an \nethical and political requirement for all the world\u2019s \nrulers. We want the citizens of every country to protest \nagainst famine, poverty and unsanitary conditions. We \nwant discrimination against women to be reason for \nshame for all those who practise it. We want \ndiscrimination against native peoples to be eliminated \nfrom the face of the Earth. We want protection of the \nenvironment to be part of the vocabulary of every \ninhabitant of the planet and, definitely, of the priorities \nof every Government in the world. We want \ncooperation by those who have the most to be a \npolitical as well as a moral obligation. That is Chile\u2019s \nachievable desire, which we have come to present to \nthis General Assembly."

        "file_text": "I would like to join previous \nspeakers in offering Mr. d\u2019Escoto Brockmann my \nwarm congratulations on his election to the presidency \nof the General Assembly. \n As this is first time that I am here to address this \nAssembly, whose main objectives include the \npromotion of democracy and economic self-reliance, I \nam happy to record that the Kingdom of Tonga has \nbeen undertaking some historical and fundamental \neconomic and political reforms over the past few years. \n Eight years ago, the United Nations adopted the \nhistoric Millennium Declaration, offering new hope to \npeople living in poverty around the world. Yesterday \nwe met to review the progress we have made to date. \nThis midterm review provides us with yet another \nopportunity to assess our overall achievements, draw \nattention to the constraints and gaps and renew our \npolitical commitment to the achievement of the targets \nthat we set for the year 2015. \n While some progress has been made globally in \nregard to poverty reduction, there is yet much more \nwork to be done. Hardship and poverty have \ntraditionally not been an issue of serious concern in the \nKingdom of Tonga, but they are now becoming one. \nExternal influences are changing people\u2019s attitudes and \naspirations, straining the traditional Tongan social \nsystem in which everyone\u2019s needs were met by the \ncommunity as a whole. \n A recent study has found that although there are \nno families living in absolute poverty, there is a small \nproportion of the population living in hardship. \nPopulation growth, changes in lifestyle and the gradual \nbreakdown of the traditional social and family systems \nhave contributed to those increased hardships. But the \nmain cause has been our lack of foresight, drive and \ndetermination to retain much of that traditional spirit of \nself-reliance and self-sufficiency that has served us \nwell for centuries. That is the main challenge for Tonga \ntoday \u2014 to be more self-reliant and more self-\nsufficient, given the natural resources readily available \nto us within our own national borders. \n The main theme of the general debate this year \u2014 \nthe impact of the global food crisis on poverty and \nhunger in the world \u2014 is most timely. We all should \nlook upon this crisis as an opportunity to redouble our \nefforts and refocus on policy actions that would help \nboost agricultural production in order to build greater \nself-reliance and self-sufficiency. Development aid can \nassist, but in the long term there is no substitute for a \nmore dynamic and productive agricultural sector. \nGreater self-reliance is the ultimate goal for which \nKingdom of Tonga strives. \n Tonga\u2019s performance under the United Nations \nHuman Development Index continues to reflect a high \nlevel of expenditure and investment in the social \nsectors, including health and education. The United \nNations Human Development Report for 2008 ranks \nTonga 55 out of a total of 177 countries. Tonga has \nachieved targets such as universal primary education \nand gender equality through the provision of free \nprimary school education. \n Tonga shares the concern that the President \nexpressed about the impact of climate change on small \nisland States. In his prepared remarks for his opening \nstatement on assuming the presidency last week, he \nemphasized that the negotiations process on agreed \nlong-term actions initiated in Bali \n\u201cmust be guided by a single consideration: saving \nthose small island States that today live in danger \nof disappearing entirely as nations. This is the \nreal challenge of our day and this should be our \nimmediate concern.\u201d \n And so it should be. For already, the prospect of \nclimate refugees from some of the Pacific Island \nForum countries is no longer merely a prospect but a \nreality, with relocations of communities already being \nrelocated due to the rise in sea level. Urgent action \nmust be taken now. \n Last month in Niue, the leaders of the Pacific \nIsland Forum countries endorsed, for the first time, a \nregional declaration on climate change as part of the \nForum\u2019s communiqu\u00e9. The Niue Declaration duly \nrecognizes the serious current impact of climate change \nand the growing threat it poses to economic, social, \ncultural and environmental well-being as well as to the \nsecurity of Pacific island countries. Therefore, the \nPacific small island developing States will introduce a \ndraft resolution entitled \u201cClimate change and security\u201d \nduring the current session of the General Assembly. I \ncommend the draft resolution to Member States for \ntheir consideration and support. \n Tonga welcomes the resources and technical \nassistance that will become available through \ninitiatives such as Japan\u2019s Cool Earth Promotion \nProgramme, the European Union\u2019s Global Climate \n \n \n33 08-52265 \n \nChange Alliance, Australia\u2019s National Climate \nAdaptation Programme for the Pacific and the increase \nin New Zealand\u2019s financial support for climate change \nadaptation. \n This year marks the tenth anniversary of the \nnormalization of relations between Nuku\u2019alofa and \nBeijing. This milestone has reaffirmed Tonga\u2019s \ncommitment to the observance of the One China \npolicy, with the state of relations and economic \ncooperation between our two countries continuing to \nflourish and prosper. \n Tonga welcomes the reform process and debates \nunder way in international institutions. We share the \nview that the United Nations has a unique role and \nlegitimacy and acknowledge the reforms that are \noccurring to strengthen the coherence of the United \nNations system and, in particular, the efficacy of its \ndevelopment and humanitarian activities. It is vital that \nthe United Nations contribute to developing a global \nframework of rules and collective action in an \ninclusive and democratic manner. As a member of the \nCommonwealth, Tonga joined others in Kampala in \n2007, and most recently in London earlier this year, in \nexpressing concern that the current architecture of \ninternational institutions does not respond adequately \nto the challenges facing the small island States and \nenvironmental governance. \n The longstanding debate on the reform of the \nSecurity Council, now over 10 years old, remains \nfraught with uncertainty and an inability to reach \nagreement on improving fundamental aspects of the \nCouncil, including the questions of equitable \nrepresentation and an increase in its membership. In \nour opinion, the forthcoming intergovernmental \nnegotiations present a further opportunity for Member \nStates to advance this debate to a successful \nconclusion. Tonga continues to maintain its support for \nJapan\u2019s proper and permanent place in any enhanced \nCouncil. \n Last year from this podium, we provided details \nof how our Legislative Assembly approved a timetable \nfor the implementation of reforms by 2010, leading to \ngreater democratization of our political system. \n His Majesty King George Tupou V is the driving \nforce guiding the political reform process on which we \nhave embarked as a nation. He holds the view that the \nmonarchy is an instrument of change and not an \nobstacle to it. He has for some years, therefore, \nencouraged the Government to take the necessary \nmeasures to bring about a more democratic form of \ngovernment, one in line with the aspirations of his \npeople and with the changing circumstances of our \nglobalized world. \n In July this year, royal assent was granted to the \nConstitution and Electoral Commission Act of 2008. Its \nmain task is to consider the constitutional and electoral \nimplications of the resolutions of the Legislative \nAssembly and to draft the necessary bills for \nconsideration and enactment. \n Tonga was the first Pacific State to present its \nnational report at the second session of the Human \nRights Council\u2019s Universal Periodic Review earlier this \nyear. I wish to thank New Zealand for assisting in the \nfunding of the preparation of the report and also those \nMember States who took the opportunity to contribute \nconstructively to the review dialogue on the human \nrights situation in Tonga, as well as those who made \npledges of financial and technical support. \n In our globalized world, no sovereign nation can \nachieve its goals of progress, peace and security on its \nown, and that includes the Kingdom of Tonga. \nConstructive and active engagement in regional and \ninternational affairs through bilateral and multilateral \ncooperation mechanisms, with the United Nations at \nthe centre, and greater, yet appropriate, integration into \nthe global economy will thus continue to be the \ncornerstone of Tonga\u2019s foreign policy. \n As a Member of the United Nations, Tonga \nwishes to reaffirm its commitment to continuing its \nactive involvement in the work of the United Nations \nas the central body coordinating the common efforts of \nthe family of nations to which we all belong."

        "file_text": "First of all, I \nwould like to congratulate Mr. d\u2019Escoto Brockmann on \nhis well-deserved election to preside over the \nsixty-third session of the General Assembly. The \nsustained increase in the cost of energy, the growing \ndemand for oil by industrialized countries and \nemerging economies, higher food prices, the lack of \narable land and water in many regions and climate \nchange are only some of the indicators of \nnon-conventional threats to security that we all face \ntoday and increasingly in the future.  \n But crises also offer opportunities. Throughout \nthe decades, hundreds of millions of people all over the \nworld abandon their ancestral lands and move to cities \nin search of work and a better life, as Governments \nfocus their attention and resources on cities and \nneglected rural populations. But as urban populations \nswell in numbers, the dream of a better life is turning \ninto desperation. However, the twenty-first century \nmay witness their return to their places of origin, if \nGovernments can learn from this crisis and seriously \ninvest in job creation programmes for rural areas, \nparticularly in agriculture, in order to increase food \nproduction. \n Increasing food costs, whatever the cause may be, \nare neutralizing the progress achieved in many \ndeveloping countries towards the achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals. If the international \ncommunity does not redouble and coordinate its efforts \nto significantly boost development assistance and \nmarket access, it will be nearly impossible for poor, \nnon-oil-producing countries to achieve even the modest \ngoals that we had set for them in 2001 with a view to \nreducing poverty in the world by half by 2015. Donor \ncountries must quickly readapt their aid for \ndevelopment, emphasizing agriculture, particularly in \nsupport of small family and community projects, \npreservation of land and rainwater recovery, by \nincreasing the percentage of official development \nassistance (ODA) from a modest 3 per cent in 2006 to \nat least 30 per cent. I note that in 1980, the percentage \nof all foreign aid dedicated to agriculture was 17 per \ncent, which had dropped to 2.9 per cent by 2006. \nTimor-Leste accordingly supports the initiative of the \nSecretary-General to establish a High-Level Task Force \non the Global Food Security Crisis and an integrated \nframework in order to deal with immediate food needs \nworldwide and to provide the most vulnerable \ncountries with the capacity they need to become self-\nsufficient. \n As a newly independent country, Timor-Leste has \nbenefited much from the generosity of the international \ncommunity. Donors will say that they have contributed \nhundreds of millions of dollars to my country in the \nlast few years, and that is true. However, we must ask \nourselves if the aid has helped to improve the lives of \nthe majority of our population. The answer is yes and \nno. But we all could do better if the bulk of the aid was \nnot used to cover the costs of the endless study \nmissions and redundant reports, but was invested on \nthe ground in small rural development initiatives. \n(spoke in English) \n Timor-Leste is a least developed country. \nHowever, Almighty God has bestowed on us some \nmodest oil, gas and other mineral wealth. Our oil and \ngas revenues are modest, averaging only $100 million \nto $150 million a month. It could be argued that, for a \ncountry of slightly over one million people, this \namount is not too bad. By the end of this year, our \nPetroleum Fund, which was established in 2005, will \nhave accumulated in excess of $3 billion, all invested \nin United States treasury bonds. A writer in The \nEconomist recently stated that those who invest in \nUnited States treasury bonds are people who like to \nlose money. We may be among them. We agree with \nthat remark, and Timor-Leste is seeking to reinvest our \nmodest revenues in diversified portfolios around the \nworld. \n While our first obligation is to make use of our \noil wealth for the sustainable development of our \ncountry and to address the immediate needs of our \npoorest, we are not indifferent to the suffering of our \nfellow human beings in other parts of the world. When \nthe Asia region was hit in December 2005 by a tsunami \nof major proportions, our Government immediately \ncontributed $50,000 for the victims in Indonesia, and \n \n \n9 08-51851 \n \nour citizens took up their own collection of donations \nand raised an additional $70,000. \n Now, in response to several natural disasters that \nhave affected tens of millions of our fellow human \nbeings, Timor-Leste promptly decided to donate \n$500,000 for the victims of the earthquake that hit the \nChinese province of Sichuan; $500,000 for the victims \nof Cyclone Nargis that hit Myanmar on 2 May, to be \nchannelled through the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN) Secretariat; and $500,000 for Cuba \nto assist the victims of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, to \nbe channelled directly to the Cuban authorities. \nStarting in 2009, Timor-Leste will contribute \n$1 million annually to assist child-related programmes \nin Myanmar and Somalia through United Nations \nagencies like UNICEF and the Office of the \nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \n(UNHCR). \n We believe that, even though we are poor, or \nbecause we are poor, we should better understand and \nfeel the pain of the poorest of the poor and must be \namong the first to help others less fortunate than us. \n In my address today, I shall touch upon three \ninternational issues: Myanmar, the United States \nembargo against Cuba and the question of Western \nSahara. \n Timor-Leste\u2019s stance on Myanmar is aligned with \nthe stance taken by our immediate neighbours in the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations. We believe in \nparticular that while strong denunciations of abuses are \njustifiable and that sanctions might be morally \njustifiable, there cannot be a long-term solution in \nMyanmar without the consent and full partnership of \nthat country\u2019s army. Hence, the challenge for those \ninvolved is to persuade the military that their own \ninterests as a group will not be compromised in any \nfuture democratic arrangement. Any other strategy \nseeking to sideline the military or that the military sees \nas undermining their power and future safety will not \nsucceed and will only prolong the agony of all in that \nsad country. \n Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, which brought \ndevastation to the Caribbean, ruined the Cuban \neconomy. The country\u2019s material losses are staggering, \nwith initial estimates showing the losses to approach a \ntotal of at least $5 billion. Timor-Leste has nearly \n700 East Timorese medical students in Cuba, and over \n140 East Timorese are studying medicine in our \nnational university with Cuban medical instructors. In \naddition, there are nearly 300 Cuban doctors working \nin our country, distributed through all districts and \nsub-districts. Cuban adult education specialists assist \nus in our adult literacy campaign, benefiting thousands \nof adults. The costs of those programmes are borne \nalmost entirely by Cuba. \n Mr. Siles Alvarado (Bolivia), Vice-President, took \nthe Chair. \n While I commend the United States and any \ncountry that stands for universal democratic values and \nthat provides moral support for those promoting \ndemocracy in their own countries, I submit that \npunitive measures imposed on poor developing \ncountries for the perceived sins of their leaders cannot \nbe morally justified. \n As a friend of the United States, I humbly appeal \nto its next Administration and to Congress to lift the \nembargo against Cuba. Such a gesture would be \nhonourable, and my admiration for the United States \nwould only increase. As it is, as I witness the impact of \nUnited States sanctions on a small developing country, \nas well as its refusal to provide unconditional \nassistance to Cuba following the devastation caused by \nHurricanes Gustav and Ike, my heart bleeds in sorrow \nand my admiration for the United States seriously \ndiminishes. In that connection, I wish to express once \nagain our most heartfelt sympathy and solidarity with \nthe people of Haiti and others in the Caribbean region \nwho were affected by the recent natural disasters. \n With regard to the situation in Western Sahara, \nTimor-Leste is guided by the stance taken by the \nregional organization that is most competent on this \nmatter \u2014 the African Union \u2014 and guided by the \nrelevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the \nSecurity Council and the Advisory Opinion of the \nInternational Court of Justice, all of which clearly and \nunequivocally recognize the inalienable right of the \npeople of Western Sahara to self-determination. That is \nthe core of the issue and the root cause of the ongoing \nconflict. Hence, Timor-Leste joins with the African \nUnion in calling for strict respect for the inalienable \nright of the Saharawi people to self-determination. \n I now turn to the situation in my own country. On \n11 February, I was shot and nearly died as a result. I \nescaped by an act of God and thanks to the \nprofessionalism and dedication of doctors and nurses at \nthe Australian army medical centre in Dili and the \n  \n \n08-51851 10 \n \ndoctors and nurses at the Royal Darwin Hospital. To \nthem, and to all who have prayed for my life and my \nrecovery, I once again express my eternal gratitude. I \nstood at the frontier between life and death; I saw the \ndarkness of death and the beauty of life, which I nearly \nleft behind. \n The attack against Prime Minister Gusm\u00e3o and \nmyself shocked the nation, and my near-death served to \nunite the people in opposing violence. Since then, the \nsituation in Timor-Leste has been more peaceful than it \nhas been in many years, without any politically \nmotivated violence so far; even common crime has \nbeen significantly reduced. The Government, led by \nMr. Gusm\u00e3o, a resistance hero, has made enormous \nefforts in stabilizing the country and delivering \nservices to the people. Progress is visible. A growing \nnumber of internally displaced persons are returning \nhome. Most camps are now empty. More than \n700 former soldiers involved in the 2006 mutiny have \naccepted a Government financial package and have \nreturned home. \n On the economic front, our real gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) will show a 7 per cent increase by the \nend of this year. However, if oil and gas revenues are \nfactored in, our economic growth will be \napproximately 19 per cent. While our real annual GDP \nper capita is less than $400, that figure jumps to more \nthan $4,000 if oil and gas revenues are factored in. \nHowever, we would not have succeeded in pulling back \nfrom the brink without the prompt and steadfast \nsupport of the international community. I thank the \nSecretary-General and, through him, the entire \nUnited Nations family, in particular those serving in \nmy country in various capacities, for their selfless \ncontributions to the preservation of peace in \nTimor-Leste. \n I also thank Australia and New Zealand for \nmaintaining a robust and credible security force in my \ncountry in support of, and in close coordination with, \nour Government and the United Nations Integrated \nMission in Timor-Leste, under the leadership of \nMr. Atul Khare, Special Representative of the \nSecretary-General, who is a most compassionate \nhuman being and a dedicated and tireless professional. \n The professionalism of the International Security \nForces is visible to all, and the behaviour of the \nsoldiers is irreproachable. The same can be said of the \nUnited Nations police force in my country, comprising \npolice from 40 countries, with particular reference to \nformed police units from Portugal, Pakistan, Malaysia \nand Bangladesh. We are blessed by the Almighty with \nnon-negligible resources, and we can count on the \ngenerosity of our development partners, but challenges \nremain complex and multifaceted. However, I am \nconfident that, with a shared vision and a commitment \nto serve the poorest of the poor, we will meet the \nMillennium Development Goals. We cannot fail. We \nshall not fail. "

That trust is sustained by democratic \nsecurity, security for socially responsible investment \nand the construction of social cohesion. \n Crimes against the safety of citizens continue to \ndecrease, but we are not satisfied. So far this year, the \nnumber of crimes has fallen by 30 per cent in \ncomparison to the same period last year. We have \nprioritized the protection of union leaders, teachers and \njournalists. Of the 11,204 homicides committed as of \n10 September, 36 were of workers and teachers \naffiliated with trade unions or independent teachers. To \ndate, not a single journalist has been murdered. The \nGovernment grants individual protection to 8,612 \ncitizens, 1,462 of whom belong to trade unions. \n Our determination to combat impunity is \nongoing. Between 1991 and 2001, only two \nconvictions were handed down. Thanks to efforts in \nrecent years in terms of budgeting, the strengthening of \nthe judicial system, the security policy and the \ntripartite agreement among workers, business leaders \nand the Government, sponsored by the International \nLabour Organization, 199 persons have been convicted \nfor the murder of workers and 134 of them are in \nprison. Of the 123 sentences handed down, 85 have \noccurred in the past three years. \n In the past, terrorist organizations penetrated the \nlabour movement, resulting in the murder of workers. \nThe dismantling of the paramilitaries has eliminated \nthat source of suffering, but terrorist guerrillas persist \nin committing such crimes, as recently happened in the \nsouth of the country with the murder of a group of \nteachers by the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de \nColombia-Ej\u00e9rcito del Pueblo (FARC). \n Recently, our tranquillity in the absence of \nterrorist attacks was shattered by a car bomb set off by \nFARC, which destroyed the palace of justice in the city \nof Cali and left several people dead and others injured, \nas well as many poor families with their small \nbusinesses and homes destroyed. \n Of the approximately 60,000 terrorists that \nravaged the country at the start of the Government\u2019s \nterm of office, 48,000 have abandoned their criminal \norganizations and joined the reintegration programme, \nwhich is a great challenge for Colombia. As of \n  \n \n08-51839 14 \n \n17 September this year, 2,436 guerrilla members \u2014\n2,147 of them from FARC \u2014 had been demobilized. \n In a democracy of opinion such as ours, the \nsustainability of democratic security depends on its \ncredibility, which in turn is based on effectiveness and \ntransparency. That transparency is tantamount to the \nobservance of the fundamental human rights we all \nenjoy. From that foundation comes our respect for \nliberties in the midst of the fight against terrorism and \nfor openness, vigilance, criticism and debate at the \nnational and international levels. \n Furthermore, a formative, world-leading effort in \nhuman rights within our armed forces is crucial, as is \nthe ongoing adjustment of operative protocols through \nsuch measures as that requiring soldiers to wait for the \npresence of a judicial delegate before moving the body \nof a member of a criminal organization killed in action. \nWe are also resolved to investigate and assist in the \ninvestigation of any type of accusation and the \nmodernization of military criminal legislation. \n On 10 December, our country will voluntarily \nsubmit our human rights record to the Universal \nPeriodic Review, a new mechanism created by the \nUnited Nations that is an additional contribution to the \npublic discussion of our new road map on the matter. \nOur work with the Office of the High Commissioner \nfor Human Rights and with the Organization of \nAmerican States on the policy of truth, justice and \nredress for victims must, along with our historic \nmemory, heal wounds and help to extinguish the flames \nof violence forever. \n There are intangible results of democratic \nsecurity. Citizens have greater faith in the State and \nturn to it for protection, overcoming the past \nindifference of some and the inclination of many to \nsolve problems by their own means. Additionally, we \nhave recovered the State monopoly on weapons and on \nofficial justice. Citizens have lost their fear of \ndenouncing others, testifying and cooperating with the \narmed forces and the justice system. Victims are no \nlonger fearful and today are coming forward to claim \ntheir rights. \n One year ago, I looked out at this Assembly in the \nfrustration of not having been able to rescue Ingrid \nBetancourt and those held in captivity with her. Today, \nthanks to the heroism, planning and bloodless \neffectiveness of our soldiers, Ingrid Betancourt is a \nsymbol of freedom \u2014 the freedom to which we aspire \nas we liberate those who remain in captivity and put an \nend to such shameful crimes in our homeland. \n Social cohesion validates security. Meeting the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) set for 2015 \nis an urgent need for us as an essential part of building \nsocial cohesion. We are close to reaching the goal of no \nmore than 3 per cent of children under the age of five \nbeing malnourished. We are determined to reach zero \nand are now beginning to provide early schooling to \nthose children. \n By 2010, we hope to have reached 100 per cent in \nbasic education coverage. Towards the goal of \naveraging 10.6 years of education for the population \nbetween ages 15 and 24, we have already achieved an \naverage of more than nine years. The number of \nstudents having to repeat a grade has decreased from \n6.1 per cent to 3.3 per cent, towards a goal of  \n2.3 per cent. \n Mortality rates for children under five years of \nage have fallen from 37 to 20 per 1,000 births, with a \ngoal of 17. That same indicator for children younger \nthan one year has decreased from 31 to 15.6, with a \ngoal of 14. Vaccination coverage is almost at \n95 per cent, the percentage defined in the MDGs for \n2015. Our great challenge is to reduce the pronounced \ndisparities between regions. \n Despite the economy\u2019s problems, we are still \nfully determined to meet the social goals through such \nprogrammes as Families in Action, Bank of \nOpportunities and the Together Network, which \nfocuses social tools on the poorest spheres. That is all \nsupported by very ambitious goals in the areas of child \nnutrition, educational quality and coverage, vocational \ntraining, health insurance, connectivity and good \nmanagement of social resources. With regard to the \nlatter, our administrative reform, which has already \nbeen extended to 411 State entities, seeks to prevent \nthe State from being discredited, eliminating \nbureaucratic wastefulness and achieving social \nefficiency. \n The mortgage and financial crises are minor \nproblems compared to the threats to the environment. \nAlthough Colombia produces 0.35 per cent of world \ngreenhouse gas emissions, we are highly vulnerable to \nthe ravages of climate change resulting from melting \nice and floods. More than 51 per cent of our territory is \npreserved as rainforest and is a major net contributor of \noxygen. \n \n \n15 08-51839 \n \n Some of our most important environmental \nprogrammes include the building of mass \ntransportation systems in nine cities, with plans under \nway for 10 more; a network of 66,000 rural families \nworking as forest rangers, who are paid by the State to \nmaintain collective areas free from illicit crops and to \nsupervise the recovery and conservation of forests \nunder the oversight of the United Nations; the \nconservation of 257 protected natural areas; the \nimplementation of aqueduct and basic sanitation \nprojects in the country\u2019s 32 departments and the 1,102 \nmunicipalities; and the promotion of alternative energy \nsources such as wind power and biofuels. \n There are three common objections to biofuels: \nthe risk of destroying the rainforest, the elimination of \nareas for agricultural food production, and the small \namount of energy generated compared to that used to \nproduce it. Colombia has 578,000 square kilometres of \nrainforest and 43 million hectares of savannah. We will \nnot allow the rainforest to be touched. Protecting it is \nour main contribution to combating global warming. \nWith the available savannah, we can expand our \nagricultural production concentrated in 5 million \nhectares, increase the number of livestock to 24 million \nheads of cattle and, without affecting food production, \ndevelop a large biofuel industry that generates good \nquality jobs, increases income and becomes an \nalternative to coca, which fuels terrorism. Our \nproductivity is high, thanks to sources of energy such \nas sugar cane and the African oil palm, which also \nprotects the soil from direct sunlight and prevents \nerosion. For every energy unit used, 8 energy units of \nethanol are produced, or 6.5 units in biodiesel. \n Illicit drugs are a great enemy of the \nenvironment, and they fuel terrorism. Colombia still \nsuffers from violence because of illicit drugs. We speak \nof shared responsibility not to assign exclusive \nresponsibilities to consumer countries, for, unfortunately, \nour young people also use drugs. We speak of shared \nresponsibility to spur the world to combat production, \ntrafficking, consumption, asset laundering and \nchemical precursors on an equal basis. Our \nGovernment requests that consumption be punished in \nour country and across the international community. \nWe have extradited more than 800 persons. This year, \nwe must spray 130,000 hectares of coca crops, while \nanother 100,000 must be manually eradicated. Over the \npast five years, 10,000 properties have been \nconfiscated. However, there has been no significant \nreduction in illicit crop areas and consumption is on \nthe rise.  \n Let us consider that situation. It is more difficult \nto carry out prevention and rehabilitation efforts \nagainst the backdrop of exponential growth in \nconsumption resulting from a permissive attitude. The \ndestruction of the rainforest to plant coca, the erosion \nof the soil and the pollution caused by chemical \nprecursors are enormous affronts on the environmental \nbalance. Whoever buys a personal dose of illicit drugs \nencourages a child to become a distributor and, later, a \nfeared criminal. Whoever buys a personal dose of illicit \ndrugs helps to set off a car bomb in Colombia and to \ndestroy four trees from our Amazon rainforest. \n Investors from all over the world are coming to \nColombia every day. Twice as many tourists, from \nevery corner of the world, are visiting our country as \nwere five years ago. Many of those who looked on our \ncountry with scepticism and spoke about Colombia as a \nfailed State can now discern clear signals of \ninstitutional strength and democratic boldness. \nColombia today generates more trust and respect, but \nthe work goes on. To free us all from the horrors of \ndrug trafficking, terrorism and poverty, we need more \nresolute support from the international community. I \nwould very much like to thank the United Nations for \nits very significant presence in our country. "

        "file_text": "I offer my \ncongratulations to Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann on \nhis election as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-third session. I wish him every success. \n The United Nations mandate to establish and \nmaintain peace and security has lost none of its \nurgency in 2008. The task remains. However, fulfilling \nit is more demanding than ever. \n When the Berlin Wall fell, no one had greater \nhopes than we Germans not only that Germany would \nbe reunited but that a new age of global cooperation \u2014 \nbeyond the traditional front lines \u2014 would begin. The \nIron Curtain had divided the world into two blocs and \nwhen it came to dealing with crises and conflicts, often \nenough, loyalty within the blocs had priority; what was \nneeded to improve the lot of ordinary people was of \nsecondary importance. \n \n \n47 08-52265 \n \n The end of the East-West confrontation in the \nearly nineties seemed to mark the dawn of a new age of \neffective multilateralism, while the United Nations \nseemed to be on the threshold of a great renaissance. \nDisillusionment has now set in, more quickly and more \nprofoundly than we had feared. The hoped-for peace \ndividend did not materialize. On the contrary, the \ncynical certainties of the cold war had disappeared, and \nthey were not replaced by new ones.  \n The world is clearly searching for a new order, \nand multilateralism does not always seem to be the first \nchoice in this quest. What we have experienced since \nthen is the confluence of the traditional power politics \nof the 19th century, the legacies of the cold war and the \nnew challenges of the 21st century. \n At the same time, new players and Powers that \nhave still to find their place in the international order \nare seeking to enter the global stage. It is now \ngenerally accepted that we can master the new \nchallenges of the twenty-first century, such as climate \nchange, scarcity of raw materials, access to food and \nwater and the fight against epidemics, pandemics and \nterrorism, only if we act together. Although we know \nthat and although it is absolutely vital that we focus on \nfinding common solutions to the key issues of the \nfuture, time and again we are called upon to resolve \nconflicts that have their roots in a past that we have \nonly seemingly put behind us. \n One conflict that smouldered for some time and \nthen escalated suddenly and violently is the crisis in \nGeorgia, where an entire region found itself on the \nedge of the abyss of war and destruction and where \ncommon sense failed to prevail on all sides. The United \nNations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation \nin Europe (OSCE) and the European Union agree that \nthe weapons must be silenced for good. We must help \nthe suffering population without delay. That does not \nmean accepting the status quo; nor does it mean the \ncalling into question of Georgia\u2019s territorial integrity. \n Nevertheless, we have to work together to ensure \nreconstruction, the return home of the refugees and \nlong-term security in Georgia and the entire region. \nThe European Union is making an important \ncontribution by sending an observer mission, which my \ncountry is leading. Together with the United Nations \nand the OSCE, the mission will put forward a \ncomprehensive strategy in Geneva this October. We are \naiming to pave the way towards the durable resolution \nof the conflict through stabilization and confidence-\nbuilding in this particular region of the world, the \nSouthern Caucasus. \n The same task is even more demanding in \nAfghanistan, a country where the situation is still \nprecarious. It is clear to us that, without security, \nAfghanistan will not, and indeed cannot, develop. \nEqually, however, we need economic development in \norder to improve the security situation and to \nencourage people to reject fundamentalism and terror. \n We have achieved much together in recent \nmonths and years. Millions of children \u2014 many of \nthem girls \u2014 are going to school again, while streets, \nbridges and hospitals are being built. The training and \nbuild-up of the Afghan police force and army are \nprogressing. Compared to the deteriorating security \nsituation, however, they are not progressing fast \nenough, especially in the present situation. Germany \nintends to do even more in the future. \n However, we cannot afford to look at Afghanistan \nby itself. We need to step up our efforts to help \nPakistan master the economic and social challenges it \nfaces. Pakistan\u2019s internal stability is crucial to stability \nin the entire region. This will require concrete support \nfrom everyone in the international community, and my \ncountry \u2014 rest assured \u2014 will play its part. \n International engagement is also still necessary in \nthe Middle East. In the current phase of domestic \nuncertainty, we call upon all parties to the conflict not \nto ease up in their efforts to resolve the conflict. As \nexperience has shown, to stand still in the Middle East \noften means to take a step backward. A new wave of \nterror and violent clashes would result, and neither \nIsrael nor Palestine, nor the international community, \ncan afford to let that happen. \n Germany believes it has a particular \nresponsibility to provide concrete assistance to \nimprove the framework conditions. Just recently, at the \nBerlin Conference in Support of Palestinian Civil \nSecurity and the Rule of Law \u2014 which many of those \nhere attended \u2014 we agreed on concrete measures to \nstrengthen the Palestinian security sector. Those \nmeasures are already having an impact. \n An Iran armed with nuclear weapons would pose \na threat to security throughout the Middle East and \nwould trigger a nuclear arms race. Therefore, Iran must \nput its cards on the table. We have made our offer, \n  \n \n08-52265 48 \n \nwhich is a tangible solution. The delaying tactics of the \nIranian side must not exhaust the patience of the \ninternational community. We expect a clear signal from \nIran indicating its willingness to comply with the \ninternational community\u2019s demands and to build \nconfidence. And let me make the following very clear: \nthe Iranian President\u2019s remarks concerning Israel are \nirresponsible and unacceptable. In my view, the blatant \nanti-Semitism that he expressed in his statement once \nagain this year (see ) is outrageous and \nshould be condemned by all of us. We must stand \ntogether on that issue. \n The problems in Georgia, Afghanistan, Pakistan \nand the Middle East highlight one fact: it is more \nurgent than ever that we develop the foundations for a \nstable world order. My country stands for dialogue and \nthe reconciliation of interests. That does not mean \ndialogue for the sake of discussion, without any \nresults; nor does reconciliation of interests imply that \nwe are prepared to abandon our own principles. We \nbelieve that it is essential to renounce violence, ensure \nfairness and recognize international law.  \n For us, that is the alternative vision to a world of \nfabricated opposing interests, the bloc mentality and \noversimplified categories such as good and evil. East \nagainst West, North against South \u2014 that is yesterday\u2019s \nthinking, and it no longer has a place in today\u2019s world. \nIn order to resolve the problems of today and \ntomorrow, we all need more partners, not more \nopponents. The twenty-first century is the first in \nwhich we can resolve problems only if we work \ntogether. \n The same applies to disarmament policy. Only a \npartnership of shared global responsibility can achieve \nlasting results. The dangerous trend in which an ever-\nincreasing number of countries strive to gain access to \nnuclear technology, or even to build nuclear weapons, \nmust be stopped. My proposal to multilateralize the \nfuel cycle showed how those risks can at the very least \nbe minimized. Furthermore, I call upon all States to \nsign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, \nbecause its entry into force would mean a huge gain in \nsecurity. \n For all that, however, we must remember that \nmore people die every day as a result of hunger than as \na result of war. The pledges that we made at the turn of \nthe millennium must not remain a mere piece of paper. \nThe fight against hunger and poverty is also part of a \nglobal responsibility partnership. Germany will \ntherefore step up its efforts to promote poverty \nreduction and global fairness. As part of those efforts, \nwe will increase our official development assistance \ncontributions in accordance with the plan of the \nEuropean Union. In the next budget alone, we will \nincrease development assistance by $1.2 billion.  \n In that connection, I would like to say something \nabout Africa. For too long, we have perceived that part \nof the world only as a continent of wars and conflicts. \nHowever, I also know an Africa that has set off on the \nroad to the future with courage and resolve. It deserves \nour partnership and support along that road. \n At present, the headlines are dominated by the \ninternational financial crisis. Recklessness, greed and a \nlack of common sense among those involved has set us \nback years. The long-term consequences cannot be \nassessed yet. However, I am certain that the painful \ntremors on the world financial markets will accelerate \nthe multipolarization of the international financial \nsystem. There can be no future without rules, and no \nsingle player will be able to lay down those rules. It \nwill no longer be possible for any one country to act as \nif it were immune to undesirable developments. \nEurope, with its tried-and-tested policy of mediation \nand reconciliation of interests, could play a key role in \nthis. \n Together, we must now finally ensure long-\noverdue transparency, stability and provisions to guard \nagainst risks on the world financial markets, along with \noversight. My country developed concrete proposals in \nthat regard a few years ago. I hope that, in the face of \nthis deep crisis, the international community will now \nact quickly and with resolve. We need universal rules \nfor the international financial markets. \n That does not apply only to the international \nfinancial sphere, however; clear rules, solid structures \nand joint action are the vital prerequisites for meeting \nglobal challenges. That is why we need a strong and \neffective United Nations that enjoys the confidence of \nthe international community, has the requisite \nlegitimacy and can be the umbrella for a global \nresponsibility partnership. \n We therefore support the process of reforming the \nUnited Nations and its organs. Security Council reform \nis overdue, as we are all aware. The Council\u2019s \ncomposition must reflect the realities of world politics \ntoday. Germany is prepared to shoulder greater \n \n \n49 08-52265 \n \nresponsibility in that area. Less than two weeks ago, \nthe General Assembly unanimously decided to begin \nthe negotiations on reform soon (see decision 62/557). \nThat important step must now be followed by others. \nGermany is firmly convinced that, in the twenty-first \ncentury, we need the United Nations more urgently \nthan ever before.

        "file_text": "I bring to everyone here \ngreetings from His Excellency Al Hadji Yahya A.J.J. \nJammeh, President and head of State of the Republic of \nthe Gambia.  \n The legitimacy of multilateralism, which lies at \nthe core of the United Nations system, is being \nincreasingly questioned. Yes, with the launching of the \nformer Secretary-General\u2019s report \u201cIn larger freedom: \ntowards development, security and human rights for \nall\u201d (A/59/2005), a lot of reforms have taken place and \nare still taking place. However, the question is, \u201cIs it \nenough?\u201d One of the unassailable conclusions reached \nin that report is that \u201cno reform of the United Nations \nwould be complete without reform of the Security \nCouncil\u201d (A/59/2005, para. 169). We have established \na new Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding \nCommission and have undertaken far-reaching \nmanagement reforms, yet the reform of the Security \nCouncil is still being unnecessarily stalled for no \njustifiable reason. That delay constitutes a source of \nfrustration for the citizens of this world, who are \nincreasingly questioning the legitimacy of our \ndecisions. The world is watching the unsatisfactory \nstatus quo with dismay.  \n In any event, the aspirations of the African people \nand their Governments to adequate representation on \nthe Council cannot be ignored because they are \nlegitimate and justified. The suggestion that reforming \nthe Council\u2019s working methods alone could constitute \nsufficient reform is not accurate. \n A/63/PV.13\n \n29 08-53122 \n \n My delegation has taken note of the High-level \nPanel\u2019s report and the Secretary-General\u2019s comment on \nUnited Nations system-wide coherence, as well as the \nconcept paper on institutional options to strengthen \nUnited Nations work on gender equality and the \nempowerment of women. My delegation aligns itself \nwith the position of the Group of 77 and China on that \nwork in progress. \n Our world is also going through a period of \ncrises, ranging from the food crisis and the energy \ncrisis to the collapse of financial markets and the \ncollapse of trade talks. There is no country on Earth \nthat is not affected by those crises. Too many repetitive \nhigh-level meetings, too many false promises and \nunfulfilled commitments continue to characterize our \nefforts to address the global crises. We in the \ndeveloping world have received too many prescriptions \nfrom the international community and we have \nfastidiously followed them. The irony, however, \nremains that our partners are not fulfilling their side of \nthe bargain in the way they should. It is our hope that \nthe upcoming Follow-up International Conference on \nFinancing for Development to Review the \nImplementation of the Monterrey Consensus, to be \nheld in Doha this November, will result in the reversal \nof that trend. \n We are asked to eliminate subsidies while our \npartners in the North continue to give huge subsidies to \ntheir farmers. We are opening up our markets while \nthey continue to introduce subtle measures including \ntariff and non-tariff barriers to deny us effective market \naccess. They commit to doubling overseas \ndevelopment assistance, but turn around and withhold \nthe little that trickles in. When it trickles in, it becomes \na media event. That is no way to end poverty. That is \nno way to end the food crisis. That is no way to end the \nenergy crisis. Certainly, that is no way to address \nclimate change, and it is no way to achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals. \n Allow me to share some thoughts about the \nglobal food crisis. When the crisis struck earlier this \nyear, no economy was spared. The food crisis was \npredictable because the international community over \nthe past decade has neglected agriculture in the \ndeveloping countries. In most developing countries, \nagricultural research and training institutions \ncollapsed, largely because of underfunding. Research \nand development were outsourced to multinational \ncorporations. Most of us in the developing world saw \nthe collapse of our agriculture markets through \ncompetition from the heavily subsidized farmers of the \ndeveloped world. World trade talks keep on failing, to \nthe detriment of poor farmers in rural Africa and \nelsewhere in the developing world. \n Our response to the food crisis followed the usual \npattern of convening conferences and meetings and \nadopting blueprints that merely heal the symptoms. We \nneed more than that. How many times have we met in \nRome and elsewhere just to adopt the same \ncommitments that we have already adopted over the \nyears? Our farmers need agricultural inputs, such as \nmachinery and fertilizers, to enhance their production \ncapacity. We all know what is at stake. Let us honour \nour commitments in order not to repeat the dramatic \nevents that stem from food shortages.  \n As we address the food crisis, we cannot \nunderestimate the impact of skyrocketing energy costs \non the incomes and livelihoods of our populations. Our \neconomies are under enormous stress and our gains in \neconomic growth and development are at risk of being \ncompletely eroded. We appreciate the efforts that a \nnumber of energy-producing countries are making to \nease the impact of the crisis on net importing countries. \nOur delegation believes, however, that sustained efforts \nshould continue to be made to stabilize the oil market. \nBeyond tackling the economic crisis that is impacting \nthe world, we should also pay attention to the question \nof conflict resolution in various conflict areas. \n One of the cornerstones of the Gambia\u2019s foreign \npolicy is the pursuit of peace and security. As a peace-\nloving people, it is our constant desire to contribute to \nthe search for lasting peace wherever there is conflict. \nIt is for those reasons that the Gambia actively \nparticipates in peace missions and promotes good-\nneighbourliness, friendship and cooperation throughout \nAfrica and beyond.  \n I must register my satisfaction at the peace \ndividend that is being reaped today across Africa \nthanks to the commitment of African leaders to finding \nsolutions to African conflicts. We are witnessing the \nresurgence of hope in Sierra Leone and Liberia after \nmany years of consolidation of peace and security. It is \nmy delegation\u2019s fervent hope that the international \ncommunity will not relent in extending to them all the \nfinancial, technical and material support they require to \nturn their societies around for the better. \nA/63/PV.13  \n \n08-53122 30 \n \n The Gambian delegation fully shares the agony of \nthe Somali Government and people over the \nbreakdown of law and order and the internal conflict \nthat continues to plague that country. In that regard, I \nwish to salute the effort that the Government and the \npeople of Ethiopia, the neighbouring countries and the \nAfrican Union are making in trying to bring peace and \nsecurity to Somalia.  \n It is the strong desire of my delegation to see a \npeaceful settlement of the conflict in Darfur. As a \ntroop-contributing country to the African Union-United \nNations Hybrid Operation in Darfur, we humbly call on \nall the parties to iron out their differences at the \nnegotiating table. Regarding the threat to indict \nPresident Al-Bashir of the Sudan, the Gambia wishes \nto register its full support for the position taken on the \nmatter by the African Union, the League of Arab States \nand the Non-Aligned Movement. \n The people of the Middle East are tired of living \nin a theatre of conflict. The Palestinian conflict has \nlingered for too long and the condition of ordinary \nPalestinians continues to deteriorate even after \nnumerous accords and promises. General Assembly \nresolutions, Security Council resolutions and even the \nrecent International Court of Justice advisory opinion \non the situation are not being implemented. The \nQuartet and the international community seem \nhelpless. We must ask ourselves: \u201cHow do we respond \nto the despair and lack of action that seem to \ncharacterize the peace agenda of the United Nations in \nthat region? When will the two-State solution be \nachieved?\u201d Unless we do something to break the \nlogjam in the ongoing negotiations, lasting peace will \nremain elusive. \n Iraq and Afghanistan continue to roil in conflict. \nThe international community must give the \nGovernments of those countries space to make \ndecisions that are in the best interests of their peoples.  \n Allow me now to address some neglected issues \nof international justice. My delegation has always \naddressed the question of Taiwan in this Assembly \nfrom the point of view of justice, fairness and equality. \nTaiwan is a stable and prosperous democracy that is \nwilling and able to take part in the work that the \nOrganization does. How can one justify the exclusion \nof Taiwan from actively participating in the activities \nof United Nations agencies? Safeguarding the welfare \nof the 23 million Taiwanese through their participation \nshould be accepted under the principle of universality. \nFor example, although it has the world\u2019s tenth largest \nshipping capacity, Taiwan does not have access to the \nInternational Maritime Organization. That adversely \naffects the progress of its shipping industry.  \n Furthermore, as the world\u2019s eighth largest \neconomy and twentieth largest foreign investor, Taiwan \npossesses significant economic strength and continues \nto share its development experiences with many \ndeveloping countries through technical and \nhumanitarian assistance. Taiwan is supporting the \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \nand other internationally agreed development goals. I \ntherefore strongly believe that we should all agree to \nlet Taiwan participate in the activities of the \nspecialized agencies of the United Nations. That is a \nmodest request that my delegation fervently hopes \nmerits the Assembly\u2019s objective consideration. \n The perpetuation of the unjust extraterritorial \neconomic embargo against Cuba has never made sense, \ndoes not make sense today and has no place in our \ncommunity of nations. Its sole objective is to inflict \nunnecessary harm and suffering on a resolute people. \nThe General Assembly\u2019s persistent calls for its \nabolition have only met with indifference. At their hour \nof need, when hurricanes Ike and Gustav inflicted \nmassive damage on the country, Cuba\u2019s humanitarian \ncall for the lifting of the embargo to enable it to \npurchase necessary humanitarian supplies has met with \nnothing but a cold response. There is no room for such \naction in the twenty-first century. The embargo must \nend. \n I would like to address a number of social issues \nthat are very high on the global agenda. In Africa, we \nare committed to combating the scourges of \nHIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other infectious \ndiseases. Over the years, African Governments have \ncommitted substantial resources to fighting those \ndiseases. Yet, our health-care delivery systems remain \nunder serious stress because of the flight of trained \nprofessionals to more advanced countries. That is \nconsidered to be positive migration, but we are being \ndevastated by it. I think some serious dialogue needs to \nbegin between our countries and beneficiary States on \nhow to get fair compensation for such huge losses. \n The other side of migration is what some call \n\u201cillegal\u201d migration, especially from Africa to Europe. \nIt is a question that is tied to the problem of youth \n A/63/PV.13\n \n31 08-53122 \n \nunemployment in our societies and to the broader \nquestion of development. Over the years, we have tried \nto address the migration conundrum at various forums, \nbut we need to come up with solutions that empower \nyoung people through job creation, skills and \nvocational training programmes in order to stem the \ntide. Governments must manage migration humanely. \nThe human rights and welfare of migrants and their \nfamilies should be upheld by all societies. My \ndelegation would like to appeal to all Governments to \ndo more to stamp out the increasing rise of intolerance, \nxenophobia and racism directed against migrants and \ntheir families. \n Ours is a world of considerable opportunities and \nchallenges. Let us collectively exploit the opportunities \noffered by our globalized world to tackle the \nchallenges that face humankind. Together, we can do it. "

        "file_text": "First of all, I have the pleasure of congratulating you, \nSir, on being elected to preside over this session, an \nhonour falling to a Central American for the second \ntime in the history of the United Nations. I wish you \nevery success and commend you once again. I would \nalso like to express our gratitude for the work done by \nMr. Kerim as President of the previous session. On \nbehalf of El Salvador, I would also like to congratulate \nthe Secretary-General for the dynamism and \ndetermination with which he is leading the \nOrganization.  \n It seems to me very timely that the central focus \nof debate for this session is the impact of the global \nfood crisis on the issue of poverty and hunger \nthroughout the world, including the need to \ndemocratize the United Nations. It is increasingly \nevident every day that the world is facing a global \ncrisis that has a negative impact on development \nefforts, especially in the poorest countries. Food, \nclimate, energy and financial problems are aggravating \nthe already difficult situation of developing countries. \n  \n \n08-51839 22 \n \nWe are gathered here because we have a duty to \nassume the political and moral responsibility to \nrespond to the problems currently facing the \ninternational community. The world must learn from \nboth its successes and its failures. We must learn to \nface crises collectively and turn them into \nopportunities, for no one can solve them alone any \nlonger.  \n In order to preserve the progress made in the area \nof development, we need to strengthen global \nleadership to make it both decisive and accountable. In \nthe current crisis, there is a danger that we could lose \nground.  \n The economic and financial system cannot be at \nthe mercy of markets that operate on speculation. \nTogether, we must rebuild a wise capitalist system that \nprovides financing for economic development, rather \nthan one that rewards speculation.  \n We must help to prevent and mitigate serious \nfinancial fluctuations. We must balance accounts and \nstabilize credit. I agree with the President of the French \nRepublic that, in order to achieve this, countries \ndirectly affected by the situation must meet as soon as \npossible to find joint solutions to what is the most \nacute financial crisis the world has experienced in 75 \nyears.  \n It is undeniable the rise \u2014 and above all the \ninstability \u2014 in the price of oil continues to have a \nnegative impact on development efforts in most \ncountries in the world, in particular the smallest and \nmost vulnerable among them. \n Here, I would like to reiterate the call I made \nfrom this very rostrum last year (see A/62/PV.6), for \noil-producing countries to seek and implement flexible \nmechanisms aimed at ensuring that hydrocarbon prices \ndo not continue to drastically affect developing \ncountries. Such mechanisms, of course, should not \nignore the harmful effects of speculation by \nintermediaries in the world markets.  \n If we do not act jointly and immediately, and if, \nin this forum, we are not able to come up with a \nbalanced solution to this problem, we will effectively \ncondemn oil-importing countries to bankruptcy for \nyears to come. We have invested in development, and \nwe have worked as hard as possible to achieve the \nMDGs; those successes will be swept aside by the \nexcessive and crippling prices of oil. We cannot \ncontinue to wait. We must take immediate political \ndecisions to shore up development and prevent a \ndeeper crisis in order to preserve global peace, security \nand stability.  \n Faced with the food crisis, which is directly \naffecting us all, we support the implementation of the \nmeasures agreed upon during the June 2008 High-\nLevel Conference on World Food Security: the \nChallenges of Climate Change and Bioenergy. We call \nfor action and assistance, particularly for affected \ndeveloping countries.  \n We would like to congratulate the Group of Eight \n(G8) on its decision to support, in the framework of the \nUnited Nations system, the establishment of a world \nagriculture and food association, and the identification \nof a range of actions to address the food crisis, \nincluding through the participation of major \ninstitutions. \n In the face of this tangle of problems that require \ncreative responses, the countries of the Central \nAmerican Integration System (SICA) advocate the \ninitiative on action under the Staple Grains Plan, which \nconcentrates in particular on strengthening technical \nassistance and public and private assistance and a \nprogramme for financing, land leasing and a temporary \nworker programme. \n The countries of SICA and Brazil, during \nEl Salvador\u2019s pro tempore presidency of that \norganization, supported the holding of a special session \nof the General Assembly on the world food and energy \ncrisis. As a result, a high-level meeting on food \nsecurity was held, beginning on 18 July, in this very \nHall, during which El Salvador explained the actions \nthat we have undertaken in order to deal with the crisis \nin Central America, particularly in the most vulnerable \nareas.  \n In our country, El Salvador, we are responding \nwith social programmes aimed at reducing extreme \npoverty, fighting hunger and infant malnutrition, and \nattaining other MDGs. At the next Ibero-American \nsummit of heads of State or Government, which will be \nheld in El Salvador, the subject of children under the \nage of five will be a matter of priority. \n In order to counter the impact of the economic \ncrisis on Salvadoranian households, we have created a \nmultidisciplinary commission with broad participation, \nwhich has proposed a series of measures to address \n \n \n23 08-51839 \n \ncurrent effects and promote a social pact of national \nsolidarity for productivity and employment. Those \nsolutions involve business people, workers, political \nparties and civil society bodies, and the creation of a \ncommittee for the implementation of viable priority \nactions. \n One of the most successful measures that we have \nimplemented in El Salvador to prevent a food crisis is \nthe promotion of improved seed varieties for staple \ngrains, which has enabled us to achieve record \nproduction this year.  \n However, I have to tell the Assembly that all the \nefforts of solidarity we make as a global forum or as \nindividual countries require broad participation, \ndemocratic stability, the enjoyment of full individual \nliberties, and a genuine sense of social responsibility \non the part of Governments, irrespective of their \nideologies. International cooperation is also important \nfor strengthening national and regional efforts. That is \nwhy El Salvador has insisted on the issue of \ncooperation with middle-income countries.  \n In October 2007, at San Salvador, we held the \nsecond International Conference on Development \nCooperation with Middle-Income Countries. In August \n2008, in Namibia, my country co-chaired the third \nConference on that subject. At that meeting, we agreed \non measures including improving access to markets, \nreducing poverty, fulfilling the MDGs, increasing the \ncompetitiveness of our economies and improving our \nphysical and financial infrastructures.  \n The problems we face require decisive measures \nto be taken. In that respect, I would ask all Member \nStates to support the fulfilment and implementation of \nthe commitments agreed upon in the El Salvador \nConsensus and the Namibia Declaration, as well as the \nconsideration of this topic at the Global Conference on \nFinancing for Development in Doha. Those efforts \nshould lead to a General Assembly resolution with the \nobjective of reviewing current practices in the area of \ninternational cooperation. \n For middle-income countries, injustice is clearly \nto be seen in international cooperation. The \ncommitment I propose should lead us to swiftly \nprepare a multidisciplinary plan of action, global in its \nscope, in order to strengthen development cooperation \nfor middle-income countries. We believe that new \ntypes of development cooperation must also be \nincluded, such as South-South cooperation, triangular \ncooperation, the exchange of debt for investment in \nsocial areas, such as health, education and the \nenvironment, as we are already doing with Spain, \nFrance and Germany. All of this could help us to attain \nall of the MDGs and to meet other parameters \nestablished by the United Nations.  \n In my view, it is important that as we seek \nsolutions to all of those problems, we never abandon \nour ongoing efforts to achieve the MDGs. In that \nrespect, I am very happy to describe some of the \nachievements we made during the period from 2001 to \n2007.  \n Extreme poverty at the national level was reduced \nfrom 32.6 per cent in 2001 to 12.8 per cent in 2007. \nWith regard to education, the net rate of school \nenrolment increased from 78 to 93 per cent during that \nsame period. The percentage of schoolchildren who \nenter the first grade of primary school and complete the \nfifth grade has increased from 58 to 80 per cent, and \nthe literacy rate for young people between the ages of \n15 and 24 has increased from 85 to 95 per cent. I \nwould also like to inform you that the Constitution of \nEl Salvador stipulates that primary education must be \nfree. With tremendous effort, our Government has \nachieved and established free secondary education in \nall El Salvador\u2019s public education institutions. \n With regard to environmental sustainability, the \npercentage of the population without access to drinking \nwater dropped from 23.9 to 12.1 per cent and without \naccess to sanitation from 21.9 to 8.1 per cent.  \n In the fight against HIV/AIDS, I am very pleased \nto report on the major efforts that we have undertaken \nin El Salvador to help those suffering from \nHIV/AIDS \u2014 first and foremost, universal free \nantiretroviral drugs for all those who need them, with a \ngreat number of decentralized hospitals providing that \ntreatment. In the last four years, we have managed to \nreduce the mortality rate of those with HIV/AIDS by \n35 per cent and the number of children born with \nHIV/AIDS by 89.14 per cent, falling from 150 to \n15 children annually.  \n With regard to implementing the goals of the \nSpecial Session of the General Assembly on Children \nin 2002, contained in the Plan of Action Creating a \nWorld Fit for Children (A/S-27/19/Rev.1), I am pleased \nto report the progress El Salvador has made. We have \nachieved 15 of the 35 goals, particularly in the \nreduction of extreme poverty, immunization, infant and \n  \n \n08-51839 24 \n \nmaternal mortality and education of children and \nadolescents. \n Programmes such as the Solidarity Network, \nwhich maps poverty in order to identify extreme \npoverty, Alliance with the Family with 19 measures to \nhelp the family purse, Solidarity Fund for Health and \nhealthy schools have been key to those successes. I \nmust underline that we have achieved some of the \ntargets established under the Millennium Development \nGoals before the 2015 deadline, in particular \nconcerning poverty reduction, gender equality and \naccess to drinking water. That is why we support the \ninitiative of the Secretary-General to hold a summit in \n2010 to review the progress made in implementing the \nGoals.  \n With regard to existing regional asymmetries, and \neven more those between developed and \nunderdeveloped countries, and the role the United \nNations should play regarding sustainable \ndevelopment, the Member States need a modern, strong \nglobal Organization with institutions able effectively to \nface the new challenges of the current international \nsituation. \n To that end, El Salvador would like to reiterate its \nresolute support for the United Nations reform process, \nso that the purposes and principles for which the \nOrganization was created in 1945 can be fulfilled, \nparticularly today when we are facing global threats \nagainst peace, security, human rights and international \ncooperation \u2014 fundamental pillars of development. \n Security Council reform is particularly important \nas part of that effort, and in that respect, we would like \nto stress the need to bring changes to make that \ninstitution more representative, democratic and \ntransparent, so as to adapt it to the current international \nsituation. \n From this rostrum, I should like to reiterate once \nagain our profound appreciation to the United Nations \nsystem for supporting the process of coordinating and \nreinforcing the peace agreements in El Salvador. \nToday, El Salvador is a model. We are living witnesses \nof the fundamental role of the United Nations in \nguaranteeing peace and stability.  \n Mindful of our experience, El Salvador is \nparticipating actively as Vice-Chair of the \nPeacebuilding Commission. Similarly, we have become \na troop-contributing country within the United Nations \nsystem, a role that we are proud to assume to defend \nworld peace and security in times of need. On that \nbasis, we have participated and continue to take part in \noperations in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Western Sahara, Liberia, \nIraq and Haiti, and recently, we joined the Spanish \ncontingent in the United Nations Interim Force in \nLebanon. \n Migration, particularly when undocumented, has \nincreasingly become a source of differences, instability \nand conflict. As a country of origin, transit and \ndestination for migratory flows, we appeal for the \ncontinued strengthening of actions to combat and \nprevent the illegal trafficking of migrants and trade in \npersons in all their forms and for guaranteeing full \nprotection and support for the victims of those crimes, \nparticularly women and children. \n While respecting the sovereign rights of States \nwith regard to their immigration policies, we call for a \ncomprehensive approach to international migration that \nvalues the positive contributions made by immigrants \nto the economy and culture of the communities where \nthey live, and favours schemes in support of controlled \nmigration, including temporary work programmes. I \nshould like to point out that, in the United States alone, \naround 12 million undocumented migrants reside, \nawaiting humane and comprehensive immigration \nreform. They are good, hard-working people, who have \nsacrificed their lives to support their families. \n Another subject on which we must try to achieve \nconsensus is climate change and global warming. I \nwould like to stress that our country is meeting its \ncommitment to support international efforts to address \nthe effects of climate change. \n In that regard, El Salvador is actively \nparticipating in the international negotiations aimed at \ncreating an instrument that will complement the Kyoto \nProtocol on the emission of greenhouse gases after \n2012, and awaits the and successful conclusion of \nthose negotiations in 2009 at the conference in \nCopenhagen, Denmark.  \n In the context of Central America, on 28 May \n2008, the Presidents of the countries in the region \nadopted, at the invitation of my colleague and friend \nPresident Manuel Jos\u00e9 Zelaya Rosales of Honduras, the \nDeclaration of San Pedro Sula on climate change and \nthe environment, which set out guidelines for tackling \nthe serious problems arising from climate change. In \nEl Salvador, recently we launched the innovative \n \n \n25 08-51839 \n \nproject Green Network, which seeks to involve \nGovernment and private institutions and the Ministries \nof the Environment and of Education in the protection \nof the environment through the implementation of \nprogrammes to improve social and environmental \nconditions for the most vulnerable. \n That initiative has encouraged participation in \nareas such as water security, judicious use of timber to \nprotect the forests, recycling in schools, energy saving \nand responsible environmental business policies. \n As the emissary of a nation that lives in \ndemocracy and peace, respecting human rights and \nfundamental freedoms, I should like to reiterate once \nagain, on behalf of El Salvador, our firm support for \nthe aspirations of the people of the Republic of China \nin Taiwan to participate in the international \ninstitutional structure, particularly in the United \nNations system. We support the initiative to examine \nthe participation of that country in the specialized \nagencies of the United Nations, with particular \nemphasis on the fact that the people of that country \ncannot and should not remain isolated from the \ninternational community and could contribute \nexperience, resources and knowledge to deal with the \nchallenges that we all face. \n I also wish to refer to the case of Palestine. \nPalestine should have its own State, as does Israel, with \nsecure borders. I think that the United Nations should \nplay a greater and more active role in ensuring that the \nPalestinian people have their own territory and that the \nterritory of Israel is also respected through secure \nborders. \n This is the fifth time during my administration \nthat the Government of El Salvador has been \nrepresented at the highest level in this important forum, \nwhich is the universal and most democratic body in our \nOrganization. My presence in the General Assembly \nand in other high-level meetings to discuss matters of \nglobal interest constitutes an unequivocal \ndemonstration of the importance and relevance we all \nattach to the work of the United Nations. \n I would like to finalize my intervention as the \nPresident of El Salvador in this forum. I hope that the \nOrganization will be strengthened on the basis of \nunderstanding, solidarity and the political will of all of \nits Members. I am absolutely convinced that if we \ncombine our wills, our abilities and our resources, we \nwill be able to steer the United Nations so that it may \neffectively fulfil its role of promoting peace, security, \njustice and sustainable development. \n Despite the problems in the world, I am an \neternal optimist. Problems always have solutions, and \nit is easier to find those solutions together. We must \npromote tolerance and human dignity. There is no \ngreater bastion for peace and brotherhood than \nunderstanding and respect for our diversity, our beliefs \nand our fundamental values, if we are to live together \npeacefully and with solidarity between nations.  \n I also wish to state today, within this global \nforum, that the Central America of 20 years ago has \ndisappeared, that the world\u2019s image of it is mistaken. \nThe Central American countries and the Central \nAmerican Integration System \u2014 SICA \u2014 are working \nwell. Integration is accelerating. Over the last three \nyears we have made more progress in Central \nAmerican integration than we have made over the last \nfifty years.  \n Central America has taken valiant, bold \ndecisions, among them the customs union. Guatemala, \nEl Salvador and Honduras will be making progress in \nthe next few weeks in the area of customs \u2014 free \nmovement of people and goods in a Central America of \n40 million people living in an atmosphere of peace and \ntranquility, with the normal problems of any country, \nbut with many exchanges and closer contacts between \nleaders. \n Thanks to all, and may the supreme Creator guide \nus towards those great goals. May God bless our \nOrganization, the whole world and Central America, \nand may God bless the Earth to which El Salvador \nbelongs. "

        "file_text": "I welcome the \nopportunity today to address this sixty-third annual \ngathering of the Assembly at such a critical moment in \nthe history of my own country and of the United \nNations. \n Sometimes, the most extreme tests of this \ninstitution\u2019s towering ideals arise in small, faraway \nplaces, of which we know very little. I come to you as \nthe representative of one of those places \u2014 the country \nof Georgia, a land of fewer than 5 million that last \nmonth was invaded by our neighbour. Despite our \nsmall size, the legal, moral, political and security \nimplications raised by that invasion could not have \ngreater consequences. \n Indeed, those issues cut through to the heart of \nthe founding Charter of the United Nations. The \nprinciples enshrined in that Charter include the \ninviolability of sovereign borders, the sanctity of \nhuman rights, the supremacy of international law and \nthe global rejection of armed aggression. \n All of those principles were put to the test by the \ninvasion and now hang in the balance. The invasion \nviolated Georgia\u2019s internationally recognized borders. \nAt the very beginning of the aggression, we clearly \ntold our own people and the world that the spirit of the \npeople of Georgia would not be broken and that we \nwould never give up freedom and never surrender. We \nnever did and never will. The subsequent recognition \nof the so-called independence of our two regions \u2014 \nSouth Ossetia, with a population of less than 20,000 in \nthe areas that Russia controlled, and Abkhazia, with a \npopulation of less than 50,000 ethnic Abkhaz \u2014 in \norder to punish our country and send a signal to the \nrest of the world, not only challenged our territorial \nintegrity but also defied common sense and the \nelementary principles of international interaction. The \nethnic cleansing of hundreds of thousands of our \npeople violated the very idea of human rights.  \n This General Assembly, therefore, faces a general \nchallenge. We are called upon not just to respond to the \nparticular question of one instance of armed aggression \nin a single place but to define our attitude towards \narmed aggression in all places. We are called upon to \nanswer the momentous question: will this body stand \nup for its founding principles, or will it allow them to \nbe crushed under the treads of invading tanks, under \nthe boots of ethnic cleansers, under the immobilizing \nimpact of cyberattacks and under the pernicious tactics \nof violent separatism? \n What would it mean for every member of this \nAssembly to defend the underlying principles of the \nUnited Nations? \n First, each of us must refuse to stand silent in the \nface of this armed aggression and assault on human \nrights. \n Secondly, we must stand united and immediately \nadopt a policy of non-recognition towards Georgia\u2019s \ntwo breakaway provinces, currently occupied and \n  \n \n08-51606 26 \n \nannexed by the aggressor. Together, we have both a \nmoral and a legal obligation to protect international \nlaw and the world order. \n Thirdly, we must ensure that all parties comply \nwith the full terms of the existing ceasefire agreement.  \n Fourthly, and lastly, we must resolve to create a \nmeaningful United Nations conflict resolution process \nthat will peacefully reunify Georgia and solve the \nproblem. \n The bottom line is this: we must be ready to use \nthe full power of international law and of our collective \ninternational institutions to uphold the historic balance \nof justice and thereby set in motion a series of actions \nto right these historic wrongs. \n While the crisis poses grave challenges for the \nentire international community, it creates specific \nobligations for my own country. I would argue that the \nanswer to that new assault on our shared values is not a \nclosing up or a circling of the wagons, but rather \ngreater openness on many fronts. As a democracy, we \nhave nothing to fear. As a democracy, we have an \nobligation to our people and to the international \ncommunity to be even more open and transparent. For \nme and my Government, that commitment translates \ninto a series of specific actions at both the international \nand the domestic levels. Allow me to explain. \n First, I know that there are many people in the \nworld who seek a clearer understanding of how this \nwar started and who started it. Rather than recite our \ncase, let me repeat the simple invitation that I first \nmade on 17 August while standing next to German \nChancellor Angela Merkel, who visited Georgia \nimmediately after the unleashing of hostilities, when I \nproposed that there should be an exhaustive \nindependent investigation of the origins and causes of \nthis war. \n Investigators must have unimpeded access to all \nofficials, documents and intelligence. Georgia \nwelcomes such an investigation. My Government is \nready to share every piece of evidence and to provide \naccess to every witness sought by investigators. We \ncall on the other party to this conflict to fully cooperate \nand not to obstruct the investigation. That is how \ndemocracies behave. The truth must come out, not only \nto clarify how events unfolded last month but also to \nhelp us to answer the fundamental questions that this \ninvasion has raised. \n My Government\u2019s second initiative of openness \ninvolves developments within our borders. Whereas \nothers waged this war with arms, we will wage it with \nvalues. Georgia was attacked because it is a successful \ndemocracy in our part of the world. Our response today \nis to make our democracy even more robust. That is \nwhy I am announcing to the Assembly four categories \nof expanded democratic initiatives. \n First, we will strengthen the checks and balances \nof our democratic institutions, including granting \ngreater independence to parliament and to the \njudiciary. Secondly, we will provide additional \nresources and protections to foster greater political \npluralism, including by increasing funding for \nopposition parties and ensuring they have greater \naccess to the airwaves. Thirdly, we will strengthen the \nrule of law by introducing enhanced due process, trials \nby jury and lifetime judicial appointments. Fourthly, \nwe will expand and deepen protections for private \nproperty. In everything we do, we will be transparent. \n This morning, I was honoured to learn that, in \nTransparency International\u2019s latest index, Georgia was \namong the few countries to have risen significantly in \nthe rankings over the past year. Indeed, the European \nBank for Reconstruction and Development ranks \nGeorgia among the least corrupt economies in Europe.  \n Despite all the turmoil, my country has endured. \nThat proves the resiliency and irreversibility of our \ndemocratic commitment. In short, we will fight the \nspectre of aggression and authoritarianism with the \nmost potent weapon in our arsenal, namely, our \ncommitment to ever-expanding freedoms within our \nown borders. That amounts to nothing less than a \nsecond Rose Revolution. If our first revolution was \nabout meeting a threat from within by reinventing a \nfailed State riddled by corruption, our second \nrevolution must be even more focused, as we now face \nan even greater challenge \u2014 one that comes from the \noutside. The success of the first Rose Revolution \nhelped save my country. The health of the international \norder could well depend on the outcome of the second \nRose Revolution. \n Countless people throughout the world were \ndeeply moved and profoundly troubled by the invasion \nof Georgia, which began, with tragic irony, on the eve \nof that great celebration of peace, the Olympic Games. \nOn the most basic level, the world responded with \npassionate humanity to the plight of ordinary \n \n \n27 08-51606 \n \nGeorgians under siege; to the sight of 80-year-old men \nand women driven from their villages; to the hundreds \nof thousands of innocent souls taking shelter from \nbombings; to a small country of less than 5 million \npeople being trampled by a neighbour 300 times its \nsize. The world responded immediately by sending \ngenerous aid, by coming to Georgia and by showing its \nsolidarity. Meanwhile, leaders from around the world \nhave been working tirelessly to negotiate and enforce a \nceasefire.  \n I am especially grateful to President Sarkozy of \nFrance for his dedication to ensuring that the ceasefire \nis fully implemented in letter and in spirit. As all \nparties have agreed, that means the full withdrawal of \nall military forces from my country to their pre-conflict \npositions. \n The world\u2019s actions proved that the most potent \nresponse to this brutal invasion is to rebuild Georgia\u2019s \ndemocracy and economy, making them even stronger \nthan before. I want to make a special commitment to \nall those who, during these especially difficult \neconomic times, are helping to fund Georgia\u2019s \nreconstruction: we will spend their resources wisely, \nwell and with full transparency. \n Georgia will rebuild. It will contribute to the \nprosperity and security of all its citizens and of the \nentire international community by providing stability \nin our part of the world and serving as a model for \ndemocratic development. Reconstruction will also \nensure that Europe continues to benefit from the true \nenergy security that comes from diversification. And \neverything we do will be done peacefully. \n But today we must ask a series of questions, the \nanswers to which have grave consequences. We have \nall wondered in recent weeks: was this invasion an \naberration or a misguided attempt to resort to the \nnineteenth-century logic of brute force, or was it a sign \nof an ominous new trend, one that could continue and \ndeepen to undermine the international order of the \ntwenty-first century, eroding State sovereignty and the \npower of our common and hard-fought principles? I \nbelieve that that question and others have not yet been \nanswered. Others still need to be asked. \n Will we encourage violent and hateful separatism \naround the world, standing aside when State \nsovereignty is subverted, or will we draw a clear line \nand defend the principles that uphold the international \norder and declare, enough? In the twenty-first century, \nwe have better ways to protect the rights of ethnic \nminorities than with T-72 tanks and Sukhoi fighter jets. \n We have developed a body of legal and political \nexamples to accommodate minority demands within \nthe context of national sovereignty. After all, that is \none of the great achievements of the United Nations, of \nthe European Union and of other multilateral and \nregional organizations. Its foundation is the belief that \ndemocracy and prosperity provide room for all. Are we \nready to throw all that away?  \n And what of the use of brute force? Will we look \nthe other way or reward the dispatch of tens of \nthousands of troops and hundreds of planes across \ninternationally recognized borders to bomb another \ncountry? Will we cover our eyes when ethnic cleansing \noccurs, as it has over and over again for the past \n16 years in Abkhazia and South Ossetia? In a world \nthat struggles to reign in traditional forms of State \nviolence, will we sanction new ones? \n During the invasion of Georgia, we witnessed \nseveral terrifying new twists in the waging of war. We \nsaw proxy forces and militias cynically unleashed to \nethnically cleanse the population of my country, \noperating without any restraint and outside any order. \nWe demand a thorough United Nations investigation of \nthe crimes against humanity, war crimes and human \nrights violations that have been committed.  \n We have experienced the first full-scale cyber \nwarfare campaign, which was aimed at crippling my \ncountry\u2019s economy and our ability to communicate \nwith the outside world. It is profoundly distressing to \nsee the technology that has woven our world together \nand helped to bridge cultures being used to divide \nethnic groups and to tear our world apart. \n Today, when most of the world understands the \nexistential threat posed by climate change and \necological destruction, we in Georgia have witnessed a \nsickening campaign of ecocide as part of the invasion. \nThat occurred when combat helicopter gunships \ncontinuously dropped firebombs on old-growth forests \nin the Borjomi National Park, which comprises our \nnational centre for tourism, recreation, culture and \nwater resources. I believe that, together, we have the \nsolemn responsibility to deliver answers to those \nquestions. We will succeed. Let us resolve to bring the \nright conclusions to the world.  \n  \n \n08-51606 28 \n \n The invasion of our country provided an \nimpressive demonstration of the power of global public \nopinion, which can find expression only when societies \nare open and free. Ultimately, what stopped the tanks \nand troops from taking our capital was the international \ndisapproval voiced by so many here, by the free media, \nby courageous human rights groups and by leading \nvoices of the world\u2019s conscience, from Natan \nSharansky to V\u00e1clav Havel. \n Rhetoric, however, is no longer enough; today, \nwe must act. If words were sufficient, then something \nmight have come from the many calls for peace and the \ncountless warnings that I myself have made from this \nrostrum over the years. No one has fought harder than \nmy country and myself to heal the ethnic rifts in \nGeorgia and to bring about a peaceful resolution of the \nconflict, and we will continue to fight forcefully.  \n Indeed, in this very place, I have warned so many \ntimes that this situation was in the making \u2014 that there \nwas a threat. Four years ago, we were discussing the \ndangers posed by the illegal Russian build-up in our \ncountry aimed at our territories. We spoke about the \ndistribution of passports and about the illegal bases \nbuilt on our territories. We knew that those subversive \ntactics, combined with the ethnic cleansing that had \ndriven most Georgians from those territories, would \none day be used as a pretext for invasion. And that is \nprecisely what happened last month. It is also \nhappening in other countries in our neighbourhood. \n In 2006, I urgently drew attention to the attempts \nbeing made to annex Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and \nI asked whether any members in this great Hall would \ntolerate such interference by another Power on their \nown soil. I warned of the risk that \u201ca Pandora\u2019s box \nwill be opened, unleashing violent separatism and \nconflict not only in the Caucasus but across many parts \nof our globe\u201d (A/61/PV.16, p. 4). Today, unfortunately, \nwe stand at that very precipice, where peace could \nyield to a pernicious new world order. \n One year ago, I came to this Hall with even more \ndistressing news: that an illegal new military base was \nbeing built in South Ossetia by those who hoped that \narms and violence could triumph over the will of the \npeople. I noted that that dangerous escalation was \ntaking place under the very noses of the international \nmonitors whose job it was to demilitarize the territory, \nand I asked that those reckless acts be countered. Our \nwarnings continued in the months and weeks before the \ninvasion. We told anyone who would listen about the \ncampaign that had been unleashed to slander Georgia \nand my Government while blocking any meaningful \nnegotiations with the separatists. That was part of a \ncalculated effort to weaken international support for \nGeorgia and to lay the groundwork for the invasion. \n We gave the international community the details \nof a sharp military build-up by the purported \npeacekeepers \u2014 a build-up that began this spring in \nboth conflict zones, leading to armed attacks this \nsummer by separatist militias. Just before the land \ninvasion began in the early hours of 7 August, after \ndays of heavy shelling that had killed civilians and \npeacekeepers, we urgently sought to refute claims that \n2,100 South Ossetian civilians had been killed by \nGeorgians. That was the excuse used by the invader for \nwhat it called a \u201chumanitarian intervention\u201d \u2014 a \nprofound perversion of the responsibility to protect. \nThat lie, which was subsequently debunked by Human \nRights Watch \u2014 which estimated that 44 had been \nkilled \u2014 and others, was an attempt to conceal the true \nmotives for the invasion. \n Over the years, I have also spoken many times to \nyou about the plans that Georgia has developed, \ntogether with the international community, to \npeacefully reunify my country. I have spoken about the \nurgent need to replace and transform the failed \nframeworks for negotiation and peacekeeping in our \nregion. Repeatedly and with sincere intent, I have \nextended my hand to our large neighbour. \n Just a few days before the invasion of Georgia, \nwe continued to work furiously for peace. The \nSecretary-General had sent his Special Representative \nto Georgia to determine how to fix the broken process \nof conflict resolution, and we cooperated closely with \nhim. The German Government had proposed peace \ntalks for mid-August \u2014 talks that my Government \neagerly supported. The Finnish Chair of the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \nalso proposed talks in Helsinki in late July, to which \nwe subscribed. Unfortunately, the opposing parties to \nthe conflict repeatedly turned their backs; they had \nother plans in mind. \n Finally, on the eve of the invasion, my Special \nEnvoy travelled twice in desperation to South Ossetia \nto plead for peace. His counterpart from our \nneighbouring country failed to come to those meetings. \nHe cited a flat tire as the reason for not showing up. \n \n \n29 08-51606 \n \nWithin 24 hours, thousands of very full tires were \nrolling across the border of my country. \n So words alone are not nearly enough. Nor can \nwords accurately convey the horrors of war. It is \ndifficult, if not impossible, to say that anything good \ncan ever come of war. The value of human life is \nincalculable, and we in Georgia grieve not only for our \nown lost sons and daughters, but also for our fallen \nneighbours who were sent in to carry out an unjust \naggression of war.  \n Yet, the international community has emerged \nfrom the invasion of my country with something truly \nvaluable: finally, clarity. We understand what has \nhappened. We can no longer deny the motivations and \nintentions of those actors who instigated the war. With \nclarity comes responsibility. We no longer have any \nreason for inaction. Now each of us has a responsibility \nto act. \n Despite the destruction wreaked by the \ninvasion \u2014 hundreds dead; nearly 200,000 displaced, \naccording to the United Nations; our economy \ndisabled \u2014 my Government is putting our convictions \ninto practice. I promise to you that my Government \nwill implement with all due speed the new democratic \ninitiatives that constitute the second \u201cRose \nRevolution\u201d. I promise to you that Georgia will soon \nbe stronger and more democratic than ever before, and \nthus that it will be in a better position to contribute to \nour collective security and prosperity. \n However, if that is to have any meaning, we must \ntogether defend the principles on which this institution \nwas built. We need actions, not words. Allow me to \nrepeat once again the four commitments that, I believe, \nwe must make. First, each of us must refuse to stand \nsilently by in the face of this armed aggression, \noccupation, ethnic cleansing and assault directed \nagainst a United Nations Member State. Secondly, we \nmust stand united in rejecting the forced and illegal \nrecognition of Georgia\u2019s two separatist provinces and \nwhat is essentially their annexation by its neighbour. \nThirdly, we must ensure that all parties comply fully \nwith the existing ceasefire agreement. Fourthly, we \nmust resolve to create a meaningful conflict resolution \nprocess that will peacefully reunify Georgia and \nresolve the conflict, in the interest of all ethnic groups \nand minorities, our society as a whole and the region. \n If we can accomplish those goals, then this \ninstitution will emerge from this crisis stronger than it \nwas before. If, however, we fail to stop the violent \ntactics that have subverted State sovereignty in \nGeorgia, they will spread to other parts of the world. It \nis our collective responsibility to respond with \nconviction and resolve.  \n Georgia has made its choice, and our democracy \nwill emerge stronger as a result. Together, we will find \nways, as we have over the millennia, to ensure peaceful \ncoexistence among all members of our multiethnic \nsociety, be they ethnically Georgian, Abkhaz or \nOssetian. We have been a Christian country since the \nfifteenth century, but we are also a country in which \nmany different religious groups and communities \ncoexist. Diversity is our strength, not a source of our \nweakness. We are willing to strengthen our diversity \neven further in order to make my country successful \nand whole once again, rejuvenated and rebuilt."

        "file_text": "Let me first congratulate \nyou, Sir, on your election to preside over the sixty-third \nsession of the General Assembly. We express our full \nsupport for your presidency. I also thank the Secretary-\nGeneral for his resolute efforts to promote the United \nNations and its values. \n Finland aligns itself with the statement of the \nEuropean Union. \n Our world is facing unforeseen challenges, such \nas climate change and the food crisis. The current \neconomic turmoil also requires decisive action. At the \nsame time, we have not been able to rid ourselves of \nconventional crisis. Unfortunately, armed conflicts are \nstill a reality all over the world. Too often, we \u2014 the \ninternational community \u2014 are unable to agree on a \ncommon response. Too often, people affected by \npoverty and conflicts are let down. \n The need to adapt the international architecture to \nthese challenges is deeper than ever. We need an \nefficient United Nations to find common solutions for \nour future. The United Nations represents collective \nsecurity in its most global form. Finland is committed \nto building a more secure, fair and just world through a \nreformed and credible United Nations. \n I had the pleasure earlier this week of presenting \nto the Secretary-General the final report of the Helsinki \nProcess on Globalization and Democracy. The main \npolitical message of this joint initiative of Finland and \nthe United Republic of Tanzania is that some of the \nchallenges posed by globalization can be solved only \nthrough multi-stakeholder dialogue, and that the United \nNations could play an important role in facilitating and \ndeveloping new practices for such cooperation. \n Climate change must be addressed with vigour. \nOtherwise, it can wipe out our achievements in the \nfield of sustainable development and even bring into \nquestion the whole future of mankind. Recent extreme \nweather phenomena can be a serious indication of the \nchallenges we are about to face. Multilateral \nengagement and shared responsibility are the only \neffective means to tackle this global menace. Others\u2019 \nindifference is no excuse for inaction. Climate change \nis a matter of our responsibility to future generations. \nThere is no place for petty politics or recrimination. \n The United Nations has to play a leading role in \nthe global response to climate change. We must reach a \n  \n \n08-51606 2 \n \ncomprehensive global agreement on a new \ninternational climate regime. The Copenhagen Climate \nChange Conference will take place in December next \nyear. It is evident that global commitments need to be \nimplemented and also supplemented by national and \nregional action. It is important to include all \nstakeholders, from non-governmental organizations to \nprivate enterprises, and from individual citizens to \nGovernments. We need everybody; it is necessary that \nwomen too can participate fully in this work. \n Industrialized countries have to bear their share \nin mitigating climate change. However, international \nnegotiations on the new climate regime cannot succeed \nwithout extensive participation by the developing \ncountries. We must actively support the most \nvulnerable developing countries in adapting to and \ncombating climate change. \n There is mounting evidence that poverty, \nespecially in rural areas, can be reduced by sustainable \nmanagement of natural resources. Forests are crucial in \nreducing greenhouse gases. Finland has a long history \nof sustainable forest management, and we understand \nits impact on rural development and employment. We \nwould like the United Nations to intensify its efforts to \nassist Governments and communities to improve their \ncapacities for rural development and sustainable forest \nmanagement. We are of course ready to work with \nothers in this respect. \n I am pleased to be a co-host, together with the \nPresident of Liberia, Ms. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, my \nfriend, of the International Colloquium on Women\u2019s \nEmpowerment, to be held in Liberia next March. The \nconference will address women\u2019s role in climate \nchange, security, governance and leadership. \n Rising food prices are a challenge with \nworldwide consequences. Once again the poorest and \nthe most vulnerable \u2014 women and children \u2014 suffer \nthe most. Food shortages lead to deterioration of diets, \nand can provoke social unrest. Effective Government \naction and improved donor coordination are crucial in \ntackling the food crisis. The United Nations \nComprehensive Framework for Action is an excellent \ninitiative in addressing this global challenge. \n Parallel to the short-term response, attention must \nbe paid to medium- and long-term policies in \nenhancing food security. Support for the rural sector is \ncrucial for sustainable and equitable development, \ngrowth and well-being. Moreover, the promotion of \ngood agricultural practices is among the best \napproaches to adaptation to climate change. \n This food issue can also provide opportunities. If \ndeveloping countries are supported in the spirit of the \nAid for Trade agenda, they can better take advantage of \ntheir agricultural potential, including exporting. And \nwe need to ensure, again, that both women and men \nbenefit from support, keeping in mind that women \nproduce most of the food in many developing \ncountries. \n The United Nations currently deploys well over \n100,000 military and civilian personnel in \npeacekeeping operations. This is a remarkable figure, \nand we, the Member States, must continue to support \nthe United Nations efforts in this field. The United \nNations and regional organizations should work closer \ntogether in carrying the burden in preventing and \nresolving conflicts. \n Increased cooperation should be extended to the \nAfrican Union. We already have good cooperation and \nexperience in our own region, because improving \nefficiency and improving cooperation between the \nEuropean Union and the United Nations remain a top \npriority. In Kosovo, and most recently also in Georgia, \nwe continue close cooperation between the United \nNations, the European Union and the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe.  \n That is why I also dare to say that increased \ncooperation should be extended to the African Union. \nA continued United Nations peacekeeping presence in \nChad and in the Central African Republic would \ncontribute to wider stabilization efforts, both locally \nand regionally. \n Tackling today\u2019s multifold conflicts requires a \ncomprehensive approach to security. Trade, \ndevelopment policy and humanitarian aid need to be \nutilized alongside traditional crisis management tools. \nWe must \u2014 even better than today \u2014 take women and \nchildren into account in conflicts and post-conflict \npeacebuilding. \n We have made good decisions. We have to make \nthem become reality. I am pleased to inform the \nAssembly that last Friday Finland published a national \naction plan on implementing Security Council \nresolution 1325 (2000). We hope that more and more \nmember countries will do the same. \n \n \n3 08-51606 \n \n Furthermore, there can be no sustainable peace \nwithout justice. Finland strongly supports the \nInternational Criminal Court in rejecting impunity for \nthe most serious international crimes. \n Finally, I want to share my memories and \nexperience. I had the privilege to co-preside over the \nMillennium Summit with President Sam Nujoma of \nNamibia eight years ago. We witnessed leaders having \nthe spirit and the courage to adopt the Millennium \nDeclaration and to make a commitment on the \nMillennium Development Goals. It is our duty to fulfil \nthese commitments. Africa requires our devoted \nattention and support, as was agreed yesterday. Let us \nwork for it, because today, in this Hall, it is once again \ntime to pledge our joint commitment to the ideas and \nvalues of the United Nations.  \n Everyone present may remember what the \nCharter calls us to do: \u201cto unite our strength to \nmaintain international peace and security\u201d. While the \nconcept of security has changed and become broader, \nthe onus is on us to follow this call of the Charter and \ntranslate it into action."

        "file_text": "First of all, I would \nlike to congratulate the President of the General \nAssembly on his election to his high office and to \nexpress my confidence that, under his able \nstewardship, the sixty-third session of the General \nAssembly will be fruitful and successful. \n When Christopher Columbus reached the shores \nof America in 1492, he believed that he had discovered \na new route to India. Today we know that, many years \nbefore Columbus made that voyage, European \nexplorers had reached Saint Lawrence Bay. Obviously, \nprior to the so-called discovery of America, developed \ncivilizations had already existed there. At the same \ntime, Columbus did discover America in a certain \nsense, because it radically altered the understanding of \nworld geography. \n It is globalization that is giving us a new vision \nof the world in the twenty-first century. While offering \nnew opportunities to the world economy and human \ndevelopment, globalization is also triggering a new \nsurge of political and economic competition \nworldwide. \n We can now see clearly that it is imperative to \nprevent the interests of peoples and countries from \nbeing sacrificed for the sake of that competition. Given \nrecent complications and disputes, it is urgent that we \npreserve the basic principles of international law, \nincluding that of territorial integrity. It is crucial that \nwe avoid double standards in the application of that \nprinciple. \n Despite the efforts being undertaken, the world is \nnot becoming a safer place. We must admit that there is \nstill no international consensus regarding the issues of \ndisarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction. As everyone knows, history could \nrepeat itself if we do not learn its lessons properly. \nTherefore, nuclear disarmament and an enhanced \nnon-proliferation regime should become a priority for \nall, without any conditionalities.  \n Kazakhstan, a country that voluntarily \nrelinquished the fourth-largest nuclear arsenal in the \nworld, believes that it is absolutely imperative to \ndevelop new mechanisms for adapting the Treaty on \nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to new \nrealities. We call on Member States to finalize the \nnecessary procedures for the entry into force of the \nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the \nstrengthening of its verification mechanism. That is \nprecisely the purpose of the integrated on-site \ninspection field exercise currently being conducted in \nour country at the former Semipalatinsk nuclear testing \nground. \n The crisis of the non-proliferation regime poses \nthe real threat that nuclear weapons will fall into the \nhands of terrorists. Kazakhstan is actively participating \nin the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism \nand in that regard hosted this year the Atom anti-terror \nexercises and an international conference on the \nphysical protection of nuclear material.  \n The situation in Afghanistan remains a matter of \ngrave concern. In our opinion, the way to normalize the \nsituation is to build up the international community\u2019s \nefforts for the peaceful reconstruction of Afghanistan. \nTo that end, the Government of my county has adopted \na special plan on assistance to Afghanistan. \n Kazakhstan is committed to timely and effective \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs). We have already reached a number of targets \nin several areas, including poverty reduction, access to \neducation and the empowerment of women. Now we \nare embarking on the MDG-Plus targets, adapted to our \nnational conditions, in order to set up higher \nbenchmarks and indicators. \n Like many other countries, Kazakhstan is deeply \nconcerned about the situation regarding the global food \nmarket. We share the view of the majority that an \nintegrated approach is required to overcome the current \nfood crisis. \n Today the international community faces the \nchallenge of a global rise in basic food prices. \nKazakhstan, as a major producer and exporter of grain \ncrops and flour, is prepared to make a substantial \ncontribution to overcoming the food crisis. As of \n1 September 2008, we have lifted our ban on grain \nexports. That is our contribution to the international \ncommunity\u2019s collective efforts to curb global grain \nprices. \n Because of the critical importance of energy \nresources, preserving the global energy balance has \nbecome a more urgent imperative. Kazakhstan fully \nunderstands its ever-increasing role and responsibility \nas a reliable energy supplier.  \n Bearing in mind that energy and environmental \nproblems are closely interconnected, I would like to \nonce again draw attention to the initiatives set forth by \n A/63/PV.13\n \n23 08-53122 \n \nthe President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, \nfrom this rostrum a year ago (see A/62/PV.4). They call \nfor adoption of a Eurasian pact on the stability of \nenergy supplies, as well as development of a global \nenergy and environment strategy within the United \nNations framework. \n Kazakhstan attaches critical importance to \nproblems associated with climate change and \nsustainable development. To ensure the convergence of \nthe European and Asian processes of transition to \nsustainable development and their merging into a \nsingle Eurasian process, Kazakhstan has put forward an \ninitiative on convening in 2010 a conference of \nministers of environment, economy and social welfare \nof the Asian and Pacific countries and a pan-European \nconference on the environment for Europe in 2011. \n We would like to express our profound \nappreciation to the entire international community, the \nUnited Nations and its agencies and programmes for \nthe support they rendered to our country in mitigating \nthe consequences of environmental disasters in the Aral \nSea and Semipalatinsk regions. Calling for continued \nactive international cooperation, we request support for \nthe draft resolutions to be submitted at the sixty-third \nsession of the General Assembly concerning the \nproblems of the Semipalatinsk region and granting the \nInternational Fund to Save the Aral Sea observer status \nat the General Assembly. \n The growing number of natural and man-made \ndisasters makes it necessary to intensify international \ncooperation as the most effective means of responding \nto emergencies. Kazakhstan supports cooperation in \nsetting up national and regional platforms, exemplified \nby the Central Asian Disaster Response Coordination \nCentre. \n We strongly believe that the special needs of \nlandlocked countries should be fully taken into account \nin accordance with decisions and recommendations \nbased on the Almaty Programme of Action. We hope \nthat the forthcoming midterm review of the Programme \nwill result in the adoption of specific decisions on \nassistance to this group of countries. \n Escalation of ethno-territorial conflicts and \nincreased interfaith tensions indicate that we have \nreached a critical turning point in our common history. \nUnder these circumstances, Kazakhstan has been \nconsistently and proactively pursuing a policy aimed at \nensuring inter-ethnic and interfaith accord, as well as \npreserving political and social stability in our society. \nUpon the initiative of our head of State, President \nNazarbayev, the Kazakh capital, Astana, hosted two \nCongresses of Leaders of World and Traditional \nReligions, in 2003 and 2006. With its next summit \nmeeting to be convened in 2009, this forum has already \nproved to be an effective international mechanism for \npromoting peace and tolerance on a global scale. \n Kazakhstan is actively involved in the work of \nthe Group of Friends of the Alliance of Civilizations. \nOur initiative to declare 2010 the International Year of \nthe Rapprochement of Cultures has been supported by \nall Member States, as reflected in resolution 62/90. We \nappeal to all countries and organizations of the United \nNations to prepare relevant plans for the attainment of \nthe goals of the International Year, in accordance with \nthe provisions of that resolution. \n Taking further practical steps to promote dialogue \namong civilizations, Kazakhstan has proposed the \nconvening of a ministerial conference to be entitled \n\u201cCommon world: Progress through diversity\u201d. Foreign \nministers from different regions of the planet have \nbeen invited to attend the first meeting of that forum, \nwhich is to be held in Astana in October. \n As Kazakhstan prepares to assume the duties of \nChair of the Organization for Security and Cooperation \nin Europe in 2010 and of the Ministerial Conference of \nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference in 2011, we \nintend to use this unique opportunity to promote the \nissues of ensuring greater tolerance and furthering \nmeasures by member States against all forms of \ndiscrimination as serious items in those organizations. \n I would like to conclude my remarks with some \nancient oriental wisdom: \u201cBetween a man that digs a \nhole and the man that fills it, there should always be a \nthird man ready to plant a tree\u201d. In today\u2019s world, the \nUnited Nations performs that vital function by \nfostering dialogue and cooperation among all peoples \nand all States. "

        "file_text": "Standing before the \nAssembly for the first time, I am greatly honoured by \nthis opportunity to speak on behalf of the people and \nGovernment of Tuvalu. \n Next week, on 1 October, Tuvalu will \ncommemorate the thirtieth anniversary of its \nindependence. While we take pride in moving forward \nin nationhood, as a small and young nation, we have \nfull confidence in the noble goals of the United Nations \nto guide us through the waters of our destiny. Our \npresence here in the United Nations is our statement of \nhope and trust in the goodwill of humanity. \n Let me on this occasion express Tuvalu\u2019s deep \nappreciation to all members of the international \ncommunity for their invaluable support to my nation, \nand convey its warmest greetings and felicitations to \nthe Assembly at its sixty-third session. \n I wish also to associate us with previous speakers \nin extending our congratulations to the President on his \nelection and in expressing our appreciation to his \npredecessor, particularly for promoting the issue of \nclimate change, among other matters, within the \nAssembly\u2019s agenda. \n Climate change is without doubt the most serious \nthreat to the global security and survival of mankind. It \nis an issue of enormous concern to a highly vulnerable \nsmall island State like Tuvalu. Here in this great house \nwe now know both the science and economics of \nclimate change. We also know the cause of climate \nchange, and that human actions by all countries are \nurgently needed to address it. \n The central message to us, world leaders, of both \nthe International Panel on Climate Change reports and \nthe Sir Nicholas Stern report on climate change is \ncrystal clear: unless urgent actions are taken to curb \ngreenhouse gas emissions by shifting to a new global \nenergy mix based on renewable energy sources, and \nunless there is timely adaptation, the adverse impacts \nof climate change on all communities will be \ncatastrophic. \n This great family, the United Nations, must not \nfail to take heed of these timely warnings, and to save \nus all, particularly the small and most vulnerable, from \nthis man-made catastrophe. \n The next 12 to 18 months are crucial in the \ncontext of negotiating a new international agreement \non climate change, based on the Bali Action Plan. We \nmust work together to ensure that all countries make a \nsubstantial effort to reduce their greenhouse gas \nemissions. \n We need to find the right incentives to ensure that \nall countries contribute to dramatically reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions. This requires a substantial \ncollective effort. It also requires strong political \nleadership. Tuvalu observes with great disappointment \nthe clear absence of this leadership particularly \nemerging from the recently concluded Group of Eight \n(G-8) Summit. We need stringent, short-term targets by \nall major developed countries. \n Based on the principle of the polluter pays and \ncommon but differentiated responsibilities, the \nindustrialized world must show strong leadership in \nadvancing real actions on climate change. But all \ncountries must also act. In the little way we can, we in \nthe small island developing States are also committed \nto contributing to emission reduction through use of \nrenewable energy. \n While we call for urgent action to reduce \nemissions, we know that the impacts of climate change \nare upon us. For a highly vulnerable small coral atoll \nnation like Tuvalu, the consequences of the impacts of \nclimate change are frightening. The survival and \nsecurity of our entire nation, along with fundamental \nhuman rights and its cultural identity, are under threat; \nTuvalu is right on the edge of existence. Climate \nchange could well push us over that edge. \n Last year Tuvalu produced an international \nblueprint on adaptation which we presented as a \nsubmission to the Conference of the parties to the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange. This blueprint highlights a number of areas \nwhere we envisage greater collaboration within the \nUnited Nations system. Let me highlight a few. \n First, it is very clear that financial resources for \nadaptation are completely inadequate. Last year Oxfam \nInternational suggested that the adaptation needs of \ndeveloping countries will cost a minimum of \n$50 billion per year. We must work together to find \nthese additional funds. One means of increasing the \n \n \n15 08-52265 \n \nfunding for adaptation is through the creation of what \nwe call a burden-sharing mechanism. Funding for this \nmechanism could come from levies on the share of the \nproceeds from emissions trading and international \naviation and maritime transport. \n We also believe that new and additional sources \nof funding must be identified and channelled through \nthe recently established Adaptation Fund to help fund \nconcrete adaptation projects in-country to adapt to the \nimpacts of climate change, while ensuring long-term \nsurvival and livelihoods of our God-given lands. While \nwe welcome, therefore, the recent launch of several \nnew funding initiatives on climate change, we must \ncaution against the fragmentation of international \nefforts, and warn of the need, not to do more studies, \nbut to fulfil obligations to urgently save those suffering \nfrom climate change. \n Secondly, we need collaborative action by United \nNations institutions and non-governmental organizations \nto develop a comprehensive approach to long-term \nadaptation action. As a first step, we believe, a special \ncoordination committee should be established under the \nauspices of the General Assembly. \n Thirdly, the blueprint proposes the establishment \nof an international climate insurance pool. This would \nbe an internationally sourced pool of funds for an \ninsurance mechanism to provide support to the most \nvulnerable communities to meet the costs of rebuilding \nafter climate-related disasters. \n Those are only three ideas we have elaborated in \nour blueprint. There are a number of others. We \nencourage the President to look closely at the blueprint \nand develop the ideas further. \n We strongly believe that it is the political and \nmoral responsibility of the world, particularly those \nwho caused the problem, to save small islands and \ncountries like Tuvalu from climate change and ensure \nthat we continue to live in our home islands with long-\nterm security, cultural identity and fundamental human \ndignity. Forcing us to leave our islands due to the \ninaction of those responsible is immoral, and cannot be \nused as a quick-fix solution to the problem. \n In the context of all this, therefore, Tuvalu also \nstrongly supports the draft resolution on security and \nclimate change submitted by the Pacific small island \ndeveloping States, to be reintroduced at this sixty-third \nsession. We urge others to co-sponsor this very \nimportant draft resolution and properly address the \nissues raised in it. \n Tuvalu recently attended the High-Level \nConference on World Food Security. We share the \ngrave concerns regarding the current global issue of \nhigh food prices, food shortages and their associated \nsocial problems for humanity, which are made worse \nby high fuel prices. We highly commend the initiative \ntaken by the Secretary-General in establishing the \nHigh-Level Task Force on the Global Food Security \nCrisis, and the formulation of a Comprehensive \nFramework for Action. We sincerely hope that this \nFramework will produce concrete results in countries \nexperiencing the food crisis.  \n One of the most sensitive issues for small and \nvulnerable island developing States like Tuvalu has \nbeen the lack of recognition of our unique vulnerability \nin the consideration of the question of graduation from \nthe least developed country (LDC) status. Our \neconomic and environmental vulnerabilities cannot be \nignored. The enormous threat of more severe weather \nevents and a rising sea level hangs overhead like a \nlarge storm cloud. It hinders investment in our country \nand potentially puts into question our very survival. We \ntherefore make a strong and heartfelt appeal to the \nGeneral Assembly, the Economic and Social Council \nand our development partners to carefully reconsider \nthe criteria for LDC graduation.  \n Two issues are of particular concern. First, it is \nremarkable that nearly all recent graduates and \npotential graduates are small islands \u2014 including my \nown country, Tuvalu. The small island States that are \nalso LDCs eligible for graduation all have improved \ntheir per capita income and their human assets. Also, \nthey have in common the fact that they are highly \nvulnerable in economic and environmental terms. But \nthis vital criterion of vulnerability does not seem to be \ntaken seriously enough. In short, our countries are or \ncould be losing LDC status because of progress they \nhave made on per capita income, despite the fact that \nthe sustainability of that income is challenged by our \nvulnerability.  \n My second point has to do with the serious lack \nof coherence within the United Nations system. For \nseveral years the high level of vulnerability of small \nisland developing States has been recognized and \nreiterated in many different United Nations circles \u2014 \nin Rio, Barbados, Mauritius and Johannesburg, as well \n  \n \n08-52265 16 \n \nas in several other major United Nations events, \nincluding the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \nSummit Declaration. Yet this special vulnerability has \nnever been given serious recognition in the General \nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council, let \nalone recognized as the main criterion for LDC \ngraduation.  \n I therefore call on the United Nations to work \nseriously towards reform of the graduation rule so that \nno LDC that is recognized as highly vulnerable is \nforced to lose its LDC status.  \n Tuvalu wishes to commend the ongoing reforms \nwithin the United Nations but would also note with \ngrave concern that progress is slow. We clearly need to \nrestructure and expand the Security Council in order to \nproperly reflect regional balance. We must take a fresh \nlook at the membership so that the Council can \nproperly address emerging global peace and security \nchallenges, including climate change. We also believe \nthat a seat should be allocated for a representative from \na small island developing State in the reformed \nSecurity Council.  \n In the broader context of United Nations reforms, \nI support the Secretary-General\u2019s remarks that  \n  \u201cOur changing world needs a stronger \nUnited Nations. \u2026  \n  \u201cwe need to be faster. \u2026 We need to pay \nless attention to rhetoric, and more attention to \nresults \u2014 to getting things done.\u201d (A/62/PV.4, \npp. 1-2)  \nI could not agree more. To this end, I appeal again to \nthe United Nations for the earliest establishment of its \nJoint Presence office in Tuvalu in order to facilitate \nbetter coordination of United Nations interventions.  \n Tuvalu believes strongly that nations have the \nright to self-determination. The United Nations must \nuphold this principle. Therefore, we believe it is time \nthat the United Nations properly addressed the issue of \nTaiwan\u2019s meaningful participation in the United \nNations specialized agencies. My Government strongly \nsupports Taiwan\u2019s aspirations to meaningfully \nparticipate in the United Nations and its specialized \nagencies, recognizing Taiwan\u2019s own political and \neconomic achievements and its constructive \ncontribution to international development, trade, \nhealth, education and technology. We appeal strongly \nthat Taiwan\u2019s aspirations to participate as a full \nmember of specialized agencies of the United Nations \nbe given proper and urgent attention.  \n Finally, our story on the achievement of the \nMDGs is mixed. For small island developing States \nlike Tuvalu, addressing our sustainable development \nchallenges is not simply poverty reduction. It is the \nMDGs-plus. More than ever, we need a significant \nincrease in direct financing, technology and capacity \ndevelopment, as recognized under the Mauritius \nStrategy for Implementation, to cope with our unique \nisland challenges.  \n Mr. Derrick Sikua (Solomon Islands), Vice-\nPresident, took the Chair.  \n My Government firmly believes that the next 12 \nmonths will be an extremely critical time in the history \nof the United Nations. We must act promptly and \ndecisively to address climate change, to achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals and to respond to the \nglobal crises on food and energy. These issues are \nclosely linked. We must rise to these challenges. \n God bless the United Nations. Tuvalu mo te Atua."

        "file_text": "On behalf of my delegation, I would like to express my \nsincere congratulations to you, Sir, on your outstanding \nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-third session. Your personal qualities, your in-\ndepth knowledge of our Organization and your great \nexperience in international affairs have enabled you to \ngather around you the support of the entire Assembly \nand certainly augur well for the success of your work. I \nalso extend my congratulations to the members of your \nBureau. Please be assured that our warmest wishes will \naccompany you throughout the session, which, under \nyour leadership, is sure to be crowned with success. \n \n \n29 08-53135 \n \n Allow me to pay fitting tribute to your \npredecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, for his work as \nPresident.  \n I would also like to welcome Secretary-General \nBan Ki-moon and wish him every success as he \nattempts to accomplish his noble and lofty mission to \nconsolidate and strengthen the role of the United \nNations. My delegation and I assure him of our fullest \ncooperation and support as he seeks peaceful solutions \nto the problems of the world. I convey to the Secretary-\nGeneral the deepest gratitude and the sincere thanks of \nHis Excellency Mr. Laurent Gbagbo, President of the \nRepublic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and the Ivorian Government \nfor his personal involvement in solving the crisis in my \ncountry. The Ivorian people still recall his historic visit \nof 23 and 24 April to C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. My country will \ncontinue to support him and, through him, the United \nNations Operation in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire so that it may \nsuccessfully accomplish its mission. \n May I also express the thanks and gratitude of the \nGovernment and the people of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire to the \ninternational community, and in particular to the \nFrench Government, for their commitment and their \nefforts, through Operation Licorne, to restore peace in \nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.  \n I take this opportunity once again to pay sincere \ntribute to the facilitator, Mr. Blaise Compaore, \nPresident of Burkina Faso and Chairman-in-Office of \nthe Economic Community of West African States \n(ECOWAS), for his untiring efforts on behalf of the \npeace process in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, in particular in the \nframework of the follow-up mechanism of the \nOuagadougou Political Agreement signed on 4 March \n2007. My thanks also go to the heads of State of the \nAfrican Union who spared no effort to resolve the \ncrisis roiling C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire since 19 September 2002. \n I wish solemnly to reaffirm the determination of \nmy country to emerge from the current crisis by \norganizing free, open and transparent elections. \nAttesting to our resolve was the launch on \n15 September 2008, of the penultimate phase of the \nelectoral process, which consists of identifying the \nvoting population and individual voters. \n The efforts of the international community to \nensure the return of peace to C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire \u2014 relying \non regional organizations such as ECOWAS and the \nAfrican Union, pursuant to President Gbagbo\u2019s \napproach to resolving conflicts \u2014 are gradually \nbearing fruit and giving rise to improvements in the \nsecurity situation throughout the country. For that \nreason, my country would be grateful if the United \nNations could take into account the new situation and \nonce again consider lowering its security index for \nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. \n In the same vein, my country would like to see \nthe Security Council sanctions committee accede to its \nrequest, made on 26 September 2007 from this very \nrostrum, for the lifting of individual sanctions imposed \non a number of Ivorian citizens. Allow me also, in the \nframework of the reorganization of the new Republican \nArmy called upon to maintain public order and \nsecurity, to appeal once again for the partial lifting of \nthe arms embargo, as requested by President Laurent \nGbagbo on that same occasion. \n More than ever before, our Organization must \nshow that it is able to maintain international peace and \nsecurity throughout the world. In that context, as was \nindicated by President Laurent Gbagbo at the high-\nlevel debate on the relationship between the United \nNations and regional organizations, this universal \nOrganization must open broad new avenues for peace \nin the world. Indeed, the United Nations, as an \ninstrument prepared at the end of the Second World \nWar to guarantee international peace, is no longer \nadapted to the current world. Therefore, as wished by a \nnumber of Member States, the reform of the United \nNations is necessary, and we must clarify its goals and \nits missions.  \n That is why my delegation feels that, after years \nof work and reflection on United Nations reform, the \ntime has now come to bring the process to a close. \nUnfortunately, with regard to the reform of the Security \nCouncil, although there may be a consensus on the \nneed to increase the number of members of the Council \nin order to make it more broadly representative, there \nare still differences with regard to its composition, the \nextension of the right of veto to potential new \npermanent members, and the improvement of its \nworking methods. In that respect, my country reaffirms \nits adherence to the African Common Position on that \nmatter.  \n The persistent search for peace will be in vain if \nwe do not bring greater justice to international \neconomic relations. In other words, there will be no \ngenuine peace so long as intolerable differences remain \nin the living conditions between various population \n  \n \n08-53135 30 \n \ngroups, on one hand, and between developed and \ndeveloping countries, on the other.  \n In that respect, I welcome the efforts undertaken \nby a number of countries to promote economic \ncooperation between them and the countries of Africa. \nExamples include cooperation with the European \ncountries through the European Union; with Japan \nthrough the Tokyo International Conference on African \nDevelopment; with China through the Forum on China-\nAfrica Cooperation; with the United States through the \nAfrican Growth and Opportunity Act; and with India \nand Turkey through their respective partnerships. \n Economic globalization was meant to open new \nhorizons for international cooperation, but overall it \nhas not been beneficial to developing countries because \nof the fragile nature of their economic structures. It \nwould therefore be an illusion to imagine that market \nforces alone can help the development of the poorest \ncountries. We must therefore regulate trade by adopting \nrules agreed at the global level, because only a fair \ninternational trade system can contribute to the \nexpansion of underdeveloped economies.  \n In that respect, my delegation deplores the failure \nin July of World Trade Organization negotiations that \nshould have breathed new life into international \ncooperation and created conditions for developing \ncountries to benefit from globalization through trade \nand investment. \n The issue of debt remains a cause for concern to a \nnumber of developing countries. That is why I would \nlike to welcome all the praiseworthy initiatives \nundertaken to alleviate its effects on the economies of \nthose countries.  \n The recent food crisis, whose devastating effects \nare being felt in several countries, requires the \ninternational community to go beyond mere promises \nand to act together, taking specific innovative and \ncourageous actions and measures that can, above all, \nbring hope to the situation and find a global response \nto a problem that has become global. \n In that regard, I welcome the establishment by the \nSecretary-General of the High-Level Task Force on the \nGlobal Food Security Crisis and the efforts of \ndeveloping countries to come to the rescue of those in \ntheir countries who have been the most seriously \naffected by the food crisis.  \n My country also welcomes the implementation of \nthe Centres of Excellence project carried out by the \nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development, \naimed at strengthening South-South cooperation \nscientific research in the agricultural field. With that in \nmind, President Laurent Gbagbo recommends the \ncreation of a solidarity-based mechanism through \nwhich exporting countries would provide food to \nimporting countries and the establishment of a United \nNations food stabilization fund. \n The energy crisis being felt throughout the world, \nin addition to its negative effects, is demonstrating \nonce again the fragility of the economies of a large \nnumber of countries. Although the development of \nbiofuels seems to be a good alternative to fossil \nfuels \u2014 which, much to our consternation, are running \nout \u2014 we must also ensure that their production is not \ncarried out to the detriment of agriculture, the main \npurpose of which is to feed the people of the world. \nThat is why, in the interest of current and future \ngenerations, we must think carefully and deeply about \nthe adoption and development of new, renewable \nsources of energy. \n With regard to all of the crises and difficulties \nthat humanity is facing, now more than ever before the \ninternational community must translate into action the \nidea of solidarity and cooperation, as contained in the \nCharter of the United Nations, in order to restore \ncredibility to the Organization. Such solidarity should \nbe demonstrated first and foremost by the \nimplementation of the commitments undertaken by the \nindustrialized countries to devote at least 0.7 per cent \nof their gross national income to official development \nassistance.  \n To that end, I would like to welcome all \ninitiatives aimed at helping developing countries in \ngeneral, and African countries in particular, to \novercome their current economic situation. The \ndiligent implementation of the New Partnership for \nAfrica\u2019s Development, the main goal of which is to \nfight poverty, is part of such an approach. It is on that \nnote of hope that my delegation calls on the \ninternational community to seek solutions to current \nchallenges in a United Nations that is more democratic \nand that responds to each and every one of its \nMembers.

        "file_text": "Mr. President, allow me to extend you the warmest and \nmost heartfelt greeting of the people and the \nGovernment of Honduras. I would also extend this \ngreeting to all nations and peoples represented here. I \ncongratulate you, Sir, a distinguished representative of \nthe Republic of Nicaragua who today is leading the \nAssembly. Your prestige as a man of peace and \nharmony and as a builder of dreams and utopias has \nbeen recognized throughout the world through the \nnumerous prizes you have received, which honour the \npeoples of Central America. \n Honduras currently holds the presidency pro \ntempore of the Central American Integration System, \nand I would like to recognize the work of the United \nNations and use this opportunity also to recognize the \ndetermination of the Central American Presidents to \nbring about a process of Central American integration. \nAs was recognized by the European Commission, the \nregion of the world that is unifying the most and \nbecoming the most integrated is Central America \u2014 \nafter Europe, of course. That is part of an important \nprocess, because we are addressing on areas and \nsectors that are important for our society. \n Francisco Moraz\u00e1n was a martyr who gave his \nlife for the cause of Central American union and for \nliberal policies, opposing the enemies of independence \nand freedom. The peoples of Central America and of \nHonduras continue to fight for these causes. We \ncontinue to fight for unity as we seek to establish \neconomic independence. In recent years, Honduras has \nachieved a sustainable growth rate of between 6 and \n7 per cent, and we have been able to reduce poverty \nand have recognized the international and national \nimportance of protecting the environment. Honduras \nhas become a tourist destination in Central America, \nbecause of the beauty of its main Caribbean Bay \nIslands, such as Guanaja, Utila and Roat\u00e1n. \n However, today, all of those advances in our \neconomy and in the fight against poverty are being put \nin jeopardy by the crisis and the international scale of \nthe financial fraud that has been brought about by the \nbig multinationals in the world. The serious events that \ntoday have dragged us into a food and energy crisis \nwith high fuel prices, and the collapse of the financial \nsystems, particularly here in the United States of \n  \n \n08-51839 2 \n \nAmerica, have shown that what I and others Presidents \nare saying today are historic and irrefutable truths. \n For example, in our countries, particularly in \nHonduras, poverty and inequality are continuing to \ngrow more marked in our societies. The State continues \nto become weaker through privatizations and capital is \nconcentrated in a few firms and a few hands, lessening \ncapacity to produce and generate development for our \npeople. In recent years, the unequal distribution of \nwealth and income has become ever more entrenched. \nIn Honduras, less than 1 per cent of the population \npossesses 70 per cent of the national wealth. Barely \n10 families with links to international capital control \nthe main economic activities of the country, naturally \nimpoverishing the rest of the population. \n Over the last two centuries, our peoples and our \nregion have resisted with heroism, dignity and stoicism \nthe onslaught of the cruel system that governs us. Pope \nJohn Paul II himself came to call that capitalistic \nsystem savage, an immoral mercantile system that \nexploits men and women and turns them into mere \ncommodities and numbers. The merciless and demonic \nlaws of the invincible market only satisfy the wealth \nand power of the few, to the detriment of the great \nmajority of our societies. They believe themselves \ninfallible gods. They are like a sinister Proteus that \nplays cat and mouse with people. They act like Saturn, \nthe Greek god who devoured his children out of fear \nthat they would dethrone him. However, today, with \nthat logic of the law of the market, his sons are \ndevouring their creator in the very cradle of capitalism, \nin the great centre of Wall Street or the other hubs of \nspeculative capital in the world. \n To give an example, the international trafficking \nof drugs, arms and people are other scourges that \nprevent us developing peoples from achieving the \neconomic freedom and independence to which our \nnations aspire. The submission of our poor countries to \nthe economic choices of international capital is brutal \nand surprising. We can say that capitalism is devouring \nhuman beings in most parts of the world, and \nparadoxically it is now also devouring the very creators \nof that system. Here I shall mention two particularly \nsalient examples. In Honduras, over the last 20 years, \nmany small coffee producers have succeeded in \nincreasing their exports from $200 million to almost \n$600 million. That involved 20 years of hard work. \nHowever, in the last 12 months, in barely a year, with \nthe doubling of the prices of energy, oil, food, wheat \nand the main staples that we consume, we are now \nlosing what we achieved in that period of hard work. \n Another example is what has happened here to \nthe mandate of the United Nations. In 2000, this \nOrganization agreed that poverty should be reduced by \nat least 50 per cent in 15 years, which we know is not \ncoming about. The goal of reducing poverty and the \ncontributions that the international community pledged \nto the developing world are not being translated into \nreality. In contrast, by way of giving an example, for \neach dollar that the international community \ncontributes to cooperation, it allocates 10 dollars to the \narms race. \n Another quite fantastic example to give today is \nwhat is happening with the bankruptcy of the big \ninvestment banks. Now people are racing to provide \nfunds to those big banks. Logically, if we were to \nprovide them with what is being proposed today to \nsave those banking institutions that have created that \nspeculative capital \u2014 a sum of $700 billion \u2014 with \njust a third of that amount we could reduce and \nimmediately put an end to poverty in Africa, Asia or \nLatin America. That system is the true present-day \nKing Midas, who tried to convert everything into gold \nand profit for one particular sector. We shall never be \nfree under that system, and we know that we must not \naccept that condition of neo-slavery and \nneocolonialism through which, by its domination, it \nbends us to its purposes. \n The question for us all is can that difficult \nsituation being experienced today, particularly by the \nless developed countries, be saved. The answer is yes, \nwe can save ourselves from that crisis. We can respond. \nFirst, the State must act, the State must operate again in \nterms of social commitment. Capital must be used so \nthat it serves to build a genuinely fair society. The aim \nshould not be to destroy the market but simply to \nconstruct a social market economy. Capital should \nexist, but with limits. Defining the limits of capitalism \nis important to put an end to its primitive laws of the \njungle. The aim is not to eliminate entrepreneurship \nand the free market, but to check and regulate the \nabuses and to humanize and sensitize those who are in \nthe driving seat.  \n We must support a genuine democratic system, \nnot only in international bodies but also internally \nwithin our countries. We must reform false democracy, \nwhich uses different political means to legitimize that \n \n \n3 08-51839 \n \nsystem of exploitation and injustice. It is a false \ndemocracy, in which men and women are seen merely \nas voters, as useful instruments employed only to \ndistribute power, whose consciences are manipulated \nby the highest bidder in a political comedy in which \nthose who possess wealth impose their mercantile \nirrationality on the larger group of those who are \nexcluded from and marginalized by the system. We \nmust reform that system, improve it and strengthen it \nso as to convert it into a genuine democracy. It is by \nthe logic of political democracies that Governments are \ncontrolled and States manipulated, basic services are \nprivatized and the whole of society is indoctrinated \nwith an ideology of gain, egoism and individualism. \n Imperialism as a system of domination of \ncountries and of trade must disappear from the face of \nthe Earth. The twenty-first century, and the peoples of \nthe twenty-first century, should not have to pay for the \nexcesses and brutality of the twentieth century.  \n We agree that property must exist, as it has a \nsocial function. Since the beginning of social \norganization in the world, property has always been \ngranted within the framework of collective ownership. \nThere must be the authority to intervene in speculative \nmarkets, as is happening now in the United States. \nTraders and their spokespeople do not have the right to \ndirect society. The strategic areas of the economy must \nbe at the service of the State and under its control to \nensure that society never finds itself without food or \nmedicine and that consumers are not robbed. Profits \nproduced by work, wealth and capital should be better \ndistributed in our societies among the real owners \u2014 \nworkers, producers, capitalists, consumers and the \nState \u2014 in order to attain a common good.  \n The major transnational companies that produce \nmedicines and chemical products should make \navailable to developing countries the patents for \ntechnological discoveries that can improve living \nconditions for our citizens. This is a time for human \nsolidarity.  \n We should end unfair competition in markets by \neliminating subsidies in industrialized countries and \nremoving tariff and non-tariff barriers. That would be a \ngood message of the international community, a good \nintention at this time of crisis, for those peoples that \nwere once their colonies, a message that we are no \nlonger looked upon as mere game reserves but as \nbrothers in humanity.  \n I am sure that the peoples of the world are able to \ncome together to provide alternatives to a crude system \nthat kills and destroys everything that does not adapt to \nits unmerciful laws. \n Developed countries have a responsibility \ntowards the peoples. Members know that very well. \nThis afternoon we want to say, from this United \nNations rostrum, that we are very grateful to the \ndeveloped world, the industrialized world, for their \ncooperation with us at certain times. However, our \npeoples and our countries do not want donations. We \nhave not come here to beg.  \n What we want is to be treated with equality and \nrespect, and the right to opportunities and to \nparticipate. We do not want to be affected by the \nasymmetries in the economies and differences in \ndeveloped countries. We do not want to have models \nimposed on us, models that only impoverish our \nnations. We do not want to be given lessons about how \nto manage our economies. We want to be given \nexamples of solidarity and responsibility in the face of \nthe major problems of nations, examples of how to \ndistinguish between matters of importance to human \nbeings and matters that are simply material. To \ndeveloped countries we say that if they offer us aid, do \nnot attach conditions to our acceptance of it. Do not \ninsist that we accept a neoliberal model that is \nsuffocating and exploiting our communities.  \n We cannot continue to measure development of \ncountries by the profits of large companies. We must \nmeasure development by the access of young people to \neducation and jobs, of children to food, of mothers to \nhospitals, of those who are ill to treatment, and of the \nundernourished to food. \n We say to the countries of the Group of Eight \n(G8), with all due respect, that that very important \norganization should expand its membership to include \ncountries that represent the five continents, to include \ncountries of the Americas, such as Mexico, Brazil, \nBolivia or Cuba, or, from other areas, India. The G8 \nshould increase its capacity for dialogue with, for \nexample, Central America or the South American \nCommon Market (MERCOSUR), where there are so \nmany societies that could contribute with ideas, for \nideas are sometimes worth more than money.  \n The countries that cooperate should respect \nnational systems and not impose their own aid \nreception mechanisms on us. They should respect the \n  \n \n08-51839 4 \n \nnational priorities and systems that each country has \ndeveloped in its programmes, the planning of \nGovernments legitimately elected by the people. \n Likewise, with all due respect to the European \ncountries and to the United States of America, we wish \nto ask them to consider \u2014 as a gesture of goodwill and \nin light of the problems that we ourselves are suffering \nas a result of the financial imbalances that those \ncountries caused \u2014 the rights of immigrants who are \nalready on their territories. I would also like to recall \nthat the peoples living in the lands of America and \nEurope were themselves once immigrants in those \nlands. \n What does it cost to reunite migrant families and \nto begin to deal with their documentation, instead of \ndeporting them? To immigrate is a human right, not a \ncrime, and we should consider it in the context of \nrespect for society. All of us want peace and harmony, \nand this is the best means of obtaining them. \n The world is also concerned with the enlargement \nof the Security Council. Like other presidents who \nhave spoken about this matter from this podium over \nthe decades, we believe that there should be \ndemocratization at the very top of the United Nations, \nand the example should begin at home. That way we \ncould discuss the real problems of humanity and find \nsolutions.  \n We therefore need to establish a new pedagogy, a \nnew way of education of our peoples, our children and \nfuture generations. We must cultivate, as is logical, \ngenuine freedom for our nations, freedom of the press, \nfreedom of movement, an honest freedom that gives \nthe people the opportunity to know the truth about their \nproblems without lies and manipulation. \n The new manner of teaching that we are \nproposing to the General Assembly today could be \npromoted through the development programmes of the \nUnited Nations. We must begin to teach the value of \nsolidarity among human beings, among countries and \namong the various organizations represented here. That \nteaching should demonstrate in a practical way that the \ncentre of the world is not material possessions or \nmoney; the centre of the world should always be the \nhuman being \u2014 men and women, young people, \nchildren, the elderly, those beings with a soul and who \nare made in the image of the Creator of the universe. \n In conclusion, I wish to take a moment to read a \npoem entitled, \u201cGold\u201d, by the Honduran poet and \nwriter Alfonso Guill\u00e9n Zelaya, who described well \nthrough poetry the events we have addressed in the \nAssembly.  \n\u201cGold killed in men the native communion;  \nIt divided the Earth and corrupted affection. \nBefore that, hunger did not exist. \nFruit grew in all places freely before this, \nWaters, hunting, the plains were free. \nAs there were no owners, there were never thieves. \nLife was one of peace, of love and of gentleness. \nPeople were good, like blessings. \nBut, Lord of the gifts, \nYour gifts are gone. \nWe are now condemned to live without fortune,  \nEverything that we have made, \nOur own clothing, with the gold of the stars and the \nsilver of the moon.\u201d \n This is the Christian moral; it is the moral of the \nmessage today, tomorrow and forever, that we must \naccept the fact that this world is extremely materialistic \nand not very spiritual. It was the message offered when \na tycoon approached the Master of Galilee and asked, \nLord, how do I save myself? He replied: leave your \npossessions and follow me.  \n I would like to end with those thoughts on liberty, \nwhich is what our societies most need today. Let us \nensure that the liberty advocated by our forefathers \u2014 \nMart\u00ed, Bol\u00edvar and Moraz\u00e1n \u2014 transforms the destiny \nof globalization so that we convert it into a \nglobalization of solidarity, of justice and of harmony \namong the peoples. We must regain trust in the \ncollective so that we can return to trusting in reason \nand say to the minority that they cannot be the reason \nfor the State simply because of what they own. That \nalienating argument is unsustainable for the peoples of \nthe world.  \n I fervently appeal this afternoon for us to secure \nvotes for the freedom and peace of all peoples and \nnations of the Earth, for the principles expressed and \nratified today in the sixty-third session of the General \nAssembly, because I firmly believe that a new world, \nanother world, a better world is still possible. We have \nunited to defend important matters of other countries. \nWe have united to defend the positions of President \nEvo Morales in Bolivia so that a real social democracy \ncan be established, as he has advocated. Based on those \n \n \n5 08-51839 \n \nprinciples, we have signed the Bolivarian Alternative \nfor the Americas \u2014 ALBA \u2014 and, based on those \nprinciples, we hope that the international community \nwill also provide the international solidarity needed by \nTaiwan, which is asking for that solidarity. \n We ask that God\u2019s blessing for you all and for \nyour families and your nations become a reality today, \ntomorrow and forevermore.

Despite past and \ncontinuing challenges, this Organization remains an \nirreplaceable forum where the representatives of many \nnations can exchange opinions concerning the most \npressing issues facing the world we all live in. \n Allow me at the outset to welcome the election of \nMr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann of Nicaragua as \nPresident of the Assembly at its sixty-third session. I \nconvey to him our unwavering readiness to cooperate \nduring the year of his mandate. At the same time, allow \nme to congratulate the previous President, my \ncompatriot Srgjan Kerim, on his contribution to the \nwork of the world Organization over the past year, \nduring which numerous issues of global importance \n \n \n5 08-51845 \n \nwere considered. Through his engagement, my country, \nthe Republic of Macedonia, has confirmed in the best \npossible way the values for which we stand and the \nprinciples in which we believe when it comes to \ninternational relationships, namely, multilateralism as \nthe key tool for cooperation and for the promotion of \nthe fundamental values of peace, democracy and \nhuman rights and freedoms. \n I take this opportunity also to welcome the efforts \nof the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, who \ncontributed greatly to the useful and functional \noperation of the Organization over the past year. \n In 2008 we enter the second half of the term \nenvisioned for the attainment of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. The results accomplished thus far \nare not to be underestimated, but they are still far from \nsatisfactory. Furthermore, even the Goals that have \nalready been achieved are now jeopardized by the new \nchallenges and problems we are facing: the surge in oil \nand food prices and the adverse effects of climate \nchange. \n During this year, a slowdown in economic \ndevelopment has been noted in many countries; that is \nconfirmed by numerous indicators forecasting regional \nand global recession. It is therefore of the utmost \nimportance to devise new stimuli for the \nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals. \nOur debate should thus focus on issues such as \ndevelopment and the implementation of effective \nconcepts for sustainable development, as a crucial part \nof any agenda for the maintenance of long-term peace, \nstability and security in the world. \n Speaking of issues related to the sustainability of \npeace and security, we have unfortunately to note that \nhere there are not many reasons for satisfaction. We are \nstill facing numerous crisis situations and old and \nfrozen conflicts, as well as a series of recent turbulent \nincidents and tensions in several regions of the world. \nTerrorist acts continue to occur with worrisome \nfrequency, yet Member States remain unable to reach \nconsensus on a truly necessary global counter-terrorism \nconvention. Such recalcitrance has rightly led some \npeople to question the relevance of the United Nations \nin the present context, as well as the true meaning and \nscope of multilateralism and the selective \nimplementation of international law and principles. \n This year we commemorate the sixtieth \nanniversary of the adoption of the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights, and it is only proper to \nask ourselves whether universal respect for its \nprovisions is possible. Human rights problems will \ncertainly not decrease if there continue to be different \ninterpretations of the provisions of the Declaration or if \nthose provisions are only partially implemented. \nAcceptance of the entire body of human rights is the \nbasis of the rule of law and fundamental to resolving \nbilateral and international conflicts. Only if those \nprovisions are universally accepted and sincerely \nsupported by all of us will humanity be able to proceed \non the path towards progress. \n Solutions to problems should be sought within \nthe framework of respect for agreed norms and through \nequitable dialogue and cooperation. In that context, the \nUnited Nations has a specific and valuable role that \nshould not be neglected. It is therefore especially \nimportant to develop the Organization further so that it \nmay become more efficient and more relevant in a \nbroader sense, as well as more responsible for the \npeople on whose behalf it acts. I am deeply convinced \nthat our differences are among the greatest values that \nwe possess and that each Member State, regardless of \nits size, has a valuable contribution to make. It is \ntherefore necessary to overcome our existing \ndifferences for the sake of a more efficient United \nNations that will serve the world in the twenty-first \ncentury in the best possible way. \n Over the past few years, South-East Europe and \nthe Balkans have begun moving in the right direction. \nAlthough it is certain that not all open problems and \nissues have been resolved, the tendency of the region \ntowards closer integration with international bodies is \nclearly discernable. The activities of my country, the \nRepublic of Macedonia, are directed towards \ncontinuing participation in and support for regional \nprojects and the consistent promotion of comprehensive \nregional cooperation with all neighbouring countries. We \ndo not doubt that only together with the rest of the \nBalkan countries will we be able to contribute to the \naccelerated integration of the entire region into the \nEuropean and Euro-Atlantic structures. \n At the domestic level, the Republic of Macedonia \nis continuously working towards the sustainability of \nits specific model of functional multi-ethnic \ndemocracy. We believe that our model has broad and \npositive regional implications because it has shown \nthat it is possible for different nations and cultures to \nshare the same territory and coexist productively. \n  \n \n08-51845 6 \n \n Two strategic goals that have enjoyed our highest \npriority for years are integration into the European \nUnion and NATO. In recent years, we have invested \nsignificant resources and focused all our efforts on the \naccomplishment of those goals. Unfortunately, at the \nNATO summit held in April 2008 in Romania, an \ninternational precedent was set when the narrow \nnational interests of one country were presented as \nbeing more important than the established principles of \ninternational law. \n Despite the obvious absurdity of the issue, my \ncountry is participating actively and constructively in \nthe negotiating process with the Republic of Greece, \nmediated by the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-\nGeneral, Ambassador Matthew Nimetz. At the same \ntime, we have consistently respected our legal \nobligations and affirmed our constructive role by \nmaking numerous suggestions and concessions during \nthe long-standing process. \n I recall that, at the time of Macedonia\u2019s \nadmittance to the United Nations in 1993, the first \nmajor legal precedent was set. A decision was adopted \non that occasion to the effect that, instead of using the \nname which my country had chosen, other Members \nwould address us as \u201cthe former Yugoslav Republic of \nMacedonia\u201d. \n Unfortunately, I am forced to conclude that in \nthat time the other party has not demonstrated the same \nlevel of dedication to its agreed obligations, as \nconfirmed by its flagrant breach of the Interim Accord \nsigned by both countries in 1995. According to that \ndocument, the Hellenic Republic is legally bound not \nto object to Macedonia\u2019s application for membership to \ninternational, multilateral and regional institutions and \norganizations in which the Hellenic Republic is already \na full member. Contrary to the agreed obligations, at \nthe NATO summit held in April 2008 in Bucharest, \nGreece objected to the invitation to admittance to \nNATO extended to the Republic of Macedonia and \ninsisted that, prior to integration, a mutually acceptable \nsolution to the dispute must be reached. The very logic \nof the negotiations was seriously undermined by that \nact, while at the same time the principles of the United \nNations Charter were derogated. Taking advantage of \nits status as a standing member, the Hellenic Republic \nhas begun obstructing our integration into the \nEuropean Union, using similar arguments. \n Let me take this opportunity to highlight once \nagain before the Assembly our position, which has \nbeen openly expressed on numerous occasions. As a \nresponsible country fully aware of its internationally \nagreed obligations, the Republic of Macedonia is ready \nto accept a fair compromise and a reasonable solution \nthat will not deny our national and cultural identity. It \nis understandable that we are not ready to consent to \njust any kind of solution in a case of such national \nimportance. If our integration into international \ninstitutions is to help stabilize our State, then we \nshould not allow ourselves to be humiliated and \ninternally destabilized by an unsatisfactory compromise. \n To conclude, allow me to reiterate the well-known \nfundamental position in which we, as a State, believe \nand intend to firmly uphold in the years to come. The \nprinciples and values enshrined in the Charter of the \nUnited Nations are the highest goals around which we \nshould all unite. Respect for those principles and for \nthe full equality of States and peoples is the sole \nguarantee for the noble mission of creating a more \ndignified and just world. "

        "file_text": "I would like to \nextend my congratulations to His Excellency \nMr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann on his election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \nsession. I also wish to express my deep appreciation to \nHis Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \ndedication to having the United Nations meet global \nchallenges in a more effective and timely manner. I \nassure them of the Republic of Korea\u2019s full support for \ntheir noble endeavours. \n As I stand here, I recall those turbulent days \nseven years ago when we stood shaken by the terrorist \nacts in the morning of 11 September 2001. Throughout \nmy presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-\nsixth session, all Member States were united in dealing \nwith the grave challenges in the shadow of 9/11. \n On 12 September 2001, this Assembly began its \nfifty-sixth session by adopting resolution 56/1, strongly \ncondemning the terrorist acts and calling for a \nconcerted effort by the international community to \ncombat terrorism. With the close cooperation that \nfollowed, counter-terrorist capacity has been \nstrengthened at all levels. \n Nevertheless, as we are witnessing in many parts \nof the world today, terrorism continues to threaten and \ntake the lives of innocent people. As the international \ncommunity shares the concern over such an intractable \ntrend, it is time for us to renew our commitment to \ncompletely root out terrorism in all its forms and \nmanifestations. \n This year marks the sixtieth anniversary of the \nfounding of the Republic of Korea. The Republic of \nKorea was the first country to have the establishment \nof its Government recognized by the United Nations \n  \n \n08-51851 32 \n \nthrough a General Assembly resolution, back in \nDecember 1948. Thanks to the Assembly\u2019s continuous \nsupport, the Republic of Korea was able to step into the \ntwenty-first century as a full-fledged democracy and \nvibrant economy. It is my sincere hope that this special \nrelationship will further develop and strengthen in the \nyears to come. \n Over the past six decades, the United Nations has \nstrived for the common good of the international \ncommunity and has become ever more relevant to the \nwell-being of the present and future generations of \nhumankind. It is currently leading the global efforts to \nachieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \nand is demonstrating strong stewardship in addressing \nthe global food and energy crises, as well as climate \nchange. \n Standing at the midpoint to the MDG target year \nof 2015, we realize that, in order to achieve what we \npledged, all Member States will have to redouble their \ncommitments to the MDGs. But political commitment \nalone is not enough. We need solid economic growth \nand a coherent strategy to translate our commitment \ninto reality. \n While the rapid growth experiences of Korea and \nother countries have served as a useful reference for \nmany developing countries, we should move beyond \nthe conventional economic growth approach of \u201cgrow \nfirst, clean up later\u201d. Rather, what we need is green and \npro-poor growth. \n Climate change, on which the future of humanity \nso critically depends, is now looming larger than ever \nas a global challenge. Adverse impacts of climate \nchange are threatening the very foundation of the \nMDGs, inter alia, by affecting agriculture, upon which \nthe livelihood of many in the developing world \ndepends, and by increasing climate-related natural \ndisasters, which are hitting hard the most vulnerable \nbottom billion, as in the case of Typhoon Nargis. \n The conventional growth approach based on \ncheap fossil fuel is among the factors driving up the \nprices of oil and food. As such, we need a new climate-\nfriendly strategy for energy and development if we are \nto attain the goals of the MDGs while addressing \nclimate change. I encourage all agencies of the United \nNations to closely cooperate to develop a new road \nmap. In that regard, I would like to express my full \nsupport for the energetic leadership of Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon, who has been working hard to \nplace climate change as our top priority on the global \nagenda. \n The Republic of Korea recently embraced a low-\ncarbon, green growth paradigm. We strongly believe \nthat that is and should be the new paradigm for growth \nand development of the world in the future. We support \nthe global vision of reducing greenhouse gas emissions \nby 50 per cent by 2050 and plan to announce next year \nour voluntary midterm mitigation goal set for the year \n2020. We will also launch the East Asia Climate \nPartnership, which will initiate programmes in the \namount of $200 million over the next five years to \nsupport other countries in making their economic \ngrowth compatible with climate change concerns. \n In 2002, I attended the World Summit on \nSustainable Development, held in Johannesburg, in my \ncapacity as President of the General Assembly. \nThrough that and other experiences, I have come to \nfirmly believe in the importance of high-level \ncommitments to strengthening our efforts and political \nmomentum on issues concerning the environment and \ndevelopment. In that vein, I would like to emphasize \nthat a new world summit focusing on climate change \nand sustainable development needs to be held in 2012, \nnot least to ensure a strong take-off for a post-2012 \nclimate regime. \n Given that the past three conferences were held in \nEurope, America and Africa respectively, it could well \nbe Asia\u2019s turn to host the next. Asia is the most \npopulous region in the world and is undergoing vibrant \neconomic transformation, which makes the sustainable \ndevelopment issue all the more relevant. As a country \nwell-placed to play a bridging role between developed \nand developing nations, the Republic of Korea hopes to \nmake a contribution by hosting that conference. \n The global food crisis is another factor \ncontributing to instability by increasing the population \naffected by poverty and starvation. It is also \nthreatening to reverse many of the gains we have \nachieved thus far in the development field. As the \ncauses behind the current food crisis are complex and \nvaried, our responses must be comprehensive as well \nas timely. \n The Republic of Korea has provided \nhumanitarian assistance to countries facing food crises. \nI am pleased to inform the Assembly that the Republic \nof Korea, in addition to its assistance to the Democratic \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea, has decided to offer \n \n \n33 08-51851 \n \n$100 million over the next three years for emergency \nfood aid and for assistance to strengthen the \nagricultural capacities of developing countries. With \nfirst-hand knowledge in agricultural development, \nKorea plans to assist in various areas, including \nfarming infrastructure, technology and policymaking. \n This year also marks the sixtieth anniversary of \nthe adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights. Over the decades, the United Nations has \nplayed an indispensable role in setting international \nnorms and principles to ensure all human rights for all. \nThis year saw further progress, with the \nimplementation of the Universal Periodic Review by \nthe Human Rights Council and with the Convention on \nthe Rights of Persons with Disabilities taking effect. At \nthe same time, we need to redouble efforts to stem the \nserious human rights violations that still continue in \ncertain regions. The Republic of Korea urges those \nhuman rights violators to urgently respond to the \ninternational community\u2019s call for dialogue and \ncooperation and to follow up with appropriate \nmeasures to enhance human rights. \n In the area of United Nations reform, it is more \ncrucial now than ever that the United Nations operate \nefficiently, effectively and responsively. The Republic \nof Korea supports all efforts, in particular the \ninitiatives taken by the Secretary-General, to make the \nSecretariat more accountable, efficient and responsive. \n As for the Security Council, in order for it to \nbetter fulfil its mandate of maintaining international \npeace and security, it needs to be reformed to ensure \nthat it is more representative, accountable and efficient. \nMoreover, considering the importance of the Security \nCouncil, every effort should be made to acquire a \ngeneral agreement among all Member States in steering \nthe direction of the reform. It should be not an issue of \ndivision, but one that unites Member States. \n The new Government of the Republic of Korea \nhas posited contributing to the international community \nas a trusted partner as one of the pillars of its foreign \npolicy. To that end, we are strengthening our role in \nofficial development assistance and peacekeeping \noperations. \n Since 2000, our official development assistance \nhas increased three times in volume, with assistance to \nAfrica increasing threefold in the past three years. We \nplan to triple our current official development \nassistance to reach over $3 billion by 2015. To better \ncoordinate our development cooperation policy with \nthe international community, the Republic of Korea \nplans to join the Development Assistance Committee of \nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment in 2010.  \n The Republic of Korea is also seeking ways to \nstrengthen its participation in United Nations \npeacekeeping operations. Currently, we have a 350-\nstrong contingent dispatched to the United Nations \nInterim Force in Lebanon and are considering \nlegislation to facilitate our participation in \npeacekeeping operations. \n The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \nand their delivery systems poses a grave threat to \ninternational peace and security. We must strengthen \nthe disarmament and non-proliferation regimes, \nincluding the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons (NPT). In that regard, it is crucial \nthat the North Korean nuclear issue be expeditiously \nresolved. That issue has remained for many years a \nthreat to the security of North-East Asia while \nseriously undermining the very foundations of the NPT \nregime. \n The Republic of Korea is making every effort to \nresolve the North Korean nuclear issue within the \nframework of the Six-Party Talks, under which some \nprogress has been made. However, Pyongyang\u2019s recent \nmove to suspend the disablement measures and attempt \nto reverse the process is highly regrettable. We urge the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea to resume \ndisablement measures immediately so that the positive \nmomentum generated by the Six-Party Talks process \ncan be maintained and the denuclearization process can \nmove forward. \n With a view to developing more mature \ninter-Korean relations in a pragmatic and productive \nway, the Republic of Korea pursues a policy of mutual \nbenefits and common prosperity. As progress is made \nin denuclearization, we stand ready to support \neconomic development in the North. We are also \nwilling to hold discussions with Pyongyang on how to \nimplement properly all past inter-Korean agreements, \nincluding the Basic Agreement of 1992. President Lee \nMyung-bak, in his speech to the National Assembly in \nJuly, proposed to fully restore inter-Korean dialogue \nand emphasized that we are ready to render our \ncooperation to alleviate the food crisis in the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. We look \n  \n \n08-51851 34 \n \nforward to the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea \naccepting the offer for dialogue so that real progress \ncan be made in inter-Korean relations. \n Eventually, I believe that we will see more peace \nand prosperity in North-East Asia. The region is \nalready a major powerhouse for economic growth in \nthe world. With the peaceful resolution of the North \nKorean nuclear issue, countries in the region will be \nable to accelerate cooperation to make North-East Asia \nmore stable and future-oriented. Undoubtedly, that will \nin turn contribute greatly to the peace and prosperity of \nthe world. \n Currently, the international community is \ngrappling with the grave financial turmoil that \nthreatens to spread worldwide. It has even been feared \nthat the turmoil could lead to a recession of the \nmagnitude of the Great Depression of the 1930s. \nWithout a doubt, the current instability in the financial \nmarket could have a devastating, domino-like impact \non the real economy of this globalized world. \n We have to be careful, however, not to rush into \nprotectionist policies either for fear of uncertainty or \nout of self-interest. There are hard-learned lessons \nfrom the Depression of the 1930s: the \u201cbeggar thy \nneighbour\u201d policy and the policy of raising tariffs to \nprotect particular industries harmed the world \neconomy. Therefore, I strongly believe that any \nsolution should be based on an even closer cooperation \nwithin the international community and the open \nmarket economy. \n Today, the expectations placed upon the United \nNations by the international community are higher than \never. However, what the United Nations can achieve \ncannot be greater than the sum of all our individual \nachievements unless there are synergistic effects. \nTherefore, all of us, each and every Member State, \nshould not only do our best in carrying out our \nresponsibilities, but should also be willing to help and \nreach out to others. Only by doing so can this global \nbody live up to and even exceed the expectations of the \ninternational community. To that end, the Republic of \nKorea will faithfully do its part. "

        "file_text": "The collapse of the recent \nDoha talks is deeply troubling. The Doha Development \nRound was the first round of talks to be launched after \nthe end of the cold war. \n Two years after the failed start at Seattle, it was \nlaunched again two months after 11 September 2001, \nwhen member countries of the World Trade \nOrganization (WTO) felt a strong sense of common \ncause. Since then, however, progress has been \npainfully difficult. I remember WTO Director-General \nPascal Lamy telling me that not enough countries felt a \nsense of responsibility for the global trading system. \nThe recent setback in Geneva means that it will be \nsome time before the Doha Development Round can be \nconcluded. \n During the Cold War, the United States and the \nEuropean Union effectively led the global trading \nsystem of the non-communist world. In 1994, the \nUruguay Round was finally concluded after United \nStates and European negotiators struck a bargain at \nBlair House, much to the unhappiness of many \ncountries that felt excluded but went along nonetheless. \nFor the Doha Development Agenda, however, a \nnumber of developing country members were \ndetermined that this should not happen again.  \n  \n \n08-53135 10 \n \n Brazil played a leading role in forming the Group \nof Twenty (G-20) coalition of countries, including \nIndia and China. At the Canc\u00fan talks in September \n2003, the G-20 became a grouping whose position \ncould not be ignored, altering the traditional dynamics \nof multilateral trade negotiations. When the talks failed \nin July, it was apparently over the issues of agricultural \nsafeguards for China and India, but even if a \ncompromise over safeguards had been possible, United \nStates cotton subsidies, which were next on the agenda, \nwould still have been a major sticking point. \n The failure of the Geneva talks comes at a time \nwhen the global economy is rapidly slowing down. \nMany of us worry that the downturn will be severe \nbecause of the collapse of huge asset bubbles inflated \nover many years by loose monetary policies. \nProtectionist pressures will now build up in many \ncountries. A rise in trade protectionism could reduce \nglobal welfare by many billions of dollars. Our \ncollective efforts to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) have become much \nharder. \n Who takes responsibility for the global trading \nsystem? Who takes responsibility for the global \nsystem? While on paper the 153 WTO members make \ndecisions by consensus, the reality is that a small group \nof countries has to take the lead to keep the multilateral \ntrading system moving in the right direction. On no \nmajor issue confronting the human family can \ndecisions be taken without the major countries taking \nthe lead. The challenge of climate change, for example, \ncannot be tackled without the major emitters coming to \nsome broad agreement on the way forward. If the Doha \nRound, despite being a positive-sum game, is so \ndifficult to conclude, it is hard to be optimistic that a \nUnited Nations agreement on climate change can be \nnegotiated quickly without the exercise of strong \nleadership by the United States, Europe, Russia, China, \nIndia, Japan and Brazil. If they could not or would not \nexercise such leadership on global trade, can we expect \nthem to do so on climate change? \n The emerging multipolar reality of the twenty-\nfirst century is a fact that we have to face squarely. \nInternational institutions like the United Nations can \nonly function well when we accept that reality and \nwork with it. As a small country, Singapore accepts \nthat while all countries, big or small, have a single vote \neach, we do not all carry the same weight. Small \ncountries need the United Nations and other \ninternational institutions to protect our interests, and \nwe therefore have every interest in making sure that \nthose institutions are effective. They can work well \nonly if the world\u2019s multipolar reality is taken into \naccount. The Forum of Small States, which is an \ninformal grouping of more than half the United Nations \nmembership, takes a realistic view of global politics \nbecause that is the only way to secure our own \ninterests. \n Recent developments in the Balkans and \nCaucasus do not bode well for the future. After the \ncrimes committed against the Kosovar people in the \n1990s, many countries expressed sympathy and \nsupported some form of autonomy for them. However, \nKosovo\u2019s unilateral declaration of independence in \nFebruary was greeted with a certain discomfort \nbecause of the precedent it set for other parts of the \nworld. I remember Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN) foreign ministers discussing Kosovo \nat our retreat in Singapore in February. While we \nsupported autonomy for the Kosovar people, we felt it \npremature to recognize Kosovo\u2019s independence at that \npoint in time. There was strong preference for the issue \nto be resolved by the United Nations. \n Russia\u2019s recent recognition of South Ossetia and \nAbkhazia as independent States is also unsettling. \nSome analysts see it as Russia\u2019s response to western \nsupport for Kosovo\u2019s independence. While the issue of \nKosovo and the disputes in South Ossetia and \nAbkhazia are different and should not be directly \nlinked, we do have a common concern, which is the \nrole of the United Nations in conferring legitimacy on \nnew States. If this century is to be peaceful, it is crucial \nthat all countries, big and small, abjure violence and \nadhere to the Charter of the United Nations and to the \ninternational rule of law. \n The relaxation of tensions across the Taiwan \nStraits in the past few months serves as a positive \nexample of how intractable problems from the past can \nbe creatively transcended with wisdom, goodwill and \npatience. Sometimes impatience is its own worst \nenemy. After 90 years, the collapse of the Ottoman \nEmpire has left some problems still unresolved in parts \nof its former domain. We cannot expect all the issues \nthrown up by the end of the cold war and the break-up \nof the Soviet Union to be quickly overcome. What we \nknow is that, without the United Nations setting \nacceptable norms of behaviour, there will be many \nmore problems in the world and some of the problems \n \n \n11 08-53135 \n \nwe now face will become far worse. Universally agreed \nhuman rights are important precisely because they \nunderpin those norms of good behaviour. \n However, the realpolitik of big Power rivalry \ncannot simply be wished away; indeed, it has been part \nof the human condition for most of our history. \nHowever, we can confine that rivalry and, by a \ncombination of pressures, prevent any Power from \npushing its claim excessively. International institutions \nlike the United Nations play a civilizing role in such \nefforts. International institutions cannot stop big Power \nrivalry, but they can channel it and ensure that the \ncommon interests of the human family are not \ncompletely disregarded. \n For that reason, the smaller countries have a \nstrong vested interest in seeing international \ninstitutions strengthened. The reform of the United \nNations to take into account the changes in the world \nsince the end of the Second World War is an absolute \nnecessity; so, too, is reform of the other Bretton Woods \ninstitutions. Either we reform them to forestall crises or \nwe wait for crises to force change upon us. For \nexample, if the present global economic downturn is \nthe once-in-a-century event Alan Greenspan talked \nabout, then bringing China and India into the Group of \nEight and making the International Monetary Fund and \nWorld Bank more representative of the global economy \ntoday become matters of urgency. \n We can also make international institutions more \neffective by partnership with regional institutions. \nEvery region has its own distinctive characteristics \nwhich must be taken into account. \n When Cyclone Nargis hit Myanmar in May, there \nwas for many precious days a stand-off between the \nMyanmar Government and the international community \nover the provision of assistance. Western warships \nbearing relief supplies were viewed with suspicion by a \nGovernment that saw not the supplies but a military \nthreat. It was absurd that such suspicions got in the \nway of soldiers helping cyclone victims in the \nIrrawaddy Delta. ASEAN had to step in and build a \nbridge of trust between the Myanmar Government and \nthe international community. A tripartite organization \ninvolving the United Nations, ASEAN and the \nMyanmar Government worked effectively day by day \nto overcome problems on the ground and ensure that \ninternational aid reached the furthest corners of the \naffected area. That prevented a second wave of deaths \nfrom hunger or disease. ASEAN on its own did not \nhave the capabilities to help Myanmar in a major way, \nbut ASEAN working together with the United Nations \nand other international agencies was able to make a \nhuge difference.  \n With globalization, there has been a \nmushrooming of regional institutions around the world. \nSome have come to play useful roles in fostering \nregional peace and development. The United Nations \nand other international agencies can multiply their \neffectiveness by working closely with such regional \ninstitutions. \n While international and regional institutions can \nprovide a more conducive environment, the key to a \ncountry\u2019s development is its own good governance. \nBecause every country has its own unique history, \nthere is no universal model of development applicable \nto all countries. Every country must find its own road \nto the future. \n At the closing of the Olympic Games in Beijing, \nthe President of the International Olympic Committee, \nJacques Rogge, described China\u2019s hosting of the \nGames as truly exceptional. Indeed, from beginning to \nend, the organization was superb \u2014 from the \nspectacular opening ceremony to the hospitality \nextended to individual delegations. Everyone was \nimpressed, and rightly so. That was a Chinese dream \ncome true, and the world doffed its hat to the \nachievement of the Chinese people. Thirty years ago, \nall that would have been inconceivable, even to the \nChinese themselves. What has changed? Good \ngovernance and the right policies in place have \nunleashed the natural talents of over a billion people.  \n India, with a different history and political \nsystem, is also making remarkable progress. Here \nagain, the right policies, introduced less than 20 years \nago, have made a profound difference. Indeed, across \nall of Asia, from the Bering Straits to the Gulf, an \nancient continent, encompassing more than half the \nworld\u2019s population, is stirring again. Although highly \ndiverse, the countries of Asia are being reconnected by \na new East-West trade in a new age of globalization. To \nbe sure, not all are doing well. Among those that are, \nand they are many, a recent report by the Commission \non Growth and Development, chaired by Nobel \nlaureate Michael Spence, identified effective \ngovernment as a critical factor. In a surprising \ndeparture from Western conventional wisdom, the \n  \n \n08-53135 12 \n \nreport did not see democracy as either a necessary or a \nsufficient condition, at least not in the initial phase of \neconomic take-off. \n That is an important insight which can help the \nwork of international and regional institutions in \npromoting national development. If we set as our \nobjective the promotion of democracy, the reaction \namong many countries will instinctively be negative. \nHowever, if we set as our objective the promotion of \neffective government, our task will be much easier. Let \neach country, after having achieved a certain level of \ndevelopment, then evolve the form of democracy best \nsuited to its culture and history. In a recent speech, \nPresident of the World Bank Robert Zoellick hit it on \nthe head when he emphasized that the strategic centre \nof gravity is to build legitimacy through good and \neffective governance. \n However, for development to take place, there \nmust be peace. Without continuing peace in Asia, we \nwill not be able to realize the promise of this century. \nThe thoughtful manner in which the United States is \nmanaging its strategic relationship with a rising China \nand India is of decisive importance. It is rare in history \nfor new Powers to emerge without conflict. China and \nIndia are becoming responsible stakeholders in the \nglobal system. That many of the sons and daughters of \nChinese and Indian leaders choose to study in \nAmerican universities gives us reason to be cautiously \noptimistic about the future of Asia. \n We cannot stop rivalry among the big Powers, but \nwe can limit the harm that rivalry does to smaller \ncountries. In fact, smaller countries can turn the \nemerging multipolarity to advantage if we combine our \nstrengths in regional and international institutions. \nAmong those, the most important is, of course, the \nUnited Nations. \n We still need global leadership, but it has to be by \na new concert of big Powers going beyond the United \nStates, Europe and Japan. It has to be a new kind of \nleadership exercised in a transparent manner through \nboth hard and soft power, and preferably through \nregional and international institutions. Writing about \nthe Beijing Olympics in The Wall Street Journal on \n26 August, Tony Blair said: \u201cThe truth is that nothing \nin the twenty-first century will work well without \nChina\u2019s full engagement\u201d. The same can be said of \nRussia, India and Brazil. While the United States will \nlong remain dominant, a more inclusive global \narrangement will make this a better and safer world for \nall of us.

        "file_text": "Over 60 years have passed \nsince the General Assembly voted on the historic \nresolution that would have put an end to the Arab-\nIsraeli conflict. Resolution 181 (II) called for the \nestablishment of a Jewish State and an Arab State. Its \ntitle was: \u201cPlan of Partition with Economic Union\u201d. It \nenvisioned two States for two peoples, fulfilling a \ndistinct national aspiration. The Jewish people adopted \nthe resolution and established the State of Israel. The \nArabs rejected it, and this led to war. \n What happened in the ensuing years is much \ndifferent from the resolution\u2019s original intent. While \nmuch has changed since then, the ironies of history \nsummon similar circumstances today. Today, again, we \nare in the middle of the lake. There is no sense going \nback. Continuing forward will show how near we are \nto achieving the initial goal. \n A year prior to Israel\u2019s declaration of statehood, \nits first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, called me, \na young man from a kibbutz, to serve in our national \ndefence. Since then, I have participated in Israel\u2019s \ndynamic realities: the building of security; the striving \nfor peace. So, I need no books to learn the history, \nsince I witnessed its miraculous unfolding. We went \nthrough seven wars. All have paid heavily. Tears still \nflow down the faces of bereaved mothers. \nRemembrance days fill the air with silent prayers of \nwidowed families who lost young boys and girls in \nbattle. They are, today, the same age, but lifeless.  \n Israel turned military victories into peace \nprocesses, knowing that the cost of life renders \nimperfect peace superior to perfect victories. \n We have also achieved two peace agreements: the \nfirst, with the largest Arab country, Egypt; the second, \nwith the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. All the land, \nall the water, all the natural resources that fell into our \nhands through war were completely repatriated after \npeace was signed.  \n But for peace, the call in our region is to repair \nthe damaged environment and the wounded land which \nleads to poverty. If we do not overcome the desert, the \nthirst, the pollution, they will overcome us. Joint \n \n \n33 08-51749 \n \nventures can meet this call. Nature does not carry a \nnational passport. \n With the Palestinians, we negotiate full peace. \nBoth parties agreed to building a Palestinian State side \nby side with Israel, living in peace, security and \nrespect. We tried to conclude those negotiations this \nyear. Apparently, this will take a longer time. I believe \nit can be accomplished, in spite of this, within the next \nyear. \n I know that our Prime Minister is more than \nready to conclude an agreement. And knowing \nPresident Abbas as well, I am sure he will not miss this \nopportunity. We agreed to progress in spite of possible \nchanges that may take place in the leadership. Gaps \nhave been narrowed through negotiations, particularly, \nand hopefully, the territorial ones. \n But peace is not just a matter of territorial \ncompromise. Rogue politics rejects peace even when \nand where territorial disputes have been resolved. In \nLebanon, we implemented the resolutions of the United \nNations, but Hizbullah paralysed the country and cut \nthe road to peace. \n From Gaza, we withdrew completely and \ndismantled all of our settlements. I know there are a \ngreat many complaints about the settlements: in Gaza, \nwe dismantled 30 settlements by order of the \nGovernment; Hamas responded with a bloody takeover \nand turned the Strip into a base for rocket fire. \n These militants offer no positive alternative but \nthe agonies of Job. They added kidnapping to \nbombings, bringing strife to innocent families. From \nthis rostrum, I call for the immediate release of Gilad \nShalit, the son of Aviva and Noam, a most peace-loving \nfamily. This Assembly should place the release of that \nperson at the top of its priorities. Holding a hostage in \nGaza, causes Gaza\u2019s isolation and could cause further \ndeterioration. \n At the centre of this violence and fanaticism \nstands Iran. It presents a danger to the entire world. Its \nquest for religious hegemony and regional dominance \ndivides the Middle East and holds back chances for \npeace, including among Arabs, while undermining \nhuman rights. \n Iranian support for Hizbullah divides Lebanon. \nIts support for Hamas splits the Palestinians; it \npostpones the establishment of the Palestinian State. \nYesterday, from this very rostrum, the Iranian leader \nrenewed the darkest anti-Semitic libel \u2014 the \n\u201cProtocols of the Elders of Zion\u201d \u2014 bringing to life \none of the ugliest plots against the Jewish people. Their \ndespicable denial of the Holocaust is a mockery of \nindisputable evidence and a cynical offence against the \nsurvivors of the Holocaust, contrary to the resolutions \nadopted by this very Assembly. \n Iran continues to develop enriched uranium and \nlong-range missiles. It has introduced a religion of fear, \nopposing the call of the Lord to respect human life: all \nhumans; all life. The Iranian people are not our \nenemies. Their fanatical leadership is their problem \nand the world\u2019s woe. Their leader is a danger to his \nown people, to the region and to the world. He is a \ndisgrace to the ancient Iranian people and tradition. He \nis a disgrace to the values of Islam and all religions. He \nis a disgrace to this House, the United Nations, and its \nbasic principles and values. His appearance here is a \nshame.  \n The Jewish people have known throughout \nhistory that they must stand firm and face evil. \nEnlightened humanity should make it possible for \nfreedom and respect to prevail for all of us.  \n Tehran combines long-range missiles with short-\nrange minds. It is pregnant with tragedies. The General \nAssembly and the Security Council bear the \nresponsibility to prevent agonies before they take \nplace.  \n Israel has shown that democracies can defend \nthemselves. We are able to defend ourselves. We do not \nintend to change that capacity to defend ourselves.  \n Terrorism has not solved a single problem. It \nnever has; it never will. It will make the world \nungovernable. If groups of killers are allowed to \nthreaten innocent masses, the world \u2014 if it continues \nto survive \u2014 will be without order and security, a \nhopeless battleground. The free world must unite to \nstop this, to combat it. \n Israel, for its part, shall continue to seek peace \nsincerely and fully. We suggest immediate peace with \nLebanon. Israeli Prime Ministers have indicated to \nSyria that, for peace, we are ready to explore a \ncomprehensive compromise. To gain trust and save \ntime, we have suggested a face-to-face meeting with \nPresident Assad. I say to the President: \u201cFollow the \nsuccessful example set by President Sadat and King \nHussein\u201d. We await an answer. \n  \n \n08-51749 34 \n \n I know there is a growing concern that peace is \nfar away. My lifelong experience provides me with a \ndifferent judgement. True, I have seen stagnation, \nregression and failure in our journey, but today I can \nidentify a road leading in the right direction. In \naddition to the peace agreements, a series of summits \nhave taken place: Madrid, Oslo, Wye, Camp David, \nSharm el-Sheik, Annapolis. In fact, Israelis and Arabs \nare marching towards peace. After a long internal \ndebate, Israel has chosen to support the two-State \nsolution. \n Furthermore, I must say that in Beirut, the Arab \nLeague replaced the three \u201cnays\u201d of Khartoum \u2014 \nwhich were no peace, no negotiation, no recognition \u2014 \nwith an initiative inaugurated by King Abdullah Bin \nAbdulaziz Al Saud. I call upon the King to further his \ninitiative. It may become an invitation for \ncomprehensive peace \u2014 one to transform a \nbattleground into a common ground. \n I respectfully invite all leaders to come to discuss \npeace in Jerusalem \u2014 which is holy to all of us \u2014 \nwhere all of us are praying to the same Lord as \noffspring of the same Father. Israel shall gladly accept \nan Arab invitation to designate a venue where a \nmeaningful dialogue may take place at their choice. \n We are facing a serious economic crisis in the \nworld. Perhaps it has happened because we are rich and \nlight with funds and poor and heavy with ideas, while \nwe live in an era in which science, not land, is the basis \nfor a successful economy. Science does not stop at \nborders; it is not disturbed by distances. Wisdom \ncannot be conquered by armies. Knowledge diminishes \ndiscrimination because it operates through goodwill \nand transcends race, nationality, colour and gender. \n The global dangers unite and divide us at the \nsame time. The dangers are clear: degradation of the \nenvironment, shortage of water, lack of renewable \nenergy, the spread of terrorism and, alas, increased \npoverty among millions and millions of people. The \ndivisions of the free world may increase them. Unity \nmay offer alternatives. It would direct global \ninvestments to new areas and to demanding challenges \nsuch as health, security, education and the \nenvironment. \n The future is not in the hands of oil or gold. \nIntellectual assets, new inventions and superior \neducation hold the key to the future of each of us. In \nour region, border areas could become open economic \nzones, permitting the free movement of people, \ncommodities and ideas. They could encourage tourism \nand build high-tech incubators. They could cultivate \nand advance modern agriculture. Economic zones \nwould provide a million jobs and produce billions of \ncubic metres of desalinated water for the Arabs, for the \nPalestinians, for the Jordanians, for Israel \u2014 for all of \nus. We have already started to do this; the initial steps \nare promising. \n The Jewish people are celebrating a New Year. I \nwould like to end with a quote by Rabbi Nachman of \nBreslav: \n \u201cMay it be thy will to remove war and bloodshed \nfrom the world and perpetuate the wonders and \ngreatness of peace. All the inhabitants of the \nworld shall recognize and know the truth: that we \nhave not been placed on this earth to wage war \nand not for hatred or bloodshed.\u201d \nI will repeat it in Hebrew. \n (The speaker repeated the quote in Hebrew)"

        "file_text": "I wish to \nbegin by thanking His Excellency Srgjan Kerim for his \nleadership over the past year as President of this august \nand venerable body at its sixty-second session. I also \nwish to congratulate and extend best wishes to His \nExcellency Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann of \nNicaragua on his assumption of the presidency of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-third session. \n Twenty-five years ago almost to the day, two \nCaribbean peoples who had always been separated by \nwater but had long been united by history, culture and \ncircumstance joined forces to embark upon a bold \nexperiment. Having between them a land mass of just \nover 100 square miles and a population of \napproximately 50,000, the people of Saint Kitts and the \npeople of Nevis decided to step forward as one nation \nto join the world community of sovereign States. \n It is an honour and a pleasure for me to be here to \nrepresent that nation at the United Nations, a potent \nsymbol of freedom and sovereignty. That symbolism \nmeans all the more to my people at this particular time, \nas this sixty-third session of the General Assembly \ncoincides with the celebration of my nation\u2019s twenty-\nfifth anniversary of political independence. \n Building and reinforcing the pillars of nationhood \nhas not been easy, but we have always considered it an \nessential task and a challenge worth facing. Therefore, \nas chief servant of my people and my cherished land, I \nstand before the Assembly today, emboldened by the \npride of a nation that has taken its full and rightful \nplace among the community of independent nations, a \nvibrant democracy with a thriving economy, a deep \ncommitment to justice and human rights, and an \nabiding faith in social equity. \n Mine is a pride that comes not only from \nrealizing the benefits of the practical policies and \nprogrammes created over the years to improve the \nstandard of living and uplift our people, but also from \nthe sense of community, partnership and civic and \npersonal responsibility that have shaped the destiny of \nmy proud nation. \n It is also the pride that comes from witnessing \nfirst-hand the true value of freedom \u2014 a freedom that \nhas enabled us to share in the triumphs of democracy \nand to mould the creative genius and the industrious, \nenterprising spirit of our people into a single \ncommunity of goodwill and commitment that moves \nour people and great country forward. \n It is a pride borne of weathering storms of \nexternal economic shocks, including fluctuating \ncommodity prices and the withdrawal of preferential \nmarket access, while being able to successfully \n \n \n47 08-51851 \n \ntransform three centuries of a monocultural, sugar-\nbased economy into a vibrant and competitive services-\ndriven economy. Many other small States have not \nbeen as fortunate, however. \n That is evident in our sister Caribbean nation of \nHaiti, where the devastating effects of four consecutive \nhurricanes in the space of one month continue to \nundermine the Government\u2019s effort to build strong \ninstitutions and to invest in the productive enterprises \nand infrastructure that generate employment and \nimproved living conditions. \n The progress witnessed in Saint Kitts and Nevis \nwas not achieved by chance. Since the birth of our \nnation 25 years ago, we have faced a multitude of \nproblems, some of which are fortunately behind us, but \nseveral others of which have emerged and grown in \nintensity and scope. \n However, our experience in Saint Kitts and Nevis \ndemonstrates that good governance and prudent \nmanagement of one\u2019s resources; appropriate investment \nin people and systems; the protection people\u2019s freedom \nof association, religion and speech; the support and \nfacilitation of a free and vibrant press; success at \nadvancing the socio-economic well-being of one\u2019s \npeople; and the upholding of democratic ideals are \ndetermined not by land mass, but by national character \nand political commitment. They are the result not of \ndemographics or geographic size, but of long-standing \nsociocultural traditions. They are a function not of \ngross domestic product, but of an entrenched ethos of \nstriving and determination. Our faith has steadied our \nresolve and belief in ourselves and our future. Of \ncourse, along the way, we have relied, understandably \non such institutions as our beloved United Nations. \n Through membership, Saint Kitts and Nevis has \nbuilt important and strategic partnerships, stood \nshoulder to shoulder with other Member States to \nprotect our individual rights and collective freedoms, \nand have fought battles far bigger than would be \nexpected for a country of its size. We have also been \nwitnesses to the positives and negatives, the strengths \nand failings of our world, but have soldiered on \ntogether in common cause. \n That is why, 25 years later, I remain optimistic \nabout the progress of the United Nations and its ability \nto defend the poor and needy despite the pull of \ncompeting powerful national agendas that have \noccasionally threatened to undermine the ethos of the \ninstitution and, indeed, the common good. From where \nI stand today, I have come to appreciate those \nachievements and to appreciate that, even at this \njuncture, providence affords us still new opportunities \nto renew our cherished institution. \n It is very easy to side with the cynics when the \nSecurity Council becomes frozen in stalemate or when \nthe need for action falls victim to political posturing. \nBut history, particularly that of the past two decades, \ninstructs me that the United Nations is far more than \nthe sum of its weaknesses, because for millions of \npeople around the world this Organization is their only \nhope, a bridge between life and death, a bastion of \nfreedom and a beacon of hope. \n It is my hope, therefore, that in this \u201cAssembly of \nfrankness\u201d there will be a sober and unrelenting \nanalysis of the human consequences of sweeping and \nglobally enforced trade and economic regimes on small \nStates all around the globe. And it is also my hope that \nthe economic uncertainties now being experienced in \nsome of the world\u2019s larger economies will sensitize us \nall to the breadth of the uncertainty, the depth of the \nanxiety and the real psychological trauma that often \ngrip small States when policies that are formulated far \nbeyond their shores and are utterly unresponsive to \ntheir entreaties are nonetheless thrust unflinchingly \nupon them. \n Recent events have brought into focus the issue \nof the stability of the world\u2019s financial systems and \nfinancial institutions. The circumstances that have led \nto collapsing financial institutions and rising prices for \nfood and energy were not created by small States such \nas Saint Kitts and Nevis. But yet again, as in the case \nof climate change, we are victims of the act of others, \nbut with no resources whatsoever to combat the \nconsequences. \n Earlier this year, I participated in the High-level \nConference on World Food Security, held in June in \nRome. The upbeat response from several heads of State \nor Government and from the numerous ministers of \nagriculture, forestry, fisheries, water, energy and \nenvironment who participated in that meeting was, for \nme, a strong indication of the relevance and timeliness \nof the Conference for nations seeking to take positive \naction on the issue of food security. \n The current trend continues to have a lopsided \nimpact on the poor and on the increasing numbers of \nextremely poor and vulnerable people, who are those \n  \n \n08-51851 48 \n \nleast able to counter the impact of economic \ndislocations facing our countries. Mindful of our \npersonal responsibility as leaders and of the heightened \nexpectations of our citizens, the Government of Saint \nKitts and Nevis has been taking practical measures to \nalleviate the suffering of our resilient people. We have \naddressed the important dimensions of availability and \naccess to certain food staples such as rice, flour and \nsugar. We have looked at how best to stabilize prices to \ninject predictability into the system without prejudice \nto free market economics. We have also begun to \nrationalize and promote proper utilization of \nagricultural lands through land use diversion and \ndiversification, providing financial and seedling \nsupport to farmers and recommending water \nrationalization and enhanced irrigation techniques. \n The problems to which I have alluded are not \nunique to Saint Kitts and Nevis. Members will recall \npopular riots in some countries, including in Haiti, \nwhere they led to the resignation of that country\u2019s \nGovernment. That is evidence of just how the impact \nof the rising cost of food and the despair visited upon \nwhole communities could easily undermine peoples\u2019 \nfaith in their Governments to deliver on the promises \nof democracy, free market economics and \nglobalization. \n It was in January 2008 that the food price index \nestablished by the Food and Agriculture Organization \nof the United Nations (FAO) jumped by 47 per cent \nover the previous year. This included increases for cereals \nby some 62 per cent, dairy products by 69 per cent and \nvegetable oils by 85 per cent. In some instances, prices of \nstaple foods such as maize, wheat, rice and beans have \nrisen by more than 100 per cent. This global economic \ndownturn, coupled with the dramatic upsurge in \ncommodity prices, has created the worst food crisis in \nrecent years. \n This new phenomenon will make it much more \ndifficult for us to address the growing incidence of \npoverty in and among our nations and our ability to \nachieve the Millennium Development Goal of halving \nextreme poverty and hunger throughout the world by \n2015. \n Against this backdrop, and given the need for \nurgent action, we also urge that the issue of reform, a \nrecurrent United Nations theme for some 15 years, be \nrevisited with renewed vigour and commitment. Far \ntoo much time has passed. Far too little has been done. \nAnd far too much now hangs in the balance. Let us \nequip the United Nations with the tools necessary to \nfulfil its mandates, especially in the areas of protecting \nindividual freedoms and human rights and of \npromoting economic development as an integral \nelement of human security around the world. For as \nClarence Darrow said, \u201cYou can only protect your \nliberties in the world by protecting the other man\u2019s \nfreedom. You can only be free if I am free\u201d. \n The continuous suppression of freedom \u2014 overt \nor disguised \u2014 under the cloak of civil order or \nterritorial integrity, must be tackled openly. Freedom \nand personal responsibility go hand in hand. How can \nwe encourage people to take personal responsibility but \ndeprive them of their personal freedom? That is the \nfundamental question. \n Our presence here today is both a demonstration \nand an acknowledgement of the increasingly \ninterconnected nature of our world. I wish to say that \nmuch of what Saint Kitts and Nevis has achieved over \nthe past 25 years has been the result of our people\u2019s \nhard work and discipline, combined with the benefits \nthat have accrued from both our multilateral and our \nbilateral relations. In that regard, the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme has been a vibrant partner in \nadvancing the programmatic goals of our twin-island \nfederation, as have UNESCO and other United Nations \nagencies. Our relationship with this Organization is \none that we cherish dearly.  \n We have worked with and through subregional \nentities such as the Organization of Eastern Caribbean \nStates, regional mechanisms such as the Caribbean \nCommunity and hemispheric institutions such as the \nOrganization of American States. Through regional \nmechanisms we have been able to map a course for \nfunctional cooperation on issues such as trade, security \nand health. Within the Pan-Caribbean Partnership \nagainst HIV/AIDS, we have developed a regional \nresponse to tackle the epidemic of HIV/AIDS. In the \narea of environmental protection, we continue to \ncollaborate on and to work towards disaster reduction \nand mitigation. And we are assiduously exploring \nrenewable energy sources, including geothermal \nenergy, on which we have made encouraging progress. \n On the issue of bilateral relations, I am pleased to \nsay that we have built many deeply valued \nrelationships over the years, and we continue to further \nstrengthen those relations. In the light of that, we urge \n \n \n49 08-51851 \n \nthat a way be found to facilitate the participation of the \nRepublic of China on Taiwan in the specialized \nagencies of the United Nations. As world challenges \nhave expanded, the Republic of China on Taiwan has \nstepped forward to provide technical assistance in the \nareas of social and agricultural development, as well as \ndisaster relief in many countries, thus bringing \nenormous benefits to both public and private sectors. \n Whatever the tone and tenor of the ongoing \ndebate, climate change is an aspect of our modern \nexperience. Because of our activities and our assault on \nEarth\u2019s atmosphere, many processes have negatively \nimpacted rivers, lakes and oceans, resulting in fast-\nmelting polar ice caps and rising sea levels and \nexposing us to greater risks of harmful solar radiation \nand greenhouse gas emissions. Wherever culpability \nmay reside, those processes all have serious \nimplications and consequences for small island States. \nIn varying degrees and at various levels, those changes \nimpact hundreds of thousands of small-scale farmers, \nfishermen and other people who depend heavily on the \nnatural environment for their livelihood but are already \nwitnessing lower crop yields and smaller catches. \n It is no longer sufficient simply to lay blame at \nthe feet of countries, businesses and people who \npollute. We need effective strategies based on scientific \nconsensus and, of course, solution-focused approaches \nthat address such issues as the suitability of land for \nvarious types of crops, dedicated areas for livestock, \npasture development, the marine environment, impact \non health and health care, the productivity of forests \nand the increased incidence of pests and diseases, as \nwell as implications for biodiversity and ecosystems. \nWe must collaborate in addressing those effects, and \nwe must take necessary corrective action in order to \nbuild a safer environment for ourselves and our future \ngenerations. \n Our destinies and our freedoms are all \ninterwoven. It was Franklin D. Roosevelt who said that \n\u201ctrue individual freedom cannot exist without \neconomic security and independence\u201d. As Saint Kitts \nand Nevis commemorates its silver-jubilee year of \nindependence, we therefore feel compelled to call on \nthe United Nations and the members of the Security \nCouncil to work together to put an end to the genocide \nin parts of Africa. I also call on the United Nations to \ntake firm action in the lead-up to the Follow-up \nInternational Conference on Financing for \nDevelopment so that that event will bring real relief \nand development, even to the far corners of Africa. \n For much too long we have, perhaps unwittingly, \nseparated human security from representative \ndemocracy and economic development from human \nrights. Those are inextricably linked. When we fight \nfor the freedom of our brothers to vote but ignore their \ninalienable right to food security, that is a skewed \nprinciple; it is a half-measure based on a selective \nmorality in which our fight will always be only \npartially won. \n We cannot simply tell our citizens that they are \nfree to vote, while failing to help them transform \nfreedoms into practical systems that support and \nadvance personal dreams. Democracy, I emphasize, is \nthe best vehicle through which humankind can realize \nits dreams and aspirations. I firmly believe that true \nindependence, like freedom, can come only from doing \nwhat is right. \n And so I continue to believe in the United \nNations, but beyond that, I have faith \u2014 an abiding \nfaith \u2014 in the people of Saint Kitts and Nevis, whose \nconfidence in themselves as a nation and whose \ncommitment to the future have made possible the \nsuccesses, positive growth and development that they \nhave achieved, as well as the international partnerships \nthat they have established, over the past 25 years. \n Therefore, I say to the States Members of the \nUnited Nations: Let us commit to doing the right \nthings. Let us continue the important work to reform \nand revitalize the United Nations. Let us tackle food \nsecurity by recognizing that globalization was meant to \nimprove our lives, not to worsen them. Globalization \nwas meant to facilitate the free movement of goods and \nservices, not to provide an opportunity for erecting \nartificial and unilateral barriers that punish poor and \nless competitive countries. Let us do the right thing \nabout climate change. And together, one step at a time, \nlet us do the right thing by using the Follow-up \nInternational Conference on Financing for \nDevelopment to address the fundamental development \nchallenges facing developing countries in Africa and \nthroughout the world. All that and far more is within \nthe power and the capacity of a reordered United \nNations and of Member States that are willing to take \npersonal responsibility in that regard. "

I read with keen interest \nthe United Nations news report of His Excellency\u2019s \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-third session. I note well what he said on 4 June \nthis year, following his election (see A/62/PV.99): for \n  \n \n08-52272 6 \n \nthe United Nations to be more effective, it must be \nwhat its name implies \u2014 an organization of nations \nunited, not nations dispersed or, even worse, \nsubjugated.

In this respect, please allow \nme also to extend my congratulations to the Secretary-\nGeneral on his appointment and on his keen \ncommitment to revitalizing the United Nations. \n I am humbled and privileged to stand before the \nsixty-third General Assembly to share some words and \nthoughts on behalf of the people of Vanuatu. Twenty-\nseven years ago, on 15 September 1981, Vanuatu \nbecame the 155th Member of the United Nations \nfamily. On that same day, our first and longest-serving \nPrime Minister and the founding father of our nation \u2014 \nthe late doctor, chief and priest, Father Walter Hadye \nLini \u2014 spoke to the Assembly in the name of the \npeople of Vanuatu, with pride, humility and gratitude. \nHe acknowledged the support of the United Nations \nthrough the active concern and assistance of the \nSpecial Committee of 24 on Decolonization.  \n Father Lini said that, because of that, the United \nNations has a very special place in the affections and \nesteem of the people of Vanuatu. He also expressed our \nnation\u2019s debt of gratitude to a great number of the \ncountries represented in the Assembly, which assisted \nour nation\u2019s difficult progress towards independence. \n In the same spirit I call on the United Nations to \ncontinue to pursue the interests of those countries and \npeoples that continue their struggle for freedom and to \nwin a permanent place among us. The United Nations \nis the Organization of the family of independent \nsovereign nations and peoples of the world. It must \nstand firm to promote peace, security and equality \nthroughout the world.  \n The world\u2019s majority has accepted the \nphenomenon of climate change as a reality and no \nlonger an academic theory. From Kyoto to Bali, that \nobservation has been consistently repeated. \n The increase in the occurrence of natural \ncalamities and their destructive powers are a stark \nreminder of the increasing vulnerability of today\u2019s \nglobal environment, where nature respects no \nboundaries. The severe impact of natural disasters will \nconstantly remind us of the harsh experiences and \ncritical development challenges confronting many of \nthe island countries. \n I join my colleagues from the Pacific region in \nour call to the international community for more \nconcerted action in addressing climate change as a \nsecurity issue. Unless the present trend of global \nwarming is reversed through sincere and concerted \ninternational action through the United Nations \nframework, some of our Pacific colleague nations will \nbe submerged. If such a tragedy should happen, then \nthe United Nations and its members will have failed in \ntheir first and most basic duty to a Member and its \ninnocent people, as stated in Article 1 of the Charter of \nthe United Nations. \n In 2003, Vanuatu\u2019s economic growth rebounded \nto 3.2 per cent from -2.6 per cent and -7.4 per cent in \n2001 and 2002 respectively. Continued growth was \nrecorded in 2004 and 2005, with a published growth \nrate of 5.5 per cent and 6.8 per cent respectively, \ndriven mainly by growth in the service sector and, in \nparticular, tourism. \n As members know, a dimension of the least \ndeveloped country (LDC) status is the tri-annual \nreview by the Economic and Social Council of the list \nof least developed countries with the view to \nrecommending countries for graduation out of or \ninclusion in the group of least developed countries. It \nis in that regard that I wish to bring to the attention of \nour Assembly to an area of serious concern to the \nGovernments of Vanuatu and of several other small \nisland developing States of the Pacific. \n \n \n7 08-52272 \n \n It is our view that the current graduation rule \nposes a systemic issue that could easily be resolved if \nMember States were willing to recognize its \nimportance to countries such as Vanuatu and other \nPacific nations. The decision to graduate a country \nfrom LDC status, in our view, must imply the \nrecognition of undisputed sustainable socio-economic \nprogress in the country. The criteria the United Nations \nrelies on to arrive at a decision are by and large sound \nand fair, and I will briefly recall them: first, one \nexpects the country to enjoy a higher income per \ncapita; secondly, the country\u2019s human assets or human \ncapital is expected to have made significant progress; \nand thirdly, the country ought to have achieved greater \nresilience to external shocks \u2014 in other words, to have \nbecome less vulnerable economically. \n A country is recommended for graduation if it \nmeets any two of those three criteria. In other words, \nthe graduation rule implicitly postulates that all three \ncriteria are equally important. If a country, no matter \nhow vulnerable, has risen to a level of per capita \nincome above $900, which is not difficult in a small \nState, and enjoys improved human capital, it is \nassumed that that country has become structurally \nstronger and is now ready to pursue its development \nefforts without LDC treatment. \n Vanuatu and other Pacific countries believe it is \ncritical to recognize the vulnerability criterion as the \nparamount criterion and accordingly give it \nprominence. It is indeed the only criterion that \nultimately matters to small and vulnerable States such \nas ours. \n Vanuatu and other Pacific countries are deemed \neligible for graduation on the basis of their improved \nper capita income and improved human assets. They \nremain among the most vulnerable countries in the \nworld, both economically and environmentally, and \nthat must be recognized by the United Nations. Our \ncountries may graduate from LDC status because they \nhave achieved a higher per capita income performance, \neven though the sustainability of that income is \nconstantly challenged by the high vulnerability of \nisland economies to shocks such as frequent cyclones, \nearthquakes, volcanic eruptions and sea-level rise. \n The recent hurricanes in this part of the world \nremind us of the destructive impact that such natural \nphenomena have on the development process of island \ncountries and LDCs. Members may be aware that the \n\u201cisland paradox\u201d \u2014 when relative prosperity \novershadows high vulnerability \u2014 continues to be \ndisregarded, despite the repeated call for a reform of \nthe graduation rule that would make low vulnerability \na sine qua non or compulsory criterion. \n This is not the first time that Vanuatu, in \naddressing the Assembly, has called on the United \nNations to reform the way least developed countries \nare identified. Some 11 years ago, in 1997, a former \nPrime Minister called for an urgent review of the LDC \ngraduation criteria, which brought the United Nations \nto introduce a vulnerability criterion, a fair and sound \nmove on the part of the Organization. \n I reiterate Vanuatu\u2019s plea for a reform of the \ngraduation rule and wish to point out that the reform \nwe are calling for is a mild and reasonable one, one \nthat could easily be adopted by the Economic and \nSocial Council and the General Assembly without \naltering the main components of the established \nmethodology. We believe the time has come for the \nUnited Nations to come full circle by making the same \ncriterion a superior one, so that no highly vulnerable \ncountry is forcibly reclassified and bound to lose the \nlevel of concessionary support of which it remains in \nneed. Such a reform would do justice to countries that \nhave not achieved the implied structural progress. \n We are also urging experts from the Committee \nfor Development Policy to seriously consider the merit \nof undertaking in-country visits to assess first-hand the \ndevelopment experiences of affected countries rather \nthan making conclusions on statistical indicators that \nare anomalous and theoretical. \n In 2004, the Government of Vanuatu established \nits Millennium Development Goals (MDG) National \nCommittee, which adopted a plan of action to \nimplement the MDGs. In its first report, in 2005, the \nMDG National Committee concluded that Vanuatu\u2019s \noutlook for the achievement of the MDGs or their \nrespective targets was poor to fair. That can be \nattributed to poor linkages to Government priorities \nand inadequate allocation of resources to implement \nthe plan of action.  \n Nevertheless, we are pleased to report that in \ncollaboration with the United Nations Development \nProgramme, Vanuatu is endeavouring to put in place \nmechanisms to operationalize its sector strategies by \nidentifying key issues and the  required interventions to \naddress them, and defining the coverage of \n  \n \n08-52272 8 \n \ninterventions and their costing. We believe that, if we \nsucceed in doing that, we will be able to accelerate \nprogress on the MDGs and that, come 2015, Vanuatu \nwill be able to provide a more positive report to the \nAssembly. \n At the Millennium Summit, the then Prime \nMinister of Vanuatu, The Honourable Barak Sope \nMaautamate, called on the United Nations to review \nthe legality of the United Nations action in 1962 to \nendorse the New York Agreement to administer the  \nso-called Act of Free Choice over West Papua. \n The Charter of the United Nations espouses the \nprinciples that continue to guide the Organization\u2019s \nefforts in the process of self-determination. That \nmanifestation calls for recognition and respect for the \nfundamental and inalienable rights of peoples and \nterritories still under colonial rule to determine their \nfuture. We cannot champion democracy if the United \nNations continues to hang this blanket of silence over \nthe case of West Papua, in which the United Nations \nitself takes part. \n An issue of extreme national importance is the \nquestion of submissions to the United Nations on the \nextension of continental shelves. As with some other \nsmaller nations, technical capacity constraints and \nfinancial resources have inhibited our progress on \nsubmissions, and therefore we are requesting that the \nUnited Nations consider extending the deadline for \nsubmissions to enable countries like Vanuatu to \nparticipate fully in the process. We call for the \nunderstanding of our development partners and urge \nthem to consider providing funding for that important \nexercise. \n A side issue to the question of the extension of \ncontinental shelves in relation to Vanuatu is that there \nis a dispute between Vanuatu and the French Republic, \nthe former colonial authority, concerning our \ncontinental shelves to the south of the nation.  \n On the question of reforms at the United Nations, \nwe believe that, in order to make the Organization truly \ndemocratic, reforms are essential to make the Security \nCouncil more representative of the membership as a \nwhole. In that respect, we believe that Japan and India \ndeserve permanent membership. \n At this critical moment of global crisis, I recall \nthe aphorism underpinning the foundations of the \nUnited Nations. It is taken from the book of the great \nprophet Micah and is engraved on the walls of United \nNations Headquarters: \n  \u201cThey shall beat their swords into \nploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks. \nNation shall not lift up sword against nation, \nneither shall they learn war any more\u201d (The Holy \nBible, Micah, 4:3). \n It is no coincidence that the theme for this \nAssembly is a much clearer manifestation of those \nprophetic words, which the United Nations has \nneglected over the years. As one of the smallest \nMembers of the United Nations family of nations, \nVanuatu reaffirms its commitment to building global \npeace and security. We also remain committed to \nsupporting United Nations peacekeeping missions as \nour modest contribution to that worthy cause. \n Finally, we welcome 2009 as the International \nYear of Reconciliation. We all hope and pray that it \nwill be a time for real compromises and political \ngoodwill. We encourage all members of our family of \nnations to approach 2009 with open hearts. If we are to \nturn the tide of tension and animosity, we must have \nthe courage to reconcile our differences and come \ntogether in those dimensions that will enhance this \nnoble Organization\u2019s role in peacebuilding and \ndevelopment. \n In closing, I would like to express the \nGovernment of Vanuatu\u2019s gratitude to all our \ndevelopment partners who have generously contributed \nto Vanuatu\u2019s development efforts. In particular, we \nwish to thank Australia, China, the European Union, \nNew Zealand, Japan, the United States of America and \nFrance. We would also like to acknowledge the support \nof other partners, including India, Turkey, South Korea, \nMalaysia, Indonesia and Canada, as well as such \nmultilateral institutions as the World Bank and the \nAsian Development Bank, and other United Nations \nagencies. \n Mr. Baugh (Jamaica), Vice-President, took the \nChair. \n We are living in perilous times. In our Father\u2019s \nhands were we created, and to the hands of the leaders \nof the world He has entrusted the responsibility to \nensure a world safe and just for all His peoples and \nchildren. The world\u2019s destiny is in our hands. That \nmust be our inspiration. \n \n \n9 08-52272 \n \n May God bless the United Nations. May God \nbless the sixty-third session of the General Assembly. \nMay God bless us all. "

        "file_text": "I \nhave the honour to speak on behalf of the President of \nthe Swiss Confederation, Mr. Pascal Couchepin, who \nhad to cancel his trip to New York at the very last \nminute. \n Since its foundation, the United Nations has \nembodied the hope of all people to live in peace, \nfreedom and dignity. As Members of the United \nNations and as representatives of our peoples, we are \nunder an obligation not to disappoint those hopes. \nThree years ago in this Hall, we decided in the 2005 \nWorld Summit Outcome to ensure that human beings \nwould live in freedom and dignity, free from poverty \nand despair. We ought now to ask ourselves the \nfollowing questions: Have we kept that promise? Have \nthe expectations been fulfilled? Have we done enough \nto bring about peace and security, development and the \nrealization of human rights? \n According to a recent World Bank report, the \nnumber of people living in poverty has fallen by 500 \nmillion since 1981. Their proportion of the total \npopulation has fallen from 52 to 26 per cent. \nNevertheless, 1.2 billion people still have to get by on \nless than a dollar a day. Twenty-five thousand people a \nday are dying as a result of starvation and poverty. \nThere are still 67 million refugees and internally \ndisplaced persons on the planet. No State, however \nwealthy or powerful, can tackle all these challenges \nalone. Common solutions are required. A strong United \nNations is needed, a United Nations that focuses on \nthat which unites rather than on that which divides. \n Cooperation across cultural and religious borders \nis not always easy. Swiss history has shown that this \ntype of cooperation is most likely to bear fruit when \nspecific problems are tackled and solutions are sought \nthrough open dialogue. This approach is reflected in \nSwiss peace policy. We support projects the purpose of \nwhich is to bring together people with different values \nand cultural backgrounds to enable them to coexist in a \npositive way. This approach also characterizes our \nactivity in the United Nations-sponsored Alliance of \nCivilizations. \n Although dialogue is necessary, it is nevertheless \nonly one of the means of promoting the fundamental \nvalues to which we are all devoted. I am thinking first \nand foremost of human rights, access to a decent \nstandard of living and personal development for \neveryone. \n In this context, Switzerland is participating \nactively in the work of the Human Rights Council. Let \nus recall that the usefulness of the Council will \nultimately be judged by the specific contribution that it \nmakes to the protection of human rights on the ground. \n \n \n33 08-53141 \n \nThe Universal Periodic Review and its special \nprocedures provide the Council with two effective \ntools, and those tools must be used. Switzerland will \ncontinue to advocate in favour of a constructive and \ncritical Universal Periodic Review, the independence \nof special procedures and the autonomy of the Office \nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Human \nRights. \n Next year, the Review Conference on the \nimplementation of the Durban Declaration and \nProgramme of Action will take place at Durban. For \nSwitzerland, the fight against racism is a priority. That \nis why my country will play its part in this process. \nHowever, we expect the preparatory phase to be \ncharacterized by a constructive spirit that helps us \nachieve a balanced outcome. In particular, the Review \nConference should confine itself to the evaluation of \nthe implementation of the Durban Declaration and \nProgramme of Action. It should not call into question \nthe normative advances set out in the International \nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial \nDiscrimination. And finally, it should deal with \ndifferent subjects relating to racism in a balanced \nmanner, without becoming a platform that focuses on a \nparticular situation. \n Last week, the Assembly also discussed the \nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals. \nWe all know that the implementation of the Goals is \nslow and arduous. Collectively, we could have done \nmore. We should have done more, and Switzerland is \nno exception. But we are trying to assign our limited \nresources to actions that meet the needs of recipients, \nthat make a difference to the poorest, that help people \nto help themselves and that complement, but do not \nreplace, the efforts of recipient countries. \n Development assistance should be characterized \nby lasting effectiveness and coherence. The Follow-Up \nInternational Conference on Financing for \nDevelopment, to be held in Doha, will give us an \nopportunity to renew and to deepen this alliance \nbetween developing and industrialized countries. \n Progress towards the achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals requires that the \nworld\u2019s poorest be better protected legally. Only if they \ncan defend themselves against injustice and have equal \naccess to justice, property, work and markets will \ndevelopment ultimately be possible. The Commission \non Legal Empowerment of the Poor presented its report \na few months ago. It deserves careful study and follow-\nup by the Assembly. \n The food crisis has undoubtedly made achieving \nthe Millennium Development Goals more difficult. \nLike some other countries, Switzerland has responded \nto the crisis by increasing its contribution to the World \nFood Programme. But the causes of food price rises \nalso need to be addressed. The causes are diverse and \nrange from changing eating habits to increased \ncultivation of agrofuel crops and neglect of agricultural \nproduction. Measures to resolve this crisis will have to \nbe both numerous and varied. In this regard, we \nwelcome the efforts made by the High-Level Task \nForce on the Global Food Security Crisis in providing \na coherent and efficient response. \n However, there is also a positive side to this \ncrisis. Rising food prices may also represent an \nopportunity for farmers in developing countries. But \nfor farmers to benefit from the rise in food prices they \nneed access to land and property, financing and seed. \nLikewise, they need international rules against the \nflooding of their sales markets by subsidized \nagricultural products, as well as better access to the \nmarkets of industrialized countries. \n A positive conclusion of the World Trade \nOrganization (WTO) discussions could have been a \npositive sign of movement in this direction. \nSwitzerland therefore regrets that it was not possible to \nreach agreement at the Ministerial Meeting held in \nGeneva in July. The challenge now is to ensure that the \nprogress already made is not jeopardized and that \nconfidence among WTO member States is restored, so \nthat the Doha Round can be brought to a successful \nconclusion. \n Climate change is another major source of \nconcern. We in Switzerland are particularly aware of \nthis fact because our alpine glaciers are rapidly melting \naway. In other parts of the world, this phenomenon \ntakes the form of changing precipitation patterns, \ndroughts and floods. The reports of the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \nclearly show that all these disasters have a point in \ncommon: they are the result of climate change and are \ncaused by human beings, and particularly by the \nconsumption of fossil fuels. \n The time for never-ending talks has passed. \nSwitzerland will achieve its emissions reduction goals \nfor 2012. For the years after 2012, we need a new, \n  \n \n08-53141 34 \n \nambitious and internationally accepted climate regime. \nSuch a regime should be based on the principle of \ncommon but differentiated responsibilities. Switzerland \nhas put forward a proposal for a global carbon dioxide \ntax which meets that criterion and would ensure the \nfinancing of the necessary adaptation measures. I \nwould like to invite the Assembly to carefully study \nthis proposal in the framework of the ongoing climate \ndiscussions. \n The efforts of the industrialized countries alone \nwill not be enough, however, to solve the problem of \nglobal warming. Each country will, according to its \nown capacities, have to contribute to the reduction of \nCO2 emissions. In so doing, we are united by a \ncommon concern: that of shouldering our responsibility \nto future generations. \n Today, many countries are still in situations of \narmed conflict. In many cases, respect for international \nhumanitarian law has declined. That is why \nSwitzerland calls again on all conflicting parties to \ncomply with the provisions of international \nhumanitarian law and to guarantee humanitarian \norganizations swift and unhindered access to the \nvictims of conflicts. \n Conflict prevention is one of the central tasks of \nthe United Nations. Switzerland is particularly active \non two levels. First, we wish to pay closer attention to \nthe connection between armed violence and \ndevelopment. Together with other partners, we intend \nto submit a draft resolution on this subject during this \nsession of the General Assembly. Secondly, we \nstrongly advocate the strengthening of the Secretariat\u2019s \nmediation capacities. The mediation efforts in Kenya, \nfor instance, have demonstrated that this form of \nconflict prevention can work. \n That brings me to the subjects of the \nresponsibility to protect and of prevention of genocide. \nSwitzerland welcomes the fact that these subjects have \nbeen institutionally anchored more firmly within the \nUnited Nations. \n The concept of the responsibility to protect was \nrecognized in September 2005 in the framework of the \nWorld Summit. It is obvious that the operational \nimplementation of the concept can only be realized \nprogressively. Nevertheless, Switzerland will commit \nto ensuring that the concept is not partially assimilated \ninto that of humanitarian intervention, thereby calling \ninto question the consensus achieved in 2005. \n Justice is necessary for building lasting peace. In \nother words, peace and impunity are incompatible in \nthe long term. The arrest and extradition of Charles \nTaylor and Radovan Karadzic to The Hague have once \nagain confirmed the importance of international \ncriminal justice. Alleged war criminals must not be \nallowed to live in serenity. They must answer for their \nacts in a fair trial. That is the preventive effect of the \ninternational criminal justice system, and it should not \nbe underestimated. Switzerland therefore supports the \nwork of the International Criminal Court and advocates \nits independence. \n At the beginning of my speech, I stressed the \ngreat importance of the United Nations. The world is \nchanging, however, and international relations are \nconstantly developing. The United Nations will also \nhave to change. Those who focus only on the past will \nno doubt miss the future. \n There is a need for reform in all United Nations \nbodies, but particularly in the Security Council. Given \nthe power that it exerts, the expectations of the \nSecurity Council are very high. If its decisions are to \nbe accepted and supported by the entire international \ncommunity, the Council will need to adapt to the \nrealities of the twenty-first century, namely, the new \nbalances that characterize our world at the political, \neconomic and demographic levels. \n Moreover, it is important that the views of \nimportant actors that are not members of the Council \nshould be better taken into account in decision-making. \nSwitzerland has for some time advocated an \nimprovement of the Council\u2019s working methods and \nwill continue to work for greater participation and \ntransparency. \n Peace is not a given. It is an ideal that has to be \npursued every day. The United Nations is the \npredestined venue for achieving that goal. We are \nwilling, within our capacities, to make our contribution \nto that pressing collective task. "

        "file_text": "Mr. President, on behalf of Cuba, I would \nlike to congratulate you on your election as President \nof the General Assembly. \n We are living at a decisive moment in the history \nof humankind. The threats looming over the world put \nthe very existence of the human species at risk. \n The promotion of peace, solidarity, social justice \nand sustainable development is the only way to ensure \nthe future. The prevailing world order, unjust and \nunsustainable, must be replaced by a new system that \nis truly democratic and equitable, based on respect for \ninternational law and on the principles of solidarity and \njustice, putting an end to the inequalities and exclusion \nto which the great majorities of the population of our \nplanet have been condemned. \n There are no alternatives. Those responsible for \nthis state of affairs \u2014 the industrialized countries, and \nin particular the lone super-Power \u2014 must shoulder \ntheir responsibilities. Fabulous fortunes cannot \ncontinue to be wasted while millions of human beings \nare starving or dying of curable diseases. It is not \npossible to continue to pollute the air and poison the \noceans, which is destroying the living conditions for \nfuture generations. Neither the peoples nor the planet \nitself will permit that without great social upheavals \nand extremely grave natural disasters. \n Wars of conquest, aggression against and the \nillegal occupation of countries, military intervention \nand the bombing of innocent civilians, the unbridled \narms race, the pillaging and usurpation of the natural \nresources of the Third World and the imperial offensive \nto crush the resistance of peoples who are defending \ntheir rights constitute the greatest and most serious \nthreats to international peace and security. \n Concepts such as the limitation of sovereignty, \npre-emptive war and regime change are expressions of \nthe desire to mutilate the independence of our \ncountries. The so-called war on terrorism and the \nalleged promotion of freedoms serve as pretexts for \naggression, military occupation, torture, arbitrary \ndetention, the denial of the right of peoples to self-\ndetermination, unjust blockades, unilaterally imposed \nsanctions and the imposition of political, economic and \nsocial models that facilitate imperial domination with \nflagrant disdain for history, cultures and the sovereign \nwill of peoples. \n The gap between the rich and the poor widens \ndaily. The very modest Millennium Development Goals \nare an unattainable dream for the vast majority. While \n$1 trillion is spent on weapons worldwide, more than \n850 million human beings are starving, 1.1 billion have \nno access to drinking water, 2.6 billion lack sewage \nservices and more than 800 million are illiterate. More \nthan 640 million children lack adequate housing, \n115 million do not attend primary school and \n10 million die before reaching the age of 5, in most \ncases as the result of diseases that can be cured.  \n With increasing frequency, the populations of the \nSouth are suffering from natural disasters, whose \nconsequences have been worsened by climate change. \nHaiti, Jamaica, Cuba and other countries of the \nCaribbean are examples. We issue a special call for \nsolidarity with the brotherly people of Haiti in their \ntragic situation. \n The rise in oil prices is the result of irrational \nconsumption, heavy speculative activity and imperial \nmilitary adventures. The desperate search for new \nsources of energy has propelled the criminal strategy \ndriven by the Government of the United States to \ntransform grains and cereals into fuel. \n For many of the countries of the Non-Aligned \nMovement, the situation is becoming unsustainable. \nOur nations have suffered and will have to continue to \nsuffer the consequences of the irrationality, \nwastefulness and speculation of a few countries in the \nindustrialized North, which are responsible for the \nworld food crisis. They imposed trade liberalization \nand financial prescriptions of structural adjustment on \nthe developing countries. They caused the ruin of many \nsmall producers; they denied \u2014 and in some cases \ndestroyed \u2014 nascent agricultural development in the \ncountries of the South, turning them into net importers \nof food.  \n It is they who continue scandalous agricultural \nsubsidies while imposing their rules on international \ntrade. They set prices, monopolize technologies, \nimpose unjust certifications and manipulate \ndistribution channels, financing sources and trade. \nThey control transport, scientific research, gene pools \nand the production of fertilizers and pesticides. \n  \n \n08-51749 38 \n \n We have not come here to complain. We have \ncome, on behalf of the Movement of Non-Aligned \nCountries, to support and defend the demands of \nbillions of human beings who are calling for justice \nand respect for their rights. The formula is not difficult; \nnor does it require great sacrifices. All that is needed is \nthe necessary political will, less selfishness and the \nobjective understanding that, if we do not act today, the \nconsequences could be apocalyptic and would also \naffect the rich and powerful. That is why Cuba, on \nbehalf of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, \ncalls once again on the Governments of developed \ncountries to honour their commitments. In particular, \nwe urge them to do the following.  \n They should put an end to the wars of occupation \nand to the plundering of the resources of the countries \nof the Third World, and should free up at least a part of \ntheir millions in military spending so that those \nresources can be allocated to international assistance \nfor the benefit of sustainable development. \n We urge them to cancel the foreign debt of \ndeveloping countries, which has already been paid \nmore than once. That would release additional \nresources that could be devoted to economic \ndevelopment and social programmes. \n They should honour the commitment to allocate \nat least 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product to \nofficial development assistance without conditions, so \nthat the countries of the South could use those \nresources for their national priorities. They should also \npromote access on the part of poor countries to \nsubstantial new financing. \n They are urged to devote one fourth of the money \nthat is wasted each year on commercial advertising to \nfood production, which would provide nearly \n$250 billion more to fight hunger and malnutrition. \n They should allocate the money being used for \nagricultural subsidies in the North to agricultural \ndevelopment in the South. Thus, our countries would \nhave approximately $1 billion per day at their disposal \nto invest in food production. \n We urge them to comply with the commitments \nset out in the Kyoto Protocol and to establish more \nambitious emission-reduction targets beginning in \n2012, without seeking to increase restrictions on \ncountries that, even now, maintain far lower per capita \nemission levels than those of the countries of the \nNorth.  \n They should promote access by Third World \ncountries to technology and should support the training \nof their human resources. Today, on the other hand, \nqualified personnel from the South are subjected to \nunfair competition and incentives resulting from \ndiscriminatory and selective migration policies \nimplemented by the United States and Europe. \n Something that is today more urgent than ever is \nthe establishment of a democratic and equitable \ninternational order and a fair and transparent trading \nsystem in which all States can participate, in \nsovereignty, in the decisions that affect them. \n It is our deepest belief that solidarity between \npeoples and Governments is possible. In Latin America \nand the Caribbean, the Bolivarian Alternative for the \nAmericas and Petrocaribe have demonstrated this. \n The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries has \nremained faithful to its founding principles. We support \nthe cause of the Palestinian people and their inalienable \nright to self-determination in an independent and \nsovereign State, with its capital in East Jerusalem. We \nsupport the cause of those other peoples whose \nsovereignty and territorial integrity is being threatened, \nlike those of Venezuela and Bolivia, and we endorse \nthe right of Puerto Rico to be independent. \n We condemn the imposition of unilateral coercive \nmeasures in violation of international law and attempts \nto implant a single model for a political, economic and \nsocial system. We object to the negative practice of \ncertifying countries that follows the patterns and \ninterests of the powerful. We strongly oppose political \nmanipulation and the application of double standards in \nthe matter of human rights, and we reject the selective \nimposition of politically motivated resolutions against \nthe member countries of the Non-Aligned Movement. \n The establishment of the Human Rights Council \noffers the opportunity to open a new era in the \npromotion of and protection for all human rights for \nall, on the basis of international cooperation and \nconstructive dialogue. Those who caused the demise of \nthe old Human Rights Commission are now trying to \ndisqualify the Council because they have not been able \nto bend it to serve their own interests. They refuse to \nparticipate in its work in order to escape the scrutiny of \nthe international community within the framework of \n \n \n39 08-51749 \n \nthe Universal Periodic Review mechanism. The \nlegitimacy of the Council does not depend on the \nperception that the empire has about its work, but on \nits capacity to discharge its mandate with the strictest \nadherence to the principles of universality, objectivity, \nimpartiality and non-selectivity in the treatment of \nhuman rights issues. \n The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries will \ncontinue to defend the interests of the Third World and \npromote the building of a world which is more just, \nmore democratic and with greater solidarity.  \n Cuba has had to pay a very high price for the \ndefence of its independence and sovereignty. The \nheroic Cuban people have endured the longest and \ncruellest blockade in history, imposed by the most \npowerful nation on Earth. Despite the fact that this \nAssembly has repeatedly and resoundingly taken a \nstand in favour of ending that genocidal policy, the \nUnited States Government has not only ignored the \nwill of the international community, but in marked \ndisregard of it has gradually intensified its economic \nwar against Cuba. Never has the foreign policy against \na country been armed with such a broad and \nsophisticated arsenal of aggressive measures in the \npolitical, economic, cultural, diplomatic, military, \npsychological and ideological domains. \n Cuba has just been lashed by two intense \nhurricanes, which have devastated its agriculture, \nseriously affected part of its infrastructure and \ndamaged or destroyed more than 400,000 homes. \nAllow me to take advantage of this opportunity, on \nbehalf of the Cuban Government and people, to thank \nall those countries, organizations and persons who in \none way or another have honestly and sincerely \ncontributed with resources or moral support to the \nreconstruction efforts undertaken by my country. That \nstands in contrast with the position of the United States \nGovernment, which continues to ruthlessly apply the \nblockade. \n Cuba has asked for no gifts from the United \nStates Government. It has simply asked and asked \nagain that it be allowed to purchase in the United \nStates the materials that are indispensable for the \nreconstruction of homes and the power grid, and that \nAmerican companies be authorized to grant Cuba \nprivate commercial credits to buy food. The answer has \nbeen negative and has been accompanied by an attempt \nto manipulate information in such a manner that the \nGovernment of the United States seems to be \nconcerned for the well-being of the Cuban people \nwhile the Government of Cuba is perceived as turning \ndown their offer. \n If the United States were really so concerned for \nthe Cuban people, the only moral and ethical behaviour \nwould be to lift the blockade imposed on Cuba for five \ndecades, in violation of the most elemental rules of \ninternational law and the Charter of the United \nNations. That irrational policy has a clear objective: to \ndestroy the process of profound revolutionary \ntransformation undertaken by the Cuban people since \n1959 \u2014 in other words, to trample on its right to self-\ndetermination, wrest away its freedom and its political, \neconomic and social conquests and push it backwards \nto its former neocolonial status.  \n The Bush Administration attempts to justify the \nintensification of its policy against Cuba by turning \nonce more to fraud and deceit, with its characteristic \ncynicism and hypocrisy. Its determination to dominate \nand recolonize Cuba is being presented as nothing less \nthan as an endeavour to liberate and democratize. \n Who, other than its accomplices, recognizes that \nthe United States Government has any authority in this \nworld in the matter of democracy and human rights? \nWhat authority could such a Government claim that \nhunts down and cruelly mistreats illegal migrants at its \nsouthern border, that legalizes the use of torture and \nkeeps in concentration camps \u2014 such as the one \ninstalled in the territory illegally occupied by the \nUnited States base at Guant\u00e1namo \u2014 people who have \nnot been proved of or even charged with any crime? \nWhat respect is due to a Government that attacks the \nsovereignty of other States, using the excuse of the \nfight against terrorism, while at the same time \nguaranteeing impunity to anti-Cuban terrorists? What \nkind of justice can be promoted by an Administration \nthat illegally keeps imprisoned five Cuban patriots who \nwere only seeking information to neutralize the actions \nof the terrorist groups operating against Cuba from the \nUnited States? \n Cuba appreciates the solidarity it has received \nfrom the General Assembly in its fight against the \nblockade and the aggression that it has had to confront \nfor almost five decades. Cuba reaffirms its unyielding \ndecision to defend its sovereignty and independence. \nCuba reiterates its will to carry on, together with \nmembers of the Non-Aligned Movement, in the battle \n  \n \n08-51749 40 \n \nfor a better world, where the rights of all peoples to \njustice and development are respected. \n To conclude, I would like to recall the words of \nthe Commander-in-Chief of the Cuban Revolution, \nComrade Fidel Castro Ruz: \u201cA world without hunger is \npossible. ... A just world is possible. A new world, \nwhich our species eminently deserves, is possible and \nwill become reality.\u201d "

        "file_text": "I wish to take this \nopportunity to warmly congratulate Mr. Miguel \nd\u2019Escoto Brockmann on his election as President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-third session. He has the \nfull support of my delegation, and I wish him every \nsuccess as he guides the important deliberations of the \nsession at this most critical time. I also wish to take \nthis opportunity to express my delegation\u2019s \nappreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, who \nsuccessfully presided over the General Assembly at its \nsixty-second session. \n These are turbulent times indeed. The world \ntoday is not getting safer by any standard. Alas, there \nseems to be a vortex of perennial conflicts and crises. \nThe fires in Afghanistan and Iraq have not been \nextinguished; to the contrary, they continue to \nsmoulder and intensify, punctuated by misleading, \nshort-lived lulls. The intractable conflict situations in \nthe Middle East are not nearer to a solution today. In \nSomalia, humanitarian suffering of unparalleled \nmagnitude continues to unfold, although it remains \nlargely ignored by the international media. \nFurthermore, the war in Georgia, with its potential \nfallout for global polarization is symptomatic of, and \nunderscores, the extremely fragile security \nenvironment that prevails in our troubled world today. \n To add to that gloomy mix, the world is also \nwitnessing volatile and speculative fluctuations in the \nprice of fuel oil, an unprecedented hike in food prices \nand a recent spate of insolvency of financial \ncorporations that in combination are driving the global \neconomy towards recession. Rapid climatic changes \nresulting from progressive environmental degradation \nand the resulting spell of more frequent floods and \ndroughts, as well as pandemics that are affecting \nmillions of people, complete the grid of the immense \nchallenges that our global community is facing today. \nThese multifaceted problems stem from multiple \ncauses.  \n At the same time, it cannot be denied that many \nof those problems have been exacerbated, if not \ninstigated, by the misguided and domineering policies \nof the United States Government. Indeed, the \nfingerprints of the sole super-Power are discernible in \nmost of the conflict situations that are raging in many \nparts of our globe, with the deleterious economic, \nfinancial and humanitarian ramifications that they \ninvariably entail. \n The perplexing feature of that overarching and \nnegative development is the emergence of the concept \nof management by crisis as a new tool of policy \npromotion. These days, candid efforts are not exerted \nto prevent and manage conflicts. On the contrary, \ncrises are deliberately spawned and allowed to fester \nand the resulting necessity for management then \nprovides the United States with opportunity and \nlatitude for control, in a situation of permanent \ninstability. The absence of countervailing forces in a \nunipolar world has only aggravated the situation. \nPrincipal among those is the weakness of the United \nNations in pursuing an independent line and acting as a \nbulwark of robust multilateralism. \n The strong misgivings that I have expressed are \nattested to by the multiple situations of turbulence that \ncontinue to unfold in our part of the world. Allow me \nto illustrate this grim reality through a brief description \nof the causes and complications of such turbulence. \n In the border war between Eritrea and Ethiopia, \nboth parties had ultimately agreed to resolve the \ndispute through binding arbitration on the legal basis of \nthe sanctity of the colonial boundaries. These are \ncardinal principles of international law enshrined in the \nUnited Nations Charter as well as in the Constitutive \nAct of the African Union. Furthermore, these \ncommitments were solemnly enshrined in the Algiers \nPeace Agreement that was signed by the parties in \nDecember 2000. The Algiers Agreement was \ncomprehensive in its details. Essentially, it had two \ncomponents: first, confidence-building provisions and \n \n \n15 08-53141 \n \nmeasures through the deployment of a modest United \nNations peacekeeping force; and secondly, settlement \nof the border dispute through final and binding \narbitration on the basis of the colonial treaties and \ninternational law. \n As members know, the parties went through \nlengthy and meticulous legal litigation in The Hague in \n2001. The Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission \u2014 a \nfive-member arbitration panel of international \njurists \u2014 announced its unanimous final and binding \ndecision on 13 April 2002 and made serious efforts for \nfive years, until the completion of its work in \nNovember 2007. From November 2007 onwards in \nparticular, Ethiopia\u2019s military presence on sovereign \nEritrean territories has been one of blatant occupation. \nThis is so because the Boundary Commission has \ndecided to complete its demarcation functions \u2014 \nwhich were disrupted and held hostage by Ethiopia for \nfive long years \u2014 through precise representation of the \nboundary by coordinates. \n Throughout these years, Ethiopia\u2019s reckless acts \nof destabilization and aggression were supported by the \nUnited States, and they continue to be. Throughout \nthese years, the United States not only used its \nformidable clout in the United Nations system to \nforestall appropriate measures against Ethiopia \npursuant to the Algiers Agreement and that were based \non Chapter VII of the Charter, but it concocted various \nformulas \u2014 special envoys and extensions of the \nmandate of the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and \nEritrea (UNMEE), among other things \u2014 of \n\u201cmanagement by crisis\u201d, to perpetuate the conflict and \nderail enforcement of the Commission\u2019s legal decision. \n The tragedy in Somalia is another extremely \ngrave humanitarian situation that has been exacerbated, \nif not brought about, essentially because of wrong \nUnited States policies. Half a million Somalis are today \ndisplaced and living in abysmal conditions mainly as a \nresult of Ethiopia\u2019s military invasion in 2007. \nThousands of innocent civilians have been killed. \nUnited States warplanes occasionally pulverize Somali \nvillages in the name of the war on terrorism.  \n Were these interventions legal or justified? The \nportrayal of Somalia and the Union of Islamic Courts \n(UIC) as the epicentre or hub of terrorism was neither \ntrue nor candid. Somalis should and could have been \ngiven a chance to sort out their own problems through \nthe reconciliation processes that they had begun in \nearnest. But all of those efforts were nipped in the bud \nthrough a pre-emptive invasion by Ethiopia at the \ninstigation of the United States that resulted in massive \nhumanitarian tragedy that dwarfs other contemporary \ncrises in Africa. \n Nor is the situation in the Sudan any different, \neither. While the complexities of the long and varied \nconflicts cannot be downplayed, the fact remains that \nUnited States policy in the Sudan is driven by other \nobjectives and considerations. The net outcome has \nbeen and remains an aggravation of the multiple \nproblems there, whether in relation to the \nimplementation of the Comprehensive Peace \nAgreement between the North and South or with \nrespect to the situation in Darfur. \n Recently, the United States, which has a military \nbase in Djibouti, has fabricated a new conflict situation \nbetween Djibouti and Eritrea to keep alive the hot spots \nof tension in the region. As I explained earlier, due to \nUnited States influence, the Security Council has been \nparalysed and rendered impotent in the face of \nEthiopia\u2019s occupation of sovereign Eritrean territories, \nincluding the town of Badme. At the same time, the \nUnited States doggedly tried to use the Security \nCouncil platform during its presidency last June to \nfabricate a non-existent problem and establish a case \nagainst Eritrea. \n All those destabilizing acts are sometimes \nportrayed as unavoidable consequences or collateral \ndamage of the war on terror. The fact is that the war on \nterror was derailed long ago from its original \nobjectives and intentions in order to undermine and \nsubvert forces and Governments that do not toe \nWashington\u2019s line. Furthermore, the dragnet has been \nwidely extended to involve the transparent interference \nof the United States in the subregional and regional \norganizations in our part of the world. \n This untenable state of affairs cannot go on and \nshould not be tolerated. The human sufferings have \nbeen and are too great, the time too long. Therefore, \nthe collective international efforts to check United \nStates excesses are timely and imperative \u2014 all the \nmore so because those failures are widely recognized \nand acknowledged by significant segments of public \nopinion in the United States itself. \n The perils of unchecked unipolarism have \nbecome glaringly obvious in the past few years. That \nreality can only accentuate the need to bolster the \n  \n \n08-53141 16 \n \nUnited Nations to make it a democratic and robust \ninstitution of multilateralism through prolonged and \nconcerted collective efforts. \n The need for prompt action requires great \nurgency, particularly in our region. For that to happen, \nfirst of all, illegal occupation of sovereign territories \nmust be terminated and the rule of law and the Charter \nof the United Nations fully respected. Secondly, the \ninvasion of Somalia must come to an end and the \nperpetrators of war crimes must be held accountable. \nThirdly, the interferences in and complications of the \nproblems in the Sudan must cease, and a conducive \nclimate must be created to bring about a lasting \nsolution. Lastly and most importantly, United States \nmeddling in the affairs of the Horn of Africa region, \nwhich has invariably led to the instigation of crises, \nmust be terminated. \n The consequences of failing to act are dire \nindeed. Unless effective measures are taken to remedy \nthe multiplying problems that our global community is \nconfronting today, we run the risk of further widening \nand exacerbating them. The situation in the Horn of \nAfrica may in fact spiral out of control unless those \ndestabilizing practices are brought to an end. \n In conclusion, I sincerely hope that our plea will \nbe heeded so that further turmoil and suffering in our \nregion may be avoided.

        "file_text": "At the outset, I wish to \nwarmly congratulate His Excellency Mr. Miguel \nd\u2019Escoto Brockmann of the Republic of Nicaragua on \nhis election as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-third session. I can assure him of our fullest \ncooperation throughout his tenure. I have no doubt that, \nunder his able leadership, we will be successful during this \nsession. I also wish to extend my high appreciation to \nMr. Srgjan Kerim of the former Yugoslav Republic of \nMacedonia, President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-second session, for his relentless efforts in \nguiding us to the many outstanding achievements \nduring the past year. \n At present, we have a number of global issues \nand challenges that we need to address, both \ncollectively and individually, in order to ensure a better \nworld for all of us. Undoubtedly, peace and security \nremain at the centre of our preoccupation that obliges \nus to take responsibility first and foremost. Terrorism \nis a stumbling block to the advancement and prosperity \nof our societies and the world at large. We need to \nrecommit ourselves and strengthen our practical \nmeasures, including putting in place a good strategy to \ncombat terrorism at the national, regional and \ninternational levels. We must enhance at all levels the \nrelevant existing instruments on counter-terrorism, in \nparticular the United Nations Global Counter-\nTerrorism Strategy, which was adopted by the General \nAssembly in December 2006. \n As for Cambodia, the Royal Government has \ndevoted its time, energy, efforts and resources to join \nthe international community in combating terrorism in \naccordance with the United Nations conventions, \nprotocols and agreements on security cooperation with \nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations member \nStates, including its partners in the region. To live up to \nour strong commitment, the Law on Counter-terrorism \nwas promulgated by His Majesty the King of \nCambodia in July 2007, and our national mechanism in \nthat area has been constantly strengthened. \n Furthermore, our world is still marred by the \nspread of small arms and light weapons, which \ncontinue to have implications for our comprehensive \nsecurity and livelihoods. We need to address that issue \nwith seriousness and prompt actions. As a country that \nwas ravaged by war and conflict for more than two \ndecades, Cambodia experienced suffering from the use \nof small arms and light weapons and other weapons of \nwar. In that regard, we attach great importance to the \nagreed international instruments, especially the \nimplementation of the 2001 United Nations Programme \nof Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit \nTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its \nAspects. Over the years, Cambodia has taken practical \nmeasures to strictly control the use and circulation of \narms and ammunitions, as well as to eliminate the \nillegal procurement and sale of arms. \n On the issue of landmines and unexploded \nammunition, we are of the view that landmines are not \nonly a security problem, but also a humanitarian one, \nas their innocent victims become permanently \ntraumatized and physically handicapped, while their \n  \n \n08-53141 20 \n \nfamilies suffer untold misery of spiritual and material \ndeprivation. \n The problems of landmines and unexploded ordnance \nhave been integrated into our national agenda \u2014 such as \nthe Cambodia millennium development goals, the National \nStrategic Development Plan and the Rectangular \nStrategy of the Royal Government of Cambodia \u2014 in \norder to cope with that challenging issue. Cambodia \nhighly appreciates the valuable contributions of \ndevelopment partners and donors in terms of financial \nand material support over the years. \n With our demining experience and as part of our \ncontribution to international peace, security and \ndevelopment, Cambodia has dispatched its third group \nof 135 deminers of the Royal Cambodian Armed \nForces to the Sudan for mine clearance activities under \nthe umbrella of the United Nations peacekeeping \noperations. \n We are now confronted more than ever with \nincreasing natural disasters, from floods to droughts, \nfrom tsunamis to storms and global warming, to name \njust a few that are caused mostly by climate change. \n Nowadays, industrialized countries consume 75 per \ncent of the world\u2019s energy and produce 80 per cent of \ngreenhouse gas emissions, while developing countries, \nwhich produce little of such gas and have essentially \nagricultural economies, are the main victims of \nincreasing global warming and continuing climate \nchange. \n According to a report of the United Nations \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, if the \ntemperature increases by two degrees Celsius, up to \n30 per cent of plant and animal species worldwide \nwould be at risk of extinction. However, according to a \nseparate study of the Climate Change Policy Unit of \nthe World Wildlife Fund, it would take only 0.1 per \ncent of global gross domestic product to save the \nworld\u2019s climate, and thus our own human survival. \n Fully aware of the danger and consequences of \nclimate change and global warming on the well-being, \nlivelihood, and development of people around the world, \nCambodia has led a vast campaign of reforestation \nthroughout our country, where 14,300 hectares were \nplanted between 2003 and 2006. The rationalization \nand ban of wood-cutting have been implemented. As a \nparty to the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change and its Kyoto Protocol, Cambodia has \nmade its utmost effort to implement the Convention \nand the Protocol, promote clean development \nmechanism projects, and to prepare a national \nadaptation programme of action on climate change. \nCambodia also strongly supports the Bali Action Plan \naimed at greenhouse gas reduction as well as the \nJapanese initiative Cool Earth 50. \n We are also of the view that, to help reverse \nclimate change, we will need to preserve nature\u2019s \nbiodiversity as much as possible and to put an end to \nthe ongoing deforestation in the world, especially in \nthe least developed countries, by assisting people in \nfinding sources of income other than deforestation. \n It is also important for us to actively promote \nworld public participation in the issue by mobilizing \npublic awareness of the absolute necessity to work \ntogether to struggle against global warming and \nclimate change. We should forge a shared awareness of \nclimate change caused by industrialization, which is \nthe other side of the coin of development. We need to \nmobilize the support of all countries, especially the \nindustrialized developed nations, to respect and \nimplement the Framework Convention and its Kyoto \nProtocol. \n I would like to take this opportunity to call on the \nUnited Nations to organize a world summit on climate \nchange so that the issue will remain at the top of world \nleaders\u2019 agendas and to ensure that concrete and timely \nmeasures and action will be undertaken to help reverse \nthe current trend of global warming and climate \nchange. \n Concerning the Korean peninsula, we are \nconfident that the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea and the United States, as well as other parties \ninvolved, will maintain the momentum in fulfilling, in \ngood faith, the implementation of the 2005 Joint \nStatement for the sake of peace, stability and security \nin the region and the world at large. \n Regarding the Middle East, the peace process has \nbeen on our agenda for long enough and we are \nhopeful that all parties to the conflict will have the will \nand the wisdom to end the conflict as soon as possible \nin the interests of all countries concerned. In that \nregard, Cambodia welcomes the 24 June 2008 Quartet \nstatement and the ongoing negotiations between Israel \nand Palestine to bring about peace. Israel and Palestine \nmust seize this opportunity to use every potential for \nachieving an agreement acceptable to both sides. \n \n \n21 08-53141 \n \n With regard to the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs), eight years have gone by since their \nadoption. We all know that the pace of achieving \nprogress towards the MDGs is very slow and that we \nrisk the possibility of missing the 2015 target date. The \noutcomes of the high-level meeting on the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals have clearly underlined the \nimportance for the need to continue implementing the \nMDGs with greater effectiveness by enhancing closer \ncooperation between developed and developing \ncountries. \n In that regard, there is a need to ensure greater \nflows of financing for development through foreign \ndirect investment, official development assistance and \nmore trade. At the same time, developed countries \nshould make greater efforts to transfer innovative and \nrelevant technology to developing countries. \n For its part, Cambodia is firmly dedicated to \nachieving the MDGs. Various strategies for sustainable \ndevelopment and poverty alleviation are in the early \nstages of elaboration. The eight United Nations Goals \nhave been incorporated into the framework of our \nNational Strategic Development Plan, the Cambodian \nmillennium development goals and the Rectangular \nStrategy. Over the years, with those development \nblueprints Cambodia experienced a double-digit \neconomic growth of 11.1 per cent on average from \n2004 through 2007 and the poverty rate dropped from \n35 per cent to 31 per cent. \n In addition, Cambodia is fully committed to \nimplementing the principle of good governance and \nmaintaining macroeconomic stability and fiscal \ndiscipline. The policy of the Royal Government of \nCambodia is to conserve its domestic resources in \norder to finance the needs of national development. \n However, domestic resources are not enough to \nfinance investment needs for maintaining the economic \ngrowth rate at an acceptable level and as a response to \nkey socio-economic targets, including the MDGs. \nTherefore, Cambodia continues to need financial \ncooperation from its development partners in order to \nsupport ongoing national development and poverty \nreduction. \n For years, we have all agreed that the United \nNations needs reform. Despite our concerted efforts \nand some progress, differences remain on how to make \nthe United Nations more effective and more relevant in \ndealing with the numerous challenges we face today \nthroughout the world. Cambodia is of the view that \nUnited Nations reform must be comprehensive and \nrealistic. In order to move forward, we should continue \nto build greater consensus and uphold the common \ninterests of all, without discrimination. \n For almost 15 years now, Member States have \nintensely deliberated Security Council reform. \nCambodia has consistently reiterated its position in \nsupport of the expansion of the permanent and \nnon-permanent membership of the Security Council. \n However, we have not yet achieved any \nacceptable modality and clear framework for the \nreform. Therefore, Security Council reform has \nremained deadlocked. Although we have agreed that \nthe status quo is not acceptable, we must not lose the \nmomentum. In addition, we need to redouble our \ncollective efforts to ensure a breakthrough in the \ncurrent impasse of Security Council reform. "

        "file_text": "I am delivering this \nstatement on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Abdulla \nShahid, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Maldives, \nwho, unfortunately, had to cancel his trip to New York \nat the last minute owing to various pressing \nengagements at home. \n \n \n39 08-53141 \n \n Permit me to begin by expressing my delegation\u2019s \nwarmest congratulations to Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann on his election to preside over the General \nAssembly at its sixty-third session. I assure him of the \nfull support and cooperation of my delegation in his \nwork. I should also like to take this opportunity to \nexpress our profound appreciation to his predecessor, \nMr. Srgjan Kerim, for the exemplary manner in which \nhe guided the work of the Assembly at its sixty-second \nsession. In addition, I should like to offer my \ndelegation\u2019s heartfelt gratitude to Secretary-General \nBan Ki-moon for his inspiring leadership and \ndedication in promoting the noble principles and ideals \nof this Organization. \n Four years ago, the people of the Maldives \nembarked on a comprehensive reform programme \naimed at strengthening and modernizing democratic \ngovernance in the country. Within that short period of \ntime, unprecedented reforms have been adopted and \nthe political landscape of the country has been \ncompletely transformed. \n A new Constitution that fully guarantees the civil \nliberties and fundamental freedoms of our people was \nadopted on 7 August 2008. To safeguard the \nfoundations of democracy on our islands, several \noversight bodies \u2014 a National Human Rights \nCommission that complies with the Paris Principles, a \nJudicial Service Commission and an independent \nElections Commission \u2014 have been established and \nare now operational. Significant progress is also being \nmade in reforming and restructuring the legal and \njudicial system of the country to align it with \ninternationally accepted norms and standards. \n In accordance with the new Constitution, the \nMaldives will hold its first multiparty presidential \nelection early next week. Parliamentary elections will \nbe held before the end of February and local municipal \nelections will be completed by July next year. \n Those gains were made with the help of the \ninternational community, particularly the Commonwealth, \nthe European Union and the United Nations. I thank them \nfor their invaluable support, encouragement and \nassistance in implementing the reform programme. My \nGovernment is also extremely grateful to those \norganizations for accepting our request for election \nmonitoring and assistance in the electoral process. We \nare firm in our resolve that the elections shall be held \nin a free and fair manner in full conformity with \ninternationally recognized standards and best practice. \n When the Maldives joined the United Nations in \n1965, we were one of the smallest and poorest States \nMembers of this Organization. We lacked even the \nmost basic political, legal and economic infrastructure \nand institutions necessary for self-governance. Our \nability to provide for the welfare of our people was \nextremely limited. The economy was based largely on \nsubsistence fishery, and the health and education \nsectors were severely underdeveloped. However, since \nthen, the Maldives has achieved remarkable levels of \nsocio-economic progress. Thirty years of strong and \nunwavering political leadership, complemented by the \nhard work of our people and the generous assistance of \nour development partners, have enabled the country \nsuccessfully to pursue a people-centred path of \nsustainable development, based on social equity and \njustice. \n The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are \nnow fully incorporated into our national development \npriorities, and I am happy to note that we are among \nthose countries that are on track to achieve most of the \nMDGs by 2015. We believe that the ongoing political, \nlegal and human rights reform agenda will further \nstrengthen our progress and propel us to new heights of \nsocio-economic development, with the support of our \npartners. \n As a result of our rapid development progress, \nfour years ago the Assembly decided to graduate the \nMaldives from the list of least developed countries. \nThe Maldives is also being hailed by the international \ncommunity as a major success story of the multilateral \ndevelopment assistance framework. \n And yet those hard-won achievements will be \nrendered meaningless if MDG 7 \u2014 environmental \nsustainability \u2014 cannot be guaranteed. It is now \naccepted beyond any doubt that climate change poses \nthe most immediate and far-reaching threat to human \nsecurity, directly compromising the most fundamental \nrights, including the right to self-determination and the \nright to life itself, for millions of people around the \nworld. \n From the highest Himalayan peaks to the low-\nlying coastal areas and small islands a metre or so \nabove sea level, global warming and changing weather \npatterns are undermining the lives and livelihoods of \nmillions of people around the planet, with the poor \n  \n \n08-53141 40 \n \nbeing especially vulnerable. The recent hurricanes that \nleft such a trail of destruction across the Caribbean \nonce again brought into sharp relief the acute \nvulnerabilities of small island States, such as the \nMaldives, to global warming and climate change. \n For the Maldives, climate change is not a distant \npossibility. It is happening now and is a reality that we \nare experiencing on a daily basis. The continuing \ndegradation of the global environment is not only \nundermining our development process, but also \nseriously threatening the very survival of our people \nand the existence of our tiny country. \n We are all aware of the grim predictions in the \nfourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change. If those predictions were to \ncome true, the Maldives and many other small island \ndeveloping States and low-lying coastal areas would \ncease to exist within a relatively short period of time. \n Hence, the Maldives and many other small island \ndeveloping States do not have the luxury of hesitation \nand inaction, nor can we afford to pick and choose \nwhere and when that important issue needs to be \naddressed. For us, it is not solely a development issue, \nbut also a moral, ethical, political, legal and human \nrights issue, as well as a grave security issue. \n That is why the President of the Maldives took \nthe initiative in 1987 to raise that issue before the \nAssembly. That is also why the Maldives participated \nin the Security Council debate on the issue last year, \nand why the Maldives decided to raise the issue before \nthe Human Rights Council in 2008. \n The inverse relationship between responsibility \nfor climate change and vulnerability to its \nconsequences is often overlooked. The Maldives and \nother small island developing States contribute the \nleast to global warming, and yet their development \nand, indeed, their very existence are fundamentally \nthreatened by global warming and its consequences. \n Addressing the injustices of climate change is \ntherefore the moral and ethical responsibility of the \nentire international community. It is time that we put \npeople back in the climate change debate. We believe \nthat a comprehensive rights-based approach to \nsustainable and just development, anchored in the \nconcept of common but differentiated responsibility, is \nnow an imperative. \n In that regard, we are happy that, at the initiative \nof the Maldives and 80 other like-minded countries, the \nUnited Nations Human Rights Council for the first \ntime, earlier this year, recognized the link between \nhuman rights and climate change. The Council will \nformally debate the issue at its tenth session in March \n2009, and we hope that due consideration will be given \nto the outcome of the debate by our colleagues in the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange as they work to ensure an effective and \nequitable successor to the Kyoto Protocol. \n The Maldives is encouraged by the renewed \ninternational impetus towards a more sustained and \nrobust approach to achieving the MDGs. Indeed, the \nhigh-level event on the MDGs held last week clearly \nillustrates the collective commitment and interest of \nthe international community to work towards achieving \nthose Goals. The interrelationship between climate \nchange, food security and the attainment of the MDGs \ncannot be overemphasized. It is now believed that the \nglobal food and energy crisis will drive more than \n100 million more people into poverty. \n While short-term measures may ease the \nimmediate pressures, we believe that a sustainable \nsolution to the problem lies in a fair and equitable \ntrading regime and a shared vision of partnership and \ncooperation. The early and successful completion of \nthe Doha Development Round and the successful \noutcome of the post-Bali negotiations, as well as the \nFollow-up International Conference on Financing for \nDevelopment to be held in Qatar at the end of this year \nwill prove critical in that regard. \n As a country that depends on importing most of \nits food and all of its energy resources, the Maldives is \nextremely concerned about the rise in global food and \nenergy prices. Although the situation in the Maldives at \npresent is relatively stable, the potential of a severe \nblow to our economy is alarmingly high. The \nGovernment is fully aware of the risks involved and is \ntaking all necessary precautionary measures to ensure \nthat the crisis does not adversely affect the daily lives \nand well-being of our people. \n Organized crime and terrorism are continuing to \nthreaten the maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity. The recent bombings in India and Pakistan are \nyet another tragic reminder of the evil and insidious \nnature of terrorism. It is therefore important for the \ninternational community to ensure that the war against \n \n \n41 08-53141 \n \nterrorism remains a main priority on the international \nagenda.  \n The continued scourge of terrorism is particularly \nalarming when seen in the context of the spread of \nnuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction. \nThe threat of a terrorist organization gaining access to \nsuch weapons is extremely alarming. \n I am happy to note that the Maldives is now party \nto almost all the international conventions on counter-\nterrorism. Despite its limited resource and expertise, \nthe Maldives has been actively working towards \nimplementing its various regional and multilateral \nobligations under the international counter-terrorism \nregime. I would therefore like to take this opportunity \nto reiterate our commitment to combating global \nterrorism and to Security Council resolutions 1373 \n(2001) and 1540 (2004) in particular. \n A permanent and lasting resolution to the \nquestion of Palestine remains elusive. The Maldives \nreiterates its support for the right of the Palestinian \npeople to self-determination and to an independent and \nsovereign homeland. We believe that the two-State \nsolution remains the only viable option and needs to be \npursued with greater vigour and vitality. \n The United Nations in the twenty-first century \nmust have the ability to take on emerging challenges in \nan expeditious and efficient manner. While we applaud \nthe present efforts to reform and revitalize the \nOrganization, we believe that such reforms cannot be \nsuccessfully achieved without the much-anticipated \nreform of the Security Council. In that regard, we are \nhappy that the Assembly has decided to proceed to \nintergovernmental negotiations in early 2009. We look \nforward to participating in those negotiations. \n Despite the criticisms levelled against the United \nNations, my country remains convinced that the \nOrganization is the most potent and credible universal \ninstitution today. For the past six decades, the United \nNations has been a beacon of hope for peoples around \nthe world. Its universal character and the \nmultilateralism that it embodies hold true to the ideals \nand virtues upon which it was founded and, without a \ndoubt, provide the only viable framework for solving \nthe world\u2019s great challenges, including climate change, \nsustainable development, human rights and global \nterrorism. \n I therefore reaffirm the Maldives\u2019 commitment to \nthe principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter. \nI offer our full support to the United Nations in its \nresolute efforts to maintain international peace and \nsecurity and to work towards the betterment of all \nhumanity.

        "file_text": "I wish first to congratulate \nMr. D\u2019Escoto Brockmann on his election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly. \n This session of the General Assembly is taking \nplace at a time of great global challenges, such as the \n  \n \n08-51606 16 \n \nenergy crisis, high food prices and instability in the \nfinancial markets. Those are serious problems that \ncould erode the gains the world economy has made in \nthe past 10 years. Let me add that our gathering here \nalso provides a window of opportunity for us to review \nthe progress we have made, individually and \ncollectively, in fulfilling the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs). \n Nevertheless, before proceeding with my \nremarks, I wish first of all to update the Assembly on \nthe progress Kenya has made following the challenges \nwe faced soon after the general elections held in \nDecember 2007. \n Kenyans, fellow Africans and the international \ncommunity held on to the hope that our country would \nobtain a peacefully negotiated outcome to the political \ncrisis. That hope was realized on 28 February with the \nsigning of the National Accord and Reconciliation Act. \nThe Accord paved the way for the establishment of a \ngrand coalition Government representing all major \npolitical parties and interests in our country. \n The Government is making use of that historic \nwindow of opportunity to build a consensus that will \nenable us to address the major challenges facing our \nnation. We are, for instance, making good progress \ntowards the implementation of far-reaching legal, \nconstitutional and policy reforms that will entrench \nnational cohesion and meet the political, economic and \nsocial aspirations of our people. \n I am confident that, over the past few months, \nKenya has regained its glory and redeemed its image as \na peaceful nation, a safe tourist and investment \ndestination and the regional hub for peace and \nhumanitarian efforts. I wish to express, on behalf of all \nKenyans, our profound gratitude for the engagement \nand support of all our friends. In that connection, I \nwish to pay special tribute to the members of the Panel \nof Eminent African Personalities, led by former \nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, the African Union and \nthe United Nations. I would also like to thank the \nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his personal \nand constant support. \n As Africa grapples with the challenges of \ncompetitive elections in fragile democracies divided by \nregional, racial, religious and ethnic differences, the \ntime has come for us to reflect on the role of \ncompetitive electoral processes in the building of our \nnational democratic institutions. \n Indeed, the challenge of attaining democratic and \ninclusive elected Governments is at the core of the \nconflicts and insecurity prevailing in many parts of \nAfrica. In the Sudan, for example, the Comprehensive \nPeace Agreement (CPA) continues to hold three years \nafter its signing, despite challenges. I welcome the \nefforts made by the parties to the CPA in overcoming \nsome recent difficulties. I urge them to intensify their \nefforts to address all outstanding issues in the \nimplementation of the Accord. \n On the other hand, the situation in Somalia \nremains fragile. That is mainly because the Transitional \nFederal Government of Somalia has still not received \nfull support from the international community. \n While I pay tribute to the Governments of \nUganda and Burundi for providing troops as part of the \nAfrican Union Mission in Somalia, I urge the \ndeployment of the remaining troops to strengthen the \nMission. I also urge the United Nations and the \ninternational community to assume greater \nresponsibility in Somalia so as to nurture the \nemergence of a stable and democratic country. \n With regard to the Great Lakes, tremendous \nprogress has been made in promoting peace while \nreducing conflict in the region. The conclusion of the \nPact on Security, Stability and Development in the \nGreat Lakes Region has given impetus to our efforts. \nHowever, the implementation of the Pact faces \nchallenges owing to renewed tension and hostilities. I \ncall upon all those involved to embrace the Pact and to \nseek the peaceful resolution of current problems. We \nmust not derail our goal of achieving economic \ndevelopment and regional integration in the Great \nLakes. The Special Fund for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment, on which we all agreed, is now \noperational. I appeal to the international community to \ncontribute to the Fund. It is a crucial pillar for the \npromotion of peace and development in the Great \nLakes region. \n I now return to the food crisis, which I mentioned \nat the beginning of my speech. Our meeting is taking \nplace at a time when Africa and many other parts of the \nworld are facing a severe food shortage. I am therefore \nhappy to note that the theme of this general debate, \n\u201cThe impact of the global food crisis on poverty and \nhunger in the world as well as the need to democratize \nthe United Nations\u201d, pays particular attention to that \nimportant subject. Indeed, while food prices have risen \n \n \n17 08-51606 \n \nglobally, their impact has been most severe and adverse \nfor the poorest people living in developing countries. \nThe continued rise in food prices has national security \nimplications for most developing nations. \n Therefore, in the immediate future, we must, as \nMembers of the United Nations, find mechanisms to \ndeliver sufficient quantities of affordable food to poor \npeople in Africa and other parts of the developing \nworld. In the medium term, we must also address the \nissues of agricultural productivity, particularly in terms \nof making available to smaller farmers in Africa better-\nyielding seed varieties, modern farming techniques and \ncheaper fertilizer. That will require more effective \nglobal partnerships among developed nations, \ninternational institutions and developing nations. In \nparticular, such partnerships should place food security, \nagricultural technology development and transfer, trade \nand agricultural credit at the centre of the development \nagenda. \n Indeed, the most equitable way to lift Africa\u2019s \npeople out of poverty and underdevelopment is through \nthe widespread commercialization of agriculture. We \nmust focus on the manufacture of and trade in value-\nadded agricultural products, supported by efficient \nfinancial services and markets. In that regard, the \nglobal community should hasten consensus on \nagriculture and other contentious issues, so as to enable \nthe successful conclusion of the Doha Development \nRound of the World Trade Organization.  \n On the issue of escalating global oil prices, I wish \nto make a passionate appeal to oil-producing nations to \nconsider the plight of non-oil-producing nations, \nespecially those in the developing world. There is need \nto address the problem of speculative trading in the oil \nfutures market, where prices have doubled in the past \nyear. Indeed, the rapid increase in oil prices is hurting \ndeveloping countries the most and does not augur well \nfor international peace and stability. We should all be \naware that we are one global community and that none \nof us is completely isolated from the instability caused \nby inflationary pressures resulting from the high oil \nprices. \n We have, over the years, discussed the need for a \nmore effective and accountable United Nations that \nwill enable us to address the emerging and persistent \nglobal challenges such as climate change, international \nsecurity, poverty, conflicts and economic disparities. \nTowards that end, reform at the Security Council is \nimperative. We need to ensure that its composition \nreflects equitable geographical representation of the \nentire United Nations membership. Africa therefore \ndeserves permanent representation on the Security \nCouncil. \n Reforms are also needed in other areas. We are \nconvinced that strengthening the Economic and Social \nCouncil will enable that organ to reassert its authority \nand its capacity to promote greater coherence and \ncoordination with the multinational financial \ninstitutions, the World Trade Organization and other \nUnited Nations bodies. \n I would like to congratulate the Secretary-\nGeneral for his continued focus on the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and, in particular, the \nestablishment of the MDGs Africa Steering Group, \nwhich has, among other interventions, proposed the \nlaunching of an African green revolution. I also look \nforward to the insights and recommendations that will \ncome out of the High-level Event on MDGs later this \nweek. \n Finally, I wish to note that the challenges facing \nus today, such as the global food crisis, attaining the \nMDGs and climate change, more than ever before \nrequire coordinated global and multilateral \ncooperation. A more effective and accountable United \nNations is therefore needed to meet and overcome \nthese challenges. "

        "file_text": "I would like to \ncongratulate Mr. d\u2019Escoto Brockmann on his election \nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \nsession. The Australian delegation looks forward to \nworking closely with him throughout the session. \n We gather together at a time of great challenge to \nthe international system \u2014 a challenge that reminds us \nafresh that we live in a world where our \ninterdependence is now greater than at any time before, \nan interdependence that therefore demands our \ninternational cooperation now more than at any time \nbefore. \n There are many who criticize the United Nations. \nAnd those of us who know this institution well know \nthat it is not immune to criticism. But those who argue \nagainst this Organization advance no credible argument \nas to what should replace it. Whatever its \nimperfections, the United Nations represents a \nnecessary democracy of States \u2014 States who resolved, \nout of the carnage of the last world war, that \ncooperation should always be preferred to conflict, that \nour national interests are invariably best served by the \nsimultaneous prosecution of the international interest, \nand that the purposes of our common humanity should \nprevail over the narrow interests of the few. \n When the nations of the world met in San \nFrancisco in 1945, the United Nations was conceived \nas a bold experiment \u2014 one that ran contrary to the \ngrain of the international order that had preceded it, \nwhere conflict was the norm and cooperation the \nexception; one in which the international community, \nfor the first time, began to imagine how through an \ninternational institution we could not just protect the \nsovereignty of States, but equally advance the \nprotection of peoples and the dignity of individuals. \n Beyond that, we began to advance the idea that \nthrough the other great international institutions \u2014 the \nWorld Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), \nthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) \nand the International Labour Organization (ILO) \u2014 we \ncould fashion an international economic order that \nrecognized the unfolding reality of economic \ninterdependence.  \n These were the ideals we set for ourselves more \nthan half a century ago. And while the history of our \nachievements since then has been mixed, the ideas and \nthe ideals on which these institutions were constructed \nnonetheless remain as valid now as they were back \nthen. \n The failures that we have seen in recent times do \nnot lie in the institutions alone. The failure lies more in \nthe poverty of our political will to animate those \ninstitutions to discharge the purposes for which they \nwere created. And that is our collective responsibility. \n The global financial crisis of today presents us \nafresh with a critical opportunity to act \ncomprehensively and collectively for the long term, \nrather than selectively and separately for the short. In \nthe post-war period, the quantum of financial \ninstitutional failure seen these last weeks has been \ngreat. The quantum of government intervention in \nfinancial markets has been significant. The quantum of \nthe impact by one market on another has been \nunprecedented. What we have seen in financial markets \nshould bring home to us all that the central organizing \nprinciple of this twenty-first century is interdependence. \n For the century just past, interdependence may \nhave been one option among many. For the century that \nis to come, there is no longer an alternative. \nInterdependence is not the expression of sentimental \nidealism. Instead, it is a recognition of the new realism \nof our current times, which represents the cumulative \nimpact of the globalization of our engagement with \neach other over many decades. Through unprecedented \ntrade flows, unprecedented investment flows and \nunprecedented financial flows, we now see the \nglobalization of our economy; the globalization of \nsecurity, arising from the searing impact of \n11 September when the obscenity visited on this great \ncity caused us all to conclude that terrorism was the \nenemy of all civilized humanity, not just of some \n \n \n37 08-51851 \n \nnations; and the globalization of the environment, as \nwe have come to recognize that carbon emissions from \none part of the planet affect all parts of the planet and \ntherefore radically affect the future of the planet itself. \n What all these things tell us is this: \ninterdependence is the new realism of this twenty-first \ncentury. And unless as a community of nations we rise \nto this new challenge, our future is bleak indeed. \n The global financial crisis is a call to the global \ncommunity to act. Financial markets are a public good. \nThe stability of global financial markets is a public \ngood. If Governments fail to protect this public good, \nthen those who suffer are the working people of the \nworld, whose jobs, whose homes and whose standard \nof living depend on it. \n It is Governments rather than speculators that \nhave the central responsibility for determining the rules \nthat govern the way markets work. A decade ago, the \nglobal economy and global financial markets were \nbuffeted by the Asian financial crisis, and as a global \ncommunity we resolved that we would act to reduce \nthe risk of such systemic crises in the future. The \nproblem is, a decade on, that systemic lessons were not \nlearned. \n Now we face a financial crisis of truly global \nproportions. We must therefore ask ourselves three \nquestions: What went wrong? What needs to be done \nnow to fix the problem of financial market instability \nfor the long term? And most critically, how do we \nmarshal the political will to do so? \n First, what went wrong? There has been a failure \nof internal governance within financial institutions. \nThere has also been a failure of external oversight. \nRegulators have not always recognized the systemic \nrisk posed by significant financial institutions. \n So what must now be done? \n The immediate task is to rebuild confidence in \nthe financial system by ensuring that central banks \nprovide adequate liquidity, by enabling the \nrecapitalization of critical financial institutions and by \nensuring their continued solvency. Over the longer \nterm, the challenge is to reform financial markets and \nregulatory systems so as to reduce the chances of these \nevents repeating themselves in the future. To this end, \ntogether with other States, we would argue that the \nfollowing reform programme be implemented. \n First, systemically important financial institutions \nshould be licensed to operate in major economies only \nunder the condition that they make full disclosure and \nanalysis of balance sheet and off-balance sheet \nexposures. Systemically important financial institutions \nare not just commercial banks but can include \ninvestment banks, insurance companies, hedge funds \nand financial clearing houses. \n Which institutions are systemically important will \nvary in a given country over time. The central bank in \neach country should have responsibility for the \nstability of the financial system. That should be \nembedded in globally agreed best-practice standards \nfor financial regulation and should be assessed by the \nIMF.  \n Secondly, we need to ensure that banks and other \nfinancial institutions build up capital in good times as a \nbuffer for bad times, using predictable rules. \nSupervisory frameworks need to be countercyclical, \nnot pro-cyclical. The Basel rules need to address this. \n Thirdly, financial institutions need to have a clear \nincentive to promote responsible behaviour rather than \nunrestrained greed. Regulators should set higher capital \nrequirements for financial firms that have executive \nremuneration packages rewarding short-term returns or \nexcessive risk taking. Again, the Basel rules need to \naddress this. \n Fourthly, supervisory systems must be compatible \nwith accounting principles that reflect reasonable \nassessments of the value of assets over time. We need \nto make sure that accounting rules foster a more \nmedium-term perspective and that they do not \nencourage institutions to believe that risk is low merely \nbecause current asset prices are high or recent asset-\nprice volatility has been low. The Basel rules also need \nto address this. \n Fifthly, the IMF should be given a strengthened \nmandate for prudential analysis. Conservative and \nconsistent prudential standards should be applied to all \nfinancial institutions of systemic significance. \nFurthermore, the IMF and the Financial Stability \nForum should develop early warning systems that \nsignal impending institutional vulnerabilities and \nprovide advice on remedial policies. Collectively, those \ninstitutions have led the development of the initiatives \nthat represent the core of the financial-market reform \nagenda that I have just described. However, those \ninstitutions are, by their very nature, bureaucratic, and \n  \n \n08-51851 38 \n \nthe reform processes they initiate are constrained by a \nlack of political authority.  \n That brings me to the third question arising from \nthe current crisis: how are we to go about \nimplementing this reform agenda for the long term? \n What is required is political will, exercised \nthrough ministerial forums working in cooperation \nwith the IMF, the Financial Stability Forum and the \nGroup of Twenty (G20). The G20 is well placed to \nprovide the political authority to have such actions \nimplemented urgently and comprehensively. In that \ncontext, Australia will work intensively with the \nforthcoming Chairs of the G20 \u2014 in particular the \nUnited Kingdom in 2009 \u2014 to ensure that financial \nstability is at the centre of the work programme and to \ninitiate arrangements to strengthen G20 input into \nshaping the work of the IMF and the Financial Stability \nForum and the implementation of agreed outcomes. \n At their meeting in November, the G20 finance \nministers should review the progress made in adopting \nthe current Financial Stability Forum \nrecommendations, reinforce the agreed deadlines for \nfinalizing their implementation and agree with the \nForum on a clear timetable for the action plan. \n As countries with systemically important \neconomies, G20 members should demonstrate their \ncommitment to best-practice financial regulation and \ndisclosure by providing better information regarding \nthe stability of their domestic financial systems and \ncross-border exposures to the IMF and the Financial \nStability Forum. The IMF and the Financial Stability \nForum should provide regular scenario analysis to the \nG20 to facilitate clear engagement on the risks facing \nthe global financial system. Such analysis should be \nincluded in an enhanced version of the IMF\u2019s Global \nFinancial Stability Report. \n The purpose of this reform agenda is to provide a \nreal political mandate for our international regulatory \ninstitutions to do their job in defending the integrity of \nthe international financial system. \n One of the greatest challenges we face is climate \nchange and the threat it poses to the environment. In \nDecember last year, after many years of delay, \nAustralia ratified the Kyoto Protocol. We are \ndetermined to be part of the solution to climate change, \nnot just a part of the problem. We have acted to begin \nthe process of developing a comprehensive emissions \ntrading or carbon pollution reduction scheme to bring \ndown carbon dioxide emissions over time. We will also \nimplement a national energy efficiency strategy as well \nas a renewable energy strategy. Developing and \ndeploying new technologies will also be part of our \nresponse to climate change. \n The Australian Government has decided to \nestablish a global centre to drive the demonstration and \ncommercialization of carbon capture and storage \ntechnologies. Building on existing national and \nregional initiatives, that project will bring together the \nbest researchers in the world to develop the best \ntechnology to apply. As the world at present is \nplanning to generate 45 per cent of its electricity from \ncoal by 2030, we can no longer afford to delay acting \non such technology. Australia invites all Governments \nand corporations of goodwill to participate in the \nGlobal Carbon Capture and Storage Institute. \n The United Nations and we, its Member nations, \nhave a responsibility to protect the nations and peoples \nof the world. We must protect people from terrorism, \nand that must include a commitment to support those \nnations on the front lines of the struggle. Australia is \nworking closely with the Government of Afghanistan \nand with our global partners to bring security and \nstability to that country. We can never again allow it to \nbecome a haven for terrorists. \n Australia is also an active contributor to global \nefforts to prevent the spread of weapons of mass \ndestruction. We continue to urge nations to sign and \nratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty so \nthat it can enter into force. \n We remain concerned that States such as Iran and \nNorth Korea continue to defy the international \ncommunity and to fail to comply with demands for a \nfull declaration and accounting of their nuclear \nprogrammes. Their actions are undermining the global \nconsensus on containment of the spread of nuclear \nweapons. \n This year, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons (NPT) celebrates its fortieth \nanniversary. As a middle Power and a long-standing \nmember of the NPT, Australia is committed to working \nwith other nations towards the goal of the eventual \nabolition of nuclear weapons. Australia, together with \nour close friend and partner Japan, has established an \nInternational Commission on Nuclear Non-Proliferation \nand Disarmament to create the political and policy \n \n \n39 08-51851 \n \nconsensus necessary to elicit a real result on  \nnon-proliferation and disarmament in advance of the \n2010 NPT Review Conference. \n The United Nations own security machinery must \nalso be effective. The Security Council needs reform. \nAustralia supports expansion of its permanent \nmembership to reflect changes in the world since 1945, \nand our nation will be a candidate for a non-permanent \nseat for the 2013-2014 term. Australia once again \nwishes to play its part in advancing the international \nsecurity order. \n Prosperity comes from economic growth. It \ncomes from nations trading with one another. That is \nwhy it is so important that we conclude the Doha \nRound of world trade talks this year. It is why we must \nalso implement the Millennium Development Goals, \nconsistent with our solemn commitment in this place at \nthe dawn of this millennium. \n Progress in achieving the Goals has been mixed. \nWe need to redouble our efforts to reduce poverty, to \nprovide education for children and to ensure that \npeople in the developing world have access to health \ncare. Australia is committed to increasing its official \ndevelopment assistance to 0.5 per cent of its gross \nnational income by 2015. Australia now resolves to do \nmuch more \u2014 much, much more \u2014 to make poverty \nhistory. It is unforgivable that poverty and conflict, \nsuch as those in Darfur, continue to claim the lives of \ninnocents in the face of inaction by Governments.  \n Development is also about protecting human \nrights. Sixty years ago, this body adopted the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights. We must commit afresh \nto protecting the rights that that charter identifies.  \n As nations, we should also commit afresh to \nrighting past wrongs. In Australia, we began that \nrecently with the first Australians, who have the oldest \ncontinuing culture in human history. This year, on \nbehalf of the Australian Parliament, I offered an \napology to Indigenous Australians for the wrongs that \nthey had suffered in the past. That was the right thing \nfor Australia to do. \n Our membership in the United Nations is a key \npillar of our foreign policy. Our priorities are regional, \nbut our interests are global. We work with partners \naround the world to meet shared challenges. Through \nour membership in the United Nations, we are \ncommitted to using creative middle-Power diplomacy \nto help overcome the great challenges of our age \u2014 \nchallenges that are beyond the power of individual \nnation-States to resolve, that can be overcome only \nthrough unprecedented cooperation between States. \nThat is because the problems that we seek to solve in \nthis Hall and through the organs of the United Nations \ntouch every one of our peoples. To advance prosperity \nand stability at home, we must advance prosperity and \nstability around the globe. \n Australia was one of the founding Members of \nthe United Nations. Our Foreign Minister at the time, \nHerbert Evatt, made a significant contribution at the \nSan Francisco Conference, particularly on the part of \nsmall and medium-sized countries. He ensured that the \nrole of the General Assembly was protected in the \nstructure of the Organization as a whole. \n Sixty years ago this week, he was elected \nPresident of the General Assembly at its third session. \nEvatt was a patriotic Australian. Evatt was equally a \npassionate internationalist. Sixty years later, this \ninstitution, together with other international institutions \nof our current order, have yet to realize the vision of \nthose who founded it. Yet the need today, in this age of \nunprecedented global interdependence, is greater than \never before. \n And so it falls to this generation to now summon \nthe political faith and to exercise the political will \nnecessary to act for the common purposes of the planet \nwe all share.

        "file_text": "When the present \nsession of the General Assembly began on Tuesday, the \nSecretary-General made important remarks about the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the \nfinancial crisis. The world is witnessing extraordinary \nfinancial turbulence, and all parties must shoulder their \nresponsibility. \n At the same time, the current crisis should not \ndistract us from the need to achieve the MDGs. What \nkind of world do we want to leave to our children and \ngrandchildren? Any parent who considers that question \nfor a moment will answer: a world in which my \nchildren are safe and can build decent lives, free from \nwant; a world in which my children can reach their full \npotential without fear of repression or terror; a world in \nwhich my children are free and their rights are \nprotected. \n Everything that we do as the United Nations is \nabout deep desires. There is a direct link between this \nUnited Nations building and the homes of hundreds of \nmillions of families all over the world. \n One man who forcefully reminded us that we are \nresponsible for the opportunities open to future \ngenerations was Franklin Delano Roosevelt. In early \n1941, in the darkest hour of the Second World War, he \ngave us his vision of the future: the dawning of a world \nin which people would enjoy freedom of expression \nand belief and would be free from fear and want. After \nthe war, those freedoms became our moral compass. \nThey were set out in the Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights, proclaimed by this very Assembly \nalmost 60 years ago. Human rights remain the \ncornerstone of Dutch policy. \n If we look around us today, we can see that \nreality falls far short of our ideal. We still live in a \nworld where, each year, more than 9 million children \ndie before they reach the age of five, and every day \nmillions of people live in fear of violence and the \nabuse of power. \n We cannot accept that. Together, the United \nNations comprises a working community and our work \nis not done \u2014 not by a long way. Global challenges \nrequire global solutions. Global solutions require \nglobal action. Every one of us needs to ask ourselves: \nWhat am I doing to make freedom a reality for people \nat home and elsewhere? \n What are we doing to bring about freedom from \nwant? In the past 10 years, millions of people have \nmanaged to escape from poverty. In Asia and parts of \nAfrica, a great deal of progress has been made, thanks \nto the efforts of many people. That progress should \ninspire hope as we continue to work towards the \nMillennium Development Goals. There is still so much \nto do. In some countries, the situation is actually \ngetting worse, especially where health is concerned. \nOne child still dies every three seconds, one mother \nevery minute. \n All Governments need to realize that good and \nethical governance is an essential foundation for \ndevelopment, and realizing that, they must act \naccordingly. That also applies to the current financial \ncrisis, where urgent action is needed. The financial \nsector and regulators should quickly implement the \nrecommendations of the Financial Stability Forum: \nstricter supervision, better risk management, greater \ntransparency and enhanced accountability. That is how \nto restore confidence in the financial markets and \nprevent future crises. The International Monetary Fund \nshould play a central role in that process by further \n \n \n51 08-51851 \n \nstepping up its financial sector oversight. Together, we \nshould re-establish the stability and integrity of the \nfinancial system. \n Governments have a duty to provide food for \ntheir people. The international community will support \nall those who fight against hunger, want and disease, \nbut we must do so as efficiently as possible. We must \nnot waste resources; the need is too great. Above all, \nwe must work together. We must work together with \nother Governments, certainly, but also with the \nbusiness community and civil society. Public-private \npartnership works. I meet more and more entrepreneurs \nwho are committed to the Millennium Development \nGoals and actively want to help. Let us grasp the hands \nthey extend. \n The Netherlands welcomes the initiative of \nMr. d\u2019Escoto Brockmann to place food security at the \ncentre of this session of the General Assembly. Rising \nfood prices hit the poor hardest. The position of small \nfarmers is particularly important. If they are able to \nincrease production, not only will their own families \nbenefit, but the local community will too. That is why \nthe Netherlands has earmarked extra funding for the \ndevelopment of agriculture in developing countries.  \n However, there can be no food without water. \nWater is the source of all life \u2014 1.8 billion people \ncurrently have no proper access to clean drinking \nwater, and their health, their very lives, are in the \nbalance. So the Netherlands has joined with countries \nthat believe that water is a human right, because access \nto water is an essential part of freedom from want. \n What are we doing to ensure that second essential \nfreedom \u2014 freedom from fear? Millions of people still \nlive in the middle of conflict and violence. We must \nnot accept that. Over the past 60 years, United Nations \npeace operations have played an important role in \nending conflict. In many areas, the United Nations has \nensured that dormant conflicts do not flare up again. So \nour efforts must continue, undiminished. Yet peace \noperations alone are not enough. The root cause of a \nconflict is often a political dispute, and it often requires \na political solution. \n There is no place in a free society for torture. \nThere is no place for the death penalty. We all strive \nfor a life without fear, yet there are people who face \nfear every day in order to defend human rights. To \nrecognize those brave people, the Netherlands has \nintroduced the Human Rights Defenders Tulip, a \nspecial honour that will be awarded annually on \nInternational Human Rights Day.  \n In our free world, no one is above the law and no \none is beneath it. The Netherlands is proud to host the \nlegal capital of the world in the city of The Hague. We \nwill continue to strive for an International Criminal \nCourt that is supported by all Member States. In a safe \nworld, right is stronger than might. Crimes that outrage \nworld opinion must always be punished. The \nInternational Criminal Court is there to support us in \nthat task, and we must support the Court \u2014 all of us, \nopenly and unconditionally. A wider acceptance of the \njurisdiction of the International Court of Justice will \nalso strengthen the international legal order. \n We also need to speak about freedom of \nexpression and belief. The debate on that issue often \nleads to misunderstandings, incomprehension and fears \nthat national traditions may be swept aside. We can all \nbe proud of our cultures and traditions, of the things \nthat distinguish us from others. The challenge for every \nGovernment is to affirm its people\u2019s cultural and \nreligious values and customs, and at the same time to \nbuild bridges with the rest of the world \u2014 bridges that \nenable people, organizations and religions to meet and \ndraw closer. Finding the right balance is not easy, but it \nis essential. \n Governments are there for everyone \u2014 for men \nand women; for people of all backgrounds and all \nreligious convictions; for monks, priests, rabbis and \nimams; and equally for those who do not believe in a \nsupreme being. Religion offers people comfort and \ninspiration in their personal lives. A religion is not a \nsystem of dogmas that may be imposed on others by \nforce, and it is certainly not a justification for using \nviolence when one feels aggrieved.  \n Everyone is free to profess his or her faith, to \nchange religion or not to believe. We must all cherish \nand defend the freedom of religion or belief. The same \ngoes for the freedom of people to express their views, \nand those freedoms go hand in hand. \n We all know that there are countries in the world \nwhere those freedoms are violated, and to those \ncountries I say: Respect the right of every person to \nfreedom of religion and freedom of expression. They \nare universal rights. They are universal freedoms. At \nthe same time, we must remind everyone who enjoys \nthose freedoms of their responsibility \u2014 the \n  \n \n08-51851 52 \n \nresponsibility to show the same respect to others that \nwe claim for ourselves. \n We need the United Nations to ensure those four \nessential freedoms for which we stand, and the United \nNations needs us. A strong United Nations is one in \nwhich universal values are central \u2014 a United Nations \nwith a fair and balanced Human Rights Council, a \nUnited Nations that unites and delivers. When we \nbegan building the United Nations together, the number \nof countries worldwide in which people enjoyed a \nreasonable level of freedom was around 15 per cent of \nthe total. Today, more than 60 per cent of countries can \nbe called free. \n In the same period, the number of people \nsuffering from malnutrition has fallen by several \nhundred million. The number of armed conflicts is also \ndeclining, however serious the situation remains in \ncertain troubled regions. Progress is possible, but it \ndoes not happen by itself. For the Netherlands, that is \nan incentive to continue working, heart and soul, for \u201ca \nworld in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of \nspeech and belief and freedom from fear and want\u201d. \n In conclusion, let me echo President Roosevelt\u2019s \nwords: \u201cThe world order which we seek is the \ncooperation of free countries, working together in a \nfriendly, civilized society.\u201d "

        "file_text": "We live in an era when the \nworld is becoming increasingly interdependent. \nNothing illustrates this interdependency more than the \nAsian financial crisis of a decade ago and the current \nfinancial crisis gripping the world\u2019s largest economy. \nThe problems may have local roots, but, given the \nseverity of the situation, their effects will transcend \nborders. The world economy, and by extension the \n  \n \n08-53135 18 \n \nstability of nations, depends on the stability of the \nfinancial markets. \n In recent months, the world has also been \nchallenged by the soaring prices of fuel and food, \nparticularly such staples as rice. Those daunting \nchallenges add an extra burden to developing \ncountries. The answer to those problems lies not in \nmultiplying the number of world summits and \nconferences but in taking concrete actions towards \nimplementing the commitments made. \n My own country has the potential to contribute to \nenergy and food security in our region. We are willing \nto do our part. We are making concerted efforts to \nproduce more crude oil and natural gas to meet the \nneeds of the domestic market as well as for export. We \nalso have huge potential to produce hydroelectric \npower. Moreover, as the agriculture sector is the \nmainstay of Myanmar\u2019s economy, we are focusing on \nexpanding the cultivation of paddy, beans and pulses. \nWe have also introduced new industrial crops, such as \njatropha, for use in the production of biofuels. \n Developing countries like my own need to have a \nlevel playing field in order to promote the economic \nprosperity and social progress of our people. Subsidies \nand protectionist policies distort markets and do great \nharm to developing countries. Political and social \nprogress can be achieved only through development, \nnever through coercive economic measures. Such \nmeasures only serve to worsen the plight of the people, \nparticularly the most vulnerable among them, women \nand children. \n Unilateral sanctions have been imposed on my \ncountry. Those sanctions are unwarranted. Unilateral \nsanctions are also against international law. They are \nnot only unfair but immoral. They are counter-\nproductive and deprive countries of their right to \ndevelopment and do not function as a solution to solve \nthe problem. \n Myanmar has abundant land and natural \nresources with which to make a meaningful \ncontribution to the energy and food security of our \ncountry and beyond. But in order for us to fulfil our \npotential we need unfettered access to markets. We \nneed modern technology; we need investment. The \nsooner the unjust sanctions are revoked and the barriers \nremoved, the sooner the country will be in a position to \nbecome the rice bowl of the region and a reliable \nsource of energy. \n That brings me to the matter of making the \nUnited Nations an Organization better suited to meet \nthe challenges of the twenty-first century. Only a more \ndemocratic Organization will be able to respond to the \nneeds of Member States and serve the interests of the \ninternational community as a whole. Reform of the \nOrganization, particularly reform of the Security \nCouncil, has been on our agenda for some time. \nHowever, progress has been extremely slow. The role \nand authority of the General Assembly as the principal \ndeliberative and representative organ must be \nenhanced, including in the maintenance of international \npeace and security. \n Reform of the Security Council has eluded us for \nover a decade. Myanmar believes that the membership \nof the Security Council should reflect current reality. \nWe believe in an increase in the membership of the \nCouncil in both the permanent and the elected \ncategories. Reform should not be confined to an \nincrease in membership but must also include \nimprovement in the Council\u2019s working methods. Above \nall, it should result in a Security Council that is \ntransparent, credible and democratic. \n Here, I would like to stress that attempts to \ninitiate formal or informal discussions in the Security \nCouncil on situations that do not constitute a threat to \ninternational peace and security are contrary to the \nletter and the spirit of the Charter. This is a view that \nMyanmar shares with the Non-Aligned Movement, \nwhich constitutes a clear majority of the membership \nof our Organization. \n The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \nadopted in 2000 are imperatives that the international \ncommunity has set for itself. We have now passed the \nmidpoint, but progress has been uneven. Much more \nremains to be done if the Goals are to be achieved by \n2015. While national Governments have the primary \nresponsibility to ensure progress, the international \ncommunity must help by creating an environment that \nwill enable developing countries to turn faltering steps \ntowards development into firm strides. Fulfilment of \nofficial development assistance commitments, \nincreased investment flows, improved market access \nand resolution of the debt problem are needed to enable \nthe developing countries to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. \n For its part, Myanmar is striving to promote better \nliving standards for its people. The implementation of \n \n \n19 08-53135 \n \nthe MDGs is inextricably linked to the implementation \nof our national development plan. The national plan \nfocuses on the promotion of equitable and balanced \nsocio-economic development of both rural and urban \nareas. In recent years, we have made significant \nprogress in areas such as poverty alleviation, the \npromotion of health and education. \n In the health sector, Myanmar has been \nimplementing a national plan that accords priority to \nthe eradication of major diseases such as HIV/AIDS, \nmalaria and tuberculosis. The high-level multisectoral \ncommittee on AIDS has been overseeing HIV/AIDS \nprevention and care activities in our country since \n1989. The activities undertaken by the committee \ninclude active surveillance, prevention of mother-to-\nchild transmission and community, institution and \nhome-based care services. These activities are carried \nout by the Government in close cooperation with \ninternational organizations such as the World Health \nOrganization, UNICEF and the World Food Programme, \nand with national and international non-governmental \norganizations in order to reach out widely to vulnerable \ngroups. \n As a result, Myanmar has not only levelled the \nrate of HIV/AIDS infection but also reduced it. I would \nlike to emphasize that if we are to achieve a more \ndynamic and effective global response to HIV/AIDS, \nadequate resources must be made available. Moreover, \nallocation of resources for HIV/AIDS, malaria and \ntuberculosis must be based on need rather than on \npolitical considerations. \n With regard to education, we envision a system \nfor our people that will generate a learning society \ncapable of meeting the challenges of the information \nage we live in. Long-term investment in the education \nsector is being made with the aim of building human \nresource development. The Government has been \nexpanding the number of basic, primary, post-primary, \nmiddle and high schools throughout the country in \norder to provide access to education for all. We \nstrongly believe education to be a fundamental \nrequirement for the attainment of sustainable \ndevelopment. It is also a prerequisite for the \nachievement of other MDGs. \n I am happy to be able to say that, as a result of \nour efforts, the literacy rate of those 15 years old and \nabove has risen to 94.8 per cent. Likewise, the rate of \nenrolment in primary schools has reached 98 per cent. \n Myanmar also accords priority to creating job \nopportunities in rural areas as part of its poverty \nalleviation strategy. In that regard, development \nprojects to improve economic, educational and health \nconditions in rural areas are being implemented all \nover the country. \n The Secretary-General\u2019s initiative to convene \ntoday\u2019s Ministerial Meeting on Reducing Disaster \nRisks in a Changing Climate is indeed timely. We in \nMyanmar can relate to the growing concern of the \nworld regarding climate change and its adverse effects. \nWe felt the full brunt of the devastating consequences \nof climate change last May, when a powerful cyclone \nslammed into the Ayeyarwaddy delta. Cyclone Nargis \nleft unprecedented death and destruction in its wake. \nThe pain and sorrow felt by the survivors of the \ndevastating storm continue even today.  \n There is, however, a silver lining in the dark \nclouds. The Myanmar nation was united in its response \nto the emergency. The outpouring of generosity was \noverwhelming. People from all walks of life, regardless \nof their own difficulties, donated, in cash and in kind, \nfor the victims. The United Nations, States members of \nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations, donor \ncountries, non-governmental organizations and \nindividuals from around the world also responded \ngenerously. We have been able to demonstrate \nwillingness and ability to work in concert with the \ninternational community. We have been able to rebuild \nbetter and stronger homes, schools and monasteries. \nThe paddy fields destroyed by the storm have been \nreplanted. \n I would like to take this opportunity to express \nour heartfelt appreciation to our friends from far and \nnear who came to our assistance in our time of need. \n Myanmar is home to over 100 national races, and \nnational unity is of paramount importance. \nAccordingly, we have been resolutely pursuing a policy \nof national reconciliation. Our endeavours have \nresulted in the return to the legal fold of 17 armed \ngroups. We have effectively put an end to the decades-\nlong insurgency. Peace and stability now prevail in \nalmost all parts of the country. \n We have also been implementing a seven-step \npolitical road map to democracy. The representatives of \nformer armed groups, together with the representatives \nof political parties, ethnic nationalities and other \nrepresentatives, took an active part in the National \n  \n \n08-53135 20 \n \nConvention process. The National Convention laid \ndown the fundamental principles to be enshrined in a \nnew constitution. Based on those principles, a new \nConstitution was drafted and was put to a nationwide \nreferendum last May. The people of Myanmar \noverwhelmingly approved the draft constitution. \n The fifth step of the road map, general elections, \nwill be taken in 2010. Necessary measures are being \nundertaken for the elections. All citizens, regardless of \npolitical affiliation, will have equal rights to form \npolitical parties and to conduct election campaigns. \nThe Government will make every effort to ensure that \nthe elections are free and fair. The international \ncommunity can best assist Myanmar\u2019s democratization \nprocess by respecting the will of its people, expressed \nin the recent referendum. \n The daunting challenges of the twenty-first \ncentury can be addressed only through international \ncooperation. We can solve international problems of \neconomic, social, cultural or humanitarian character \nonly by working together. To do this, powerful \ncountries should refrain from practicing hegemonic \npolicies through either political or economic pressure. \n In the global village in which we live, mutual \nrespect, understanding and tolerance must be the \nvalues that we espouse. Let us work together to give \nour global village a peaceful and prosperous future. "

        "file_text": "Allow me \nfirst of all to congratulate Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann on his election as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-third session. He can count on the \nfull cooperation of the Togolese as he carries out his \nnoble task. We would also like to pay tribute to the \nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for the insight \nand determination which he has demonstrated in \nleading the Organization since taking up his post. \n At the high-level meeting on Africa\u2019s \ndevelopment needs, held here on 22 September, \n  \n \n08-53129 24 \n \nMember States noted that despite the efforts that have \nbeen made, the situation in Africa demands continued \nserious consideration by the international community \nin order to help Africa face up to the many challenges \nit faces. It was also stressed that the fight against \npoverty and the fight for sustainable development \ncannot succeed without considerable official \ndevelopment assistance and fairer trade between \nnations.  \n In that regard, it is unfortunate that the North-\nSouth dialogue has been exhausted, as evidenced by \nthe recent failure of the World Trade Organization \nnegotiations in Geneva. Indeed, while international \ntrade should become a tool for development, the \nbalance of global economic power, which was \nresponsible to a great degree for the dependence of \ncountries of the South on their partners in the North, \nwill continue to deteriorate. Most countries perceive \nglobalization as the status quo, which makes the \nobjectives of development and social justice even more \ndifficult to achieve. To think that, when the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) were adopted in 2000, \nmany of us were hopeful that they would be achieved. \nFor that reason we call upon the international \ncommunity, especially the countries of the North, to \nrespect the commitments made. \n We note with concern that today new and even \ngreater challenges are being added to the long list of \nthose which our States already face. The sharp rise in \nthe price of oil and other raw materials, as well as the \nincreasing demand for energy, along with the effects of \nthe global food and financial crises are among these \nnew challenges. \n The current food crisis will not fail to have \ncatastrophic consequences if aid to agriculture is not \nreviewed and increased; it is unfortunate that such \nassistance was cut by half between 1992 to 2000. It \nshould also be stressed that few resources have been \nallocated to agricultural infrastructure, to irrigation and \nto supplying water to the population. \n We venture to hope that the new partnership \nestablished on 4 June in Rome between the Alliance for \na Green Revolution in Africa, the United Nations, the \nFood and Agriculture Organization, the International \nFund for Agricultural Development and the World \nFood Programme will contribute to an appropriate \nresponse to the situation. \n Togo has suffered the negative effects of a long \npolitical and economic crisis. However, since President \nFaure Essozimna Gnassingb\u00e9\u2019s accession to power in \nMay 2005, the Togolese Government has sought \nsuitable solutions to the major concerns of the Togolese \npeople by implementing a pragmatic policy based on \nnational reconciliation, poverty reduction and \nstrengthening democracy and the rule of law. \n In that context, the head of State worked to \nconclude a comprehensive political agreement in \nAugust 2006, which was signed by the major political \nparties and which opened the way for the holding of \nlegislative elections in October 2007. There is little \nneed to remind members that those elections took place \nin a peaceful, transparent and safe environment. They \nled to the establishment of a broad-based Government \nand a pluralistic National Assembly, which shows the \ncommitment of the head of State to strengthen the \ndemocratization process in an atmosphere of \nunderstanding and national unity. \n We would like to take this opportunity to reiterate \nour thanks to the friendly countries and multilateral \npartners that have fully resumed their cooperation with \nTogo following the implementation of the agreements \nsigned. In order to consolidate that commitment \nprocess, the Togolese Government is working tirelessly \nto see through the institutional and constitutional \nreforms provided for by the comprehensive political \nagreement. \n In the legal field, it has undertaken to modernize \nthe justice system, so as to guarantee its independence. \nIn the same vein, national consultations aimed at \nestablishing a Truth, Justice and Reconciliation \nCommission were launched on 15 April 2008. The \nCommission will be charged with shedding light on \nacts of political violence committed in the past and \nfinding ways to compensate the victims. The results of \nthose consultations have just been submitted to the \nhead of State. \n Similarly, in its search for better strategies to \nfight corruption and improve good economic \ngovernance, Togo recently signed a memorandum of \nunderstanding with the African Peer Review \nMechanism, by which it agrees to submit to periodic \nreviews by the other members of the African Union \n(AU) and to be directed by the jointly adopted \nparameters for political, economic and financial \ngovernance in Africa. As part of the financial reform, \n \n \n25 08-53129 \n \nsoon the post of auditor-general and a national audit \noffice will be set up. A Government audit programme \nis in the process of being finalized. \n The torrential rainfall that struck our country last \nJuly sorely tested our Government\u2019s efforts. It led to \ncountless human injuries and material and financial \nlosses, including the collapse of a dozen bridges, the \nflooding of railways and the destruction of roads, \nvillages and fields. That disaster, the second of its kind \nin a year, makes it very difficult to move from region \nto region. \n The solidarity shown to our country enabled us to \nassist the affected and to start rebuilding some of the \ninfrastructure. Here, I should like to express our deep \ngratitude to Ghana, Benin, France, China, the United \nStates of America, Brazil and all the other countries, \norganizations and institutions that helped us. \n As members can see, in spite of our efforts the \noverall situation in our country is far from satisfactory. \nTherefore, our country deserves more substantial \nsupport. In that regard, the positive results of the Togo \nDevelopment Partners Conference, held in Brussels on \n18 and 19 September, leads us to hope that the \ninternational community is ready to play a decisive \nrole in assisting our country to get back on its feet. \n We would like once again to express our \nprofound thanks to all those who contributed to the \nsuccess of that conference, in particular the European \nUnion, France, Germany, the United States of America, \nPortugal, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, the Niger, the World \nBank, the International Monetary Fund, the Islamic \nDevelopment Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the \nCentral Bank of West African States, the Economic \nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) and the \nWest African Economic and Monetary Union. \n For decades, Togolese diplomacy has worked to \nstrengthen friendship and cooperation among States \nand peoples. Thus, at both the bilateral and the \nmultilateral levels, Togo has always done its utmost to \nachieve the peaceful settlement of disputes with the \npurpose of maintaining peace and stability wherever \nthreatened. Those actions, undertaken through dialogue \nand consultation, are part of the efforts made by \nAfrican countries to ensure better living conditions for \ntheir populations. Togo believes that dialogue and \nconsultation must be the preferred ways to settle \nethnic, religious or territorial disputes, which are true \nobstacles to harmonious coexistence among States and \npeoples. \n Along those lines, it must be recalled that the \nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict, which is at the core of the \npolitical and security problems in the Middle East, \ncontinues to be the focus of the highest concern for the \ninternational community. In order to promote peace \nand stability in that region, the international \ncommunity must make a greater effort to find a just \nand lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians. \n In that regard, Togo welcomes the ongoing \ndialogue between the parties and hopes that the various \ninitiatives will lead to a comprehensive solution, based \non the principle of two States, Israeli and Palestinian, \nliving within secure and internationally recognized \nborders. \n Afghanistan and Iraq, which are experiencing a \nmajor lack of security, deserve special attention. We \ntherefore call on the international community to \nincrease its assistance to the Governments of those \ncountries in their fight against terrorism, so as to \npromote peace and reconstruction. \n In Africa, while it is true that glimmers of hope \nare to be seen in the settlement of crises, one cannot \nbut condemn situations such as those persisting in \nDarfur and Somalia. We call on the various actors to \ndemonstrate more courage and political will to get out \nof the vicious circle of violence and, thus, give peace a \nchance. \n Because of the orientation of its foreign policy, \nthe Togolese Government endorses all initiatives aimed \nat preventing, fighting and eliminating the causes of \nconflict, in particular the trafficking of and illegal trade \nin small arms. For that reason, it did not hesitate to \nsupport the proposal to draft and adopt a binding \ninternational instrument on the trade in small arms. \nAlong those same lines, Togo was involved in activities \nlinked to promoting and safeguarding international \npeace and security, as demonstrated by its participation \nin the various peacekeeping operations of the United \nNations, the African Union and ECOWAS. \n Today more than ever, the world needs security \nand peace in order to devote its energies to eliminating \nhunger, illiteracy and disease. To that end, it is more \nurgent than ever to make concerted efforts to fight \ninequality, injustice and exclusion. \n  \n \n08-53129 26 \n \n In our respective countries, we must build \nsocieties where humanism and solidarity will reign in \npeace and security. We believe that that is one of the \npurposes of the founders of the United Nations and \nwhich we must strive to achieve now, at the beginning \nof the twenty-first century. "

        "file_text": "It is an honour for me, as \nPresident of the Republic of Sierra Leone, to deliver \nmy first speech to this Assembly. I wish to congratulate \nMr. D\u2019Escoto Brockmann on his assumption of the \nhigh office of President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-third session, and to assure him of Sierra Leone\u2019s \nsupport and cooperation as he undertakes the \nchallenging responsibility of presiding over our \ndeliberations during this session. I should also like to \nexpress my gratitude to his predecessor for the efficient \nway in which he guided the Assembly during its last \nsession. \n The sacred duty of this Organization to save \nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war was \ntested in fire in Sierra Leone, but today my country \ndemonstrates what the United Nations can achieve \nwhen its Members work closely together. The people of \nSierra Leone know the value and relevance of the \nUnited Nations and appreciate its continuing support as \nwe reconstruct our society from war to peace and work \nwith determination to build a better future. \n \n \n25 08-51845 \n \n The theme for this general debate, \u201cThe impact of \nthe global food crisis on poverty and hunger in the \nworld as well as the need to democratize the United \nNations\u201d, is important and timely. Africa has a \ndisproportionate share of the world\u2019s poor and hungry, \nand the need for urgent and concerted action is \ncompelling. The rising cost of food has had a negative \nimpact on our resources and poses a threat to our \nnational stability and the stability of other countries in \nWest Africa. It is vital that Africa increase food \nproductivity and achieve food self-sufficiency. African \nfarmers need to adopt higher-yielding land practices, \nwith increased use of seeds, fertilizers and irrigation. \n In that connection, we welcome the work of the \nAlliance for a Green Revolution in Africa, chaired by \nformer Secretary-General Kofi Annan. The Alliance \nrecognizes that massive investment in agriculture is the \nkey to a long-term solution to the continent\u2019s food \ncrisis. That will enable Africans to grow enough of \ntheir own food and become less dependent on handouts \nfrom donors. Sierra Leone, like many other countries \nin Africa, is suitably positioned to benefit from such \ninvestment because of its vast arable land, abundant \nwater resources and the fact that over 70 per cent of its \npopulation is engaged in farming or farming-related \nactivities. If that problem is going to be resolved, it is \nessential to end the agricultural subsidies and trade \nbarriers that impoverish African farmers. \n I have had the privilege to coordinate the African \nUnion committee of 10 heads of State and Government \ncharged with the mandate to promote the African \nCommon Position on the Reform of the United \nNations. In that capacity, and as Head of State of Sierra \nLeone, I welcome the theme \u201cthe need to democratize \nthe United Nations\u201d as part of this year\u2019s work of the \nGeneral Assembly. \n The need to democratize and reform the \nOrganization is of vital importance. However, reform is \nnot an end in itself but a means to an end. We support a \nstrong and effective United Nations that can meet the \never-increasing and complex array of challenges in the \ntwenty-first century. We are convinced that a more \nrepresentative and effective United Nations will \nstrengthen the loyalty and commitment of Member \nStates and make the Organization more responsive to \nthe needs of our time. \n It should be recognized that reform efforts have \nachieved some modest successes. However, one of the \nmost critical and urgent issues on our current reform \nagenda \u2014 reform of the Security Council \u2014 remains \nunresolved. We need to make the Security Council \nmore representative of today\u2019s realities. The current \ncomposition of the Security Council contradicts basic \nprinciples of democratic representation. Africa has \noutlined its collective position in the Ezulwini \nConsensus. Africa will negotiate in good faith, and we \nexpect others to do the same in the best interest of the \nOrganization. The status quo is not an option. Africa, \nwith 53 countries constituting about a quarter of the \nUnited Nations membership, deserves permanent \nrepresentation in the Security Council. We believe that \nthe Security Council should be enlarged sooner rather \nthan later. \n The United Nations has had an important role in \nglobal peace and the development of justice. Sierra \nLeone\u2019s peace and stability are due largely to United \nNations peacekeeping, a visible and an important \naspect of the Organization\u2019s work. The Peacebuilding \nCommission, the Peacebuilding Fund and other United \nNations agencies are helping us in critical ways to \nachieve our development priorities and to meet the \nchallenges of post-conflict reconstruction. \n The United Nations-backed Special Court for \nSierra Leone and the Truth and Reconciliation \nCommission have made extraordinary contributions to \nestablishing the rule of law and fighting against \nimpunity so that the people of Sierra Leone can put \ntheir tragic past behind them and look forward to the \nfuture. Without reconciliation, tolerance and the rule of \nlaw, there will be no true and lasting peace. \n The Special Court has established legal principles \nthat will endure beyond its anticipated closure in 2010. \nI want to commend the efforts of the Special Court to \nengage both my Government and the international \njustice community in making preparations for any \nresidual issues that might remain following its closure. \nThe facilities of the Special Court in the heart of our \nhistoric capital, Freetown, will be inherited by Sierra \nLeone, and we will explore the best possible use for \nthem. \n In recent years, Sierra Leone has made real \nprogress in consolidating democracy and good \ngovernance by conducting successive free, fair and \nnon-violent presidential, parliamentary and local \nGovernment elections. We are on the right path. On \nbehalf of all Sierra Leoneans, I would like to thank \n  \n \n08-51845 26 \n \nmembers of the international community for their \ninvaluable contribution to our electoral process, and \nparticularly for their logistical and technical support \nthat enabled the various institutions to perform their \nrespective tasks. \n But we are the first to acknowledge that much \nmore needs to be done to achieve sustainable peace and \ndevelopment. War and deadly conflicts have social and \neconomic consequences long after the fighting has \nended. A peaceful country requires more than the \nabsence of war. Development remains the foremost \nneed of all Sierra Leoneans. Moreover, it is the \nfoundation of security, and it makes political rights \nmeaningful.  \n One can be secure only if one has food, shelter, \nclean water and protection from disease. That is why \nthe monumental task of poverty eradication is one of \nthe national priorities of my Government. My \nGovernment is completing a second-generation poverty \nreduction strategy to guide us in the process. We have \nalso developed a comprehensive strategy for the \nnation\u2019s development over the next five years, called \nthe Agenda for Change. The Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) are also central to our work. Despite the \nenormous difficulties on the development front and in \nachieving the MDGs, we are resolved to improve the \nlives of our people and to respond constructively to \ntheir needs and aspirations. International support \nremains crucial, however, if we are to consolidate hard-\nwon gains. It is our hope that the United Nations and \nother development partners will continue to be our \nsteadfast allies in our ongoing struggle for economic \nprogress and development. \n The mission of the United Nations \u2014 to serve the \ncause of peace, to advance development and to protect \nthe human rights of all \u2014 is more important than ever. \nThe United Nations is a unique forum where the weak \nand the strong, the poor and the prosperous can have \ntheir voices heard. Sierra Leone reaffirms its \ncommitment to the ideals and principles of the United \nNations and will continue to be a constructive partner \nand member of this Organization. "

        "file_text": "I should \nlike to begin by congratulating you, Sir, on your \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-third session.  \n \n \n13 08-51606 \n \n I should also like in particular to thank Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for the excellent report he has \nprepared on the activities of the Organization in the \npast year (A/63/1), as well as for his concern in \nensuring that the issues of Lebanon are at the centre of \ndebate. In its close pursuit of the situation in Lebanon, \nthe United Nations has established the foundations and \nprinciples necessary to face the crises and challenges \nthat have undermined the stability and prosperity of \nour country. I would like to note in particular the role \nof the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon \n(UNIFIL) and pay tribute to the sacrifices of its \npersonnel. I note also that in his report the Secretary-\nGeneral notes that there is strong cooperation between \nUNIFIL and the Lebanese army. I would like to \nconfirm that Lebanon cares a great deal about the \nsecurity and safety of those troops, especially vis-\u00e0-vis \nthe terrorist attacks of which they have been the target. \n Lebanon is the cradle of an ancient civilization. \nIts peace-loving people set sail from their shores \ntowards the European continent, carrying with them \nelements of an advanced alphabet and spreading in the \nMediterranean realm and whatever horizons they were \nable to open the spirit of communication, dialogue, and \nfree exchange. \n Lebanon, which believes in human and cultural \nvalues, is one of the oldest parliamentary democracies \nin the Middle East. Its constitution of 1926 embraces \nfreedom of opinion, freedom of belief and justice and \nrejects confessionalism and fanaticism. In its \nendeavour to put this democracy into practice, our \nnation experienced a distinctive alternation of power \ndespite all the crises, aggression and wars it has \nknown. Today, our country is preparing for new \nparliamentary elections. \n The young Lebanese nation that emerged in 1943, \nhowever, suffered from the aftermath of the catastrophe \nthat befell Palestine in 1948. It has received on its \nnarrow territory hundreds of thousands of Palestinian \nrefugees. Since the late sixties, it has been subject to \ntwo large-scale Israeli invasions and to a series of \nIsraeli devastating attacks that wreaked havoc in terms \nof lives, property and infrastructure. The records kept \nby this Organization bear witness to that brutality.  \n I recall the two massacres of Qana that were \nperpetrated against innocent children, women and the \nelderly, as well as the aggression of July 2006 in which \ntens of thousands were killed and wounded and \ndisplaced which led to the destruction of bridges and \ncivilian facilities in various parts of the country. The \nIsraeli bombardment of the Jiyeh power plant and its \nfuel storage tanks caused an environmental catastrophe \nresulting from an oil slick along the Lebanese \ncoastline. That prompted the General Assembly of the \nUnited Nations to request Israel to provide immediate \nand adequate compensation to Lebanon for the damage \nand pollution it caused. Israel must pay due \ncompensation for the full damage it caused through its \nrepeated aggression against Lebanon. \n The United Nations has not hesitated to shoulder \nits responsibilities towards Lebanon. The Organization \nissued a series of resolutions in support of Lebanon\u2019s \nindependence, sovereignty, unity and territorial \nintegrity, notably Security Council resolutions 425 \n(1978), which called for an immediate and \nunconditional Israeli withdrawal from all Lebanese \nterritory, and 1701 (2006), which \u201ccalls upon the \nGovernment of Israel ... to withdraw all of its forces \nfrom southern Lebanon\u201d. Lebanon reiterates its \ncommitment to the full content of that resolution. \n Mr. Ya\u00f1ez-Barnuevo (Spain), Vice-President, took \nthe Chair. \n However, the intransigence of Israel and its \nfailure to comply with the will of the United Nations \nSecurity Council pushed Lebanon to adopt, in \nconjunction with diplomacy, other legitimate options. \nIn 2000, thanks to its people, army and resistance, \nLebanon was able to force Israel to withdraw from \nmost of the Lebanese territory that it occupied. This \nyear, successful efforts were made, with the help of the \nUnited Nations, to complete the liberation of the \nLebanese prisoners and detainees from Israeli prisons. \n Despite these achievements and its continued \ncommitment to the resolutions of international \nlegitimacy, Lebanon still faces a host of urgent risks \nand challenges that require the following. \n First, the international community should compel \nIsrael to fully implement resolution 1701 (2006) and \nstop its serious threats to launch a new war against \nLebanon. Such threats are acts of aggression that \nadversely affect the Lebanese State, the national \neconomy and civil society. \n The second challenge is the recovery or liberation \nof the remaining occupied Lebanese territory in Shabaa \nFarms, the hills of Kfarshuba and the northern part of \n  \n \n08-51606 14 \n \nthe village of Al-Ghajar, and the upholding of our \nrights to our water. \n Thirdly, Israel must be forced to stop its \nextensive air breaches of Lebanon\u2019s sovereignty. In its \nmost recent briefing to the Security Council, the \nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations confirmed the \nprovocative nature of those actions. \n Fourthly, we must obtain all the maps of \nlandmines and cluster-bomb sites left behind by Israel \non Lebanese soil. Their presence constitutes a direct \nthreat to the civilian population, especially children. It \ndeprives farmers and families of their livelihood and \nprevents them from cultivating their land. The States \nconcerned are therefore called upon to meet their \npledges to provide the necessary resources for \ndemining declustering programmes. \n Fifthly, we need to confront terrorism in all its \nforms and to maintain internal civic peace. The \nLebanese army and the internal security forces have \nbeen subjected to brutal attacks by terrorist groups in \nrecent years. They were forced to confront such \nterrorist groups and make costly and huge sacrifices to \ndefend the dignity of the Lebanese people and their \nsecurity and stability. In their efforts to combat Israeli \nterrorist operations, the Lebanese security services \nmanaged to arrest the head of an Israeli network that \ncarried out espionage and assassination operations on \nLebanese soil. \n The sixth challenge is to develop a \ncomprehensive national strategy to protect and defend \nLebanon, which would be adopted and coordinated \nthrough genuine national dialogue, which we held on \n16 September. That is in accord with the Doha \nAgreement, which is based on the sincere will for \nnational reconciliation and on extending the authority \nof the Lebanese State over all of its territory. \n On this occasion, Lebanon reiterates its \ncommitment to the international tribunal established \nunder Security Council resolution 1757 (2007) to \ninvestigate the crime of the assassination of martyr \nPrime Minister Rafik Hariri and his companions. \nLebanon is cooperating with the relevant organs of the \nUnited Nations to bring the truth to light and to achieve \nthe process of justice away from any politicization. \n Lebanon closely follows the developments of the \nsituation in the Middle East. In view of its commitment \nto just Arab causes, especially the cause of Palestine, \nLebanon reiterates its commitment to the process of \nachieving a just and comprehensive peace in the region \nand to the Arab peace initiative that was unanimously \nadopted by Arab leaders at the 2002 Beirut Summit. \nHaving said that, Lebanon stresses the need for Israel \nto withdraw from all Arab territories that are still under \noccupation and stresses the inalienable right of the \nPalestinian people to return to their land and to \nestablish their independent State on their national soil. \n We call on the international community to assume \nits full responsibilities to provide the necessary \nfinancial resources to the United Nations Relief and \nWorks Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East \n(UNRWA) and to support the work carried out by the \nLebanese State in this area, until a just solution to the \nPalestinian problem is found. \n From this rostrum, Lebanon cannot but draw the \nattention of the international community once again to \nits absolute rejection of any form of resettlement of the \nPalestinian refugees on its territory, for the following \nmain reasons. \n First, the resettlement of the Palestinian refugees \nin Lebanon runs counter to their right to return to their \nhomeland and homes, which is reaffirmed by the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and the \nrelevant United Nations resolutions. \n Secondly, it is difficult for a small country like \nLebanon, with limited resources and a population \nbelow 4 million people, to provide a decent livelihood \nfor more than 400,000 Palestinian refugees on its \nterritory at a time when large segments of the Lebanese \npeople are emigrating in search of their own \nlivelihoods. \n Thirdly, the resettlement of Palestinian refugees \nis explicitly rejected in the preamble to the Lebanese \nConstitution, and by the Taif Agreement, which has \nbeen recognized and enshrined by resolutions of the \nUnited Nations and constitutes a key element of \nconsensus in Lebanon. \n While the issue of Lebanon is at the centre of \nattention of the United Nations, the agenda of our \nGeneral Assembly is full of items and of political, \neconomic, social and environmental topics that are still \nwaiting for a comprehensive solution. In that context, \nLebanon interacts in a special way with the needs and \naspirations of the African continent, where hundreds of \nthousands of Lebanese citizens have been living on its \n \n \n15 08-51606 \n \ngenerous soil for over a century, contributing to \nAfrica\u2019s prosperity and development under difficult \ncircumstances. Accordingly, we support the political \ndeclaration issued yesterday at the high-level meeting \non Africa\u2019s development needs. We therefore believe \nthat a major international effort should be undertaken \nto finance programmes to combat poverty, disease and \nilliteracy as a means to preserve human dignity and to \nprevent further armed conflicts on that continent. \n Similarly, we hope that a more effective project \nto build solidarity in the face of natural disasters will \nbe quickly and efficiently finalized in view of the \nincreasing risks arising from climate change, global \nwarming, environmental degradation and the spread of \nwildfires in forests and green spaces. \n Deeply rooted in history and, with the rise of \nnationalist movements, a contributor to the shaping of \nthe Arab renaissance at the political, cultural, \nintellectual and social levels, as well as a founding \nmember of the League of Arab States, Lebanon is \ndevoted to preserving Arab solidarity. In that context, \nwe need to revisit the concept of cooperation and good-\nneighbourliness between countries to consolidate peace \nand solidarity in the world. That approach will \ncontribute to preserving human rights, and humanity \nwill thus be able to prevent other world wars, regional \nconflicts and the transnational phenomenon of \nterrorism, as well as upheavals in our globalized \neconomies, global crises and food crises. All of those \nmatters represent major threats that could spark new \nwars that might spill over onto the regional level and \nfrom one continent to the next.  \n We need to push for United Nations reform in \norder to meet that new international challenge. \nLebanon is extremely pleased to announce that we \nhave been nominated once again to a non-permanent \nseat on the Security Council for the biennium 2010-\n2011. We are of course committed to making a positive \nand constructive contribution to the Council and hope \nthat we will have the support of all friendly and \nbrotherly States.  \n Lebanon\u2019s philosophy has been based on dialogue \nand coexistence from the day its citizens approved the \nNational Covenant in 1943, and subsequently when \nthey approved the 1989 National Reconciliation \nAgreement in Taif. Those themes were also repeatedly \nstressed in the 2008 Doha agreement. In the face of \nworsening international conflicts that herald a potential \nclash of civilizations, Lebanon might well represent a \nneeded international example as a living laboratory of \ndialogue of cultures and religions. \n In his Apostolic Letter of 1989, His Holiness the \nlate Pope John Paul II described Lebanon as \u201cmore \nthan a country; it is a message of freedom and a model \nof pluralism for both the East and the West\u201d. Moreover, \nin his homily delivered during his apostolic journey to \nLebanon in 1997, John Paul II characterized Lebanon \nas \u201ca country of many religious faiths, [which] has \nshown that these different faiths can live together in \npeace, brotherhood and cooperation\u201d. With 18 different \nsects coexisting on its soil, and having successfully \npreserved its democratic system and fundamental \nfreedoms in spite of all sorts of challenges, Lebanon \naspires today to become an international centre for the \nmanagement of dialogue of civilizations and cultures, \nhoping that the forces of good in the world will prevail \nand that we can be constructive in our efforts to reach a \njust and comprehensive solution to all aspects of the \nconflict in the Middle East as soon as possible."

        "file_text": "At \nthe outset, I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on \nyour election to the post of President of the General \nAssembly and wish the work of the sixty-third session \nevery success under your guidance. I should like to \nexpress deep gratitude to Srgjan Kerim for successfully \nsteering the work of the Assembly\u2019s previous session. \n Today, the role of the United Nations as the \nuniversal international forum that can make an \nimportant contribution to strengthening international \npeace and security is seen as increasingly important. \nThe high-level plenary meeting on Africa\u2019s \ndevelopment needs and the high-level event on the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) gave us every \nreason to believe that joint efforts can generate \nappropriate measures for existing crises and this \nsession of the General Assembly will serve as an \nadditional contribution towards achieving the MDGs. \n In today\u2019s conditions, when there are rapid \nchanges worldwide, enhancing the role of the United \nNations and the effectiveness of its work is \nincreasingly important. Further strengthening the \nauthority and potential of the Organization in the \npresent situation requires that we pursue reform of the \nentire United Nations system, so that it can, above all, \nact as the guarantor of international peace and security \nand also effectively and flexibly respond to existing \nproblems. \n For us, the most important issue is strengthening \nthe Security Council in the cause of preserving \ninternational law and order and tranquillity. In \nadvocating expansion of Council membership and, the \nenhancement of its working methods, the Kyrgyz \nRepublic believes that Council reform must be based \non the principles of universality, effectiveness and \nequitable geographic representation.  \n For its part, the Kyrgyz Republic will continue to \ncontribute as much as it can to maintaining peace and \nsecurity. In that regard, we would like to reaffirm that \nfor the first time our country has put forth its \ncandidacy for a non-permanent seat on the Security \nCouncil for the term 2012 and 2013. Realizing the true \nbreadth of responsibilities of members in that key body \nof the United Nations, the Kyrgyz Republic will do its \nutmost to address global problems. \n The rapid changes taking place in the world have \nnot bypassed the Kyrgyz Republic. Such challenges as \nclimate change and the food and energy crises have \nhighlighted the extreme importance of collective \nefforts, both regional and global. Such circumstances \nclearly heighten the role of the United Nations and \nother, regional organizations in consolidating efforts to \nwork out effective mechanisms for preventing and \nresponding to challenges and threats. \n As is known, the water resources of Central Asia \ncome from the high alpine glaciers and snowfields in \nKyrgyzstan. However, at the beginning of this year we \nwere already encountering the consequences of \nwarming and of a period of water scarcity, which \nnegatively impacted the delivery of electricity to both \ndomestic and external markets. The environmental \nsituation is also aggravated by the fact that in our \ncountry earthquakes, landslides and flooding have \nrecurred in recent years and in such conditions the fact \nthat our country has a considerable number of storage \nsites for radioactive waste poses a serious threat not \nonly to national, but also to regional security.  \n As international experience demonstrates, peace \nand security cannot be maintained without establishing \nthe elementary conditions that are necessary for a \ndecent existence. In order to achieve security and \ndevelopment goals simultaneously, the international \ncommunity must pursue a more balanced policy. \nParticular attention should consistently be given to \nissues of law and order in society. \n From this rostrum, I would like to thank all \nUnited Nations Member countries for their unanimous \nsupport for the initiative of the President of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic, Kurmanbek Bakiev, on declaring 20 February \nas World Day of Social Justice. The pursuit of policies \nof social justice is aimed at sustainable development of \nthe human potential and at enhancing the interaction of \nStates in order to eradicate poverty, achieve gender \nbalance and to address migration issues. \n We are grateful to Member States for their \nsupport at the previous Assembly session for resolution \n62/196, on sustainable mountain development, under \nwhich Bishkek will hold the second Global Mountain \nSummit in October 2009 to assess the activities of the \ninternational community with respect to sustainable \nmountain development. I take this opportunity to \nreiterate our invitation to interested countries to take \npart in that international forum, and also to express the \n  \n \n08-53135 32 \n \nhope that Members will provide active support to that \ninitiative of the international community.  \n I would like to touch upon several issues that are \nat the centre of attention for the delegation of the \nKyrgyz Republic. Most unfortunately, there are still \nradioactive waste storage sites in the Kyrgyz Republic. \nProperly maintaining them and preventing a regional \nenvironmental disaster stand high on the agenda. We \nare grateful to the United Nations Development \nProgramme, which has seriously paid attention to the \nneed to solve that problem. I am confident that at the \ninternational forum on resolving issues of the storage \nof uranium tailings, to be held in Bishkek this autumn, \nthe international community, under the United Nations \ncoordinating role, will take effective measures, \nincluding financial and technical assistance, aimed at \nensuring their security. \n We would also like to express firm support for \nthe establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in \nCentral Asia, since that would contribute to \nstrengthening global and regional security. In that \nregard, we hope to receive the broad support of the \ninternational community for the related draft resolution \nat this Assembly session. \n In conclusion, I would like to note that the \ninternational community is going through a complex \nperiod. Member States must reaffirm their readiness to \nseek practical solutions to the most pressing problems \nof our time. The international community rightfully \nexpects that we all will work out effective measures to \nstrengthen the United Nations in order to find ways to \nresolve the challenges of the new millennium. \nTherefore, we need to do our utmost, so that the \ncurrent session of the General Assembly will be \nremembered as a session of reform.

        "file_text": "Sixty-three years \nafter its formation, the United Nations remains the \nworld\u2019s central international body. Only here do all \ncountries come together to devise solutions and to \nforge collective action on global challenges. And these \nare particularly challenging times. As the Secretary-\nGeneral and many others have noted, we are facing a \nglobal financial crisis, a global energy crisis and a \nglobal food crisis. More than ever before, we are an \ninterconnected and interdependent world community. \nThe Charter goals of peace and prosperity require the \nfull support of all United Nations Members. New \nZealand was a founding member in 1945, and our \ncommitment to this body is as strong now as it was \nthen. \n At such a difficult time in the world we need \nleadership, courage and a recommitment of our \nresources to tackle the issues before us. When the food \ncrisis was first in the headlines, the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s High-Level Task Force provided a \nmechanism for us all to respond. Having contributed \nnearly $NZ 10 million to date, New Zealand is among \nthose assisting with urgent food security needs and \nmedium-term policy responses. A successful \nconclusion of the Doha Development Round would \nalleviate much of the pressure on the demand-supply \nimbalance. \n On the development theme of this sixty-third \nsession, New Zealand fully associates with the \nMillennium Development Goal (MDG) Global Call to \nAction Campaign. Support is urgently needed to \nrevitalize collective efforts, including developing and \nstrengthening partnerships between traditional and new \ndonors, the private sector and civil society, and through \nSouth-South cooperation. We are set to play our part. \n New Zealand is significantly stepping up official \ndevelopment assistance (ODA) from 0.27 per cent of \ngross national income in 2007 to 0.35 per cent by \n2010-2011. That 62 per cent increase will take New \nZealand aid to over $NZ 600 million. \n We are acutely aware that the Pacific is the \nsecond region after sub-Saharan Africa that is least \nlikely to meet the MDG targets. We are therefore \nlooking to direct our increased ODA there, through a \nPacific strategy, which focuses poverty reduction \nefforts around four key pillars: strengthening \ngovernance, achieving broader-based growth and \nsustainable livelihoods, improving health and \neducation, and reducing vulnerabilities, including to \nclimate change. \n In these challenging times, we look to the United \nNations to deliver effectively for development, for \npeace and security and on human rights. Our \nOrganization must continue to evolve along with the \nchanging demands on it. Momentum needs to be \nmaintained in the modernization of the United Nations. \nWe share the Secretary-General\u2019s vision for that and \nsupport his proposals to fix the human resources \nmanagement system, which he has characterized as \ndysfunctional. \n I would now like to turn to the challenges of \npeace and security around the world, from which our \nown region is not immune. At the Pacific Islands \nForum held in Niue last month, New Zealand and other \nmembers of the Pacific Forum community expressed \nprofound disappointment at Fiji\u2019s lack of progress \ntowards restoring democratic government. The Forum \ncommuniqu\u00e9 urged the interim regime in Fiji to fulfil \n  \n \n08-53141 26 \n \nits promise to hold elections in accordance with Fiji\u2019s \nexisting constitution by March next year. Leaders also \nacknowledged that there were long-term issues to be \nresolved in Fiji and supported a Commonwealth-led \nindependent and inclusive political dialogue process to \naddress them. That will not only create a more \nconducive environment for elections, but also enable a \nnewly elected Government to engage with key \nstakeholders to promote national reconciliation. New \nZealand urges all United Nations Members to support \nthe steps taken by the Pacific Islands Forum to \nencourage Fiji to return to democratic and \nconstitutional government as soon as possible. \nMr. Nsengimana (Rwanda), Vice-President, took \nthe Chair. \n Our region is also home to Timor-Leste, a partner \nand friend of New Zealand. We are pleased to see \nencouraging progress since last year\u2019s elections, \nespecially the building of institutions and improving \ngovernance. That was achieved despite assassination \nattempts on Timor-Leste\u2019s leadership. The United \nNations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) \nand the International Stabilization Force continue to \nplay a valuable role in helping to maintain security. \nNew Zealand strongly supports the UNMIT mandate \nand its extension beyond February 2009. Planning for \nsecurity in the longer term, to ensure appropriately \nsized and resourced institutions with clearly delineated \nroles and responsibilities, is also a key issue, and we \nstand ready to help. \n Also within our region, the political, economic \nand human rights situation in Myanmar remains \ntroubling. We urge the Myanmar authorities to achieve \nnational reconciliation through open and constructive \ndialogue and to respect universal human rights in the \ncountry, consistent with international obligations. We \nsupport the efforts of the United Nations to sustain a \ndialogue with the Myanmar Government in order to \nbuild foundations for the future. \n On the African continent, the humanitarian \ndisaster caused by the conflict in Darfur is \nunacceptable. The targeting of civilians by State and \nnon-State parties, is a flagrant breach of international \nhuman rights law. The widespread absence of justice \nand accountability for such human rights violations and \nthe impunity that this promotes represent major \nobstacles to improving the human rights situation in \nDarfur. \n In the case of Zimbabwe, the recent \nannouncement of a power-sharing agreement offers \nhope that the long period of violent repression and \nhuman rights abuses by the previous Government can \nbe brought to a close. The international community \nwill be watching closely to see that all parties fulfil the \ncommitments that they have made to bring about \npeace, respect for political freedom and human rights \nand a Government which reflects the will of the \npeople. \n Let me turn now to the Middle East. New \nZealand continues to be strongly supportive of all \nattempts to find a lasting solution to the Arab-Israeli \nconflict. We share the international community\u2019s vision \nfor a viable and territorially contiguous Palestinian \nState, existing side by side in peace and security with \nthe State of Israel. \n In Afghanistan, despite political progress, the \noverall situation is fragile. The international \ncommunity needs to devote more resources to ending \nthe conflict and to assisting the people of Afghanistan \nin their efforts to stabilize and rebuild their country. \nNew Zealand has expressed a strong commitment to \nrestoring peace and security in Afghanistan with our \nassistance, both military and developmental, totalling \nmore than 160 million New Zealand dollars to date. \n Closer to home, New Zealand welcomes the \nrecent improvement in cross-Strait relations. Cross-\nStrait stability is vital to the security of the greater \nAsia-Pacific region. We encourage China and Taiwan \nto maintain the dialogue which has been established. \n New Zealand remains a strong supporter of \nefforts to protect and maintain the international rule of \nlaw. To that end, one of the most significant advances \nin recent times has been the establishment of the \nInternational Criminal Court (ICC). When the ICC was \nfirst established, it was widely considered to herald the \nbeginning of a new era in international criminal justice. \nThe Court has now reached a crucial stage in its \ndevelopment, and it has become clear that the \nestablishment of a global justice system brings with it \nmany challenges. It is of the utmost importance that \nStates rise to those challenges. To fail to do so would \nbe a betrayal of the victims of egregious crimes. New \nZealand urges States to make every effort to ensure the \nindependence and success of the Court. The Court \nneeds our full support and cooperation to ensure that \nindividuals responsible for the most serious violations \n \n \n27 08-53141 \n \nof international law are brought to justice without \ndelay. \n In this sixtieth anniversary year of the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights, we acknowledge the \nmany international human rights conventions that have \narisen out of that unique statement of overriding \nprinciples. New Zealand played an active part in the \ndesign of the new Human Rights Council, and we are \nseeking election to the Council next year, so as to be \nmore closely involved in its work. \n The newest member of the family of human \nrights treaties is the Convention on the Rights of \nPersons with Disabilities, which New Zealand ratified \nthis month. We look forward to the first conference of \nStates parties, and to the opportunity the Convention \noffers to make a real improvement in the lives and \nhuman rights of disabled people everywhere. \n Finally, let me reiterate the importance that New \nZealand attaches to the concept of the responsibility to \nprotect. The United Nations, through the Security \nCouncil, should be prepared to protect people against \nethnic cleansing, genocide, war crimes and crimes \nagainst humanity when national authorities fail to do \nso. There is a clear need to enhance early warning \nsystems to enable the Council to act in a timely \nmanner. We look forward to the report of the Secretary-\nGeneral on the responsibility to protect, and we stand \nready to help to take that important initiative forward. \n As we look forward to the year ahead, New \nZealand pledges to work actively with others in our \ncollective stewardship of the United Nations. We shall \nplay our part in the continuing, patient process of \nrenewing our Organization and of making it more \nresilient and responsive. "

        "file_text": "The \nsixty-third session of the General Assembly is taking \nplace against the backdrop of various international and \nregional events and developments that are closely \nlinked to the peace and security of all humankind. \nAmong those are the global food crisis, the increase in \nenergy prices, global warming and climate change and \ntheir negative and catastrophic repercussions for the \nentire world, the global economic downturn that is \nbordering on being a worldwide recession, the sharp \nglobal increase in poverty, our diminishing collective \nability to achieve the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs), the rising rate of infection with HIV, malaria \nand other deadly diseases, and the fight against \nterrorism. Egypt believes that all those challenges, as \nwell as others, are high priorities on the international \nagenda. Their diagnosis and treatment require a \nconcerted international effort. We must all be fully \naware that jointly overcoming those problems depends \nupon our collective diagnosis and our united stand in \naddressing them. \n We need a new approach, vision and \nmethodology to deal with global problems. \nUnfortunately, the existing frameworks have proven \nincapable of dealing successfully and effectively with \nthe challenges under consideration. As an example, \nEgypt believes that the global food and energy crises \nrequire serious dialogue between importers and \nexporters of energy and food. President Mubarak called \nfor such a dialogue at the recent African Union Summit \nand at the Rome meeting of the Food and Agriculture \nOrganization (FAO).  \n The channels currently available for addressing \nand resolving the problems of food and energy are at \nodds with each another, to say nothing of the fact that \nnone of them can provide for a genuine and meaningful \ndialogue between importers and exporters. It was for \nthat reason that President Mubarak was keenly \ninterested in participating effectively in the emergency \nsummit convened by FAO, to which I have referred, on \nthe question of the rising price and availability of \nfoodstuffs.  \n Along the same lines, President Mubarak has \nstrongly supported the African endeavour to adopt a \nclear strategy to tackle that phenomenon. In turn, that \nled to the adoption of the Sharm el-Sheikh declaration \nat the last African Union Summit, which contains \nAfrica\u2019s comprehensive vision for addressing the \nmatter. Egypt has also supported the strategy put \nforward by the Secretary-General to deal with the \nissue. We have also called for utilizing that strategy as \nthe basis for more effective international action. \n In an effort to translate the growing international \nconcern into an integrated plan of action to address that \nphenomenon, Chile, Indonesia and Egypt have \nproposed that that question and its repercussions \nshould be a main theme at this session of the General \nAssembly. In that connection, I would like to thank the \nPresident for his positive response to our initiative and \nalso for including the issue of strengthening \ninternational democratic action at the United Nations. \n By the same token, urgently establishing \ncollective international political will is necessary to \ndeal with climate change. As one of the countries \nvulnerable to the repercussions of that phenomenon, \nEgypt is acutely aware of its gravity. While reiterating \nour full support for the Bali Plan of Action and Road \nMap, we call for focused international attention on the \nissue of categorizing low-lying coastlines, which \napplies to Egypt. A list of the States most vulnerable to \nclimate change is needed so the United Nations and the \ninternational community can provide them with the \nnecessary support as a matter of priority, including \ntechnological and financial support. \n Based on our belief in globally addressing those \nurgent economic challenges, Egypt and Norway are \nfacilitating the current negotiations at the United \nNations on the final document of the Review \nConference on the Implementation of the Monterrey \nConsensus on Financing for Development. The goal is \nto amend the international development agenda for the \nupcoming stage, while taking into consideration the \n A/63/PV.13\n \n9 08-53122 \n \nagreements reached in all the international meetings \nand conferences held thus far. \n Egypt believes that using language that implies \ndouble standards is an affront to human rights. Despite \nthe fact that everyone is adamant in declaring that \nhuman rights constitute an indivisible whole, the \nreality, which we need to change, is that economic, \nsocial and cultural rights are not, unfortunately, \naccorded the same attention as civil and political \nrights. That adversely affects public perception in \nmany of our societies, in particular those that face dire, \nand occasionally destructive, economic and living \nconditions. For such people, talking incessantly about \nhuman rights is a luxury they cannot afford, and results \nin the neglect of their basic requirements for \nsustenance. The promotion of economic and social \nrights must therefore be viewed as crucial to \nstrengthening the human rights regime, which is \nessential to promoting the awareness and practice of \nthe components of that regime. \n In that regard, I wish to discuss the important \nquestion of using the concept of freedom of expression \nto incite hatred based on religion. With the utmost \nrespect for the value and importance of freedom of \nexpression, I emphasize that we reject repeated affronts \nto religions and holy symbols being portrayed as a \nlegitimate exercise of freedom of expression: there are \nmany glaring slogans in whose name crimes have been \ncommitted against thousands and millions of people by \noffending them and their religious beliefs. Egypt calls \nupon everybody to consider this matter judiciously and \nobjectively with a view to striking the proper balance \nthat protects freedom of expression while respecting \nthe rights and sentiments of all. Egypt will continue to \nseek such a balance, with the aim of reaching a \nconsensus on the content of draft United Nations \nresolutions on this matter. \n Here, I wish to convey to the Assembly that we \nare concerned by the unconstructive cultural friction \nthat the world is witnessing, which causes severe \ndivergence in opinion and action; this in turn inflames \npublic emotions and increases the nature and severity \nof the polarization and confrontation between the \nfollowers of different cultures and creeds. This matter \nmust not be ignored. \n The international community\u2019s approach to \ndisarmament, arms control and non-proliferation is \nmarred by defects, double standards and regression. \nThis is a matter of concern for us. Egypt has always \nshown great interest in these matters, as best embodied \nin Egypt\u2019s call to rid the Middle East of all weapons of \nmass destruction. Our interest in this matter is based on \nour unwavering belief that security and military \nbalance, especially in conflict areas, contributes to \nlaying solid foundations for peace between countries \nand peoples. \n However, achieving genuine peace and security \nin any region requires, among other things, the \nestablishment of just and parallel international and \nregional mechanisms in the areas of disarmament, arms \ncontrol and non-proliferation. It is notable that, \nunfortunately, prominent members of the international \ncommunity are unduly lax regarding Israel\u2019s nuclear \ncapability and the extent to which this constantly \nthreatens the security of the Middle East. This occurs \nas attempts are being made to enhance the obligations \nincluded in international mechanisms without paying \nattention to the issue of achieving the universality of \nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons and subjecting all nuclear facilities in the \nMiddle East to the comprehensive safeguards system of \nthe International Atomic Energy Agency. \n Egypt will nonetheless persist in its endeavours, \nthrough existing mechanisms and forums and in \ncoordination with friendly States that understand the \nreality and danger of the situation, in order to change it \nand to warn of the danger that failing to achieve \nuniversality for the NPT in the Middle East would \nentail. \n In my statement today, I have given precedence \nto international over regional issues. This in no way \ndiminishes the significance of crises, problems and \ndifficulties at the regional level. Rather, it reaffirms the \nimportance that Egypt attaches to the international \nsituation and international problems in general. \n At the regional level, as members know, Egypt is \npersistently involved in painstaking efforts to keep \nopen a window of hope that would allow the \nPalestinians to achieve their legitimate ambition to \ngain an independent State on the Palestinian territories \noccupied on 5 June 1967, with East Jerusalem as its \ncapital. The current situation, thanks to the efforts of \nthe United States, might suggest to some that there is \nhope for a real settlement between the Israelis and \nPalestinians before the end of the year. However, \nthrough diligent monitoring of the situation, we \nA/63/PV.13  \n \n08-53122 10 \n \nunderstand that achieving a just and lasting settlement \nof the conflict \u2014 one that provides an opportunity to \nend Israel\u2019s occupation of Palestinian territories and to \nbring about a Palestinian State \u2014 requires serious \npolitical will on the part of Israel. This must include \nthe dismantlement of settlements in tandem with \nwithdrawal from the land, and the restoration of \nPalestinian rights. \n However, I must admit that we are sceptical about \nthe strength of the will and conviction of Israeli \ndecision makers. Hence the procrastination and \nsetbacks, as well as the hesitation in settling issues. \nThis is what leads to the widely condemned and \npolitically loaded settlement activities, which clearly \nindicate the regression and weakness of the Israeli \nside\u2019s will for peace. This is also the reason for the \nprolongation of the conflict, with its consequences that \nthe whole world knows only too well. But we in Egypt \nwill not lose hope; we will continue to work with \neveryone in order to achieve the objectives of justice, \nstability and security for the whole region. \n The situation in the Sudan also remains \ndisconcerting in the light of ongoing developments. We \nhave observed numerous foreign hands interfering with \nSudan\u2019s security and stability, as if their objective were \nto drive that country towards partition. In this context, \nI would like to affirm that Egypt is working sincerely \nwith all loyal Sudanese parties, at the forefront of them \nthe Sudanese Government, in order to settle existing \nproblems. Allow me to note, in particular, the situation \nin Darfur, which remains difficult, and the significant \nEgyptian participation in the United Nations \npeacekeeping force there, as well as our participation \nin all dialogue forums that aim to settle the crisis. I \nshould also note our call for an international meeting to \naddress the crisis and to agree on a road map to end it. \nStability in the Sudan requires outside parties to refrain \nfrom interfering in Sudanese affairs, just as it requires \nsupport for the development process in that country. \nEgypt will continue its diligent efforts to achieve the \ninterests of our brothers in the Sudan as well as the \ncountry\u2019s and the region\u2019s unity and stability. \n In our region, the concept of regional security \nshould be construed broadly, and the security of the \nArab Gulf \u2014 which is currently in the international \nspotlight \u2014 is one of Egypt\u2019s principal concerns, not \nonly because of Egypt\u2019s close relations with the \ncountries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), but \nalso because of what Egypt represents in terms of \nstrategic depth for its Arab brothers and sisters of the \nGulf. Therefore, we follow closely all developments in \nthe region, in particular the recurrent discourse about \n\u201cnew arrangements\u201d there. We affirm that Egypt is \nworking in coordination with members of the GCC \nwith a view to protecting Arab national security and \nensuring that any such arrangements \u2014 if they come \ninto existence \u2014 will represent true security guarantees \nfor all parties. \n A great deal of work lies ahead of us at this \nsession. This requires open minds and outstretched \nhands in order to meet the demands and aspirations of \nour peoples for freedom, justice, dignity, security and \npeace. Egypt will work throughout this session to \nadvance the components of our vision for the \ninternational and regional situation, which I have just \nelucidated. \n All of us bear the responsibility for this, just as \nwe shall all bear the consequences and the results. We \npledge to work with dedication and sincerity for a \nsuccessful session under your able presidency, Sir. "

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset, Sir, \nto congratulate you on your election to the presidency \nof the General Assembly. Uganda is convinced that, \nwith your experience and well-known diplomatic \nskills, we shall have a successful session. I wish today \nto pay tribute to your predecessor, His Excellency \nSrgjan Kerim, for the excellent manner in which he \npresided over the sixty-second session. I would also \nlike to pay tribute to the Secretary-General for his \nleadership and efforts to reform our Organization. \n The founding fathers of the United Nations had a \ndream of creating an organization whose purpose, \namong others, was \u201cto achieve international \ncooperation in solving international problems of an \neconomic, social, cultural or humanitarian character\u201d. \nToday the world is facing a multitude of problems, \nmany of which the United Nations was meant to \naddress.  \n It is encouraging that the theme chosen for this \nsession is the impact of the global food crisis on \npoverty and hunger in the world as well as the need to \ndemocratize the United Nations. The view of some of \nus in Uganda is that the so-called food crisis is actually \ngood for equatorial Africa. It is certainly good for \nUganda\u2019s farmers. Over the years, we have been \ngrowing a lot of food: maize, bananas, Irish potatoes, \nsweet potatoes, cassava, rice and wheat; and producing \nanimal products such as milk and beef. The problem \nhas always been the market for this food.  \n That was an account of two problems: first, \nprotectionism in the United States, the European \nUnion, Japan, China, et cetera; and secondly, the lack \nof factories to process that food so that it could reach \ndistant markets. Apart from these two, there are other \nfactors in some African countries, including poor \ntraffic infrastructure, lack of electricity, lack of seeds, \net cetera. These, however, do not apply to Uganda. In \nthe case of Uganda, the problem has been the lack of \nmarkets and low processing capacity, in other words, \nlow value addition. The rest we have, or we can have \neasily.  \n The high food and commodity prices have arisen \non account of the hundreds of millions of Chinese and \nIndians that have entered the opulent middle class in \nthe last 20 years. That means they need better food, \nbetter houses that require cement and steel bars, and \nbetter means of locomotion such as cars. That is why \nfood and commodity prices have gone up. It is for the \nsame reason that petroleum prices have gone up: if \nonly 200 people were driving cars previously, the \nnumber has now risen to 400. That means more \ndemand for petroleum. Following the continuously \n \n \n21 08-51606 \n \nrising petroleum prices, some Western countries have \nstarted talking of biofuels \u2014 using plants to produce \ndiesel.  \n Uganda, however, welcomes all of this. It is an \nopportunity, as far as we are concerned. It is not a \nbottleneck. In fact, farmers in Uganda are already \nreaping high. That is why our economy grew by 9 per \ncent last year. Once we solve the problem of energy, \nour economy will grow in double digits.  \n It is good that the United States of America, the \nEuropean Union, India, Japan and China have opened \ntheir markets to African products, tariff-free, quota-\nfree. However, there is still the issue of subsidies. They \nshould be removed. In Uganda, we farm without \nsubsidies. Why should not the farmers in those \ncountries with better infrastructure, lower interest \nrates, abundant electricity, et cetera, do the same? Why \ndo they need protection? Protectionism interferes with \nthose countries that can produce food easily, such as \nUganda. That is not correct.  \n We have been producing too much milk without \nhaving the capacity to process it. Recently, an Indian-\nowned company installed a high-tech integrated milk-\nprocessing plant and began to process powdered milk, \nproducing a whole range of finished milk products: \npasteurized milk, ultra-heat-treated (long-life) milk, \nyoghurt, butter, ghee, et cetera. Those milk products \nare now being exported to all parts of the world. \n Another example has been bananas. Uganda \nproduces 10 million metric tons of bananas per annum. \nThese are high-quality bananas \u2014 called enyam wonyo \nin one of our local dialects \u2014 which contain rare \ningredients. They are quite different from the bananas \nknown in other parts of the world. Forty per cent of \nthose bananas have been rotting in gardens and \nmarketplaces. Our scientists, funded by our \nGovernment, are now converting them into processed \nfoods such as flour, bread, snacks, et cetera.  \n High fuel prices are a real problem for countries \nthat do not have petroleum. Maximizing the use of \nother forms of energy \u2014 including hydropower; \ngeothermal power, which is used effectively in \ncountries such as Iceland; solar power; wind power; \nand biofuels \u2014 is part of the answer for such countries. \nAll that, however, depends on the development of \nhuman resources through education. An educated \npopulation has more capacity to look for answers than \nan uneducated population.  \n As far as Uganda is concerned, in addition to lazy \nindividuals, the only groups that are adversely affected \nby high food prices are salary earners in towns. Unlike \nfarmers, they cannot benefit from higher food prices; \nyet they must buy food. Fortunately, however, all such \nfamilies in Uganda have a dual capacity: in addition to \nbeing salary earners, they or their relatives own land in \nrural areas. They can therefore subsidize themselves by \ngrowing food using that land. Africa and other regions \nwith agriculture-based economies should rise up, \nutilize their full potential and take advantage of high \nfood prices. \n Regarding the statement that I have heard \nrepeated so many times since the opening of the \npresent session of the General Assembly \u2014 that no \nAfrican country can achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by 2015 \u2014 I would like \nto make two positions clear. First, the statement \nconfirms what I said yesterday at the high-level \nmeeting on Africa\u2019s development needs. Discussing \nsustainable development without discussing \nsocio-economic transformation is not correct. We have \nrepeatedly pointed that out. I have often used the \nexample of pregnancy: one cannot talk endlessly about \n\u201csustainable pregnancy\u201d. Yes, pregnancy should be \nsustainable until it transitions into a baby. Therefore, as \nEurope did, and as other societies in Asia have recently \ndone, Africa must metamorphose socially, \neconomically and technologically from a \npre-industrial, sometimes feudal, society into a middle-\nclass and skilled-working-class society, period. \nAchievement of all the MDGs would be the \nconsequence of such a metamorphosis. \n One cannot maintain a pre-industrial society and \nsomehow achieve the MDGs. An industrial society is \nwhat Uganda has been working towards over the past \n20 years. Africa must industrialize, develop a modern \nservices sector and commercialize agriculture. That \nmeans that emphasis must be placed on market access. \nIt means that we should not only gain access to the \nmajor markets of the world, but also rationalize our \nown African markets through regional and continental \nintegration. It also means that, in order to lower the \ncosts of doing business in Africa, we should deal with \nenergy; transport, especially by rail; and primary and \nhigher-level education. Achievement of the MDGs \nwould be a consequence of these developments, rather \nthan a precursor or a phenomenon extraneous to them. \n  \n \n08-51606 22 \n \n Mr. Y\u00e1\u00f1ez-Barnuevo (Spain), Vice-President, took \nthe Chair. \n The second position that I would like to point out \nregarding the MDGs is that Uganda is on course to \nmeet all of them except those related to maternal health \nand child mortality. I see no reason why those Goals \nshould not be achieved. With the exception of \ncombating HIV/AIDS \u2014 which is behaviour-related \u2014 \nI am sure that all the others are achievable if we in \nUganda do enough political-led sensitization and \ninvestment. \n I do not associate myself with those who are \npessimistic about Africa or with those who put the cart \nbefore the horse. Why, for instance, were \nindustrialization and value addition not made one of \nthe MDGs? The export of raw materials is one of the \ncardinal sins that cause Africa to contribute only a \n2 per cent share of world trade. If value were added to \nthose raw materials, Africa\u2019s share of world trade \nwould rise, even today. Africa is exporting many \nthings, but they are in the form of raw materials; that is \nwhy their value is 2 per cent. If value were added to \nthose raw materials, their value would rise. \n Moreover, that would create jobs for Africans and \ntherefore contribute structurally to poverty eradication. \nHow are we supposed to eradicate poverty without \ncreating jobs, other than by using witchcraft? We have \nrepeatedly pointed out these issues in several forums, \nto no avail. It is Africans themselves who can and \nshould resolve them. "

        "file_text": "First, I \ncongratulate Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann on his \nelection to the presidency of the Assembly at its sixty-\nthird session. I wish him a successful presidency. I also \n  \n \n08-51839 36 \n \nsalute Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and express my \nhighest regard for his commitment to peace, dialogue \nand prosperity for all. \n The world grows in complexity, with its multiple \nchallenges and numerous risks and uncertainties. This \ncalls for increased multilateralism, more collective \nresponsibility and greater cooperation. In short, it \ndemands and expects more and better from the United \nNations. \n The world is undergoing a profound and \nmultifaceted crisis in the financial, energy, food and \nenvironmental areas. Indeed, we face an environment \nfraught with uncertainty in the short and long term, \nunderscored by financial instability, foreign exchange \nvolatility, escalating oil and food prices and a globally \ntroubled world economy. There is risk to our economic, \nhuman, political and military security \u2014 in other \nwords, our general and collective security. \n On the one hand, organized transnational crime \nand terrorism threaten international order and the rule \nof law. On the other hand, the effects of global \nwarming and climate change, as well as the risks \nimposed by their worsening, are real facts that confront \nworld leaders and institutions. \n World peace remains out of reach. Areas of armed \nconflict still exist. Indeed, they resurge repeatedly or \npersist at low intensity. In the meantime, new sources \nof tension arise in many places. However, I believe we \nagree that war is not the best way to overcome these \nchallenges. \n We also have failed to build security and trust \namong all and for all, large and small, rich and poor. \nWithout security, without social stability, without \npolitical and institutional cohesion, and above all \nwithout mutual trust between the international political \nactors, it is difficult to further the premises that may \ncontribute to ensuring a solution to major global \nproblems, resolving our main challenges, overcoming \nextreme poverty and the most pervasive endemic \ndiseases, as well as moving past current global social \nand economic imbalances. \n With the adoption of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals the international community \nexpressly undertook to contribute to overcoming this \nunsustainable situation. I therefore urge the Assembly \nto work towards the preservation of an international \nenvironment favourable to the achievement of the \ncommitment that we undertook \u2014 the social and \neconomic growth of the poorest countries, the \neradication of extreme poverty, the consolidation of \npeace, dialogue and international cooperation towards \ninternational balance, the defence of life and the \nplanet\u2019s future. \n The current financial crisis is underscored by the \ninstability of the financial markets and the volatility in \nthe movement of capital, which put our worldwide \neconomic stability at risk. We must retain the global \nfinancial architecture. It seems necessary for us to \nagree on new forms of financial regulation that are \neffective, trustworthy and acceptable to all. \n The food crisis has placed hundreds of millions \nof people in a precarious situation. It is clear that \nurgent action is required to ensure increased \nagricultural production capable of meeting current and \nfuture needs. That requires the promotion of \nagricultural policies consistent with the demands of the \nsituation, the partnership of the rich and \ntechnologically more advanced countries and technical \nassistance from international organizations; it means \nthat attention must be given to modernizing and \nincreasing agricultural production and productivity in \nthe affected countries and regions. I think specifically \nof my country and the African continent.  \n Escalating oil prices have created serious \nproblems for the economies of the least developed and \nnon-producing countries. I ask, why not consider forms \nof compensation for the poorest and most affected \nnations in view of the enormous financial surpluses \nthat have been accumulated? Admittedly, such an act of \njustice and solidarity would not be enough. We must \ntherefore act individually and collectively and continue \nto promote energy alternatives and energy efficiency, \nas well as encourage reduced dependence on fossil \nfuels. Urgent and global measures are required to \novercome the serious environmental crisis and to \ndevelop innovative and safe options for the future of \nhumanity. That is the challenge that we must take up \nfor the sake of the future and that we must overcome \nfor the benefit of all.  \n We surely agree that humanity is at a decisive \nmoment in history that clearly runs counter to the \nparadigms of its recent past \u2014 a time when a new \nworld is painfully coming into being.  \n Recent experiences show that no single nation \ncan in isolation solve the great challenges and global \n \n \n37 08-51839 \n \nproblems which the world faces. However, our \nuniversal institution does present the essential \nconditions and the required collective responsibility for \nsuch an endeavour. Therefore, it is incumbent on the \nUnited Nations to shoulder the tremendous mission of \npromoting more effective world governance.  \n However, to perform such a role, which is now \nmore complex than ever, the United Nations is called \nupon to adapt itself to the challenges of the twenty-first \ncentury, to express the major shaping forces of the \ncontemporary world and to ensure and convey \nconfidence to all of its Member States. Accordingly, \nthe United Nations system must be reformed and \nimproved and, above all, the representativeness and \nlegitimacy of the Security Council must be urgently \nexpanded and strengthened.  \n Thirty-five years ago, on 4 September 1973, the \nRepublic of Guinea-Bissau acceded to national \nsovereignty. I salute the delegation of Guinea-Bissau in \nthis room. It is our firm conviction that our brother \nnation will be able to overcome all the difficulties \ncurrently facing it and to consolidate the foundations of \nits stability under the rule of law.  \n Allow me also to welcome the recent legislative \nelections in Angola and to congratulate the people and \nauthorities of Angola for the responsible and transparent \nmanner in which those important elections were \nconducted.  \n I would further like to welcome the political \nagreements that led to the end of the political crisis in \nZimbabwe. That is a testament to the emancipation of \nour continent and to its aspiration to progress, and thus \nhelps to usher in the new era and the new world that \nwe so eagerly desire."

        "file_text": "The people of Fiji \nwarmly congratulate Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann \non his election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-third session. We also convey our \nsincere gratitude to his predecessor, His Excellency \nMr. Srgjan Kerim. I am particularly happy also to \nacknowledge the presence of the Prime Minister of the \nSolomon Islands, Mr. Derrick Sikua, one of the Vice-\nPresidents of the General Assembly and a member of \nour region of the South Pacific. \n This session of the General Assembly is \naddressing several issues of critical global interest: the \nglobal food crisis; climate change; peacekeeping; and \nthe law of the sea. All of those issues are of great and \ndirect importance to small island nations such as Fiji. I \nwill first briefly touch upon some of them. \n The people of Fiji have been affected in a very \nreal, immediate, serious and tangible way by the \nshocks transmitted to our small nation with the \ndramatic escalation in global food prices, energy price \nrises and the downturn in the global economy. In Fiji \nwe are using these adverse external developments as an \nopportunity to revamp our long-neglected agricultural \nsector. We have ample land resources, and we must put \nthem to better and more productive use. \n The food crisis and the need for self-reliance \nunfortunately run counter to the emergence of world \ntrading rules. The principle of free trade dictates an \nopen economy. Yet small developing economies like \nours in Fiji need to protect our agriculture to ensure \nfood security. We very much hope that international \ntrade negotiations and multilateral and bilateral trade \ndeals will enable us to protect agricultural development \nin our small, vulnerable economies. Fiji will support all \nconcerted efforts, public and private, national and \nmultinational, regional and subregional, that are being \npursued to address the global food crisis. \n \n \n25 08-52265 \n \n On the issue of climate change, Fiji looks to, and \nis relying on, the leadership of the Assembly President. \nThis is a critical issue for the very small island and \natoll nations in the Pacific. While the rest of the world \ncontinues endlessly to debate the implications of \nclimate change, in the very small islands and atolls in \nthe Pacific the problem is very much upon us. It is now \na present and very real danger. It poses a serious risk to \nregional stability and security. \n I appeal to the international community and its \nsystem of institutions to enhance efforts to assist us to \naddress the threats of global climate change. We need \ninvestments in adaptation measures. We need to move \nfrom rhetoric to a more pragmatic and speedy \nresponse. We call upon the agencies and our regional \npartners to coordinate efforts to ensure that we in the \nPacific region have the capacity, both human and \ninstitutional, to deal with this new threat, especially as \nit is getting stronger. The observed and potential \nimpacts on our peoples and ecosystems due to climate \nchange are all too real and immediate. We count on the \nPresident and the Secretary-General to exercise more \nvigorous and active leadership on this issue of global \nclimate change. \n I will now speak briefly on peacekeeping. I \nconvey our gratitude and appreciation to outgoing \nUnder-Secretary-General Jean-Marie Gu\u00e9henno for his \ndedicated leadership at the Department of \nPeacekeeping Operations (DPKO). He was fair and \ngenerous in implementing the reforms within DPKO \nand in the development of a United Nations \npeacekeeping doctrine that will guide future United \nNations peace operations and missions. We wish \nMr. Gu\u00e9henno well and assure his successor, Mr. Alain \nLe Roy, of our full support and cooperation. \n Fiji\u2019s soldiers have a proud track record in United \nNations peacekeeping operations \u2014 a record of \nprofessionalism, discipline, compassion and ability. \nFiji\u2019s Military Forces have shown that their training \nand ethics are an asset to peacekeeping operations. We \ncontinue to work very hard to keep that exceptional \nrecord intact. Yet despite that, the relationship between \nFiji and DPKO has been under strain. That is because \nof Fiji\u2019s military\u2019s involvement in our Government \nsince December 2006. We are, however, encouraged by \nthe ongoing discussion between officials of our \nPermanent Mission and the Department of \nPeacekeeping Operations. It would be less than honest \nof me if I did not observe that undue external influence \nappears to have been brought to bear to exclude Fiji \nfrom participation in new peacekeeping missions. I \nexpress the hope that the opportunity will be extended \nto us to participate in new peacekeeping missions. \n Please allow me to now address this body on \nFiji\u2019s current situation and on our efforts to take the \ncountry forward. I should first like to look back, albeit \nbriefly. Fiji became independent on 10 October 1970. \nOur country then was seen as having great promise and \npotential. Our people, with high hopes, placed their \nfaith on our country\u2019s leaders to build a new nation that \nwould be peaceful, stable, culturally vibrant, tolerant \nand prosperous. We felt then that by being part of the \ninternational family of nations Fiji could demonstrate \nby example the way the world should be. \n For just over 15 years following independence, \nwe achieved some progress. However, following the \ncoups of 1987 and 2000, the rot set in. Since then, \nFiji\u2019s overall political, economic and social situation \nhas continued to deteriorate. Our people\u2019s dream of a \ntolerant, united and prosperous nation was replaced by \na different reality \u2014 a reality characterized by political \ninstability, economic stagnation, increasing religious \nand racial intolerance, ethno-nationalism and politics \nbased on ethno-nationalism, a rise in crime, violence \nand corruption, increased poverty and the emigration \nof many of our talented, skilled and experienced \ncitizens.  \n On 5 December 2006, a political transition took \nplace in Fiji following an intervention from the Fiji \nMilitary Forces. Interim measures were put in place by \nthe President to ensure good governance, maintain law \nand order and stabilize the economy. The President of \nFiji subsequently appointed an interim Government, \nwhich I head. The legality of those actions has been \nchallenged and the matter is now before the courts of \nFiji. \n To date, my Government, which remains in \neffective control of governance in Fiji, has done \neverything within its power to adhere to the current \nConstitution. We recognize that that is the supreme law \nof our nation. At the same time, we have also come to \nrecognize that the very foundation on which we have \nsought to build our nation has been shaky and weak. \nTherefore, our efforts must now focus on re-laying a \nmore solid foundation to return Fiji to sustainable \ndemocratic governance. Our island nation must be \nrebuilt on the solid rock-like foundations of equal \n  \n \n08-52265 26 \n \nrights, social justice, democracy and good governance. \nWe cannot and must not repeat the mistake of trying to \nrebuild again on the proven proverbial foundation of \nsand, which is washed away by the evils of self-\ninterest, incompetence, intolerance and greed.  \n In January of last year, the interim Government \nembarked on a comprehensive examination of our \npolitical, economic, social and governance problems. \nWe did that to identify what contributed to the abysmal \nrecord of successive Governments since May 1987, and \nalso to find durable and just solutions. Early in that \nundertaking, my Government decided to reach out to \nthe people of Fiji to ensure that they became better \naware of Fiji\u2019s problems and that they all became part \nof the solutions going forward. We did that while being \nmindful of the larger issue of mandate that the events \nof December 2006 raised. For my part, I took the view \nthat the interim Government must not pretend that it \nhad the capacity or the wisdom to solve our country\u2019s \nproblems entirely on its own. \n My country, Fiji, faces deep-rooted and very \nfundamental problems that are both complex and \nstructural. My Government therefore recommended to \nthe President of Fiji that he set up a broadly \nrepresentative and independent consultative body to \nreach out to the people of Fiji and to get them actively \ninvolved in charting the way forward for Fiji. In late \n2007, the President of Fiji established a 45-member \nnational council for building a better Fiji and officially \nlaunched what is now known as the Peoples Charter \nInitiative. The President invited the leaders of all major \npolitical, social, community, business and religious \norganizations in the country to join the national council \nand to contribute to formulating a people\u2019s charter for \nchange, peace and progress. Some, in particular those \norganizations that remain vigorously opposed to the \ninterim Government, chose not to accept the invitation \nof the President of Fiji. They wilfully persistently \nrejected the call to engage in constructive dialogue and \nto work towards a broad consensus on the way forward \nfor Fiji. \n Last year, when I addressed the Assembly, I \nbriefly mentioned our preparations to launch the \nPeoples Charter Initiative. I said then that through this \ninitiative the broad cross section of Fiji\u2019s people would \nbe fully engaged and involved through consultation \nand participation in developing a comprehensive action \nagenda, and that that would be Fiji\u2019s own way of \naddressing its problems. Today, I am pleased to inform \nthe Assembly that very considerable progress has been \nachieved on the Peoples Charter Initiative. \n The overarching objective of the people\u2019s charter \nis to rebuild Fiji into a non-racial, culturally vibrant, \nunited, well-governed and truly democratic nation \u2014 a \nnation that seeks progress and prosperity. The vision \nfor rebuilding Fiji that underpins that overarching \nobjective is guided by a number of key principles, such \nas creating a just and fair society; achieving unity and \nnational identity; ensuring merit-based equality of \nopportunity for all citizens; transparent and \naccountable Government; uplifting the disadvantaged \nin all communities; and mainstreaming our indigenous \npeople, the i-Taukei, in a modern and progressive Fiji. \n We embarked upon the very bold programme of \ndrafting a people\u2019s charter advisedly and for some very \ncompelling reasons. We can ill afford to carry on with \nbusiness as usual and in ways that continue to fragment \nand divide our nation. In that context, the process of \ndrafting the people\u2019s charter has been a unique and \nunprecedented one \u2014 a nation-wide participatory and \nconsultative process of a scale and type never before \nattempted in Fiji. The whole process is one of \nempowerment the likes of which the people of Fiji \nhave never experienced before. Too often in national \ngovernance \u2014 and this applies to so-called \ndemocracies \u2014 it is the professional politicians who do \nthe thinking for the people. While the cries and voices \nof the people are often heard, however, they are just as \neasily ignored by the elected representatives and so-\ncalled leaders. \n From the outset, after being appointed as head of \nthe interim Government, I have felt that it was my duty \nto go to the people of Fiji in the most basic and \ndemocratic sense, that is, to consult, to actively involve \nour people, and to put real people\u2019s democracy to \nwork, house to house, in each settlement and village \nand in towns and cities right across the country. \nThrough the People\u2019s Charter Initiative, that is what we \nhave been doing. \n There are some, both in Fiji and outside, who are \ncynical in that regard. I am able to understand that, and \nnot only because such a process has never ever been \ntried before. It is indeed a most challenging and \ndifficult process to undertake. Even though the \npeople\u2019s charter process has been undertaken by the \nnational council at arm\u2019s length from the interim \nGovernment, there are those who oppose it simply \n \n \n27 08-52265 \n \nbecause it is an initiative of the interim Government. \nWhat they recognize, but choose not to admit, is that \nthe people\u2019s charter process is a real threat to their \npositions of vested power and privilege. \n When I addressed the Assembly last year, I \npleaded for the support of the international community \nto help us in the wake of all the political and economic \nturbulence that Fiji has experienced since 1987. I \npleaded for support to develop a political and \ngovernance framework that is truly democratic, \naccountable, inclusive, equitable and non-racial, and \nwhich will seek to unify Fiji\u2019s diverse communities as \na nation. I also sought constructive dialogue and \nengagement with the international community and with \nall our bilateral and multilateral development partners. \nI urged the international community to support us in \naddressing Fiji\u2019s fundamental problems. \n I am asking the international community today \nnot to focus only on the removal of a Government. \nThat has already been done exhaustively. We have been \nsubjected to harsh international measures, which we \naccepted. We have endured those through the suffering \nof our people. The coups of 1987 and 2000 were \nexecuted in the interests of a few and based on ethno-\nnationalism, racism and greed. The events of \n5 December 2006 were not for any such extremist \nmotivation.  \n In 2000, in quelling the civilian-led coup, as \nCommander of the Fiji Military Forces, I played a \npivotal role in the handing of political power to a \ncivilian Government. Through the People\u2019s Charter \nInitiative, I am seeking to empower the people of Fiji \nat large and to find just and sustainable solutions to our \ndeep-rooted and persistent problems. I wish to assure \nthe international community that I am personally \ndeeply committed to breaking the cycle of coups. \nEqually important, I am committed to breaking the \ncycle of bad and unjust governance that Fiji has \nsuffered since May 1987. \n To remove the coup culture and to commit to \ndemocratic and just governance and the rule of law, it \nis imperative that policies that promote racial \nsupremacy and that further the interests of self-seeking \npolitical, religious and traditional elites are removed \nonce and for all. In good faith, I anticipated that the \ninternational community would rally behind and extend \nsupport for such goals to help move Fiji forward. \nRegrettably, so far that has not happened.  \n To the contrary, since December 2006 punitive \nmeasures have continued to be taken against Fiji. \nTravel sanctions continue, which are being imposed in \nparticular by Australia, New Zealand, the United \nKingdom and the United States of America. Those are \napplied to interim Government ministers, senior civil \nservants, military personnel and statutory board \nappointees. Those sanctions have had significant \nadverse effects on our economy, as well as on the \nfunctioning of our key State institutions, on which we \nrely to promote good governance and accountability. \nPressure has been exerted on regional and multilateral \nagencies not to extend to Fiji much-needed financial, \ndevelopment and technical assistance.  \n As a result, we have not been able to make as \nmuch progress as we should have. We cannot travel \nand engage in discussions at important regional and \ninternational meetings abroad. That is despite the fact \nthat Fiji has made every effort to engage in dialogue \nwith our bilateral partners and the international \ncommunity in a constructive and transparent manner. \nWe have openly embraced and allowed various \nmissions sent by regional and international bodies such \nas the Pacific Islands Forum, the European Union, the \nUnited Nations and the Commonwealth secretariat. We \nextended to all of them our fullest support and \ncooperation in terms of engagement, in arranging \nappointments and in making available to them \nwhatever information they needed. That demonstrates \nthat we are keen to engage constructively in dialogue \nwith whoever is interested in helping move our country \nforward. Following the recent Pacific Islands Forum \nmeeting in Niue, I wrote last week to the Forum Chair \nand indicated that the interim Fiji Government is \nprepared to re-engage with the Forum Joint Working \nGroup and that we are prepared to welcome a visit, \nbefore December 2008, by the Forum\u2019s Ministerial \nContact Group.  \n We are not able to schedule an election to return \nFiji to parliamentary democracy in the early part of \n2009, as earlier anticipated. We realize that that has \ncaused concern to some of our own people in Fiji, to \ncountries of the region and to some of our development \npartners. The stance taken by the international \ncommunity with regard to the delay in convening the \nelection, however, has given much ammunition to our \nopponents within Fiji. They have used it to vilify us \ndespite the progress that we are making towards just \nand sustainable solutions to our fundamental problems. \n  \n \n08-52265 28 \n \nI have already explained to Fiji\u2019s people the need to \ndelay the election. I wish to inform our regional \npartners and the international community represented \nhere today that the interim Government cannot convene \nan election by March 2009. That is due to work still in \nprogress to agree on a democratic electoral system that \nis acceptable to the people of Fiji and that all political \nstakeholders can agree to through political dialogue.  \n We believe that the general election must be held \nas soon as possible. That will be done only after we \nhave achieved broad consensus in Fiji on a non-racial \nand truly democratic electoral system, and agreed on a \nconstitutional and legal way to introduce the changes. \nIt is necessary to change our current electoral system \nbecause it is undemocratic and does not provide for \nfree and fair elections. It contravenes the principle of \nequal suffrage as set out in the Universal Declaration \nof Human Rights. To achieve that, the President of Fiji \nhas proposed that a political dialogue forum be \nconvened as a mechanism independent of the national \ncouncil. It is through that forum that we hope to reach \nconsensus and introduce the reforms through legal and \nconstitutional means. Again, I say with emphasis, the \ntimeframe to achieve all that is not dependent upon me \nor the interim Government; it is the collective \nresponsibility of all stakeholders.  \n In May of this year, Fiji sought assistance from \nthe Commonwealth and the United Nations to \nfacilitate, as a priority and with urgency, the \nPresident\u2019s proposed political dialogue forum. We had \nhoped that the forum, which would initially focus on \nelectoral reform, would have been convened by now. \nLittle progress has been made, and we are concerned \nabout the delay. I would like to take this opportunity to \nreiterate our request to the United Nations and the \nCommonwealth to help us urgently in that regard.  \n After taking into account the feedback from our \nnation-wide consultations, the draft peoples charter \nwill be amended as necessary and appropriate before it \nis finalized. It will then be adopted as a vision \nstatement that identifies our core problems and the \nsolutions recommended through the nation-wide \nconsultation process. It is incumbent upon me and my \nGovernment to build consensus on the peoples charter \nas the common principles on which we should rebuild \nour nation. The peoples charter will present a \nconsidered way forward for Fiji. We are not obliged to \nabandon the enormous and important work being \nachieved through an extensive participatory and \nconsultative process just because some people remain \nopposed and have decided not to participate. My \nGovernment\u2019s task now is to persuade those opponents \nto come aboard, to join and to contribute. We hope to \nand must achieve consensus. \n At this particular juncture in the history of our \nnation, leadership is more about how we can seize the \npresent historic opportunity to manage the transition \nfrom the interim Government to a truly democratic \nGovernment and nation consisting of various ethnic \ncommunities but which is one nation with its people in \nunity in the true spirit in which the United Nations was \nestablished.  \n In conclusion, I reaffirm Fiji\u2019s commitment to the \nUnited Nations and to the various United Nations \nconventions on human rights, the rule of law and \ndemocratic governance. We do not seek any special \nexemptions from our obligations under those \nconventions. All we seek from the United Nations is its \nunderstanding of our particular circumstances and the \ncomplex situation of Fiji. We invite the Organization to \nwork with us to assist us to rebuild our country and \nmove it forward. "

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to \nconvey my very warm regards and congratulations to \nyou, Sir, on your well-deserved election to preside over \nthe sixty-third session of this Assembly. \n On behalf of the African Union, the United \nRepublic of Tanzania and in my own name, I would \nlike to assure you of our unqualified support and \ncooperation throughout your term of office. Allow me \nalso to use this opportunity to thank and congratulate \nyour predecessor, Ambassador Srgjan Kerim, President \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-second session, for \nhis leadership and for a job very well done. \n Our illustrious Secretary-General, His Excellency \nBan Ki-moon, deserves special tribute from us for the \nexcellent manner in which he is discharging the \nresponsibilities of his high office. We appreciate the \nway in which he has answered the call of duty. My \ndelegation and I reaffirm our support for his great \nwork. His devotion to achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) reversing the impact of \nclimate change and his concern for Africa\u2019s \ndevelopment have won the hearts of many of us in the \ncontinent. \n As I stand before this Assembly in my dual \ncapacity as Chairman of the African Union and as \nPresident of my country, I bring with me a message of \nhope and optimism from Africa. Africa is no longer the \nhopeless case as perceived by some. There are so many \ngood things happening in the continent. There is \nincreasing political stability, peace reigns in almost all \nnations but a few and the economies of many nations \nare blossoming. \n Africa is now a continent in full embrace of \ndemocracy, good governance, rule of law and respect \nfor human rights. There is stronger commitment to deal \nwith vices in society, including the problems of \ncorruption. \n Most African countries have embraced \ndemocratic governance and regular, periodic elections \nare the norm. In the past two years, a good number of \nAfrican countries have successfully held democratic \nelections. It is a matter of principle enshrined in the \nConstitutive Act of the African Union that leaders who \ncome into office through undemocratic means are not \nallowed to participate in the activities of the African \nUnion. It is this principle that guided the African Union \nin suspending Mauritania from the organs of the \nAfrican Union until democratic dispensations are \nrestored. \n It is heart-warming, indeed, that Africans, \nthrough the African Union and their regional economic \norganizations, have been proactive and have taken the \nlead in monitoring elections and resolving conflicts \nwhere they have arisen. This was the case with Kenya \nand very recently with Zimbabwe. Indeed, Africa has \ncome of age. The old principle of non-interference in \ninternal affairs is surely being replaced by \nnon-indifference to violations of democracy and abuse \nof human rights in Member States. \n There are fewer conflicts in the continent today \nthan was the case a few years ago. This is testimony to \nthe fact that democracy and good governance are \ntaking root and the African peace and security \narchitecture is working. However, much more needs to \nbe done to strengthen the African Union\u2019s capacity for \nearly warning, conflict prevention and conflict \nresolution. There is also a need to do the same with the \nregional economic groupings to buttress their \npeacebuilding efforts. \n I would like to recognize the United Nations, the \nEuropean Union and States and other institutions in the \nworld that have generously supported the strengthening \nof the infant African Union peace and security \nmechanism. I would like to call on all of them to \n  \n \n08-51570 32 \n \ncontinue supporting the African Union mechanism as \nwell as the regional mechanisms and peacekeeping \noperations in Africa. \n There are only three conflict situations worth \nmentioning and discussing in this Assembly today. \nThese concern the conflicts in Darfur and Somalia and \nthe volatile security situation in the eastern part of \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. \n In Darfur, the humanitarian crisis still persists \nalthough there may be some encouraging signs of \nimprovement. I believe the situation would be much \nbetter if the entire contingent of the United Nations \nHybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) forces was \ndeployed, and the peace talks between the rebels and \nthe Government of Sudan were resumed and \nconcluded. Also, improvement would be seen if \nhumanitarian aid work was allowed to be carried out \nunencumbered and matters related to justice were dealt \nwith judiciously. \n There is a need therefore for the United Nations, \nthe African Union and the Government of the Sudan to \ncontinue to work together expeditiously to remove the \nobstacles impeding the deployment of UNAMID, to \nremove the obstacles impeding the dialogue between \nthe Government of the Sudan and the rebels, impeding \nhumanitarian operations and impeding the process of \ndispensation of justice in Darfur. \n I was in Sudan two weeks ago and held very \nfruitful discussions with His Excellency President \nOmar Al-Bashir. I also met officials of the Joint \nUN-AU peacekeeping mission in Darfur. We discussed \nthe situation in Darfur, the obstacles involved and \ncame to some understanding on the way forward. I am \nhopeful that progress can be made. We need to seize \nthe moment and the opportunities that are now \nunfolding. \n It is the considered view of the African Union \nthat the indictment of President Omar Al-Bashir at this \nparticular point in time will complicate the deployment \nof UNAMID and the management of the humanitarian \ncrisis in Darfur. It is for this reason that the African \nUnion sees deferment as the most expedient measure \nnow. \n Let me make one thing clear: when we talk about \ndeferment, we should not in any way be perceived as \ncondoning injustice. Justice is a matter of essence. It \nmust be done, it must be seen to be done. We are \nsimply concerned with the best possible sequencing of \nmeasures so that the most immediate matters of saving \nlives and easing the suffering of the people of Darfur \nare taken care of first. Getting the support and \ncooperation of the Government of the Sudan is a matter \nof essence in the fulfilment of all that we want to seen \ndone in Darfur. \n The conflict in Somalia remains difficult to \nmanage and resolve. The inter-party dialogue has not \nyet borne the desired results. The African Union \npeacekeeping efforts seem to be overstretched. We call \nupon the United Nations to step in and take over the \npeacekeeping responsibilities at the earliest possible \ntime before the African Union mission is overwhelmed. \nTime is of the essence. Let me use this opportunity to \ncommend the Governments of Ethiopia, Uganda and \nBurundi for their invaluable contribution to \npeacekeeping efforts in Somalia. \n The volatile security situation in the eastern \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo is a matter of great \nconcern. We are deeply saddened by the ongoing \nfighting between the government forces and rebel \nforces of General Laurent Nkunda. The continued \npresence of negative forces threatening the security of \ncountries neighbouring the Democratic Republic of the \nCongo is another complicating factor. \n The African Union is committed to be more \nproactive in the search for lasting peace in that \ntroubled region. We will work with regional leaders \nand the United Nations in that regard. \n On September 15 this year, a landmark \nbreakthrough was achieved in the Zimbabwe political \ncrisis when the three political parties to the conflict: \nThe African National Union-Patriotic Front, the \nMovement for Democratic Change-Tsvangirai and the \nMovement for Democratic Change-Mutambara, signed \nthe historic agreement for ending the conflict and \nforming an inclusive Government. The leaders of those \nthree parties are now engaged in the process of \nimplementing that agreement. Getting to this point in a \nconflict situation that seemed almost impossible to \nresolve is a major achievement indeed. \n We need to congratulate President Robert \nMugabe, Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai and \nDeputy Prime Minister Arthur Mutambara on their \nwisdom and statesmanship. We also need to \nacknowledge, recognize and commend, in a special \nmanner, President Thabo Mbeki of the Republic of \n \n \n33 08-51570 \n \nSouth Africa for his sterling leadership. It was his \npatience, perseverance and understanding that made it \nall happen. His imminent departure from office, which \ncomes suddenly, raises some concerns about what may \nhappen if difficulties are experienced with the \nimplementation of the agreement. I see no cause for \nalarm. The South African Government remains, and I \nam sure the new leadership will continue to be, seized \nof the matter.  \n Moreover, since the agreement is the product of \nthe decision taken in July by the African Union at its \nsummit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, the African Union \nand the Southern Africa Development Community \nstand ready to assist if need should arise. \n We in Africa thank you, Mr. President, for \nincluding the food and oil crises among the themes for \nthis session of the General Assembly. The current \nglobal escalation of food and fuel prices has reached \ncrisis proportions. Sub-Saharan Africa is the region \naffected the most. It is home to the majority of the least \ndeveloped countries on this planet. Their food and oil \nbills have increased exponentially. Food import bills \nhave increased by over 40 per cent over the past year, \nwhile oil prices have increased by over 100 per cent \nsince 2005. Even the recent drop in oil prices has not \nhelped much, because prices are still more than twice \nwhat they were in 2005. \n The high food and oil prices threaten to erode the \nhumble gains made in implementing the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and sustaining macroeconomic \nstability in Africa. The food and oil crisis, coupled with \nthe worsening financial crisis throughout the world, \ngives us every reason to be very worried. The need for \ncomprehensive action to reverse the situation cannot be \noveremphasized. We call upon the international \ncommunity and key players in the global economy to \nact quickly. The United Nations should take the lead. \n Yesterday, this Assembly held a high-level event \non Africa\u2019s development needs. The meeting received a \ncomprehensive report from the Secretary-General on \n\u201cAfrica\u2019s development needs: state of implementation \nof various commitments, challenges and the way \nforward\u201d (A/63//130). We are glad to note that the \nreport incorporated some of the recommendations of \nthe Millennium Development Goals Africa Steering \nGroup. \n The report\u2019s findings underscore the fact that \nAfrica cannot meet its development needs without the \nsupport of the international community. Indeed, the \ninternational community has been responding \nfavourably. A number of commitments to assisting \nAfrica have been made over the years in different \ninternational forums. Unfortunately, the commitments \nmade have not been met fully. \n We appeal to the General Assembly to echo the \ncall and impress upon Africa\u2019s development partners \nthe need to honour their promise and deliver on their \ncommitments. I also urge this family of United Nations \nMember States to fully support the political declaration \nadopted at the high-level meeting yesterday, as we re-\ndedicate ourselves to meeting the development needs \nof Africa. \n We in Africa have been following with keen \ninterest the ongoing process of the reform of the United \nNations. We remain convinced of the ideal that a \nreform of the United Nations would be incomplete \nwithout a reform of the Security Council. On our part, \nwe have authorized our permanent representatives in \nNew York to embark on negotiations with all parties on \nthe reforms of the Security Council. At this juncture, I \nshould reiterate the position of the African Union of \nasking for two permanent seats with veto power and \ntwo non-permanent seats. Our demand should be seen \nagainst the backdrop of the reality that Africa is the \nonly continent without a permanent seat in the Security \nCouncil, despite our large membership in the United \nNations. That is an anomaly. It has to be corrected. The \nreform of the Security Council, therefore, should take \nthat into account. \n The reforms of the United Nations have, on the \nother hand, to enable the Organization to work better \nand be more efficient, effective and responsive to the \nchallenges of our times. We are happy with the work of \nthe General Assembly at its previous sessions on \nadvancing the United Nations system-wide coherence \nagenda. The work has thus far advanced \nintergovernmental consultations on the United Nations \ndelivering as one: one programme, one budget, one \noffice and one leader. \n Tanzania is one of the eight pilot countries on the \nUnited Nations \u201cdelivering as one\u201d project. Our \nexperience so far has shown that delivering as one is \npossible. It improves national ownership and \nstrengthens national leadership in the development \nprocess. It permits the realignment of United Nations \nassistance with national priorities and streamlines \n  \n \n08-51570 34 \n \nbusiness transactions, thus enhancing the efficiency \nand effectiveness of United Nations activities. I urge \nthis Assembly to follow up on the implementation of \nthis important reform, and I appeal to our development \npartners to provide the requisite resources. \n At the sixtieth session of this Assembly, I \nreported on the work of the Helsinki Process on \nGlobalisation and Democracy, a joint initiative \nlaunched in 2003 and co-chaired by Finland and \nTanzania. The Helsinki Process, a forum to facilitate \nmulti-stakeholder dialogue on the possibilities offered \nand challenges posed by the process of globalization, \nhas come to an end. The main objective of that \ninitiative was to mobilize political will in support of \nthe Millennium Development Goals. The President of \nFinland, Ms. Tarja Halonen, and I would be glad, as \nco-chairs of the Process, to present the final report to \nthe Secretary-General this week. We trust that the \nreport will add impetus to global efforts to see political \nwill prevail in the implementation of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. A democracy deficit in \ninternational institutions is attendant. \n Before I conclude, allow me to mention three \nthings. First, I would remind this world body that the \nWestern Sahara problem remains unresolved. Allow me \nto make a humble appeal to the Security Council to \nexpedite the process so that the matter is concluded \nsoon. It has been going on for too long. The people of \nthe Western Sahara will then be given the opportunity \nto determine which way to go. They deserve to be \nafforded the opportunity to live a normal life in a \nnation that has been designated as theirs. \n Secondly, we should remain seized of the \nPalestinian question until the two-State solution \u2014 the \nState of Israel and a State of Palestine living together \nside by side and in harmony \u2014 is attained.  \n Thirdly, there is a matter that we discussed at the \nmost recent African Union summit. It is with regard to \nthe issue of universal jurisdiction being practiced by \nsome European nations. It has now become a matter of \nharassment for African leaders. We discussed the matter \nat length at the summit, and we intend to raise this issue \nwith the United Nations for appropriate attention. \n Once again, I would like to reiterate the support \nof the African Union and Tanzania of your efforts, Sir, \nin fulfilling our collective objectives during this sixty-\nthird session of the General Assembly. Count on our \nsupport; rely on our support. "

        "file_text": "On behalf of the delegation of the Republic \nof Nicaragua \u2014 cradle of Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo and Augusto C. \nSandino, the home of a people firmly committed to \ntheir principle, their efforts for a better world and their \ncalling for universal peace \u2014 I extend the brotherly \ngreeting of our President, Comandante Daniel Ortega \nSaavedra, and of all our authorities and citizens. \n Listening to the words of the representatives of \nthe States taking part in this sixty-third session of the \nGeneral Assembly, we find that we have a common \nvision of the major serious problems affecting all \nhumankind today. In particular, we agree on the urgent \nneed to act as one in facing those problems and solving \nthem successfully, once and for all, for the benefit of \nthose who inhabit planet Earth. \n Hunger, poverty, the high cost of oil and food, the \ntragic consequences of climate change, terrorism, the \nurgent need to observe human rights worldwide, the \ntrafficking of and trade in persons, drug trafficking and \ncivil insecurity are, among other issues, matters that \nmust lead us to focus our attention and our efforts. \n At the same time, they are questions that arise \nfrom the nature and functioning of our Organization \nand that call for in-depth consideration so that we can \nmake this Organization more effective and democratic, \nwith sufficient guarantees, and so that all countries of \nthe world represented here can have our interests taken \ninto account, our voices heard and our will expressed \nin the most transparent and effective way possible.  \n For Nicaragua, an international system based on \nthe hegemony of a few over the majority is \nunthinkable. Such an anachronistic system, unjust in its \nvery essence, is the reason for the deep political, \neconomic and social inequality in the world. It is the \nreason for the accelerated and advanced arms race led \nby countries that have set themselves up as world \nreferees in situations affecting us all. It is the reason \nfor wars of aggression that behind the smokescreen of \nthe globalization of democracy and the promotion of \ncertain freedoms, illegally and illegitimately \nappropriate scarce energy and natural resources and \nlead to the political subjugation and grief of entire \npeoples deprived of their freedom, national \nindependence and their right to their own development. \n The international security situation has become \nincreasingly volatile in various parts of the world, \nbringing new threats to international peace and security \nand to peoples\u2019 desire for peace. We must act \nintelligently, cautiously and resolutely to ensure that \nnew fratricidal wars do not assail the world. Therefore, \nwe agree with the priority given by the President of our \nGeneral Assembly to actions aimed at achieving \ncomprehensive and complete disarmament and nuclear \ncontrol. \n As a country that has fought and continues to \nfight for its independence, sovereignty and \nself-determination, and as the victim of military and \nforeign political intervention several times in its \nhistory, Nicaragua understood early on that there was \nno greater value than freedom. Our national heroes, \nthose who fought in our wars for freedom, are taintless \nwitnesses to the determination of the Nicaraguan \npeople to have a free homeland or death. \n \n \n43 08-52272 \n \n The persistence of poverty and inequality in the \nworld today cannot be justified. Hunger and poverty \nare sapping economic and social progress for future \ngenerations. Despite the efforts made in recent years, \nthe gap between the rich and poor has continued to \ngrow, and millions of people now suffer from hunger \nand live in poverty or in extreme poverty. It is ethically \nand politically crucial to put an end to that long-\nstanding injustice to so many human beings. \n The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \nawait greater impetus from countries, primarily those \nwith larger economic resources, and from international \nfinancial organizations, which are also called upon to \ncontribute to their accomplishment. Those countries \nand bodies must clearly demonstrate their genuine \npolitical will to achieve all the MDGs and that they are \nnot merely paying lip service to them. \n It was established in the Monterrey Consensus, \nadopted at the International Conference on Financing \nfor Development, that the Bretton Woods institutions, \nthe World Trade Organization and the United Nations \nmust recognize the needs and interests of developing \ncountries and make them central to the work of the \nfinancing for development programme to be reviewed \nin Doha this year. \n By and large, we can say that most donors are not \nhonouring the pledges they made to increase their aid \nunconditionally. United Nations calculations on the \ntotal official development assistance needed between \n2010 and 2015 in order to achieve the MDGs amount \nto some $130 billion per year. However, global arms \nexpenditures in 2007 alone reached some $1.399 \ntrillion, according to the Stockholm International Peace \nResearch Institute. Today more than ever, the \ncommitment to allocating at least 0.7 per cent of gross \nnational income for official development assistance \nwithout condition must be honoured so that developing \ncountries can have these resources available for our \nnational priorities. \n Nicaragua reiterates that, in order to consolidate \nour efforts in the coming years to eradicate poverty, \nextreme poverty, hunger and unemployment, we must \nfirst eradicate the unjust relationships among States. \nThose injustices can be felt most tangibly in unfair and \nimbalanced trade relations between the rich and the \npoor countries. \n My country calls for a fair international market \nand fair, democratic and balanced international trade \nthat will contribute to strengthening the economy of \nour countries, allow us to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, and end the criminalization of \nmigration by some receiving countries. \n We must ensure the maximum possible economic \ncomplementarity among all countries of the world. The \ndeveloping countries are working hard on that issue in \nthe context of South-South cooperation. We note the \nsuccesses that have been achieved in very little time in \nsome regions, such as the agreements between some \nLatin American and Caribbean countries.  \n The Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas has \nbecome a comprehensive platform for cooperation for a \nnumber of our countries, complementing their \neconomies. The complementarity we have built seeks \nto create advantages for our raw materials and \nagricultural products, as well as for our fishing, \nmineral and energy resources, to mention but a few. We \nneed complementarity, solidarity and the accelerated \ntransformation of purely economic relationships based \non a sense of shared responsibility and unity in the face \nof the major challenges of the present and the future. \n Nothing could be further from that spirit than \nunbridled capitalism, which is speculative and \ninefficient and has led the world economy into a \nserious crisis the effects of which, according to some \nexperts, we are only just beginning to feel, as we have \nseen recently in the United States financial system. \n Just a few hours ago, the President of the World \nBank, Robert Zoellick, told the world press that the \nUnited States financial crisis will have a severe effect \non development assistance, primarily that earmarked \nfor the poorest countries. In other words, the crisis in \nthe financial system will have serious repercussions on \nour peoples. The same solutions being sought to avoid \ncollapse will need to include measures to ensure that \nour peoples are not affected by a crisis that we have not \nbrought on ourselves but that we may pay for with \nworsening poverty and a further delay in our \ndevelopment. \n We have also seen that multilateralism in \ninternational relations is a means to achieve mutually \nrespectful relationships and peaceful coexistence and \nto implement development policies based on our own \nrealities. In that conviction, we have been actively \ncommitted to the principles and objectives of the Non-\nAligned Movement. The reconciliation and national \nunity Government of Nicaragua, presided over by \n  \n \n08-52272 44 \n \nPresident Daniel Ortega Saavedra, is firmly committed \nto that vision of the world and is working hand in hand \nwith the people to rebuild a country that, after almost \ntwo decades of neoliberalism following a decade of \nunjust war that was firmly condemned by the \nInternational Court of Justice, was in a state of \npolitical, social and economic collapse. \n Our Government seeks to overcome poverty and \nto transform Nicaragua through a new alternative \nmodel of development that is more just and a new \npower structure that is truly democratic. Citizens will \nplay a leading role in carrying out that task and will \ndirectly redefine the path of the country in line with \ntheir own interests. \n We propose to improve the quality of life of our \npeople by basing our policies on principles to defend \nthe environment and nature and to conserve our natural \nheritage. We must establish a participatory new world \nenvironmental order with clearly set goals that puts an \nend to the commercial and utilitarian exploitation of \nour planetary resources that, as has now been proven, \nare being depleted at an uncontrollable rate. Those \nefforts must also include the commitment of the \ncountries that are the largest emitters of the greenhouse \ngases that have resulted in global warming and have \nalready had other negative and irreversible effects on \nthe planet.  \n We are also focusing on the development of food \nsovereignty as a means of feeding our people through \nour own domestic efforts and through unconditional \nsolidarity with brotherly peoples. At the same time, \nfood security will guarantee that every Nicaraguan has \nreliable access to nutritious food at a fair cost so as to \nlead a healthy and active life. \n We are developing programmes to eradicate \nhunger and profiteering. We are providing low-cost \nseeds, stoves and butane tanks for low-income \nfamilies. We are also supporting small businesses and \nworking for the establishment of a bank to encourage \nproduction. \n For Nicaragua, the word \u201csolidarity\u201d is not an \nempty concept, but rather the cement of the society we \nwish to build. With that in mind, I cannot fail to stress \nat this general debate the solidarity of my people with \nthe Government and people of Bolivia, who have been \nsubject to unacceptable and ongoing attempts to \ndestabilize the country. The indigenous people of \nBolivia, led by President Evo Morales, have taught us \nall a lesson in democracy by defending the democracy \nthat they have gained after years of humiliating \nmarginalization. \n Once again, Nicaragua denounces the cruel \nblockade maintained against Cuba in violation of \ninternational law. That pathological obsession against \nCuba seems to justify all actions and ignores that \ncountry\u2019s own problems in combating the terrorism \nthat has been brought from this country to that \nCaribbean island. The five Cuban patriots who have \nbeen jailed in Florida for attempting to prevent terrorist \nacts against the Cuban people should be set free. \n Although it may seem untrue, the process of \ndecolonization is not over. Entire peoples are still \noppressed and denied their right to independence and \nto self-determination. We salute and stand side by side \nwith the people of Puerto Rico and the Western Sahara, \nwith the Polisario Front, and with Argentina in \nopposition to the occupation of the Malvinas Islands. \nWe also firmly reiterate our call for freedom for the \nCypriot people and for putting an end to the partition \nof that great nation.  \n We support a comprehensive and peaceful \nsolution in the Middle East that will end once and for \nall the horrors of war and allow the Palestinian and \nIsraeli people to live as brothers and sisters, and in \nwhich the Palestinian people can finally enjoy all of \ntheir rights and have a State of their own. \n We are convinced that, if we are to achieve the \nnoble objectives embraced by our Organization, we \nneed the true political will to devote time and energy to \nreviewing our own house. That is even more important \nin a world of constant change and crisis and requires \neach of us \u2014 our peoples and our States \u2014 to be active \nparticipants in our own future. As has been said before, \nwe must work together to democratize the United \nNations. We are pleased to welcome the proposal of the \nPresident of the General Assembly to hold a high-level \ndialogue on the democratization of the Organization, in \nwhich we would consider one by one the pressing \nproblems of and between its various bodies. We are \nprepared to play a constructive role in that necessary \nand urgent dialogue. \n The times our peoples are facing and the \nresponsibilities we have here in this house will be \ndecisive for millions of people, now and for future \ngenerations. It is urgent that we find points of \n \n \n45 08-52272 \n \nconvergence so that we can work together to meet the \nchallenges of the times and our responsibilities.  \n The United Nations Charter is a fundamental \nreference point to guide our action. In respecting the \nCharter and ensuring that it is respected, we are \nrespecting ourselves. Its principles must prevail over \nselfish and petty interests. Above all, the future of \nhumankind is at stake. \n Nicaragua reaffirms its call for peace and \nhumanism to contribute to a more just, more humane \nand more united world in which individual destinies, \ninterconnected and inspired by their love of justice and \nfreedom, come together in the universal task of \ncreating a world that is better for all. \n As was said yesterday at the high-level event on \nthe Millennium Development Goals, the unjust \ninternational order in which we live must change if it is \nto be credible, legitimate and effective. Fundamental \ndecisions cannot continue to be taken by one, seven or \neight stakeholders and without the participation of the \nvast majority of humankind. Solutions to this situation \nare well known and well accepted, at least in principle.  \n Through the millenniums and centuries, our \nspecies has developed institutions \u2014 and above all,  \n \nlaw \u2014 in order to govern human relations and to \nmediate conflicts through peaceful means. More \nrecently, humankind has developed democracy to that \nend and, in particular, in order to structure power and \nauthority peacefully. Those are the solutions that our \nspecies has developed over the millenniums, and it is \ndifficult to imagine another alternative.  \n The question before us now is whether we have \nthe political will to apply democracy at the \ninternational level, beginning by democratizing the \nUnited Nations and by strengthening international law \nwithin the framework of United Nations institutions. \nThat is the solution. That is what will overcome the \nchronically postponed solutions to problems and help \nus to deal efficiently with urgent new problems. It is \npossible. Why not? We are speaking of human \ninstitutions that we ourselves can change. The question \nis whether or not we have the political will to do so. I \npropose that we work together at this sixty-third \nsession of the General Assembly to build that political \nwill through increasingly broader progressive \nconsensus. "

        "file_text": "The international \ncommunity is increasingly confronted with old \nproblems coupled with a new set of challenges of a \ntruly global nature. And as Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon said at the opening meeting, under these \ncircumstances we face another daunting challenge \u2014 \nthe challenge of global leadership. \n We, the united nations of the world, must indeed \nexercise our leadership, authority and responsibility \nunder these increasingly complex circumstances. We \nneed to start here, at the United Nations, notably in the \nSecurity Council, but also in the General Assembly, the \nEconomic and Social Council and other bodies. \nCooperation among our countries and with \ninternational organizations must broaden. Real \npartnerships with the private sector and civil society \nmust be pursued more vigorously. \n \n \n51 08-52265 \n \n As part of the European Union efforts, we \npromote coordinated measures to help developing \ncountries increase the food supply and tackle the \ncurrent crises in a sustainable manner. Furthermore, \nfairer international trade rules must be adopted to \nstimulate agriculture production, beginning in \ndeveloping countries, and to allow access to foodstuffs. \n This year we are at the midpoint of assessing the \nachievements in moving towards reaching the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. So \nfar, overall progress on the MDGs has been uneven, at \nbest. Moreover, rising food prices, record energy costs, \nenergy and pipeline security challenges, climate \nchange, growing scarcity of water resources and the \nrecent meltdown of financial centres that started here \nin the United States \u2014 all that threatens to reverse the \nexisting advances towards the MDGs. Most, if not all, \nof the MDG targets can still be reached, but only if we \nall work towards them with doubled energy and \ncommitment. \n As a former recipient country that has \nsuccessfully navigated the transition process, Slovakia \nitself now also provides official development \nassistance to help meet the MDGs, among other goals. \n We are pleased that the democratization of the \nUnited Nations is among the key priorities of the year. \nWe support democratization in the sense of increased \npartnership among the key United Nations bodies and \nof respect for one other\u2019s mandates. \n Slovakia would like to place renewed emphasis \non the advancement of the agreed United Nations \nreform measures, including the management reform of \nthe United Nations Secretariat. \n Slovakia remains convinced of the need to reform \nthe Security Council. Based on our own recent \nexperience from serving on the Council, we emphasize \nthe need to make it more representative, more open and \nmore transparent. The Council needs to be enlarged in \nboth its categories. Slovakia supports the ambitions of \nGermany, Japan, Brazil and India to become permanent \nmembers of the Security Council, as well as permanent \nrepresentation of Africa on the Council. The regional \ngroup of Eastern European States needs to be allocated \nat least one additional non-permanent seat. We thus \nfully support the launching of intergovernmental \nnegotiations on Security Council reform. \n This year we mark the sixtieth anniversary of the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. The \npromotion and protection of human rights and \nfundamental freedoms, as well as cultivation of the \nculture of inter-religious and inter-ethnic tolerance, \nremain my country\u2019s priorities for action in the United \nNations. Slovakia was elected a member of the Human \nRights Council this year. We will promote universal \nrespect for the protection of human rights and \nfundamental freedoms for all, without distinction of \nany kind and in a fair and equal manner. \n Justice is a prerequisite for peace, security and \ndevelopment, not a contradiction to them. \nResponsibility to protect should be another leading \npolicy and principle for our joint action, both in \nrelation to genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and \ncrimes against humanity and in cases of large-scale \nnatural disasters and catastrophes. We can no longer \nafford another Rwanda in Darfur or elsewhere. \n In this context, we would like to especially \ncommend the African Union for its increasingly active \nrole in putting an end to the most serious crises in \nAfrica, especially the African Union-United Nations \nHybrid Operation in Darfur and the African Union \nMission in Somalia. Here, I would like to acknowledge \na continuously growing cooperation between the \nEuropean Union and the United Nations, currently in \nsome 20 operations and cases. \n Nationally owned reform of the security sector, \nparticularly in post-conflict environments, is critical to \nconsolidating peace and stability; promoting poverty \nreduction, rule of law and good governance; extending \nlegitimate State authority; and preventing countries \nfrom relapsing into conflict. \n Since its membership in the Security Council, \nSlovakia has been actively engaged in security sector \nreform-related efforts as it works in support of the \nrecommendations of the Secretary-General. We are \ncommitted to continuing our work as coordinator of the \ngroup of friends of security sector reform, as well as to \nfurther promoting regional and subregional activities in \nthat area, following a successful workshop in South \nAfrica and a later one in Asia and Latin America. \n New challenges to global security should not \ndivert our attention from old and more traditional \nthreats. The world is unfortunately full of disputes, \nconflicts and crises. We consistently support their \nresolution through negotiations and peaceful means, \n  \n \n08-52265 52 \n \nwith a central role for the United Nations based on full \nrespect for the principles of international law \u2014 \nnotably those of sovereignty and territorial integrity \u2014 \nand we reject the use of force and unilateral action. \n That is relevant to the recent developments in \nGeorgia and in the Western Balkans, where we \nunderline the importance of the European and \ntransatlantic perspective for all countries as an \nessential element in promoting peace, stability and \neconomic progress in the region. One lesson that we \nhave learned is that frozen conflicts and unresolved \ndisputes, if left to fester, tend at times to move into a \ndangerously hot stage, spread instability and fuel \nextremism. The conflict in the Middle East is telling in \nthat respect. I should like to stress, as others have, that \ncalls from this rostrum for the annihilation of the State \nof Israel are unacceptable and deplorable. \n We all recognize the importance of supporting the \nGovernment of Afghanistan in its efforts to ensure \nstability and development in the country and to prevent \nAfghanistan from becoming once again a haven for \nterrorists. This year, Slovakia has decided to double the \nnumber of its soldiers serving in southern Afghanistan, \nbut it is obvious that lasting peace and stability in \nAfghanistan will depend on solid improvements in the \nliving conditions of Afghan citizens and in good \ngovernance. \n Slovakia supports enhanced United Nations \ncooperation in implementing the Global Counter-\nTerrorism Strategy. To be more effective, we need an \nagreement on a comprehensive United Nations \nconvention against international terrorism as soon as \npossible. \n The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \nand their means of delivery continues to pose a serious \nthreat to international peace and security. We are in \nparticular concerned about our inability to close the \nissue of the Iran nuclear programme in a way that \nwould be considered by all to be in conformity with the \nnon-proliferation regime. We welcome the extension of \nthe mandate of the Security Council Committee \nestablished pursuant to resolution 1540 (2004).  \n The tasks confronting us in the year ahead are \nenormous. They can be accomplished only through our \nstrong and sustained political commitment, working \nthrough multilateral mechanisms with the United \nNations in the lead and at the centre.  "

        "file_text": "On behalf of my \npeople and the Government of Papua New Guinea, I \nbring the General Assembly warm greetings and pledge \nour support to you, Mr. President, as you guide us in \nour work. We also wish to thank Mr. Kerim, your \npredecessor, for his strong advocacy during his tenure \nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second \nsession, especially in the area of climate change. We \nalso support Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the \nUnited Nations in general, especially its agencies, in \nthe work they do to enhance our development \naspirations in Papua New Guinea. As we have always \ndone, my Government continues to support the United \nNations.  \n The United Nations currently provides the world \nforum for Member States to address the many global \nissues we face together. United Nations reforms need \nto be carried out in all the relevant areas of the system. \nWe need to address the international gender \narchitecture to make it more robust, responsive and \neffective. It has to be part of the core reform process to \ncater for women, youth and children. We must also be \nvigilant against terrorism and threats to international \npeace and security. The One UN system needs to be \ntranslated more meaningfully in order to effectively \nenhance each Member State\u2019s development priorities. \n We support the call for the reform of the Security \nCouncil in both the permanent and non-permanent \n A/63/PV.13\n \n3 08-53122 \n \ncategories of membership. A number of emerging \ndeveloping countries need to be accorded permanent \nstatus on the Council to better reflect today\u2019s \ncircumstances. We therefore welcome the recent \nconsensus to initiate the intergovernmental negotiating \nprocess to properly address the long-standing but \ncritical issue of United Nations reform. \n We live in a world that provides us many \nopportunities, as well as formidable development \nchallenges. The challenges include addressing the \ndestructive effects of the illicit use of small arms and \nlight weapons and the need to address globalization \nand food and energy security, which lead into the wider \nissue of human security. \n Additionally, the adverse impacts of climate \nchange and global warming continue to threaten the \nexistence of many small island States, especially due to \nrising sea levels. For many small island States, sea \nlevel rise and the adverse impacts of climate change \nare security issues threatening their very survival. We \ntherefore call upon the international community to act \nurgently in order to ensure the security and welfare of \nsmall island developing States. \n As a thriving democracy in the Pacific, Papua \nNew Guinea desires to see our friends and neighbours \nin the Pacific and beyond enjoy freedom and \nprosperity. In that regard, and consistent with the \ndecision of the leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum, \nPapua New Guinea strongly encourages Fiji to restore \nparliamentary democracy by preparing for elections \nand holding them in 2009. However, Fiji must be \nsupported throughout, and not isolated in its efforts to \naddress its specific national circumstances.  \n On other regional issues, Papua New Guinea \ncommends the work done so far on the Pacific Plan for \nStrengthening Regional Cooperation and Integration, \nwhich we believe may catalyse our region\u2019s \ndevelopment. It is Papua New Guinea\u2019s strong view \nthat Member States from the Pacific region should be \ncategorized separately by the United Nations in terms \nof aggregated data and in the area of social and \neconomic classification. While Papua New Guinea is \nready, we can support Vanuatu\u2019s call for an extension \nto the May 2009 deadline for submissions on an \nextended continental shelf. \n The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \nprovide us with one of the greatest opportunities to \nleverage our development process. For that reason, we \ncommend the Secretary-General for convening the \nhigh-level meeting on the MDGs during the present \nsession of the General Assembly. However, for the \nMDGs to be effectively implemented, they must be \naddressed consistent with national circumstances and \nwith host-country leadership. Further, for the MDGs to \nbe effective over the long term, developing countries \nmust take ownership of the Goals. \n At the midway point of MDG implementation, for \nPapua New Guinea, we believe there is cause for \ncautious optimism. Papua New Guinea celebrated \n33 years of unbroken constitutional democracy on \n16 September this year. Due to the political stability \nachieved by my Government, we can now afford to \nplan long-term for our own development. We have had \nsteady economic growth in the last five years, due to \nprudent economic management that has resulted in five \nsuccessive budget surpluses. \n Achieving the Millennium Development Goals \nremains an integral development priority for my \nGovernment. We have set ourselves 15 national targets \nand 67 indicators, which have been integrated into our \nmedium-term development strategy and sectoral plans. \n For example, Papua New Guinea recognizes that \neducation is a prerequisite for the betterment of our \npeople\u2019s lives. That is entrenched in our constitution \nand prioritized under a 10-year national education plan. \nThe current one-laptop-per-child pilot project will \nmake learning accessible, enjoyable and fruitful for our \nchildren, while bridging the digital divide. We are \nlooking to expand the project nationwide during the \nAfrica Caribbean Pacific-European Union Joint \nParliamentary Assembly, to be held in Papua New \nGuinea in November. In partnership with UNICEF, we \nhave also introduced proactive programmes aimed at \naccelerating the girl-child\u2019s access to education. \n In the area of health, there remain major \nchallenges, such as maternal mortality and HIV/AIDS, \nwhich the Government is now addressing through the \n10-year national health plan. We have also recorded \nsome positive results in other major health indicators, \nincluding a decrease in malaria incidence and in \nmalaria-related deaths, and the stabilization and \ndecline of infant and child mortality. \n Ultimately, reducing poverty, expanding access to \neducation and health and empowering women through \neconomic and social participation are what we in my \nGovernment are addressing. \nA/63/PV.13  \n \n08-53122 4 \n \n Millennium Development Goal 8 makes reference \nto partnerships. We strongly believe that Goal is \ncritical to the achievement of the other seven. We \nbelieve, however, that all partnerships must be \nunderpinned by mutual respect among the partners. For \nthat reason, let me highlight some key partnerships. \nOur partnerships with Australia, New Zealand, the \nEuropean Union, Japan, China, Italy, Austria and many \nnon-governmental organizations continue to contribute \nstrongly to Papua New Guinea\u2019s development. We also \npartner with the Coral Triangle Initiative on coral reefs, \nfisheries and food security, and the Forest-11 Group, \nlaunched last year by His Excellency the President of \nIndonesia. Another important partnership is with the \nBill and Melinda Gates Foundation, facilitated by the \nClinton Foundation, in the area of HIV/AIDS and the \nprovision of antiretrovirals. \n To succeed, we must significantly scale up our \npartnerships. Often, we all tend to wallow in the \nnegative \u2014 environmental degradation, catastrophic \nclimate change, crippling poverty, ineffective \ngovernance \u2014 rather than leveraging the positive. My \nGovernment\u2019s vision is to transform those societal \nchallenges into a framework for environmentally and \nsocially sustainable economic growth. It is time to cast \noff policy chains of the past and create a new paradigm \nfor the future. \n Let me be specific. First, we cannot account for \nthe environment as an externality. Our natural \nenvironment and its services are not free to society. \nOnce we lose those services, often irreversibly, the \ncosts can be significant. \n Secondly, we must create a broad framework for \necosystem service markets. Carbon sequestration must \nonly be the first step, followed by valuations for \nbiodiversity, water purification, rainfall generation, \ncrop pollination and food security.  \n Thirdly, we must now view our natural \nenvironment as an engine for wealth creation. Those \nvaluable ecosystem services must be transformed into \nlasting wealth that supports the rural communities that \nhave traditionally cared for those assets. \n Let me use the issue of reducing deforestation \nand forest degradation \u2014 an issue that our Prime \nMinister, Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare, has \nchampioned internationally \u2014 as an example. \nDeforestation is a complex subject, but, put simply, it \nis driven by the fact that the world values forests more \ndead than alive. Traditional economic theory, which \nconsiders ecosystem services a common good and thus \nfree to all, is primarily responsible for the massive loss \nof the world\u2019s forests. \n With those ecosystem services valued at zero, \nrural communities that depend on and care for forests \nmust make a living in other ways. Keeping the land \nforested means sacrificing the opportunities to be \ngained by converting it to other uses, such as \nproducing commodities such as timber, palm oil, coffee \nand cocoa. The international commodity markets, in \nfact, have hardly changed from colonial times. \n In many ways, those two economic relics are \nincreasingly perverse and nonsensical. The \nenvironment is devastated, rural communities stay poor \nand the rich shift the blame. They cite lack of \ngovernance and corruption, but those are not drivers of \ndeforestation, but symptoms of obsolete market \nconstructs. \n Therefore, global leaders must redraft economic \ntheory and reinvent global markets for a sustainable \nfuture. For example, the latest estimate is that \napproximately $20 billion a year will be needed to \nhalve carbon emissions resulting from deforestation. \nHowever, that would be a wise investment, even for \nthat one ecosystem service alone. Forests sequester \nsome 3.3 billion tons of carbon dioxide annually. So, \nwith today\u2019s price of more than $30 per ton of carbon \ndioxide, rural communities are effectively subsidizing \nthe carbon emissions of the rich to the tune of \napproximately $100 billion per year \u2014 more than total \nannual official development assistance.  \n Norway has provided great leadership towards \nthat necessary paradigm shift. First, Norway has stood \nup against global climate change and has targeted the \nachievement of carbon neutrality by 2030. Norway has \nalso dedicated $2.8 billion to offset emissions \nreductions resulting from deforestation in developing \ncountries, through the valuation of forest ecosystem \nservices. \n Faced by the ravages of climate change on a \nsmall island developing State, our Prime Minister, Sir \nMichael Somare, has charted out his own bold goals: \nreducing Papua New Guinea\u2019s emissions by 50 per cent \nbefore 2025 and achieving carbon neutrality before \n2050. Sharing a similar vision, the partnership of \nleadership between Papua New Guinea and Norway \nmay significantly address several of the greatest \n A/63/PV.13\n \n5 08-53122 \n \nchallenges of our time: effectively valuing global \nenvironmental services, contributing to the mitigation \nof climate change, conserving global biodiversity and \nfinancing the achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals in rural areas. \n Finally, our global economy values companies in \nthe billions simply for advertising trinkets on the \nInternet. Some countries make billions by selling fossil \nfuels that pollute our atmosphere, others by producing \nlow-cost consumer products that humanity does not \nrequire. In fact, Google is worth $150 billion, while the \nworld\u2019s last great tropical forests left standing are \nworth nothing. How can that be right?  \n Together, we must reconstruct our value \nframeworks. New environmental markets must support \ntropical countries striving to achieve sustainable \ndevelopment, by generating billions from rainforest \necosystem services that humanity has so far been \nexploiting for free. \n Several communities in my country have voted to \ncancel their logging concessions, telling me that the \nforests and rivers have provided all they needed for \nthousands of years. In some ways, however, they now \nfeel trapped. The old ways allowed them to survive but \ndid not prepare their children for an increasingly \ncomplex future. They now struggle with schools that \ncannot afford the best teachers and with health centres \nthat provide only basic medicines. Yet those \ncommunities still remember how to live sustainably \u2014 \na skill that many others have forgotten in the rush to \nget ahead. \n But there is hope. Bold leadership is required on \nboth sides of the economic divide to transform the way \nin which we value our environment and create wealth \nfor rural populations. As leaders, we must understand \nthat, while we may have inherited the Earth from our \nforefathers, we have in fact borrowed it from our \ngrandchildren and our future generations. Indeed, by \nlearning to save our environment, perhaps we can once \nagain learn how to save ourselves and guarantee a \nbetter world for our future generations.  "

        "file_text": "On behalf of the United Arab \nEmirates, I have the pleasure to express to you, \nMr. President, and to your friendly country our sincere \ncongratulations on your election as President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-third session. I would \nalso like to thank your predecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, \nfor successfully guiding the proceedings of the \nprevious session. I should also take this opportunity to \nexpress my gratitude to Secretary-General Ban Ki-\nmoon for his unceasing efforts to strengthen the \nOrganization and re-energize its role in international \naffairs. \n The United Arab Emirates has made major \nprogress in a number of domestic areas. For example, \nwe have increased the representation of women in our \nexecutive and legislative bodies, including by \nexpanding their effective participation in the labour \nmarket. We are developing national laws on the \nprotection of and respect for human rights and are \nmaking significant efforts to improve the welfare of \nthose with special needs. Attempts are also under way \nto enact legislation to regulate foreign workers in order \nto ensure their full rights. In keeping with our \ncommitments under relevant bilateral and international \nagreements, we are also increasing our efforts to \ncombat human trafficking and to provide protection \nand all the necessary support for its victims. \n With regard to the environment, the United Arab \nEmirates attaches great importance to environmental \nissues. In cooperation with the Worldwide Fund for \nNature, we have launched a number of ambitious \nstrategic programmes, such as the development of \nMasdar City, which will be the world\u2019s first carbon- \nand waste-free city, completely dependent on \nrenewable and clean technologies such as solar energy, \nwhich will be used to generate power and desalinate of \nwater. \n Foreign aid has an important place on our \nnational agenda. We have continued to provide various \ntypes of financial and humanitarian assistance to many \ncountries to help them to fund their development \nprogrammes and infrastructure projects. Directly and \nthrough our membership in the United Nations Office \nfor the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs Donor \nSupport Group and our contributions to the specialized \nagencies and programmes of the United Nations, we \nare also providing assistance to those who have \nsuffered from wars and natural disasters. \n In order to alleviate the suffering of millions of \npeople as a result of rising food prices, my country has \ndispatched 2 million tons of wheat to Yemen, Syria and \nEgypt. Also as part of our foreign aid, we have \nprovided additional financial assistance to help several \ndeveloping countries adjust to the phenomenal increase \nin their energy costs. \n In that regard, we would like to express our \nconcern about the repercussions of the financial crisis \nin international markets. We reiterate that this matter \nurgently calls for a joint international mechanism that \nwill contribute to the establishment of strong and \ntransparent rules to regulate international financial \nmarkets.  \n The way in which development has taken place in \nthe United Arab Emirates provides a vivid example of \ntolerance and coexistence. We hope to enrich and \nstrengthen those values through our educational and \ncultural programmes, for we strongly believe that \ninteraction between different nations and peoples is \nboth of fundamental importance and an essential \nprerequisite for the achievement of stability, welfare \nand prosperity in our region.  \nA/63/PV.13  \n \n08-53122 32 \n \n The United Arab Emirates therefore attaches \ngreat importance to radically restructuring and \nmodernizing our educational system to align it with \ntechnological and educational innovations so that it \nmeets the needs and requirements of our development \nprogrammes. We also believe that providing education \nfor all is one of the major and significant issues facing \nus. It is essential that we devote all our resources to it, \nfor in education lies the hope that we can break the evil \ncycle of poverty and ignorance, which in turn lead to \nthe creation of a fertile environment in which terrorism \nand extremism can take root and grow. \n Iran\u2019s ongoing occupation since 1971 of the \nUnited Arab Emirates\u2019` three islands of Abu Musa and \nGreater and Lesser Tunb is an issue of central \nimportance to us. From this rostrum, I would like to \nreiterate our firm position demanding the full \nrestoration of our full sovereignty over the three \noccupied islands and their territorial waters, airspace, \ncontinental shelf and exclusive economic zone. The \nislands are part and parcel of our national sovereignty. \nWe reiterate that all actions and measures, whether \nmilitary or administrative, undertaken by Iran since its \noccupation of the three islands are null and void. Iran\u2019s \nactions have no legal effect. We therefore renew our \ncall to the international community to urge Iran to \nrespond positively to the sincere appeals of the United \nArab Emirates, the Gulf Cooperation Council and the \nLeague of Arab States by agreeing to resolve the issue \nthrough committed and serious direct negotiations or \nby referring the dispute to the International Court of \nJustice. \n We strongly believe in making the Middle East, \nincluding the Arabian Gulf, a zone free from weapons \nof mass destruction. That would require compelling \nIsrael to comply with United Nations resolutions by \nbringing its nuclear facilities into compliance with the \nsafeguards regime of the International Atomic Energy \nAgency (IAEA) and unconditionally signing the Treaty \non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, as other \ncountries of the region have done. We also urge the \nIslamic Republic of Iran to continue its cooperation \nwith the IAEA and the international community in \norder to dispel fears and suspicions related to the \nnature and objectives of its nuclear programme. We \nalso call on all other stakeholders to commit \nthemselves to continuing to address that issue through \npolitical and diplomatic means in order to avoid \nescalation and achieve a peaceful solution that can \nensure stability and security for the region and its \npeoples. \n Based on our firm belief in the right of countries \nto develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in \naccordance with the safeguards regime of the IAEA, \nthe United Arab Emirates urges developed nations to \nsupport the legitimate needs of developing countries \nfor access to nuclear energy by providing them with \nthe best possible access to the equipment, nuclear \nmaterials and technological and scientific know-how \nrelated to peaceful purposes. The United Arab Emirates \nbelieves that its peaceful nuclear programme provides \na practical and responsible example of transparency in \nmeeting our energy needs, while at the same time we \npledge not to engage in enrichment or reprocessing, \nwith the support of the organizations and institutions of \nsome friendly countries and under the supervision of \nthe IAEA. \n On another front, the United Arab Emirates has \ncontinuously spared no effort to support and promote \nevery regional and international effort to help the \nGovernment of Iraq and its people. It is our hope that \nthe latest initiatives of the United Arab Emirates, \nincluding the write-off of more than $7 billion in debt \nand interest due and the re-opening of our embassy in \nBaghdad, will contribute to promoting economic \ndevelopment and strengthening the political process. \nThat will require the renunciation of all communal and \nsectarian violence and full commitment to the unity, \nsovereignty and stability of Iraq, the preservation of its \nArab identity and the rejection of any attempts to \ndivide or fragment the country. \n With regard to the Middle East, the United Arab \nEmirates has strongly supported the Palestinian-Israeli \npeace process, including final status negotiations and \nthe outcome of the Annapolis Conference. In that \ncontext, we would like to express our concerns about \nthe lack of earnest in Israel\u2019s attitude towards those \nnegotiations. We call on the international community, \nand in particular the Security Council and the members \nof the Quartet, to press Israel to lift the siege it has \nimposed on the Palestinian people and to implement \ninternational resolutions related to freezing all of its \nillegal settlement activity, dismantling unlawful \nsettlements and ending its occupation of all Palestinian \nand Arab territories occupied since 1967, including the \nholy city of Jerusalem, the Golan Heights and some \nLebanese territories. Ending the occupation would \nbring Israel into compliance with relevant international \n A/63/PV.13\n \n33 08-53122 \n \nresolutions, the road map and the Arab peace initiative. \nIt would also ensure the establishment of an \nindependent Palestinian State with Jerusalem as its \ncapital, as well as Israel\u2019s security. \n My country has cooperated effectively and \nconsistently with every effort to combat terrorism in all \nits forms and manifestations, including money-\nlaundering. We shall continue to do so in order to rid \nthe world of that scourge and its causes. At the same \ntime, we re-emphasize our support for all activities to \npromote dialogue among civilizations and enhance the \nspirit of tolerance among all faiths. \n In closing, I would like to stress the need for full \ncompliance with the Charter of the United Nations and \ninternational law in meeting the daunting challenges \nahead. I hope that this session will produce \ninternational consensus on how to address those \nchallenges for the benefit of humankind.  "

        "file_text": "On \nbehalf of my delegation and on my own behalf, I would \nlike to most warmly congratulate you, Mr. President, \non your election to presidency of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-third session. The delegation of Chad is \nconvinced that your qualities and experience in the \narea of international relations will ensure success for \nour current session, and we would like to assure you of \nour cooperation as you carry out your mission. I would \nalso like to express our gratitude to your predecessor \nfor having skilfully and insightfully steered the work of \nthe Assembly at its sixty-second session. I also pay a \nwell-deserved tribute to our Secretary-General, His \nExcellency Ban Ki-moon, for his commitment to \nupholding and promoting the ideals of our Organization.  \n The sixty-third session is being held at a time \nwhen the world is facing many challenges. The armed \nconflicts affecting essentially all continents are \ncompounded by the food, energy and financial crises \nthat endanger the most vulnerable populations. Those \nrecurring crises are genuine handicaps to implementing \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), to which \nthe international community has committed itself.  \n Chad, like many other countries, found itself \nearly on in an adverse political, social and economic \nsituation, despite the implementation of its national \ngrowth and poverty reduction strategy. That strategy, \nwhich was updated in 2008, is, however, the best \nframework for cooperation geared towards pooling all \nnational and international efforts that are essentially \naimed at achieving the MDGs. To be sure, the \nMillennium Declaration was welcomed in its time as a \n  \n \n08-53135 24 \n \nmajor step in the international community\u2019s awareness \nof the considerable lag of many of its members with \nrespect to development.  \n The Declaration and the MDGs, which we \nadopted in 2000 to eradicate poverty by 2015, are \ntoday still the most appropriate response to the \nproblems of poverty that many countries, including my \nown, continue to face. Those problems include \nshortfalls in terms of the resources necessary to fund \nour programmes, but also, and particularly, the unrest \nthat has resulted from the many attempts at \ndestabilization and that is worsened by incursions of \nmercenaries and armed militias of all kinds. The most \nnotable of such incidents took place in April 2006 and \nFebruary 2008.  \n To be sure, the development of our oil, which \nbegan in 2003, has given the country additional \nresources. But those resources do not, unfortunately, \nmeet our needs. Outside assistance is therefore \nnecessary in a number of areas in order to build our \ncapacities to better meet the challenges of poverty.  \n Contributions by our partners \u2014 although we \nwould like to reiterate our gratitude to them and \ncommend their commitment to us \u2014 need to be \nadapted. Such contributions should, as a priority, be \naimed at building the country\u2019s ability to take action, in \nparticular by developing its natural wealth, and should \nprovide more substantial financial and technical \nsupport in that context.  \n More flexible conditions with respect to easing \nthe external debt of poor countries are indispensable. \nGreater attention should also be given to the economic \nproblems facing developing countries, specifically \nthose in Africa, where the future of some could be \nthreatened by the lack of competitiveness of their \nexport products because of measures taken by their \ncompetitors in the North. My country hopes that the \noutpouring of solidarity that underpinned the launching \nof the MDGs process will be revived in order to reduce \ninequalities, which worsen poverty and which are \nultimately sources of tension, with unpredictable \nconsequences. At any rate, Chad continues to be \ndetermined to do its utmost to improve the living \nconditions of its people within the framework of the \nMDGs. \n I would like to commend the efforts of our \nOrganization in eradicating hotspots of tension that are \nmajor obstacles to the implementation of development \ngoals. The Darfur crisis is an example of that, due to \nthe burden that it has placed on Chad as a result of its \neconomic, social and environmental repercussions. The \npresence in eastern Chad of 290,000 Sudanese refugees \nand 180,000 displaced Chadians is a matter of major \nconcern, for both Chad and for the international \ncommunity. We welcome the international community\u2019s \nunprecedented mobilization in that regard.  \n Nevertheless, the fate of the host populations \nshould be given greater attention, in order to restore \nthe balances that were upset by that massive inflow. In \nthat in that part of the world a true tragedy is \noccurring, and it weighs on our collective conscience. I \nwould like to issue here a heartfelt appeal for a lasting \nsolution to that crisis.  \n Furthermore, my country welcomes the extension \nby the Security Council of the mandate of the African \nUnion-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur \n(UNAMID). Chad is persuaded that the international \ncommunity, having assessed the suffering of the people \nof Darfur, will strengthen the operational capacities of \nUNAMID by providing it with all the appropriate \nresources so that it can effectively carry out its mission \nand establish the necessary conditions for a \ncomprehensive and lasting settlement to the crisis.  \n We believe that it is essential to recall here that, \nsince the crisis broke out in Darfur, my country has \nspared no effort to assist its Sudanese brothers in \nfinding a peaceful settlement to the conflict facing \nthem. In August 2003, His Excellency Idriss Deby Itno \nwas the first foreign head of State personally to travel \nto El-Fasher to express his solidarity and support for \nhis Sudanese counterpart, Omer Hassan Al-Bashir, \nwhile calling on the Sudanese rebels to lay down their \narms and agree to a political settlement. We would \nrecall the decisive role he played as mediator to reach \nmany peace agreements between the Sudanese \nGovernment and its opposition.  \n Similarly, aware of the close linkage between \nstability in Chad and the settlement of the crisis in \nDarfur, he has always worked for the normalization of \nrelations between the two countries. It is in that spirit \nthat the Government of Chad welcomed the decision of \nthe Sudan to restore diplomatic relations with Chad at \nthe meeting of the Contact Group tasked with \nimplementing the Dakar Agreement, held in Asmara on \n12 September.  \n \n \n25 08-53135 \n \n At that time, the Government of Chad called the \nContact Group to witness the sincere commitment of \nthe two parties towards a lasting normalization of their \nrelations. Here, I reiterate the gratitude of the \nGovernment of Chad to the member countries of the \nContact Group, institutions and friendly countries for \nthe key positive roles that they continue to play in \nsupporting Chad and the Sudan on that path. \n From this rostrum, we would like to commend the \nclose cooperation among the United Nations Mission in \nthe Central African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT), \nthe European Union-led peacekeeping force and the \nGovernment of Chad. The strengthening of the \nmandate of MINURCAT offers new prospects for \ndeveloping relations between Chad and the United \nNations, taking into account the experience accrued \nduring the preceding mandate. The need for greater \neffectiveness of the international presence in Chad \nrequires dynamic cooperation between the various \nparties. \n Despite the repeated attacks of mercenaries, the \nrepercussions of which on the life of the nation have \nbeen devastating, the Government of Chad, under the \nimpetus of His Excellency Idriss Deby Itno, President \nof the Republic and Head of State, remains committed \nto pursuing political dialogue with the democratic \nopposition and with the armed movements in order to \nbring about national harmony. The tangible results of \nthat policy are the formation on 23 April 2008 of a \nbroad-based Government, led by Youssouf Saleh \nAbbas, which includes leading personalities from the \ndemocratic opposition. We are also pleased to note the \nreturn to legality of several members of the armed \nmovements under the Sirte agreement of 25 October \n2007.  \n We confirm that the political dialogue, initiated \nby the agreement of 13 August 2007 and briefly \ninterrupted by the tragic events of February 2008, has \nresumed its work. It is taking place in a climate of trust \nand understanding and naturally will continue, with the \nassistance of our partners, towards the holding of free \nand transparent elections. Here, I would like to \nreiterate very solemnly to those partners the gratitude \nof the Government and people of Chad for their \nvaluable support in facilitating that dialogue. \n After that overview on national political issues, \nwe would like to address some international challenges \nfacing our Organization.  \n The setback in the recent negotiations in Geneva \nraises questions with respect to the ability to establish a \njust and equitable global trade system that takes into \naccount the legitimate aspirations of developing \ncountries, the most vulnerable in the world economy. \nWhat is more, despite the efforts of the international \ncommunity to reduce tensions and spare the world the \nhorrors of armed conflict, unfortunately we continue to \nsee theatres of confrontation emerge on all continents. \nThe unbearable sight of thousands of women, children \nand elderly people displaced or cast into exile in the \nwake of those conflicts should persuade the \ninternational community to be more responsible.  \n Armed conflicts and the atrocities they cause are \na breeding ground for terrorism. That scourge is \nanother challenge to and major concern for the \ninternational community. My country supports the \nefforts of the United Nations to fight for its complete \neradication, but also for greater justice in addressing \ninternational issues.  \n On issues concerning nuclear matters, we \nreaffirm our country\u2019s unswerving position, which is to \nrespect the sovereign will of States to acquire nuclear \npower for civilian purposes. \n With respect to conflicts on the African continent, \nwe are pleased to note the joint efforts of the African \nUnion and the United Nations to settle them peacefully \nand enduringly. Thus, we welcome the normalization \nof the political and military situation in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, \nKenya and the Comoros. In the Horn of Africa, Chad \nsupports the efforts of the African Union to restore \npeace and national harmony in Somalia. In Zimbabwe, \nwe welcome the political agreement reached between \nthe primary Zimbabwean political players thanks to the \nmediation of President Thabo Mbeke, to whom we pay \nwell-deserved tribute.  \n In conclusion, within the framework of reform of \nthe bodies of the United Nations, and more particularly \nthe Security Council, I should like to reiterate the \nurgent appeal of my country to the Assembly and to the \nmembers of the Security Council for a just and fair \nreform that takes into account the legitimate \naspirations of the African continent.

        "file_text": "I wish to begin by \ncongratulating Mr. d\u2019Escoto Brockmann on assuming \nthe post of President of the General Assembly at its \ncurrent session. \n Today I shall start by addressing the security \nsituation in the world. During the past year, the \ninternational community has deepened its \nunderstanding of frozen conflicts. Frozen does not \nmean resolved; it means that those conflicts are able to \nre-emerge. Therefore, I am particularly glad that \nsignificant progress has been achieved towards \nresolving long-lasting conflicts in some regions. \n First, I would like to mention Kosovo. Strong \ninvolvement by the United Nations, the European \nUnion (EU) and the United States helped to resolve a \nprotracted conflict in the Balkans. Now we need to \nfocus our efforts on the development of Kosovo\u2019s \nstatehood: political stability, economic prosperity, \nsecurity and good relations with its neighbours. \n I welcome the decision of the Secretary-General \nto reconfigure the United Nations Interim \nAdministration Mission in Kosovo. It is necessary to \ncontinue the constructive cooperation between the \nUnited Nations and the EU so that the Kosovo Mission \ncan be fully deployed. That is important both for \nKosovo and for the entire West Balkans region. \n The international community has also made \nremarkable efforts to assist Afghanistan in building a \ndemocratic, prosperous and secure State. Large and \nsmall countries and civilian and military organizations \nfrom all over the world are working together to fulfil \nour common aspiration to peace and stability. \n We must not undermine that immense effort by \nbeing impatient. The war ravaged Afghanistan for  \n20 years; it will take at least as much time to rebuild a \npeaceful society. The international community must \npush ahead until that long-term aim is achieved. \n Latvia is increasing its commitment to the Afghan \npeople in terms of development and security \nassistance. We are focusing our civil engagement on \nensuring good governance and a strong judiciary and \non meeting the basic needs of the Afghan people. \n The prospects for peace and stability in the \nMiddle East affect the whole world. Latvia hopes that \nthe peace negotiations between the Government of \nIsrael and the Palestinian Authority will produce \nresults. We hope that the parties will use the window of \nopportunity to conclude a peace agreement by the end \nof 2008. The indirect talks that have resumed between \nIsrael and Syria are another positive signal.  \n Latvia welcomes the stabilization process in \nLebanon. We hope that the Doha agreement will be \nfully implemented and that it will serve as a solid \nfoundation for renewed political stability, national \nunity and sustainable economic development in the \ncountry. \n Not all of the developments over the past year \nhave been positive. We have witnessed new challenges \nto the law-based international system. We should ask \nourselves whether we, as the international community, \ncan accept the fact that peacekeeping troops protect \nonly one side involved in a conflict. Can we accept the \nfact that peacekeeping forces are occupying territories \nthat are clearly outside the conflict zones? Can we \naccept the fact that the protection of nationals abroad is \nbeing used as a pretext for a large-scale use of force in \nanother State without the approval of the Security \nCouncil? \n All those questions arise from the international \nresponse to the recent war in Georgia. If they matter to \nus, we should have a clear plan to resolve the Georgian \ncrisis. The most important task is adherence to and \nimplementation of the six-point ceasefire agreement on \nthe part of the Russian Federation. First, foreign troops \nmust be removed from all Georgian soil. Equally \nimportant is the establishment of an EU monitoring \nmission to normalize the situation in Georgia. \n For 15 years now, the United Nations has \nmandated the United Nations Observer Mission in \nGeorgia. We must ensure that there are no obstacles to \nthe continuation of that effort. I call upon world leaders \nto come together not only to provide humanitarian aid \nto Georgia, but also to ensure a massive international \neffort to help rebuild the country\u2019s economy and \ninfrastructure.  \n It is about time that we seriously examine our \ndevelopment commitments. The time between now and \n2015 may seem long, but it is less than the time that \nhas elapsed since the adoption of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) in 2000. Two days ago, I \n \n \n17 08-51839 \n \nparticipated in the high-level meeting on Africa\u2019s \ndevelopment needs, and tomorrow I will participate in \nthe high-level event on the MDGs. Those are important \nefforts aimed at giving the issue the top priority that it \ndeserves. We must significantly accelerate the \nprocesses for achieving the MDGs by 2015. A clearer \npicture of what we must achieve in the interim in each \nof the main clusters of the MDGs \u2014 health, education, \ngrowth and climate change \u2014 is what the United \nNations needs immediately. \n We also need a clearer picture of the required \ndivision of labour among various actors, and we need \nto develop a shared sense of progress. A clear plan of \naction is what we need right now. Therefore, Latvia \nstrongly supports the EU Call for Action initiative on \nthe MDGs. Climate change will have a major negative \nbearing on the achievement of the MDGs. Latvia \nsupports broader use of renewable energy resources to \nreduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. However, \nclimate change cannot be seen as an exclusively \nenvironmental challenge; we need a more integrated \napproach. \n Changes to energy consumption patterns must be \ntaken into account as we move towards sustainable \ndevelopment, food security and worldwide trade. \nInnovative technologies, as well as sustainable \nproduction and consumption, would deliver both \nmidterm and long-term results. Carbon dioxide \nemissions cannot be cut in some regions while others \ndo nothing. While each of our countries must commit \nto cutting emissions, success will be possible only if \nthere is a truly global agreement that enables us to do \nso and tells us how. The United Nations, as the only \ntruly global Organization, must play a decisive role. \n Trade liberalization is an important contributor to \nthe achievement of the MDGs. Although the recent \ntrade liberalization efforts at the World Trade \nOrganization were not successful, the process must be \ncontinued at the multilateral level. \n Globalization has brought with it both increased \nprosperity and increased risks. We need to find a way \nto ensure that tomorrow\u2019s globalization will offer \ngrowing prosperity to all people. Globalization will \nproduce benefits on a truly global scale only if trade is \nliberalized across the board. Every country and every \nregion must do its fair share in that process. \n I would like to congratulate Ms. Navanethem \nPillay, the new United Nations High Commissioner for \nHuman Rights, on the assumption of her duties and to \nwish her every success in that highly important post. I \nwould also like to thank Ms. Louise Arbour for her \ninvaluable contribution to the promotion and protection \nof human rights. \n This year, symbolically, the sixtieth anniversary \nof the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights coincides with the ninetieth anniversary of the \nfounding of the Republic of Latvia. In 1918, the Act of \nProclamation of the Republic of Latvia declared:  \n \u201cAll citizens, irrespective of their ethnicity, are \nasked to help, for the rights of all people will be \nguaranteed in Latvia. It will be a democratic and \njust State where oppression and injustice do not \nexist\u201d.  \nI am truly proud of that statement. Thirty years before \nthe adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights, the Republic of Latvia declared its adherence to \nthe same core values and principles and fully \nimplemented them in the newly established State. \n Unfortunately, by the time the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights had been adopted, Latvia \nhad come under foreign occupation and its people had \nbeen deprived of their right to freely determine their \npolitical status and were being subjected to oppression \nand injustice. It was only in 1991 that Latvia restored \nits statehood and the continuity of its commitment to \nfundamental human rights, inherent human dignity, \nequality and the universality of those values. \n The creation of the Human Rights Council and \nthe beginning of the Universal Periodic Review are \nimportant steps aimed at promoting the values of the \nUniversal Declaration. The special procedures of the \nHuman Rights Council play a particular role in that \nregard. Latvia expresses its full support for them and \nurges all United Nations Members to cooperate fully \nwith the special procedures, including by issuing \nstanding invitations to them. \n Latvia is ready to share with the international \ncommunity its experience in the area of promoting \nhuman rights. Latvia has put forward its candidacy for \nthe Human Rights Council for the year 2014. \n This year marks the tenth anniversary of the \nadoption of the Rome Statute establishing the \nInternational Criminal Court (ICC). We welcome the \nprogress the Court has achieved in its analyses, \ninvestigations and judicial proceedings. We call upon \n  \n \n08-51839 18 \n \nall States to ensure full cooperation with the Court. The \nICC is not an instrument that can be activated or \ndeactivated according to political expediency. We are \nconvinced that universality of justice is a prerequisite \nfor sustainable peace. \n Effective multilateralism requires combining \ngreater awareness of the nature of the risks we face \nwith a contemporary understanding of how \ninternational politics are forged today. International \norganizations are only one part of our global system, \nand often that part is the most resistant to change. It is \nregrettable that the enthusiasm and momentum \ngenerated during the 2005 World Summit in reforming \nthis universal international body has somewhat faded. \n Reform of the Security Council is long overdue. \nWe must move on from the discussion of procedure \ninto a discussion of substance. We welcome the recent \ndecision by the General Assembly to continue \nimmediately within the Open-ended Working Group on \nthe Question of Equitable Representation on and \nIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council \nand Other Matters Related to the Security Council to \nprepare intergovernmental negotiations on the question \nof the Security Council\u2019s expansion.  \n While recognizing the need for structural reform \nof the United Nations, we should not lose sight of \nmaking more effective use of existing capacity. \nManagement reform is central to all those efforts. We \nsupport further measures aimed at ensuring greater \ntransparency, enhanced accountability and strict budget \ndiscipline. There has been some progress, but not \nenough by far. \n We live in a world with deteriorating security, a \ngrowing population, the consequences of climate \nchange and market turbulence aggravated by high \nenergy and food prices. We need deeper engagement \nwith the risks we face globally. That requires a new \ncommitment to our values and a willingness to work \nfor an international system that has a vision of the \nfuture at its heart. I would like that to become the \ndriving force for all the work of the General Assembly \nat this sixty-third session. "

        "file_text": "I bring warm \ngreetings from the Government and the people of the \nRepublic of Kiribati, on whose behalf I am honoured to \naddress this body this morning. Let me, at the outset, \ncongratulate Mr. D\u2019Escoto Brockmann on his election \nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nthird session. I am confident that he will provide \nefficient and effective leadership in guiding this \nsession towards a productive and concrete outcome for \nall. I would also like to thank his predecessor for his \nable and effective leadership during the past session. I \nshould also like to acknowledge the election of \nSolomon Islands as a Vice-President of the General \nAssembly at this session. We are indeed very proud to \nhave a Pacific brother in that position. \n Every year, we come together as citizens of the \ninternational community to reflect on and discuss \npossible solutions to the daunting challenges that \ncontinue to face us individually and collectively. \nClimate change and sea level rise, environmental \nprotection, food and fuel price increases and achieving \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are \namong the challenges that I wish to focus on, in the \ninterests of time and brevity. \n For many years, we have tirelessly appealed to \nthe Organization to do something about climate change \nand to provide solutions for those seriously affected by \nits detrimental impact, especially those whose very \nexistence is being threatened. Those appeals have \nfailed to produce practical solutions for people living \nin low-lying small island developing States like \nKiribati. While the members of the international \ncommunity continue to point fingers at each other \nregarding responsibility for and leadership on that \nissue, our people continue to experience the impact of \nclimate change and sea-level rise and practical \nsolutions continue to elude us. \n The science on climate change is irrefutable. The \nfourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change projected an increase in sea \nlevel of 0.4 metres within this century. While that may \nsound minimal to most, it is quite alarming for low-\nlying small island developing States like Kiribati, \nwhose elevation is no more than two metres above sea \nlevel and whose main source of water is underground \naquifers. Before our islands are inundated by the rising \nsea, saltwater intrusion into our freshwater lens will \nrender the islands uninhabitable. With the projected \nsea-level rise, Kiribati could be looking at 50 to \n60 years before that happens. Presented with those \nfindings, we have had to adopt a pragmatic approach \nand to formulate options for our people. We do so with \na great deal of regret and a deep sense of frustration. \n Mitigation and adaptation strategies are and will \ncontinue to be integral components of our response to \nclimate change. It would indeed be naive to suggest \notherwise. Those strategies provide only short- and \nmedium-term solutions. Ultimately, low-lying island \ncountries like Kiribati will have to face up to the \nreality of their islands being unable to support life and \nto plan accordingly beyond existing adaptation strategies.  \n Kiribati is not a major emitter of greenhouse \ngases. Its mitigation efforts would therefore have an \ninsignificant impact on the global climate change \nsituation. Nevertheless, we will do our part and explore \nappropriate renewable and efficient energy technologies, \nas well as promote replanting in our islands. \n While we also require adaptation strategies, our \nadaptation options are extremely limited, particularly \ngiven the nature of our islands. We are a country of \nlow-lying coral atolls, with most islands rising no more \nthan two metres above sea level. Coastal protection \nthrough seawall construction is the main adaptation \nmeasure currently being undertaken by the Government, \nbut it is limited to the protection of public \ninfrastructure. We simply do not have the resources to \nextend protection to private properties and assets. \nAdaptation measures, such as moving inland and to \nhigher ground, are impractical for us. We cannot move \nfurther inland due to the narrowness of our islands, nor \nis there any higher ground to which we can escape \nfrom the rising seas. \n It is encouraging indeed to follow the emergence \nof many climate change initiatives. It gives us hope to \nsee that humankind is beginning to do the right thing. \nWe have been following developments on those fronts. \nI would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge \nAustralia\u2019s commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and its \n  \n \n08-51845 20 \n \nrecent announcement of its climate change programme. \nNew Zealand has also announced its pledge to increase \nfinancial support for climate change. We also welcome \nJapan\u2019s Cool Earth Promotion Programme and the \nEuropean Union\u2019s Global Climate Change Alliance, \nwhich support practical measures to address the \nimpacts of climate change in the Pacific island \ncountries. \n The report of the Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change also states that the concentration of \ngreenhouse gases already in the atmosphere will \ncontinue the momentum of climate change, regardless \nof any substantial reduction in greenhouse gas \nemissions and mitigation efforts. That effectively \nmeans that low-lying small island developing countries \nlike Kiribati are on the frontlines of the climate change \ncalamity. Mitigation efforts therefore will not be able \nto reverse our situation \u2014 a situation that we have \nrecently acknowledged and to which my Government \nhas provided a long-term strategy for our people\u2019s \nfuture and survival. \n At the previous session of the Assembly, a \nquestion was raised regarding what we are to do when \npeople start fleeing their countries, not because of \npolitical persecution but because of environmental \ncatastrophe. That is the question that I want to put \nforward as a challenge to this session, and to which I \nwish to provide a possible answer, at least from the \nperspective of a country whose very existence is under \nserious threat. The relocation of the 100,000 people of \nKiribati, for example, is not something that can be \ndone overnight. It requires long-term forward planning. \nThe sooner we act, the less stressful and the less \npainful it will be for all concerned. \n That is why my Government has developed a \nlong-term merit-based relocation strategy as an option \nfor our people. As leaders, it is indeed our duty to the \npeople we serve to prepare them for the worst-case \nscenario. The strategy involves upgrading the skills of \nour people to make them competitive and marketable \nin international labour markets. We want to target \nlabour markets where skills or labour gaps exist and \nprovide labour for them. We believe that offers a win-\nwin situation for all. We will be able to provide \ncountries with labour and those countries will be able \nto provide potential new homes for our people. The \nstrategy provides our people with an option so that \nwhen they choose to migrate, they will migrate on \nmerit and with dignity. We hope that they will be \nreceived by their adoptive countries not as burdens or \nrefugees, but as worthwhile members of the community \nwith something to contribute. \n We have already started implementing that \nstrategy and we are indeed encouraged by, and grateful \nfor, the support for that approach among our regional \npartners in the Pacific. Under its Pacific Access \nCategory Scheme, New Zealand randomly picks a \ncertain number of people from certain Pacific island \ncountries, including Kiribati, to migrate to New \nZealand every year. Recently, Australia launched the \nAustralia Pacific Technical College, which aims at \ntraining Pacific people with Australian standard \nqualifications that will allow them to access regional \nand international labour markets. The bilateral Kiribati-\nAustralia Nursing Initiative is another example of a \nprogramme that supports that long-term strategy. We \nwelcome them all indeed. \n At the regional level, in August, the leaders of the \nPacific Islands Forum adopted the Niue Declaration on \nClimate Change. That is a reflection of our concerted \nregional efforts to respond to the adverse impacts of \nclimate change, which have been severely felt across \nour region. As the first-ever high-level climate \ndocument in our part of the world, the Declaration is \nindeed a milestone. It calls for collective efforts to \nfight the growing threat posed by climate change to \nmany aspects of our lives and to our future as nations. \n At the international level, we have been \nfollowing closely the issues currently taking \nprecedence on the United Nations agenda. It is indeed \nmost gratifying to note that climate change is finally \nbeing given due recognition as a security issue. We \nwelcome that development, as we believe that it is time \nthe United Nations focused its attention on the human \ndimension of climate change. Discussions about carbon \ntrading, the post-Kyoto Protocol era and even concerns \nover the future of polar bears have been, or are being, \nheld. We welcome those discussions but, at the same \ntime, we wish to express our deep concern that there \nhas never been any discussion of the fate of humans, \nwhose very existence is being seriously undermined by \nclimate change.  \n That is the challenge that I propose that this body, \nthe President and the Secretary-General address during \nthis session. In that connection, I commend to the \nAssembly the draft resolution on climate change as a \nsecurity issue and a threat to international peace and \n \n \n21 08-51845 \n \nsecurity. My colleagues from the Pacific have already \nalluded to it, and I commend them for their support. I \nalso wish to applaud the excellent efforts by our Pacific \nambassadors in New York, as well as their leadership \non the draft resolution. I am also grateful to those who \nhave supported the draft resolution so far, as well as \nthose who we hope will do so in the future. We in the \nPacific have been strong supporters of the fight against \nterrorism. We now turn to those with whom we have \npartnered in the fight against terrorism to partner with \nus in our fight against climate change. \n Kiribati is proud to be home to the Phoenix \nIslands Protected Area, the largest marine protected \narea in the world. That was the result of a collaborative \neffort and partnership between Kiribati, the New \nEngland Aquarium and Conservation International. The \nPhoenix Islands Protected Area covers an area of \naround 410,500 square kilometres, making it, for now, \nthe planet\u2019s largest marine protected area. The Area \ncovers over 11 per cent of our extensive exclusive \neconomic zone of over 3 million square kilometres, \nwhile the land comprising the Area is over 3.5 per cent \nof the total land mass of Kiribati. \n The Phoenix Islands are some of the most \nisolated islands on Earth and are largely untouched by \nman. In 2002, the countries of the world made a \ncommitment to significantly reduce the current rate of \nbiodiversity loss by 2010. Our declaration of the Area \nis in part a contribution towards meeting that target, as \nwell as a statement by which we are saying that \nsacrifices must and can be made.  \n The preservation of those islands and the \nsurrounding ocean is our gift to humankind, of which \nwe are a part. Even now, as we confront the possibility \nthat our islands will become uninhabitable within the \ncentury due to the rising sea levels, we recognize the \nvalue of protecting something that we believe to be the \ncommon heritage of us all. I take this opportunity to \nacknowledge the invaluable support and contribution \nof the New England Aquarium and Conservation \nInternational, our partners in this endeavour. We invite \nGovernments, intergovernmental and non-governmental \norganizations, members of the private sector and \nindividuals to join us in this worthwhile and ambitious \ninitiative. \n The recent hike in food and fuel prices is being \nfelt by all, but more acutely by those living in drought-\nprone, resource-poor and infertile small island \ndeveloping States like Kiribati, who as a consequence \ndepend highly on imported food. Our isolation from \nmajor markets means that the cost of transporting food \nitems to our country is becoming more and more \nexpensive. In addition, the cost of providing basic \nservices to our people, who live on widely scattered \nislands, is also becoming a real challenge for all of us \nin similar situations. \n We acknowledge the ability of certain members \nof the Organization to address this global challenge. \nWe appeal to them to assist the most vulnerable \nmembers, such as Kiribati, with their food and energy \nsecurity strategies. In that regard, we acknowledge \nwith appreciation the assistance provided to our energy \nsecurity strategy by our development partners, \nincluding Japan and Korea. \n With regard to graduation from the list of least \ndeveloped countries, the Committee for Development \nPolicy will meet early next year to prepare the 2009 \nreview of countries that are deemed eligible to \ngraduate under the methodology and indicators of the \nUnited Nations. Kiribati is one of three least developed \ncountries of the Pacific \u2014 the others being Tuvalu and \nVanuatu \u2014 being considered for graduation. We \nbelieve there are pertinent issues that warrant proper \nconsideration by the United Nations with regard to this \nprocess.  \n One is the issue of the extreme economic \nvulnerability of small island developing States. Current \nindicators focus on improved performance on per \ncapita income and human assets. Due consideration \nshould be accorded to the special economic \nvulnerability to external shocks such as rising world \nfood and fuel prices.  \n While it is not currently a graduation indicator, \nwe believe that environmental vulnerability should be \ntaken into account when considering the cases of small \nisland developing States such as Kiribati, Tuvalu and \nVanuatu, which are among the most vulnerable to the \nimpact of climate change and extreme weather \nevents \u2014 which, in turn, pose major challenges to their \nsustainable development efforts. \n In that connection, I wish to commend my Pacific \ncolleagues who have advocated the need to reform the \napplication of the rule of graduation. We reiterate that \ncall and urge the United Nations to reconsider the \ngraduation rule in the light of the special economic \n  \n \n08-51845 22 \n \nsituation and the vulnerability of those island nations \nto climate change and external shocks. \n On the Millennium Development Goals, many of \nmy fellow members will be familiar with, and share, \nthe genuine desire to promote the development \naspirations of our peoples, which is our priority. Even \nwith our limited capacity, we are committed to the \nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals. \nIn that regard, I am pleased to report that Kiribati has \nlaunched its first report on the Millennium Development \nGoals. \n The report outlines weaknesses and strengths in \nthe overall development efforts and in meeting the \nMDGs. We believe that we are on track with our \nprogress on most of the Goals, but we also admit that \nwe are behind on some of them. The main reason for \nthat is the lack of data to measure our progress so far \nand our limited resources to implement strategies \naimed at achieving the Goals. We will continue to exert \nefforts in meeting the targeted Goals by 2015. At this \ntime, I wish to express our deep appreciation to our \ndevelopment partners, who have accompanied us on \nthis journey and have contributed meaningfully to the \nrealization of our development aspirations. \n While we commend the United Nations for the \nmany initiatives put forward in addressing the needs of \nits Members, it is regrettable that it has continued to \ndeny the 23 million people of Taiwan equal rights as \ninternational citizens to participate fully in world \naffairs. We believe that Taiwan has made an active \ncontribution that has enriched the lives of many in their \ncollaborative efforts in building and securing \ninternational peace and security. We believe that the \npeople of Taiwan should be accorded the same \nfundamental right to participate as fellow citizens of \nthe international community and to be allowed to \ncontribute meaningfully in various sectors of the \nOrganization\u2019s activities. \n The challenges that we face are global in nature, \nand therefore require global solutions. We call upon the \nUnited Nations to take the lead in addressing those \nchallenges, especially in funding, supporting and \nfacilitating the implementation of practical solutions to \nthe security challenges that threaten the very existence \nof peoples and nations, which in turn poses a threat to \ninternational peace and security."

        "file_text": "Today, we face the reality of \nan international system that is becoming more complex \nby the day. Globalization has created new \nopportunities; it has also produced uncertainty and \ninsecurity. Sudden crises affect the fundamental \nsources of our sustenance and progress: food, energy \nand financial resources. Terrorism and nuclear \nproliferation threaten our security. Climate change has \nan impact on the future of our planet. Growing \ninstability characterizes the energy and financial \nmarkets, widening the gap between rich and poor.  \n Those global challenges need a timely political \nresponse. A national response would be inadequate and \nillusory, for the right response can only be global and \ncooperative. A dramatic new vision of global \ngovernance for the twenty-first century requires rules \nthat all nations can embrace \u2014 a new vision based on \nthree principles: inclusiveness, effectiveness and \nshared responsibility. \n Effective global governance means a central role \nfor the United Nations, starting with its most \nrepresentative, democratic body, the General Assembly. \nEffective global governance means a strong connection \nbetween the United Nations and international \norganizations, either universal or regional, such as the \nEuropean Union and the African Union. Effective \nglobal governance requires a comprehensive and \nconsensual reform of the United Nations system, \nincluding the Security Council. To achieve a reform of \nthis magnitude on the foundations of strong political \nsupport, there is no alternative to general consensus.  \n We must immediately learn the lessons of the \nturmoil in the world financial markets. Promoting \ntransparent and reliable rules in the marketplace is the \nonly way to protect our societies from falling prey to \nthose forces. We have to avoid squandering wealth and \ninstead ensure that it is distributed equitably among \nevery component of society. That is the vision that \nItaly will promote during its upcoming presidency of \nthe Group of Eight (G-8). Through a broader dialogue \nwith the emerging economies and the least developed \ncountries, the G-8 will contribute to the shaping of a \nnew system of global governance in which formats will \nbe tailored to specific issues, leading to a gradual \nassumption of shared responsibility. \n The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are \npriority challenges. They demand an urgent response, a \nmobilization of greater human and financial resources, \nnew ideas and a true partnership between donor and \nbeneficiary countries that is fully inclusive of \ngovernments, local organizations, the private sector \nand civil society. \n Italy is strongly committed to achieving the goals \nof defeating hunger, strengthening health-care systems \nand making education accessible to all. All this is on \nthe agenda of the upcoming Italian presidency of the \nG-8, and Africa will be at the centre of our attention. \n The right place to address the food crisis is the \nUnited Nations, and we must equip the Organization to \ntackle it effectively. Italy strongly supports the roles \nand functions of the Food and Agriculture \nOrganization, the World Food Programme, the \nInternational Fund for Agricultural Development and \nall the other agencies that help to alleviate hunger and \nguarantee food security. We also encourage the direct \ninvolvement of the private sector in bringing \nagriculture back to its rightful place at the centre of \neconomic policies. That will require a global \npartnership to increase the flow of investments and \nknow-how, enhance productivity and contribute to the \ndevelopment of national agro-industry; a global \npartnership that will make a big step towards achieving \nthe first Millennium Development Goal: to eliminate \nextreme poverty and hunger and to improve the lives of \nthe last billion, that portion of the global population \nstill on the margins of the world economy. That is, \nindeed, an absolute priority. \n The year 2009 will be crucial for international \nnegotiations on climate change. Italy and the European \nUnion are determined to reach an ambitious post-2012 \nagreement that includes mitigation and adaptation \nmeasures. The fight against climate change is closely \nconnected to energy security. We need to promote \ngreater energy cooperation at the global level. We need \nto promote solutions that reconcile the need for secure \n  \n \n08-52265 50 \n \nsupplies with sustainable energy policies, energy \nefficiency and clean energy technologies. We need to \npromote research and development of alternative fuel \nsources, including renewable and nuclear energy. We \nneed to promote a comprehensive dialogue between \nproducing and consuming countries, based on mutual \ntrust, solidarity, dialogue and cooperation. \n Interdependence is the fundamental reality that \nbinds developed countries and emerging economies, \nand in its capacity as the incoming G-8 President, Italy \nwill promote the energy dialogue and the global \nnegotiations on climate change. \n Effective multilateral cooperation built on shared \nresponsibility is vital to tackling the main threats to our \nsafety and security, including terrorism and the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Our \nvigilance against terrorism must remain high and our \ninternational cooperation intense. In the next few years \nwe should work together on a new global pact against \nterrorism to be enacted in 2011 on the tenth \nanniversary of the tragic events of 9/11. \n The protection of human rights and the rule of \nlaw must underpin our action. These values are \nenshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights, which is as relevant today as it was 60 years \nago. That is why Italy has a long-standing commitment \nto a universal moratorium on the death penalty, with a \nview to its abolition. And that is also why we are \nworking to combat impunity and to strengthen the \ninstruments of international law, including the \nInternational Criminal Court. \n The fight against the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction is at the centre of our international \ncommitment. In preparation for the 2010 \nNon-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference, Italy is \nready to do its part to strengthen the Non-Proliferation \nTreaty, which is of fundamental importance to \npreventing and countering proliferation and laying the \nfoundations for a world free of nuclear weapons. Yet \nwe must also maintain cooperation on the peaceful use \nof nuclear technology, as expressly provided for by the \nTreaty. We thus call upon the Iranian Government to \nshow responsibility by promptly meeting the \nconditions for normal negotiations to reassure the \ninternational community and the countries of the \nregion. Let me say very clearly that we strongly \ncondemn the Iranian President\u2019s irresponsible remarks \non the State of Israel.  \n Global security and regional security are very \nclosely connected. We welcome the positive signals \nfrom the Middle East, such as the continuation of the \nnegotiations between Israelis and Palestinians, the \nbeginning of a national dialogue among the Lebanese \npolitical forces to fully implement the Doha \nagreements, and the new chapter in relations between \nLebanon and Syria. \n In Afghanistan, the continuation of the \ninternational commitment should be accompanied by a \ngradual assumption of responsibility by the local \nauthorities and forces and the participation of \nneighbouring countries in the stabilization process. In \nthe Caucasus, the recent crisis indicates the need, there \nand elsewhere, to strengthen regional cooperation \nmechanisms and prevent a competitive dynamic that \nwould lead to high costs and low benefits. \n More than two hundred years ago a great Italian \npolitical philosopher Cesare Beccaria wrote, \u201cThe \ngreatest happiness of the greatest number is the \nfoundation of morals and legislation.\u201d True to these \nwords, so deeply rooted in my country\u2019s democratic \nvocation, Italy joins in the common effort to build a \nworld of peace, security, sustainable development and \na new democratic, transparent and effective global \ngovernance.

        "file_text": "I am \nparticularly honoured to address the General Assembly \non behalf of His Excellency Mr. Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos \nSantos, President of the Republic of Angola. \n First, I should like, on behalf of my Government, \nto warmly congratulate Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann on his election to preside over this organ. \nWe wish him all success during his mandate and assure \nhim of the support of my country. \n The present session of the General Assembly is \ntaking place at a time of serious challenges for the \ninternational community. They include the food crisis, \nthe rise in fuel prices, unexpected climate change, the \nfinancial crisis, the escalation of cold-war rhetoric and \nterrorism. The global scale of those challenges and \ntheir negative effects on the lives of millions of human \nbeings on all continents indicate that we are at a \ncritical moment. We must overcome those challenges \nthrough a collective response, with the central role \nplayed by the United Nations. Above all, however, \neach State must also act individually. \n With regard to the financial crisis, we must take \nmeasures that help to prevent serious effects on the \nglobal economy, especially the economies of the more \nvulnerable countries. Such measures must be effective \nand must help to reduce the negative impact on the \nprogress that African countries have already made by \nimplementing reforms that have enabled them to have \nan annual growth rate of 5 per cent.  \n We are also concerned at the rise in food prices. \nThat has dealt a hard blow to the efforts to fight \npoverty, which affects more than 1 billion people. The \nrise in food prices is closely linked to climate change, \nwhich is not only causing the destruction of \ninfrastructure and basic means of subsistence in many \ncountries, but is also forcing millions of people into \npoverty. \n The elimination of distorting elements in \ninternational trade is also fundamental if we are to \nresolve the world food crisis. The agricultural subsidies \nprovided by the wealthiest countries to their farmers \nare ruining the farming production in poor countries, \nrendering difficult their farmers\u2019 access to international \nmarkets. The failure of the World Trade Organization \nnegotiations during the Doha Round last July further \naggravated that scenario. The collapse of those talks \neliminated the chances of concluding, in the short term, \na general trade agreement that would remove such \nsubsidies and other obstacles to international trade \nexchanges. The Republic of Angola hopes that \nnegotiations will resume as soon as possible and that \nthe main actors will show the necessary flexibility to \nallow countries that are underprivileged as a result of \nthe lack of a global trade agreement to avoid remaining \neternally marginalized from the global economy. \n Turning this extremely dangerous situation \naround, particularly for the countries of the South, \nrequires that the General Assembly intensify its efforts. \nOur hope is that the President will steer the debate \ntowards addressing these concerns. The Republic of \nAngola commits itself to contributing, within the limits \nof its capacity, to finding solutions to these problems \nthat affect all States. \n South-South cooperation, including triangular \ncooperation, has the potential to contribute to the \neradication of poverty through the establishment of \npartnerships for sustainable development, trade, \n \n \n55 08-52265 \n \ninvestment, tourism, prevention and combating of drug \ntrafficking, illicit trade in small arms and light \nweapons, and transnational organized crime. In that \nconnection, Angola is honoured to chair the Zone of \nPeace and Cooperation of the South Atlantic, an \neffective interregional mechanism for cooperation in \nthe areas of development, peace and security among its \n24 member States in Africa and South America.  \n I would like to avail myself of the opportunity to \nassure our international partners that the Republic of \nAngola is motivated more than ever to assume the \nresponsibilities that arise from membership in the \ninstitutions of the international community, those of the \nAfrican continent and those of the United Nations. Our \nengagement and commitment will, in the meantime, \ncontinue to lie primarily in the maintenance of peace \nand security, the consolidation of democracy, respect \nfor human rights and sustainable economic \ndevelopment, on the basis of the social laws of a \nmarket economy that will safeguard the interests and \nthe satisfaction of the majority of the population. \n Those are the principles that have guided our \ntrajectory as a country, in particular since the end of \nthe cold war. A coherent application of those principles \nis the basis for the progress that Angola is building in \nthe political, social and economic domains. As a result, \nsince 2002, a climate of peace prevails in the entire \ncountry, with the eradication of conflict factors and \nimportant advances in national reconciliation, \nemergence of a highly entrepreneurial private sector, a \ndynamic civil society and a free, vibrant and active \npress. \n In the last five years, Angola has been registering \nhigh economic growth rates. During this period, the \ngross domestic product (GDP) grew at an estimated \nrate of 14.7 per cent in real terms. The non-oil sector \ngrew at a rate of 17.4 per cent, faster than the oil \nsector, which reached an annual growth rate of 12.7 per \ncent. This growth allowed the unemployment rate, \nwhich in the mid-1990s was estimated to be at 45 per \ncent, to decrease to an estimated level of 22.5 per cent \nin 2007.  \n The relative weight of the extractive industry, \ndominated by the oil and diamond subsectors, grew at a \nsignificant rate of 61.6 per cent. Moreover, Angola saw \na reduction in inflation levels from 105.6 per cent in \nDecember 2003 to 11.78 per cent in December 2007, as \nwell as a transformation in public accounts from a \ndeficit of 7 per cent of the GDP in 2003 to a surplus of \n11.4 per cent of the GDP in 2007. These figures \nencourage us to be optimistic in relation to the \nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals. \n On 5 September of this year, Angola added one \nmore pillar to its democratic structure by holding \nlegislative elections in a transparent and totally free \nenvironment. Despite the criticism and the pressure on \nthe Angolan Government to hold the elections earlier, \nindependently of the objective and subjective \nconditions prevailing at the time, the discernment of its \nleader, His Excellency Mr. Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos, \ndemonstrated that the elections were held at the most \nappropriate moment. \n With the gradual yet significant improvement in \nthe quality of life of the people, and with fully \nreconciled and peaceful spirits, a climate of tolerance \nand political coexistence emerged into its optimal \nspace. The elections were indeed an expression of the \nreaffirmation of our dignity. \n All the efforts involved in the complex electoral \nprocess that led to the success of this historic feat were \nmade with the human and material resources of the \nAngolan Government. We are proud to once more have \ngiven a good example of political maturity, civic \ndiscipline and full popular participation. It gives us joy \nto state before this Assembly that, like other peoples of \nthe world, Africans have the capability and the ability \nto build their own destiny and develop participatory \ndemocracy. \n Armed conflicts continue to absorb resources \nfrom both the international community and the parties \ninvolved, resources that could be better utilized for the \nwell-being of the population in affected territories. \nHowever, for the first time in many years, Africa is \nexperiencing a significant reduction in conflict, \nallowing for improved economic indicators. The \nprogress in the peace process in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and the \nconsolidation of peace under way in Sierra Leone and \nin Liberia have brought about a new aura of hope. \nFurthermore, the progress made in the Democratic \nRepublic of Congo, despite some tension in the eastern \nareas, is manifestly encouraging. \n We hope that the efforts currently being made by \nthe United Nations and the African Union, as well as \nby regional organizations, will help resolve the \nconflicts in Somalia and Darfur in a peaceful manner. \n  \n \n08-52265 56 \n \n As Chair of the Organ on Politics, Defence and \nSecurity Co-operation of the Southern African \nDevelopment Community (SADC), the Republic of \nAngola has given its all, together with the other \ncountries of that region and the facilitator, to support \nthe negotiation process with a view ending the political \ncrisis in Zimbabwe. Angola welcomes the inter-party \nagreement reached in Zimbabwe and will continue to \nmake efforts to help the parties put national interests \nbefore all personal quarrels so as to ease the return to \npolitical stability and to reverse the grim economic \nsituation that prevails in the country. We appeal to the \ninternational community, particularly to the European \nUnion, to support the programme aimed at overcoming \nthe crisis, which will be drawn up by the inclusive \nGovernment resulting from the inter-party agreement. \nWe also call for the subsequent lifting of the sanctions \nimposed on that country. \n However, we must remain vigilant to the \npossibility of the eruption of new conflicts due to the \npolitical instability that exists in other countries of the \ncontinent. We must invest in preventive diplomacy and \nin the strengthening of rapid alert mechanisms.  \n In the Middle East, the latest developments seem \nto introduce a light at the end of the tunnel, with regard  \nto a definitive resolution of the Palestinian and the \nIsraeli-Arab issues. Angola encourages the parties \ninvolved to engage in a dialogue that will lead to the \nde facto and de jure establishment of a Palestinian \nState, with recognized borders, coexisting side by side \nwith Israel. \n My Government maintains its solidarity with the \nCommon African Position and with all those who \nadvocate the need to democratize the United Nations \nand to reform its system, including the expansion of \nthe Security Council so that it reflects a fair and \nequitable regional representation, with all the rights \ninherent in membership. \n I would not like to end my statement without \nonce again conveying my regret to the General \nAssembly over the continuation of the embargo that the \nRepublic of Cuba is subjected to by the United States \nof America. It constitutes a situation that does not \ncomply with the rules that govern relations between \nStates. We are in an age of peaceful coexistence among \npeoples and nations, and that embargo wounds the \nuniversal collective conscience of our time. "

        "file_text": "My delegation associates \nitself with the compliments extended to Mr. Miguel \nd\u2019Escoto Brockmann on his election to the presidency \nof the General Assembly at the present session, to his \npredecessor and to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. \n \n \n13 08-53129 \n \n We greatly welcome the convening and the \noutcomes of the two high-level meetings \u2014 one on \nAfrica\u2019s development needs and the other on the \nMillennium Development Goals \u2014 that have been held \nduring the course of this session of the General \nAssembly. Let us not lose the momentum generated by \nthose two meetings. \n Let me also thank the President of the General \nAssembly for advancing a very appropriate theme, \n\u201cThe impact of the global food crisis on poverty and \nhunger in the world as well as the need to democratize \nthe United Nations\u201d. The decision of the Secretary-\nGeneral to establish the High-Level Task Force on the \nGlobal Food Security Crisis demonstrates the \ndetermination of the United Nations to champion a \nunified response to the current food crisis. That is \nindeed emboldening, and we welcome the progress that \nhas been achieved so far by the Task Force in \nproducing the Comprehensive Framework for Action.  \n The food crisis poses a serious threat to the \nfragile progress that is being made towards the \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. It \ncan also be a source of political instability in \ndeveloping and often vulnerable countries. Policy \ninitiatives that should be implemented by relevant \nstakeholders to overcome the crisis were adequately \narticulated in the outcome documents of the High-\nLevel Conference on World Food Security: the \nChallenges of Climate Change and Bioenergy, held in \nRome in June 2008. There, the bottom line was clearly \ndrawn that, while current energy needs are real and \nurgent, they cannot and should not be allowed to \ncompete with the call to ensure food security. The \nstakes are too high in many developing countries, \nLesotho included, where abject poverty, malnutrition \nand the spread of HIV and AIDS have reached \nunacceptable levels. All humankind has a right to food, \nand hunger constitutes a violation of human dignity. \n That is why my delegation regrets the lack of \nprogress in the implementation of previous \ninternational commitments to fight hunger, particularly \nthose contained in the outcomes of the 1996 and the \n2002 World Food Summits. The Millennium \nDevelopment Goal (MDG) of reducing by half the \nnumber of undernourished people by 2015 will not be \nachieved unless there is visible movement from \nrhetoric to action. \n Lesotho was encouraged by the G8 Statement on \nGlobal Food Security that was recently issued at the \nHokkaido Toyako summit. The Statement highlighted \nthe importance of stimulating world food production \nand of increasing investments in agriculture. Hope-\nraising pledges were made at that summit and earlier \nones. What remains to be done as a matter of great \nurgency is to deliver on those promises. Also, we call \nupon other development partners, including the Bretton \nWoods institutions, to scale up their efforts to help \nfarmers in the least developed countries, particularly in \nsub-Saharan Africa, to raise agricultural production and \nproductivity. \n The preparedness of the African continent to \nshoulder its responsibilities in this regard was clearly \nreflected in a declaration entitled \u201cResponding to the \nChallenges of High Food Prices and Agriculture \nDevelopment\u201d that was recently adopted at the African \nUnion summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, in July this \nyear. \n The establishment by the World Bank of two \ninternational Climate Investment Funds in May 2008, \nintended to provide innovative financing for \ndeveloping countries to pursue cleaner development \npaths and also to help protect themselves from the \nimpact of climate change, was another encouraging \ndevelopment. Our hope is that the Climate Investment \nFunds will be additional to existing official \ndevelopment assistance, which is so sorely needed by \nthe developing countries to achieve the MDGs. \n Peace and development are closely interrelated \nand mutually reinforcing. The United Nations cannot \nafford the luxury of complacency in its mandate for the \nmaintenance of world peace and stability. Most \nimportantly, let us not forget that the United Nations \nwas born from the ashes of devastating world wars. \nIndeed, the primary purpose of the United Nations was \nand continues to be to prevent future wars and to create \nsustainable international security, but every year we \nwitness the emergence of new hotspots and designer \nwars as some big and powerful States resort more and \nmore to the use of force. Every time those States try to \npursue the illusory goal of imposing their will by force \non others, they create a more unstable and dangerous \nworld. \n Let me now address an issue of concern to my \ndelegation \u2014 the abuse of the principle of universal \njurisdiction. The Sharm el-Sheikh assembly of the \n  \n \n08-53129 14 \n \nAfrican Union was seized with the issue of the abuse \nof the principle of universal jurisdiction by some \ncountries that seem inclined to use the principle to \ntarget certain African leaders. \n Of course, lest I be misunderstood, we do \nrecognize that universal jurisdiction is a principle of \ninternational law whose purpose is to ensure that \nindividuals who commit such grave offences as \ngenocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity are \nbrought to justice. That noble principle should be \nimpartially and objectively applied so that it will not be \nabused for the political ends of some individuals or \ncountries, as that could endanger international order \nand security. \n It is a trite fact that the need for the application of \nthe principle by individual States has been rendered \nunnecessary by the creation of the International \nCriminal Court (ICC). If a State is unable or unwilling \nto deal with certain grave situations, such a matter \nshould be referred to the Court, which will deal with it \nimpartially. As we know, even the Security Council \nrefers certain situations to the ICC. We need only \nemphasize that the ICC was created by this world body \nand must enjoy the support and trust of the entire \nmembership of the United Nations. It must also be \nimmune from any external influences. \n As we respond to the invitation to comment on \nthe second part of our theme, \u201cThe need to democratize \nthe United Nations\u201d, we do so against the background \nof the integrity and credibility of the Security Council. \nWe raise the issue of the integrity and credibility of the \nCouncil, recognizing fully its responsibility to uphold \nthe three pillars of the United Nations: human rights, \ndevelopment and peace, and security. \n The working methods of the Security Council \ncontinue to interest us precisely because the Council is \nthe most powerful institution within the United Nations \nsetting. It is charged with the responsibility for the \nmaintenance of world peace and order and it is a \ncustodian of human rights. In order to fulfil that \nmandate, the Security Council needs to always \npreserve its integrity and credibility. It is only when all \nMember States are convinced of its integrity and \ncredibility that they will have confidence in it. \n The Security Council can enjoy such confidence, \nhowever, if and only if it is seen to be transparent and \ndemocratic in its structures and accountable and \nresponsible to the entire membership of the United \nNations; if and only if it submits itself to the rule of \nlaw; if and only if it is objective and impartial in its \nwork; if and only if the membership of the United \nNations is convinced that it is not used as a policy \ninstrument of any one State or group of States; and \nfinally, if and only if it subjects all States Members of \nthe United Nations to the same and equal treatment. \n The Security Council should thus not turn a blind \neye to a situation in one country and then act when a \nsimilar situation obtains in another. It must be an \nhonest arbiter in conflicts. We all owe it to ourselves to \nwork towards such reform of the Security Council that \nwill help to preserve its integrity and credibility so that \nit can perform its lofty mandate more efficiently. \nNeedless to say, the question of numbers, particularly \nnumbers representing the African continent, is at issue, \nbut I need not dwell on it as it has been amply covered \nby previous speakers. \n Lesotho is also concerned that the Security \nCouncil continues to be seen to be encroaching on \nmatters that fall within the powers and prerogatives of \nother organs of the United Nations, including the \nGeneral Assembly. We believe that the Council must \ndesist from assuming the legislative role of the General \nAssembly and from adopting binding resolutions that \ndictate domestic law for Member States. In some \ninstances, the Council has sought to interfere in purely \ninternal political matters that do not pose a threat to \ninternational peace and that, in any case, are being \ndealt with at the regional level. In our view, the \nusurpation by the Council of the mandates of other \norgans, including the Assembly, is not justifiable. \n A few days ago, we witnessed a positive \ndevelopment in the southern Africa subregion when the \nleaders of the people of Zimbabwe put aside their \npolitical differences and joined hands to form a \nGovernment of national unity. We congratulate the \npeople of Zimbabwe on that historic feat. We urge the \ninternational community to support the people of \nZimbabwe in rebuilding their economy and in \ndetermining their destiny in an atmosphere of national \nharmony and peace. We also urge the leadership of \nZimbabwe to ensure adherence to the principles of \ndemocracy, respect for human rights and the rule of \nlaw, as such adherence will have a catalytic effect on \nsocio-economic initiatives in which Zimbabwe is \ninvolved. \n \n \n15 08-53129 \n \n Finally, we urge the Security Council to support \nefforts to bring to an end the unilateral economic and \nfinancial embargo that has, for decades now, been \nimposed against Cuba. We further urge the Council to \nintervene more decisively on behalf of the people of \nPalestine and Western Sahara, who have, also for \ndecades, been denied the right to self-determination.  \n Lesotho is supportive of any efforts that will \nbring about lasting and sustainable peace in the Middle \nEast and in other conflict areas in Africa, the Balkans \nand around our globe. We recall that in his report \u201cIn \nlarger freedom: towards development, security and \nhuman rights for all\u201d, former Secretary-General Kofi \nAnnan said: \u201cOur guiding light must be the needs and \nhopes of peoples everywhere\u201d (A/59/2005, para. 12). \n Such is the call and challenge staring the United \nNations in the face: to ensure a peaceful, safe, \ndignified and prosperous world in our time and for \nposterity.

        "file_text": "On behalf of the \nGovernment and people of Belize, I congratulate you, \nMr. President, on your assumption of the presidency of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-third session. It is a \ndistinct honour for all Central American and Caribbean \npeoples. I assure you of Belize\u2019s fullest support during \nyour term of office. \n I would also wish to thank your predecessor, \nSrgjan Kerim, for the sterling manner in which he \npresided over the sixty-second session. I also wish to \npay tribute to our very capable Secretary-General, who \nworks so assiduously to discharge the multifaceted \nresponsibilities of the United Nations. \n Belize accepts with pride and humility the \ninvitation so kindly extended to us to share our vision \nof how we should address the great challenges of the \nday and how we can achieve the unity we need in order \nto do so effectively. \n Being a very small State in a world that has long \nbeen characterized by greed, indifference, arrogance, \napathy, selfishness and myopia, Belize is no stranger to \ncrises. In our evolution from colonialism to \nindependence, we have had far more than our fair share \nof them and we survived them all. \n Thus, while we join in the consensus, so \nforcefully articulated over the past week, that never has \nthere been a time in the recorded history of humankind \nthat the world has been beset at one and the same time \nby so many crises of potentially catastrophic \nproportions as it is today, we remain convinced that the \nsolution to those crises is not beyond the collective \nwisdom of humankind. On the contrary, we are \nconvinced that our world leaders, who gathered within \nthese hallowed walls this past week, possess the moral, \nintellectual and financial capacities to overcome the \npresent challenges and to secure the future of our \nplanet Earth and of all who dwell upon it. We therefore \nlook to the future with optimism. \n My Government believes that there are a number \nof preconditions that must be satisfied before we can \nhope to successfully combat the challenges we face. \nThe first is the acceptance by all peoples that we are \nour brothers\u2019 keeper and that, as you, Sir, so poignantly \nstated, \u201ceither we treat each other as brothers and \nsisters or we witness the beginning of the end of our \nhuman species\u201d (, p. 5). \n The second and equally important precondition is \nthe acceptance by all peoples that we are heirs to and \nowners of the Earth and of all the resources thereon \nand that no individual race or nation has a greater \nclaim to them than anyone else. And the third and \nperhaps most important precondition of all is the \nacceptance by all peoples that our planet as we know it \nis not indestructible, that it can be mortally damaged, if \nnot destroyed, by what we do to it, and that none of us \nwould escape the consequences of such a tragic turn of \nevents. \n The experience of our own country, Belize, bears \nout the fact that the treatment we mete out to each \nother determines to a large extent our own destinies. \nThe hardships and deprivations which Belizeans \nsuffered in the past and continue to suffer even today \nhave been caused in large part not by nature dealing us \na bad hand but by the human exploitation and \n \n \n7 08-53141 \n \nselfishness of which we are the victims. Nature itself \nhas been bountiful to us \u2014 so much so that our \nnational poet, Samuel Haynes, who penned the lyrics \nof our national anthem, was moved to begin one of the \nstanzas with the following line, \u201cNature has blessed us \nwith wealth untold\u201d. \n Yet with all our abundant natural resources, it is \nvery doubtful whether we will, despite our best efforts, \nbe able to achieve the Millennium Development Goals \nby the year 2015. We are not in a position to say today \nwith any degree of certainty that by 2015 all the \nchildren in our country, boys and girls alike, will \ncomplete publicly funded primary education. Nor can \nwe forecast that by 2015 we will attain gender equality, \nreduce childhood mortality by two thirds and maternal \nmortality by three quarters, and reverse the spread of \nHIV/AIDS and other diseases. \n The truth is that small countries like ours are not \nthe masters of our own destinies. We are severely \nconstrained in what we can do to advance our own \ndevelopment agendas because we simply do not \npossess and cannot readily access the human, financial \nor technological resources needed to develop our \npeople and to secure our futures. And given the \npredatory nature of the world we live in today, we will \nnever be able to attain those resources using our own \ndevices. We will most certainly need the assistance of \nthe international community. We live in an \ninterdependent world. \n While the developed countries may possess all \nthe human, financial and technological resources we \nlack, the crises which now confront us are making it \nmanifest that not even the richest and most powerful of \nthem can successfully withstand and combat the \ncatastrophic consequences of nature\u2019s fury and man\u2019s \nexcesses by relying on their own devices and \nresources. They must join forces with the rest of the \nworld. That imperative was articulated by Mr. Gordon \nBrown, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, on \n26 September in this very Hall (see ) when \nhe stated, in essence, that every global problem \nrequires global solutions, that we cannot solve the food \ncrisis, climate change and the pressures on resources \nwithout involving Africa and the developing countries, \nand that Africa and the developing countries are not the \nproblem but part of the very solution to today\u2019s \nproblems. \n What Gordon Brown speaks to and what many of \nthe leaders in this general debate have highlighted is \nthe global leadership challenge we face. In addressing \nthat challenge, we would propose that we first examine \nhow our multilateral institutions function. Joseph \nStiglitz in his book Making Globalization Work wrote \nthat: \n \u201cThe nation-state, which has been the center of \npolitical and ... economic power for the past \ncentury and a half is being squeezed today \u2014 on \none side by the forces of global economics, and \non the other side by political demands for \ndevolution of power. Globalization \u2014 the closer \nintegration of the countries of the world \u2014 has \nresulted in the need for more collective action, \nfor people and countries to act together to solve \ntheir common problems.\u201d \nStiglitz continued that \n \u201cwhile the nation-state has been weakened, there \nhas yet to be created at the international level the \nkinds of democratic global institutions that can \ndeal effectively with the problems globalization \nhas created.\u201d \n There is no disputing that the interests of the \ndeveloping countries are poorly represented and dealt \nwith in the present global institutions. That is clearly \nmanifested in the multilateral trade and financial \ninstitutions, where negotiations are closeted in green \nrooms and where the fundamental democratic principle \nof one vote per country is subverted in a system that \ndetermines voting rights based on economic power. If \nthe developing countries are to become developed, it \nwill be imperative to revisit those structures and \ntransform them into institutions that are representative, \ntransparent and democratic. \n In addition to the systemic issues that must be \naddressed, we must also tackle the crisis of \nimplementation. If we consider the numerous \nconferences and summits that have been convened to \ncraft global responses to development, sustainable \ndevelopment, financing for development, trade, climate \nchange and more recently the food crisis, there is no \nwant of commitments and common objectives. \n The Millennium Development Goals promised to \nthe world\u2019s peoples that we would take concerted \naction to improve the quality of their lives. The \nMonterrey Consensus promised a new global \n  \n \n08-53141 8 \n \npartnership that would support those efforts to \neradicate poverty and promote sustainable economic \ngrowth and development. The Doha Ministerial \nDeclaration promised to put the needs and interests of \nthe developing countries at the heart of its work \nprogramme. \n But we know from the reports that our progress \ntowards the realization of the MDGs has been slow and \nuneven that the realization of the Monterrey \ncommitments has been dismal particularly on the part \nof developed countries and the international financial \nand trade institutions, and that the Doha Development \nRound has collapsed. Indeed, were these commitments \nnot set down on paper, one might question their very \nexistence. \n We also know that the failure of the full \nimplementation of our global commitments is not for \nwant of resources but for want of compassion and \nempathy. Globalization may have forced the world into \na closer relationship, but at the political level it has not \nmanaged to calibrate national interests vis-\u00e0-vis global \ninterests. We therefore still act only when it is in our \nnarrow self-interest to do so. \n However, the current crises are signalling clearly \nthat we can no longer subsume the global interests \nunder our own. The challenges we face clearly \ndemonstrate how our fates are intertwined. As leaders, \nwe must start now, with a sense of urgency, to take the \nnecessary action to deliver on the promises of \ndevelopment. More importantly, we must commit to \nsubmitting our actions to international oversight. \n The United Nations must play the pivotal role in \naddressing the global leadership crisis. Belize holds the \nview that the way forward is for the United Nations to \nconcentrate its efforts on convincing the leaders and \npeoples of the developed world that the security, \ndevelopment and well-being of all peoples of the world \nafford the best guarantee for their own security, safety \nand development and ultimately their very survival. It \nis our conviction that the adoption of that view by the \ndeveloped world would prove to be the catalyst for \nachieving the unity that the world now needs to be able \nto address successfully the challenges of our day. \n To that end, the United Nations must be \nstrengthened so as better to serve to monitor the \nimplementation of the globally agreed commitments. \nIts universality must be reinforced with the \nparticipation of all relevant stakeholders in its \nelaboration of responses to our threats and challenges. \nIn that regard, my Government wholeheartedly \nsupports the participation of the Republic of China on \nTaiwan in the United Nations specialized agencies. \nFinally, its decisions must carry the full weight that \nimpels action. \n The United Nations still represents the great hope \nfor all our peoples. The principles upon which it was \nfounded and the objectives for which it was formed are \nno less relevant today than they were in 1945. For my \nown country, our membership in the United Nations \nsecured the hope of peace, security and development, \neven as we continue to struggle with a long-extant \nclaim to our territory. It provides the framework within \nwhich we can peacefully settle our differences. Today, \nthe Governments of Belize and Guatemala have an \nopportunity finally to settle that dispute by juridical \nmeans, specifically through referral to the International \nCourt of Justice (ICJ). We have reached a major \nstepping stone, but we are not deluded by the \nchallenges ahead. Not only must we negotiate a \ncompromise for the referral of the matter, but the \nquestion of taking the claim to the ICJ must be put to \nnational referendums in both countries. The road to the \nICJ and the final resolution of the territorial difference \nwill undoubtedly have many high tolls. Belize appeals \nto the international community through the United \nNations for its continued solidarity and support. \n Sixty years ago when we adopted the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights, humanity had been \nwrested from the throes of war. The Declaration \nconfirmed in article 1 that \n \u201cAll human beings are born free and equal in \ndignity and rights. They are endowed with reason \nand conscience and should act towards one \nanother in a spirit of brotherhood.\u201d \nThe global conscience was awakened and alerted, \nbecause our forebears knew that continued disregard \nand contempt for human rights and freedoms would \nlead to barbarous acts between peoples and nations. \nThey foresaw the advent of a world in which human \nbeings would enjoy freedom of speech and belief and \nfreedom from fear and want, and proclaimed those \nfreedoms as the highest aspirations of the common \npeople. \n My Government holds an unflinching \ncommitment to those values and aspirations. We are \nstill soldiers in the battle for freedom, equality and \n \n \n9 08-53141 \n \njustice, but in fighting that battle we no longer need the \ncrude instruments of war. Instead, we have as our \nweapon the power of the rule of law, cooperation and \nfriendship between peoples and nations and an abiding \nfaith in multilateralism. Let us be so guided. "

        "file_text": "I take this opportunity to \nadd my voice to those of numerous speakers who \nextended their warmest congratulations to Mr. d\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann on his assumption of his responsibilities as \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \nsession. I am confident that this world body will \nbenefit from his rich experience and wise guidance. \n I also appreciate the Secretary-General\u2019s \ncommitment to putting Africa\u2019s urgent needs at the top \nof his agenda during his term in office, and particularly \nhis untiring efforts to assist Somalis in finding a lasting \nsolution to their conflict. \n In that connection, I propose to confine my \nremarks first to what I consider to be the most \nimportant issues surrounding the development needs of \nAfrica and the implementation of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. Secondly, I will raise some of the \nmajor concerns we have about the current situation in \nSomalia. In recent years, a great deal has been said \nabout Africa and its problems regarding development \nneeds and policy implementation. I would like to dwell \nbriefly on three particular areas: aid, the debt burden \nand trade. \n On the issue of aid to Africa, we are mainly \nconcerned with its quantity, relevance and quality. Of \ncourse, we support any measure, be it bilateral or \nmultilateral, likely to increase the effectiveness, \ncoordination and coherence of aid. With regard to the \nquantity of total official development assistance, most \nobservers would agree that total aid to Africa in the \ncoming years is not likely to increase and may even \ndecrease. Therefore, it would be unrealistic to entertain \nexaggerated hopes for development through aid. Most \ndonor countries have yet to reach the United Nations-\nrecommended target of dedicating 0.7 per cent of their \ngross national income to official development \nassistance. \n With regard to the debt burden of many countries \nin Africa, especially the so-called highly indebted poor \ncountries, we believe that the international community \nshould be doing far more than has been attempted or \nachieved in recent years. For one thing, the process of \nreducing debt should be accelerated to give credence to \nour recognition of the existence of an urgent crisis. We \nbelieve that, in respect of the least developed and low-\n \n \n53 08-52265 \n \nincome countries, outstanding debts should be totally \ncancelled. We need to free resources for growth and the \nachievement of national development goals, including \nthe Millennium Development Goals. \n With regard to the achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals, we need to take a \ncloser look at our development policies and institutions \nwith a view to effecting urgent reforms. Corruption \nneeds to be controlled and better governance given a \nreal boost and not just lip service. Priority attention to \nagriculture should be reinstated. Africa can and should \nproduce more food. \n We are convinced that Africa has enormous \npotential. We believe that its greatest potential is in the \nsphere of trade, and less as a recipient of aid or debt \nrelief. In that connection, trade barriers against the \nagricultural products of Africa should be removed from \nthe markets of the European Union and North America \nif the developed countries are really serious about \naiding the less developed.  \n As we are all well aware, the Doha Round of \nnegotiations is still at an impasse due to the divergence \nof interests between the developed and developing \nmembers of the World Trade Organization. At the heart \nof the impasse is the existence of huge subsidies given \nto farmers in the European Union and North America. \nUnless those subsidies are totally eliminated or \nsubstantially reduced, there is little hope for Africa and \ndeveloping countries elsewhere to compete in the \nmarkets of the developed countries. \n I would now like to move from major issues \nfacing development in Africa to the specific problems \nand prospects of Somalia. We wish first to reaffirm that \nthe Transitional Federal Government of the Somali \nRepublic is fully committed to the implementation of \nthe road map envisaged under the Somali Charter \nadopted in 2004, despite daunting natural and man-\nmade challenges. \n With regard to reconciliation, we wish to point \nout that a peace and reconciliation agreement was \nagreed upon and signed between the Transitional \nFederal Government and the opposition alliance on \n19 August 2008 in Djibouti. We are now in the process \nof implementation, we hope without undue delays. But \nwe are also mindful, after 18 years of conflict, that \ndelays could occur as a result of the tactics of those \nwho have developed a vested interest in anarchy and \nchaos. It is also important that the leadership, both on \nthe Government side and on the opposition side, show \nresolve and leadership if the process is to succeed \u2014 \nand succeed it must. We are also determined to ensure \nthat the efforts of saboteurs and spoilers will not keep \nhostage the whole Somali nation and peace in the \nregion. We hope that we can count on the unambiguous \nsupport of the members of this United Nations body \nand the Security Council. \n The situation in Somalia has been on the agenda \nof the Security Council for a long time. We urge the \nUnited Nations and the Security Council to play their \npart and not to allow opportunities to be lost through a \npolicy of wait and see. Ultimately, history may not be \nvery kind to the way the Security Council has been \nhandling the Somali case when compared to the ways \nthat it has responded to other crises in comparable \nsituations. We urgently need the deployment of a fully \nfledged United Nations peacekeeping force to restore \npeace and stability and to create a secure environment \nfor institution-building and socio-economic development. \n Let me draw to the Assembly\u2019s attention the \nincreasing acts of piracy and armed robbery against \nvessels in Somali and adjacent waters, which have \nresulted in the loss of both human life and property. \nMy Government has strongly condemned those \ncriminal acts, which violate international law and the \nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of \nl0 December 1982. Those criminal acts of piracy are \nunacceptable and should be put to an end. Since \nSomalia has no capacity to interdict vessels or patrol \nits long coastline to ensure the security of the sea lanes, \nwe call on the international community to cooperate \nwith the Transitional Federal Government in the fight \nagainst sea piracy, in conformity with the provisions of \nparagraph 7 of Security Council resolution 1816 \n(2008). We stand ready to cooperate with all Member \nStates as well as with the United Nations in \nimplementing that resolution.  \n We believe that the time has come for the world \nto take resolute action against the piracy off the coast \nof Somalia and to put an end to these criminal acts. It \nis unconscionable that, at the dawn of the twenty-first \ncentury, piracy on such a scale has been left unchecked \nfor so long. We applaud the efforts of the Government \nof France, particularly President Sarkozy, in the fight \nagainst the piracy and armed robbery off the coast of \nSomalia. \n  \n \n08-52265 54 \n \n Finally, I would like to touch on the dire \nhumanitarian situation in Somalia, which is the result \nof conflict, drought and acts of piracy, as well as \nflooding in some regions. I appeal to the international \ncommunity to provide more humanitarian aid to the \nSomali people. I wish to thank the Governments of \nFrance, Denmark, the Netherlands and Canada for \nescorting ships carrying humanitarian aid to Somalia. I \nwould also like to express our profound thanks to all \ncountries that are currently providing humanitarian aid \nto our country. \n Permit me to conclude by emphasizing the \nimportance of conflict prevention, conflict resolution \nand conflict management, not only in Somalia, but also \nthroughout Africa and the developing world. It is hard \nto imagine that any meaningful socio-economic \ndevelopment could take place without peace or \nsecurity. It is not realistic to expect countries in a state \nof conflict to achieve all or any of the agreed-upon \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). Therefore, it \nis incumbent upon all developing countries, the United \nNations and the Security Council to promote the \nconditions for effective development. Otherwise, the \nMDGs will appear to be an exercise in wishful \nthinking. "

        "file_text": "I should \nlike to start by congratulating Mr. d\u2019Escoto Brockmann \non being elected to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-third session. I am certain that he \nwill steer the work of this session wisely and \nsuccessfully, and we wish him every success in his \nwork. I also wish to pay tribute to his predecessor, \nMr. Srgjan Kerim, and thank him for his constructive \nefforts and the results that he achieved at the sixty-\nsecond session. On the occasion of the feast of \nRamadan, I wish to extend my warmest greetings to the \nIslamic community and to all States of the world. May \nthat feast bring prosperity, peace and security to all. \n Without doubt, representatives closely monitored \nthe terrorist acts perpetrated on the United States \nembassy, which were combated by our courageous \nYemeni security forces. While we join the international \ncommunity and the Security Council in condemning \nthat terrorist act, we welcome the readiness of many \ncountries to work on a daily basis to counter terrorism. \nWe hope that such positive attitudes will translate into \ngenuine support that will enhance human development \nprojects and enable Yemen to overcome poverty by \nalso strengthening the Yemeni security forces, so that \nthey can play an effective role alongside the \ninternational community in countering terrorism. We \nalso need increased cooperation and coordination \namong security and intelligence services at the \ninternational level so as to close all the gaps that have \nenabled terrorists to continue their destructive \nactivities, which are alien to the values of religion and \nhuman morals.  \n Because of the exorbitant costs that we have had \nto bear in the field of security, Yemen has paid a heavy \ntoll in terms of lives and material damage in the anti-\nterrorist activities that we undertake. Terrorist activities \ncarried out by Al-Qaida and Islamic jihad elements, as \nwell as by rebel movements, have caused tremendous \neconomic losses of over $2 billion to the Yemeni \nGovernment and impeded the implementation of \ndevelopment projects and Government measures to \nreduce poverty. We therefore call on donor States, \ninternational organizations and Yemen\u2019s partners in \n \n \n13 08-53135 \n \ncounter-terrorism to assist Yemen generously and to \nhelp it carry out the development projects and poverty-\nreduction programmes that are key components in \ncountering terrorism, especially since terrorists exploit \npoverty, need and ignorance to polarize people and \nrecruit individuals. \n In the war on terrorism, in its various forms, \nmany people have falsely found a pretext to mobilize \nagainst the Muslim religion, since Islam is the religion \nof dialogue, tolerance and moderation. In that \nconnection, the Republic of Yemen fully supports the \ninitiative of His Majesty the King of Saudi Arabia with \nregard to dialogue among religions \u2014 an initiative that \nattracted great attention at the Madrid conference. \nThere is also a crucial need to fight terrorism around \nthe world by reviewing counter-terrorism mechanisms \nso that the war on terror will not harm the lives of \ninnocent citizens and cause human rights violations. \n The Republic of Yemen, which is one of the least \ndeveloped countries, continues to progress towards \ndemocratization through political plurality and freedom \nof expression, and is striving to promote the role of \nnon-governmental organizations and civil society and \nthe principle of the peaceful sharing of power. Yemen \nis moving from a local administration system to \none of local governance that grants broad prerogatives \nin the area of decentralization and power-sharing. \nParliamentary elections will take place in 2009 with \nthe participation of various political parties. The \nRepublic of Yemen, in that regard, intends to take all \nmeasures to safeguard the integrity of those elections, \ncomplying with international standards and welcoming \nthe participation of international observers.  \n This session of the General Assembly is taking \nplace in difficult international circumstances, with a \nnew cold war threatening to return to the world and to \nundermine global peace and stability. We believe that \nthis important international forum should be an \ninstrument for resolving all issues and challenges and \ntheir implications for international relations. We trust \nthat, through dialogue, non-interference in the internal \naffairs of countries and respect for the interests of all, \nwe will be able to prevent a return to the age of \nalliances, because the world now has a crucial need for \ninternational cooperation in a spirit of pluralism and \npartnership instead of further tension and polarization.  \n The changes on the international scene are \nmultiple. The most important facets are related to the \ninternational economic situation, which has confronted \nus with a number of unprecedented challenges. Among \nthose challenges is the severe shortage of foodstuffs, \nthe increase in the cost of food internationally and the \nrise in energy prices. Those acute crises threaten to \naffect the economies of poor countries, in particular by \nincreasing the number of hungry people around the \nworld. They are further compounded by industrial \nStates\u2019 growing use of biofuels, which poses a threat to \nthe world\u2019s current food reserves. While we agree that \nbiofuels do help to reduce damage from global \nwarming, that equation might change entirely if we \nwere to take into account the potential effect on a large \nproportion of the world\u2019s population, who may be \nfacing famine. Food must be produced in the interests \nof the mass of humanity. \n Poor countries are facing a major challenge \nbecause of the increase in the prices of food and \nenergy. Whenever there are glimmers of hope on the \nhorizon for developing countries, they find themselves \nfacing new obstacles to the achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). There can be \nno doubt that, in order to address such difficulties, we \nneed increased international solidarity and cooperation. \nWe call on the major economic Powers and countries \nthat produce energy and food to fully shoulder their \nresponsibilities vis-\u00e0-vis the poorest countries and to \nhelp them to achieve development and the MDGs \nadopted by this Assembly in 2000. \n The difficult humanitarian situation of the \nPalestinian people, whose rights continue to be denied \nand trampled by Israel, is a source of grave concern for \nus. Moreover, Israel\u2019s expansionist policies of building \nillegal settlements on Palestinian and Syrian territories \nand of the racist separation wall in the West Bank, \nwhich have been condemned by the international \ncommunity and the International Criminal Court, are \ncreating further problems and placing new obstacles in \nthe path of the peace process in the Middle East. We \ncall on all parties, including the Quartet, to act to build \na climate favourable to the restoration of trust among \nthe parties concerned in the peace process so as to \nattain comprehensive and just peace.  \n It is high time to put an end to the procrastination \npolicies of Israel. We greatly deplore the fact that \nIsraeli occupation forces are committing offences in \nthe holy sites in Jerusalem, which are among the most \nsacred to Muslims. We warn the occupying Israeli \nforces not to persist in such measures because, besides \n  \n \n08-53135 14 \n \ntheir potential impact on the peace process, they may \nalso have uncontrollable and unforeseeable \nconsequences. We believe it essential to adopt \nresolutions without delay to provide for the protection \nof the holy places and religious symbols, whatever they \nmay be, while firmly condemning any prejudice or \ndamage that may be done to them.  \n We warmly welcome the positive developments \nin Iraq. We also welcome the improved security \nsituation and hope to see greater political stability in \nthat fraternal country. From this rostrum, we welcome \nmeasures taken by the Iraqi Government to establish a \ntimetable to end the presence of coalition forces on \nIraqi territory as a major step towards its recovery of \nsecurity, peace and stability and in order to protect its \nArab identity and strengthen its national unity and role \nin the region.  \n We are also closely monitoring with great \nsatisfaction the positive results achieved in Lebanon \nand the work being carried out by the Arab Group \nunder the auspices of sisterly Qatar. We hope that the \nagreement between the various Lebanese parties and \nbetween the Syrian Arab Republic and Lebanon will \nalso be successful. Security and stability must be \nstrengthened in that region, and we hope that those \nagreements will play an important role in enhancing \nprosperity and peace for our neighbours in Iraq and \nLebanon. \n The Republic of Yemen is deeply concerned by \nattempts to interfere in the internal affairs of the \nSudan, and we reaffirm the importance of respecting \nthe sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence \nof that country. We call on the international community \nto fully assume its responsibilities in Darfur, and we \nencourage dialogue between the Sudanese Government \nand the various factions, considering any party that \nrejects dialogue and reconciliation and that resorts to \nviolence to be a terrorist entity imperilling peace and \nstability. We also welcome the African and Arab efforts \nto resolve the Darfur problem and to nullify the \nnegative impact of the decision of the Prosecutor of the \nInternational Criminal Court. We once again express \nour repudiation of politicized decisions by international \njudicial and humanitarian organizations that infringe \non the sovereignty of States and interfere in their \ninternal affairs. \n Instability in Somalia has negatively affected \ncountries of the region and is threatening the safety and \nsecurity of navigation in international waters, as a \nresult of the worsening phenomenon of piracy.  \n As members are aware, the number of refugees is \nconstantly rising. Those refugees, who number \napproximately 500,000, have come to Yemen from the \nHorn of Africa. Millions in Somalia and in the Horn of \nAfrica are threatened by famine, which could increase \nthe number of refugees and thus the burden borne by \nthe Government of Yemen. Therefore, we call for \ngreater international support to help Yemen cope with \nthe waves of refugees and to help Yemeni coast guard \nforces to combat piracy. \n The situation in Somalia poses a challenge to the \ninternational community and requires serious efforts to \nachieve peace and security for the Somali people in \norder to enhance security and stability in the Horn of \nAfrica. In that connection, we welcome Ethiopia\u2019s \nreadiness to withdraw its forces from Somalia and \nreaffirm the need to deploy international forces to \nrestore stability there. We also call on all Somali \nparties to seek reconciliation and end their disputes, \nbearing in mind the interests of the Somali people, and \nwe urge all external actors to refrain from interfering in \nSomalia\u2019s internal affairs. \n My delegation stresses the need to continue the \nprocess of United Nations reform. We reaffirm our \nresolve to join all other countries of the world in \ncontributing effectively to the attainment of that \nobjective. We believe that such reform is necessary and \nimportant and that all must join in the efforts to \nachieve it. Of particular importance is reform of the \nSecurity Council, which should not be limited to \nexpanding its membership, but should ultimately result \nin more rational use of the right of veto so that it can \nno longer be used to block resolutions approved by the \nvast majority of the membership.  \n In closing, on behalf of Yemen, I wish to thank \nthe Secretary-General for his unstinting support, efforts \nand guidance at the head of the Organization.

        "file_text": "It is perhaps fortuitous \nthat my own Deputy Prime Minister happens to be \npresiding over the Assembly at the time when I address \nthe Assembly for the very first time. But it is not true, \nas someone suggested to me just before I came to the \nrostrum, that we have come to the sixty-third session of \nthe General Assembly believing that we are still at the \nOlympics in Beijing. Neither is it true that my name is \nUsain Bolt. My name is Bruce Golding.  \n I offer Mr. D\u2019Escoto Brockmann my \ncongratulations on his presidency and I ask you, \nMr. Vice-President, to convey those congratulations to \nhim. He has assumed that office at a time when the \nworld faces challenges of crisis proportions. Much will \nbe demanded of his leadership, and I want you, Sir, to \nassure him of Jamaica\u2019s full support and cooperation in \nall of his endeavours. \n \n \n21 08-52272 \n \n We have convened amid worrying global \ndevelopments. The hopes of the new millennium are in \ndanger of fading as the ideals of international harmony \nand shared global prosperity remain elusive. \nGlobalization, despite its promise of expanded \nproduction and trade, has been uneven in the spread of \nits benefits and, for many countries, marginal in its \nimpact. Indeed, the gap between rich and poor has \nwidened within and among countries. \n The global economy now appears to be headed \nfor a severe downturn. Developments in the global \nfinancial system, the painful increase in oil and \ncommodity prices and the escalating food crisis \nthreaten to plunge vast sections of the world\u2019s \npopulation deeper into poverty. Fiscal challenges and \nthe crippling burden of debt render many countries \nincapable of responding to the crisis. Countries like \nJamaica are called upon to respond within our limited \ncapacity to protect the most vulnerable. \n In the long term, however, our hopes for survival \nwill require huge investments, improved productivity, \nbetter access to the world\u2019s markets and human \ncapacity-building. Developing countries cannot be left \nto find their own solutions. The situation requires a \ncollaborative, coordinated and global response. That is \nnot mere altruism. It is an indisputable truth that, if \ndeveloped countries assist developing countries to \nimprove their economies, their productive capacity and \nthe purchasing power of their people, they will expand \nthe markets for their own goods and services. It is the \ninterdependency that we share and that is manifested in \nso many other areas, from climate change to global \nepidemics, organized crime and human trafficking. \n Solving the problem of developing countries \nrequires more than mere liberalization of trade, more \nthan mere privatization of the economy and more than \nthe mere free flow of capital. It requires a sincere and \nsustained effort that focuses on the limitations that \nbedevil developing countries. Global development, not \njust global markets, must be at the centre of our \npriorities. \n Poverty and wealth should not have to coexist. \nPoverty can be eradicated. The tools of development \nexist and are capable of transforming the world, \nempowering the poor and enabling them to rise from \ntheir poverty. We must therefore commit ourselves to \ncreating a world in which not everyone may be rich, \nbut no one has to be poor. \n In 2001, we committed ourselves to achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals by 2015. We are now \nat the halfway mark and we are behind schedule. It is \ntime to take stock to see where we are, who is falling \nbehind, and what must be done to make up lost ground. \n A critical success factor must be the partnership \nbetween developed and developing countries as \ndefined in the 2002 Monterrey Consensus on financing \nfor development, integrating aid, debt relief, market \naccess, good governance and foreign direct investment. \nThose initiatives were carefully calibrated. Proceeding \nwith some elements without the others will not achieve \nthe goals we have set. Indeed, it might make it worse. \n We must all pull up our socks if we are to reverse \nthe slippage we have suffered. Developing countries \nmust ensure that their priorities are properly structured. \nDeveloped countries must live up to their commitment \nto devote 0.7 per cent of their gross national income to \nofficial development assistance. That is a modest \namount, yet only five countries have so far done so. \n The focus of development cooperation cannot, I \nsubmit, be too narrowly defined. The varied economic \nand social profiles of developing countries require a \nmore flexible response that recognizes investment in \nhuman capital, infrastructure and the transfer of \ntechnology as critical elements in reducing poverty in a \nsustained way. \n That is particularly important to developing \ncountries that are classified, based on per capita \nincome, as middle-income countries. That \nclassification deprives them of access to concessionary \nfinancing and creative measures to reduce the crippling \ndebt burden that afflicts so many of them. If we are to \nreduce poverty, the peculiar circumstances of those \ncountries cannot be ignored since that is where more \nthan one third of the world\u2019s poor are to be found. \n We call on the international community to devise \nstrategic programmes to address the peculiar needs of \nmiddle-income countries with deep pockets of poverty. \nBecause of those factors and because of our exposure \nto frequent natural disasters, which in the matter of a \nfew hours can reverse gains that took years to \naccomplish, Jamaica and its Caribbean Community \n(CARICOM) partners are proposing the international \nrecognition of CARICOM States as a special category \nof small vulnerable and highly indebted middle-income \ncountries. \n  \n \n08-52272 22 \n \n The international financial system, designed more \nthan 60 years ago in the context of those times, has \nundergone very little change in its governance, \nstructure and practices. However, the world has \nchanged and that requires a re-engineering of the \nglobal financial system. Jamaica supports the call for \nreform of the existing financial infrastructure to reflect \nthe new global realities and make it more proactive and \nresponsive to the needs of the entire world community. \nI want to suggest, however, that it must involve more \nthan merely expanding the membership of an exclusive \nclub. It must be development-driven, recognizing that \npoverty anywhere is a threat to prosperity elsewhere. It \nmust include mechanisms to detect signs of global \ncrises and must be able to institute preventive \nmeasures. \n The crisis currently rocking the world\u2019s financial \nmarkets reflects the inadequacy of the regulatory \nstructures that are essential to the effective functioning \nof any market. But it is more than that. It represents the \nfailure on the part of the international financial system \nto facilitate the flow of resources into areas where they \ncan produce real wealth, not paper wealth. The world is \nnot short of capital. What it lacks are the mechanisms \nto ensure the efficient utilization of that capital. \n I want to suggest that another urgent task is the \ncreation of a viable and equitable international trading \nsystem. Jamaica is deeply disappointed that the Doha \nDevelopment Round has failed to deliver on the \npromise of an open, fair and predictable multilateral \ntrading system. We urge all parties to resolve the \noutstanding differences, particularly on the removal of \ntrade-distorting agricultural subsidies, and to address \nthe need for special safeguard mechanisms for \neconomically challenged countries.  \n The need for more concerted action on global \nwarming is impatient of debate. Developing countries \nare the most vulnerable, but they are also the least \ncapable of mitigation measures. Countries that are the \nmajor pollutants must bear the major share of the \nresponsibility for corrective action. They must make \nbinding commitments to fulfil that responsibility. The \npurchase of carbon credits, especially from developing \ncountries, must not exculpate them from that \nresponsibility. \n Jamaica calls for a fair, equitable and balanced \nlong-term scheme to bind emission caps within a new \ninternational framework beyond 2012, when the Kyoto \nProtocol expires.  \n The impact of climate change on agricultural \noutput, and the frequency and intensity of natural \ndisasters to which countries like Jamaica are \nparticularly vulnerable, point to the need for a global \nenvironment management structure that establishes \nclear standards and enforces compliance. \n Jamaica is concerned that political instability in \nmany parts of the world, often fuelled by extremism \nand intolerance, continues to threaten regional and \ninternational peace and security. They are neither \nlimited in scope nor confined to national borders. \nResolving those conflicts requires effective diplomacy \nand global cooperation, and the United Nations must \ncontinue to use its good offices to secure just and \npeaceful settlements. \n Our intense focus on combating terrorism and \ntransnational organized crime, and eliminating nuclear \narms and other weapons of mass destruction must not, \nhowever, marginalize the need for decisive action to \ncurb the illicit trade in small arms, which facilitate \ninternal violence in many of our countries and result in \nhigh levels of homicide. Jamaica supports the \nestablishment of an arms trade treaty to impose strict \ncontrols on the illegal trade in small arms and \nammunition. \n The persistent humanitarian crisis in Darfur \ncontinues to be a matter of serious concern to all of us. \nWe are disappointed that the African Union-United \nNations Hybrid Operation in Darfur is not yet fully \noperational. We urge all parties to desist from actions \nthat could deepen the crisis, jeopardize the safety of \nthe civilian population and of United Nations personnel \nand prevent access to humanitarian relief. \n Jamaica remains irrevocably committed to \nfinding a just, lasting and peaceful solution to the \nMiddle East conflict \u2014 a solution that must ensure the \nsecurity of Israel and the establishment of a viable \nPalestinian State. \n The United Nations must continue to play a \npivotal role through its peacekeeping missions in the \ncreation of sustainable peace in post-conflict situations. \nJamaica will use its membership in the Peacebuilding \nCommission to underscore the importance of sustained, \nlong-term economic development in rebuilding and \n \n \n23 08-52272 \n \ntransforming countries that have been wracked by \nconflict. \n The devastation wrought in Haiti by recent \nhurricanes has aggravated the already harsh conditions \nunder which the Haitian people are forced to live. \nMuch more needs to be done not only in providing \nemergency relief, but also in addressing the long-term \nsocial, economic and development needs of that \ncountry, as a sustainable solution to the fragile \nhumanitarian situation that exists there. Haiti needs and \ndeserves the support of the entire international \ncommunity. \n We are gathered here this week as Members of \nthat union we call the United Nations. What is the state \nof that union? We must not ignore the cynicism that \nexists in some quarters about the continued value of the \nUnited Nations. Those cynics have not bothered to \ncontemplate what the world would be like if the United \nNations did not exist. But we have contributed to that \ncynicism, so often bending the facts to suit our own \ndesign, breaking the rules to secure a particular \nadvantage and making commitments without the will to \nhonour them. \n Reform of the structure and procedures of the \nUnited Nations is an imperative whose time has long \ncome. Let us not bury it in procrastination and \nincessant squabbling. It is time for constructive, \nconsensus-building dialogue. The need for changes in \nthe structure and scope of the Security Council has \nbeen under discussion for almost 15 years, bogged \ndown in polarized, adversarial positions. \n We have a compelling duty to put in place \nsystems that can secure peace and prosperity for the \nfuture. We therefore welcome the unanimous adoption \nof decision 62/557, contained in paragraph 23 of \ndocument A/62/47, which, we hope, will provide \nresolve for the early commencement of \nintergovernmental negotiations within a specified time \nframe and in the context of an informal plenary \nmeeting of the General Assembly. \n The sixtieth anniversary of the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights serves to remind us of \nthe central role of the United Nations in promoting \nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms. Those are \nessential components of the environment required for \nsustained development. It was consistent with that \nprinciple that we launched the initiative to erect a \nmonument to honour the victims of slavery. I thank the \nSecretary-General and the members of the committee \nfor their support and assistance. I also thank Member \nStates that have made or pledged contributions. We \ninvite other States to do likewise. \n Six decades ago, the founding fathers of the \nUnited Nations agreed that the Organization should be \na mechanism for harmonizing the actions of nations in \nthe achievement of our common goals: peace and \nprosperity throughout the world, respect and tolerance \namong the powerful and support for the weak and \nvulnerable. That remains our mandate, our unfinished \nbusiness. Fulfilling that mandate and advancing that \nmission will require a more proactive United Nations, \none that is more responsive to the needs of Member \nStates and gives equal attention to issues of peace, \nsecurity and development. The hopes of people \neverywhere in the world depend on us, the leadership \nthat we provide and the will that we exert for the times \nin which we live. We must not fail them. "

        "file_text": "Allow me \nto extend my congratulations to Mr. D\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann on his election to the presidency of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-third session. I wish him \nsuccess in his great work responsibilities and projects. \nI hope he will be able to work for the interests of States \nMembers of the United Nations. I would like also to \nthank his predecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, for presiding \nover the last session of the General Assembly. \n It is with honour and pleasure at this major \ninternational gathering that I convey greetings from the \nGovernment of the Republic of Iraq and its people. \nIraq\u2019s former regime left behind security and political \nconditions that had become a drain on the energy of the \nIraqi people and that led to a deterioration of the \ncountry\u2019s economy. Those conditions also left behind \nsignificant environmental and social damage. The \nforeign policy of the former regime and its domestic \npractices dragged the country into futile wars, leaving \nbehind millions of victims and the destruction of \neconomic and state institutions. \n While the Iraqi people are building a new federal \nState on the basis of democracy, pluralism and the \npeaceful distribution of power, they have been subject \nto and affected by a series of terrorist acts targeting all \nIraqis, be they Sunni or Shia Arabs, Kurds, Turkmen or \nChaldo-Assyrians, and attempts to ignite sectarian \nstrife, undermine the political process and stability of \nthe country, and return Iraq to the days of tyranny, \nbackwardness, oppression and dictatorship. \n \n \n27 08-51845 \n \n Terrorism is a blind danger that threatens \neveryone. At a time when the Iraqi people call upon the \nrepresentatives of their elected national Government to \ncombat the remnants of terrorism, they call upon the \ninternational community, and in particular \nneighbouring countries, to support Iraq in its efforts to \nsuppress violence and terrorism and to promote peace, \nsecurity and stability. That would have a positive \nimpact on the stability and security of the region and \non the interests of its peoples and of the international \ncommunity as a whole. \n The acts of terrorism committed by the enemies \nof freedom will not discourage our people from \ncreating a new democratic experience. Our people have \npaid a heavy price for embracing that experience. Our \nposition requires the support and assistance of \ncountries around the world if we are to build a modern \nnation that ensures justice, equality, strengthened the \nrule of law, respect for human rights and participation \nby women in all spheres of life. \n The Iraqi Government continues to impose the \nrule of law throughout Iraq with determination, \ndisarming militias and armed gangs, fighting sectarian \nconflict and building State institutions on the basis of \nnational unity. \n The initiative for reconciliation and national \ndialogue launched by the Iraqi Government among the \nvarious stakeholders in Iraq \u2014 be they Muslim, \nnon-Muslim, Arab, Kurd, Turkmen, Chaldo-Assyrian, \nShiite or Sunni \u2014 draws its strength from the heritage \nof the Iraqi people, which has rendered great services \nto humanity. Iraqis have coexisted in a spirit of \nfraternity, love and tolerance since the dawn of history. \nTheir religious, sectarian and national diversity has \nbeen a driving force in promoting national unity. \nNational reconciliation is a shared responsibility \nbetween political forces, decision makers, religious \nscholars, intellectuals, civil society organizations and \nall active actors in Iraq. \n Progress has been achieved on the ground thanks \nto ongoing national reconciliation activities that have \nbrought about the end of sectarian killings and an \nimprovement in the security situation, along with the \nreturn of thousands of displaced families to their \nhomes, the launch of construction projects and the \nprovision of services to citizens. \n The proper preparation and continuous training \ngiven to security and military forces have greatly \nimpacted their efficiency and capacity to respond to \ncriminal gangs, militias and terrorist organizations. \nThose forces conducted successful security campaigns \nto enforce the law in Baghdad and thereby eliminated \nmost of the armed militias and gangs and terrorist \ngroups, which greatly helped us to restore security and \nstability. We also undertook similar and successful \ncampaigns in Basra, Mosul, Diyala and other \nprovinces.  \n The Iraqi security forces have taken over security \nduties from the multinational forces in many of Iraq\u2019s \nprovinces, most recently in Anbar. We are currently \nassuming full responsibility for defending and \npreserving the democratic achievements of our people. \nThe Government is aware that those efforts have not \nfully attained our objectives and aspirations and that \nthere is still much work ahead of us before we achieve \nthe stable and prosperous Iraq to which we all aspire. \nTherefore, we call upon the international community to \nsupport and assist Iraq in achieving those noble goals. \nWe are determined to assume responsibility for all \nsecurity tasks by the end of this year. \n The national unity Government has sought to \nimprove Iraq\u2019s relations with other countries \nthroughout the world, in particular our neighbours, in \naccordance with the principles set out in the new Iraqi \nConstitution. It calls for the establishment of good \nrelations with neighbouring countries that share our \ninterests, on the basis of non-interference in their \ninternal affairs, diplomacy, direct dialogue and the \npeaceful settlement of disputes. Therefore, Iraq is no \nlonger a threat to international peace and security. We \ncall on the international community to ensure that Iraq \nis no longer subjected to action under Chapter VII of \nthe Charter of the United Nations, putting an end to all \nSecurity Council measures against Iraq, including with \nregard to compensation.  \n We thank our neighbouring countries for \nparticipating in three large regional conferences, the \nmost recent of which was held in Kuwait in April 2008. \nWe also thank them for their continued cooperation and \ncoordination to support the efforts of the Government \nand the people of Iraq to restore peace, stability and \nprosperity, by promoting ongoing dialogue in the areas \nof national reconciliation, combating terrorism, \nstrengthening the rule of law and increasing political \nparticipation. Those conferences have given \nparticipants the opportunity to reaffirm their \ncommitments to Iraq\u2019s territorial integrity, unity, full \n  \n \n08-51845 28 \n \nsovereignty and independence and to non-interference \nin its internal affairs, as well as their pledges to honour \nthose commitments. We are currently preparing for a \nforthcoming meeting among Iraq\u2019s neighbours to be \nheld in Baghdad, at which we will be able to set forth \nguiding principles for future positive cooperative \nefforts in the political, economical and security fields. \n Thanks to Iraq\u2019s new policies, our country has \nbecome a meeting place for dialogue for regional and \ninternational adversaries. We would like to enhance \nthat positive role and to adopt a policy that will help to \nfurther reduce tensions and wars not only in the region \nbut also in the world at large. This year, senior Iraqi \nofficials made important high-level visits to \nneighbouring countries and other nations. Iraq was also \nvisited by senior officials from the region, and their \nconsultations promoted balanced and stable political \nand economic policies that increased the Arab \ndiplomatic presence in Iraq. Therefore, we call on all \nnations \u2014 especially given the great improvement in \nour security situation \u2014 to open or reopen diplomatic \nmissions and to enhance existing ones by increasing \nthe level of their representation.  \n Furthermore, in its foreign policy, Iraq has made \nit a priority to enhance its role in the international \ncommunity through effective participation in meetings \nand conferences held by United Nations agencies and \nfunds on various international issues. Iraq has also \nacceded to many United Nations conventions and \ntreaties, including the Chemical Weapons Convention, \nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, the Kyoto \nProtocol and protocols and conventions related to the \nfight against terrorism.  \n Given the nearly 50 per cent increase in the Iraqi \nbudget compared with last year, and in view of our \nfuture aspirations and the improvements owing to \nincreased revenues derived from our natural \nresources \u2014 including our fertile agricultural lands and \nabundant water, mineral, and human resources \u2014 we \nsigned the International Compact with Iraq, aimed at \nachieving economic prosperity and social justice in \npartnership with the international community. That \ndocument represents a new stage in the establishment \nof balanced relations between Iraq and the other \nnations of the world. The First Annual Review \nConference of the International Compact, held in \nStockholm in May 2008, saw a high level of \ninternational participation. Its outcomes included a \nproposal to establish a new international development \npartnership that would include a joint financing \nmechanism for new programmes with international \npartners in Iraq, as well as an effort to identify critical \nareas for cooperation on issues such as human \ndevelopment, human rights, reconstruction and \neconomic governance, as points for departure in \ndeveloping new patterns of international cooperation \nand assistance with regard to Iraq.  \n The Government of Iraq would like to thank the \ninternational community for assisting us in our efforts \nto address our crises and challenges. We would also \nlike to thank the countries that have cancelled Iraqi \ndebt and to thank the Secretary-General Secretary for \nhis good efforts to that end.  \n The Government of Iraq is eager to cooperate \nwith the United Nations and would like to reactivate \nthe Organization\u2019s work in our country so that the \ninternational community can strengthen its efforts to \nrebuild Iraq and to support national reconciliation and \nour democratic experience. We thus call on the United \nNations to enhance its presence in Iraq so that those \nefforts will yield greater results.  \n We agree with the world\u2019s leaders regarding the \nneed to reconsider and reassess the international \nsituation and current political, economic and \nenvironmental crises. Indeed, the world has become a \nvillage and all events are interlinked, which means that \nan event in one region of the world will affect events in \nother regions. Therefore we must engage in dialogue, \ncooperation, coexistence and understanding in order to \nemerge from such crises. We also wish to highlight the \nrole of international and regional organizations as \nmechanisms for promoting dialogue and cooperation. \nThose are lessons that we have learned from the Iraqi \nexperiment and our own difficulties, and we see no \nalternative to such an approach in addressing the \ncurrent complex world situation. Therefore we call on \ninternational organizations to rebuild and reactivate \ntheir structures and to reduce their routine and \nbureaucracy.  \n The problems of the Middle East can be resolved \nthrough constructive and meaningful dialogue, in \naccordance with the resolutions of international \nlegitimacy and the principles of international law. \nTherefore the Government of Iraq supports the struggle \nof the Palestinian people to exercise their inalienable \nrights, including the right to establish an independent \nState. We call for the implementation of the resolutions \n \n \n29 08-51845 \n \nof international legitimacy in returning the occupied \nArab territories. We consider the Arab Peace Initiative \nendorsed by the Arab Summit to be a good and just \nbasis for the settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. \nTherefore, and in order to enhance peace and security \nin the region, we call for the establishment of a Middle \nEast zone free of weapons of mass destruction. \n The Government of Iraq attaches great \nimportance to reform of the United Nations, in \nparticular the Security Council, to improve its \nperformance. While we believe that it is important to \nexpand the Council\u2019s membership to make it more \nrepresentative and more responsive to the great \nincrease in the number of Member States in \ncomparison with 60 years ago, we also believe that it is \nessential to improve the Council\u2019s working methods in \norder to enhance its effectiveness and capacity to \nperform, which affect the interests of all Member \nStates. At any rate, the increase in the membership of \nthe Council must not affect its effectiveness or \nefficiency. Promoting stability and prosperity calls for \nenhancing cooperation among the countries of the \nworld.  \n We need to improve relations among the \nsovereign countries of the world and develop the \ninternational system so that it will be fairer and better \nable to assist development programmes in poor and \ndeveloping countries through increased support from \nwealthy countries.  \n In conclusion, allow me on behalf of my country \nand the people of Iraq to extend congratulations to the \nPresident of the General Assembly. We are confident \nthat his wisdom and remarkable qualities will bring \nabout success in the current session of the General \nAssembly. "

        "file_text": "I would like to join other \ndelegations in congratulating you, Sir, on your \nunanimous election to preside over the sixty-third \nsession of the General Assembly. I am sure that with \nyour experience and diplomatic skills you will chart a \nsuccessful outcome of this session. \n I also take this opportunity to express my \nappreciation to Mr. Kerim, President of the Assembly \nat its sixty-second session, for his leadership and \ndedication in guiding us diligently throughout his \ntenure. \n Human security and the dignity of every man and \nwoman require us to continue the discussion in order to \nbuild consensus on the principle of the responsibility to \nprotect, particularly in relation to genocide, war \ncrimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, \nas agreed by the 2005 World Summit. While we realize \nthe sensitivity of the issue, Malta agrees with the \nSecretary-General that we need to move from \ndeclarations of commitment to practice and \nimplementation. \n Likewise, the fight against terrorism must remain \nhigh on our agenda. We should not lower our guard. \nWe must always be vigilant and ready to take \ncollective and practical action on a daunting, complex \nand politically sensitive issue. Terrorism has no \nboundaries, and the unspeakable acts of terrorism can \nstrike anywhere, at any time, in poor and rich \ncountries, with innocent victims paying for these \nvicious terror attacks, such as that perpetrated in \nPakistan last week, attacks which undermine the \nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms of the \nindividual and of society itself. \n Malta, as a State party to the International \nCriminal Court, believes that the work carried out so \nfar by the Court is commendable and merits our \ncontinued cooperation and commitment towards the \nmaintenance of international peace and security. \n Malta feels that the continuing recruitment and \nuse of children in armed conflict and other grave \noffences against children merit our full condemnation. \nIn this regard, we welcome the sustained activity of the \nSecurity Council Working Group on Children and \nArmed Conflict as well as the sterling work being \ncarried out by the Secretary-General\u2019s Special \n  \n \n08-52265 2 \n \nRepresentative for Children and Armed Conflict, \nMs. Coomaraswamy. \n The protection of the human being brings with it \nthe responsibility to protect the environment. One of \nthe issues which have been described as the defining \nchallenge of our times, and also a matter described as \nthe flagship issue of the debate at the sixty-second \nsession, is climate change.  \n Next December we shall commemorate the \ntwentieth anniversary of the Assembly\u2019s adoption, on \nthe proposal of Malta, of resolution 43/53, entitled \n\u201cProtection of global climate for present and future \ngenerations of mankind\u201d, in paragraph 1 of which the \nAssembly recognized that \u201cclimate change is a \ncommon concern of mankind\u201d. Malta is proud that the \nseminal proposal launched in 1988 found universal \nsupport, which eventually led to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change and the \nKyoto Protocol. \n The fact that the Assembly met earlier this year, \nafter high-level panel discussions, for a thematic \ndebate on \u201cAddressing Climate Change: the United \nNations and the World at Work\u201d continues to give \ncredibility and authority to the will of the \noverwhelming majority of States to respond urgently to \nclimate change.  \n The process initiated at the Bali Conference last \nyear established a clear road map with a view to \nagreeing on a new multilateral, comprehensive, \ncoherent and effective post-2012 agreement, which we \nhope will be reached by 2009, in order to avoid any \nimplementation gap. \n Malta reiterates its conviction that we have a \ncommon obligation and responsibility to support \nambitious and urgent action, at the national, regional \nand international levels, within the United Nations \nFramework Convention so as to stop and overturn in \nthese coming years the accumulation of greenhouse \ngases, which are causing detrimental climate change. \nThe vulnerability of small island States like my \ncountry to the negative impacts of climate change \nneeds to be underlined. \n For obvious reasons, Malta continues to direct its \nefforts towards making the Mediterranean a region of \npeace and cooperation. \n We welcome and recognize the important \ndevelopments on the Cyprus question; the renewed \nvigour in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations; the indirect \nnegotiations between Israel and Syria, with Turkish \nmediation; the formation of a national unity \nGovernment in Lebanon; and the improved relations \nbetween Lebanon and Syria. \n Since we met here last year important \ndevelopments have taken place on the negotiations for \na permanent settlement of the Palestinian question. The \nAnnapolis Conference, held in November 2007, \nrenewed hope when there was otherwise a bleak future \nwith regard to the resolution of this question. Malta \nfeels that all United Nations Member States, without \nexception, should continue to support the Secretary-\nGeneral in his quest, together with the Quartet, to \nresolve the issue of Palestine refugees and that of the \npermanent status of Jerusalem, as well as the other \nimportant issues of settlements, borders, water and \nsecurity. \n The Paris International Donors Conference for \nthe Palestinian State, the formal start of Israeli-\nPalestinian negotiations and the series of meetings \nbetween Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas \nhave given a most welcome meaning to the efforts \nbeing made to resolve all outstanding issues, including \nall core issues without exception.  \n Malta\u2019s hosting of a United Nations International \nMeeting on the Question of Palestine, held in June this \nyear, followed shortly afterwards by the visit to Malta \nof President Mahmoud Abbas in July, came at an \nimportant \u2014 indeed, crucial \u2014 phase in the ongoing \nefforts to implement the Road Map and its \ncommitments, as well as the obligations for a \npermanent two-State solution. We shall continue to \nlend our support to all initiatives that would bring \neverlasting peace to both the Israeli and Palestinian \npeople. \n We welcome all initiatives which create a bond \nbetween European and Mediterranean countries. A case \nin point is the Parliamentary Assembly of the \nMediterranean, with its headquarters in Malta, aiming \nto bring together all the littoral States of the \nMediterranean on an equal footing to examine \nquestions and take decisions on issues of direct interest \nto the countries in the region. \n An important development in the Euro-Med \npartnership was the launching last July, on the \ninitiative of President Sarkozy of France, of what is \nnow known as the Union for the Mediterranean within \n \n \n3 08-52265 \n \nthe Barcelona Process. Malta believes that this \ninitiative will be a significant milestone in our common \nefforts to promote security and prosperity in the Euro-\nMediterranean region, to the equal benefit of all \nEuropean Union member States and Mediterranean \npartners. Malta looks forward to working \nconstructively with other members of the Union to \naddress some of the problems which the Mediterranean \nconfronts, including in particular development, food \nsecurity and the provision of water and energy. \n While referring to these problems, I must \nhighlight also the unprecedented increase in the influx \nof irregular immigrants that have been arriving in \nMalta mainly from the African continent. Malta is well \naware of its responsibility in this area. However, as has \nbeen highlighted on numerous occasions, it is \nextremely difficult for us to continue to carry such a \nburden, which is so acutely disproportionate to the size \nof the country and its population.  \n It is for this reason that Malta has continuously \nrequested assistance in tackling this problem through \nthe principles of solidarity and sharing of \nresponsibilities by Europe and other countries, as well \nas the United Nations High Commissioner for \nRefugees. Malta is grateful to those countries that have \ncome forward to assist us in coping with this \nphenomenon. Nevertheless, much more needs to be \ndone by us all, including the countries of origin and the \ncountries of transit. \n Africa continues to present us with a formidable \nchallenge. It is a challenge not only for African \ncountries themselves, but for the whole of the \ninternational community. While noting with \nsatisfaction the success stories in the reduction of \npoverty, Malta remains very concerned that progress in \nAfrica is still lagging behind. We have an obligation to \nenhance efforts to assist African countries to meet their \nlegitimate goals of sustainable development. \n It has been acknowledged that the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and the protection of human rights \nshare a number of characteristics which require our \nconstant attention. Recent phenomena, such as climate \nchange, rising food prices and international financial \ninstability, add further obstacles to the attainment of \nthese Goals. Poverty eradication and the achievement \nof all the Millennium Development Goals are to be \npriorities of our times which should be addressed in a \nmultidimensional way, both through the conduct of \npolitical and economic decision-making and through \nsocial and environmental factors related to different \nfacets, such as culture and gender equality, geography, \nclimate and energy. \n Malta strongly believes that the pledges made at \nthe Millennium Summit in 2000 on the attainment of \nthe Millennium Development Goals remain the \noverarching objective of our global agenda. Besides \nbeing a signatory to the Call to Action launched by \nPrime Minister Gordon Brown, Malta is also actively \nworking to reach its targets for official development \nassistance set by the European Union. \n The United Nations is passing through exciting \nbut challenging times. Under the able leadership of the \nSecretary-General, the search for a reinvigorated \nOrganization that will provide the whole membership \nwith a sound basis to look to the future with vigour and \ndetermination has been endorsed and accepted by \nMember States. \n During the sixty-second session, Member States \ncontinued to consider a series of critical issues in the \nprocess of reforming our Organization, including \nadvancing a system-wide coherence, reviewing all \nmandates originating from resolutions of the General \nAssembly, management practices, the revitalization of \nthe General Assembly, and giving the Security Council \na more equitable representation. \n We all recognize that the transformation of the \nUnited Nations into a stronger Organization requires \nfrom all of us determination and conviction that only a \nconcerted effort by all Member States can achieve. The \nreform of the United Nations is an evolving exercise \nwhich requires on our part not only understanding, but \nalso solidarity and partnership which we as Member \nStates must engage to overcome the new and emerging \nchallenges facing humankind. \n In a few weeks, Member States will be \ncelebrating the sixtieth anniversary of the adoption of \nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Sixty \nyears have passed since that historic day in 1948, six \ndecades which have witnessed great political, \neconomic and social upheavals in the lives of our \npeoples. Throughout these years, this family of nations \nhas also increased fourfold, an increase bringing with it \na diverse community, large and small countries, rich \nand poor, but with the sole aim of upholding the \nfundamental premise of the Universal Declaration that \n  \n \n08-52265 4 \n \n\u201call human beings are born free and equal in dignity \nand rights\u201d. \n This anniversary on 10 December 2008 will \nprovide us with the opportunity to rededicate ourselves \nto the pledges and commitments we made when we \nbecame Members of this Organization. It is a \nrecommitment which as Prime Minister of Malta, and \non behalf of the Maltese people, I solemnly make \ntoday. "

        "file_text": "Mr. Miguel \nd\u2019Escoto, in electing you to the presidency of the \nAssembly, Member States wished to show their \nconfidence in your wealth of experience, as former \nMinister for Foreign Affairs, to successfully guide its \nwork. The Senegalese delegation congratulates you \nthrough me. At the same time I wish to thank and \ncongratulate our Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \nwho has taken many initiatives since he was elected as \nthe leader of our Organization, as demonstrated by the \nrecent meetings dealing with Africa.  \n Many heads of State have referred to the dizzying \nincrease in the price of oil, including, just now, the \nPresident of the Dominican Republic. That is not by \nchance, because many of us have denounced the policy \nof the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries \n(OPEC), which establishes the price of oil as it wishes \nand tries to blame it on the increase in demand \u2014 as if \nwe had never studied economics.  \n The assessments of our association have not been \nvery optimistic, but it should be noted that the \nobjectives set by the founding Members have not been \nachieved. I quote from the birth certificate of our \nOrganization that one of the purposes was \u201cto promote \nsocial progress and better standards of life in larger \nfreedom\u201d. I believe that the United Nations has served \nhumanity considerably by resolving some conflicts and \nby establishing lasting peace, but we must also \nrecognize its shortcomings in many areas, including \npeace and in the economic field.  \n Today, populations throughout the world have \ngreat expectations of our meeting, because humanity, \nfortunately, still hopes, and that hope remains alive in \nthe countries that are called poor, and indeed they are. \nBut I usually say with regard to Africa that it is not \npoor, but rather that Africa is a continent that has been \nimpoverished over five centuries of slavery and one \ncentury of colonization and exploitation. However, \ndespite all of that, Africa has engaged itself in \ninternational cooperation \u2014 bilateral and multilateral. \n  \n \n08-51749 26 \n \nWe also strive to contribute within the United Nations, \nfor example to peace, which is one of the objectives of \nour Organization.  \n Experience teaches us that there are limits to our \ninternational system. As you, Mr. President, and the \nSecretary-General have both mentioned, we should \nlook directly at the issues and undertake reforms. \nAbove all, we must demonstrate imagination and a \ncapacity for innovation. \n The first issue of concern to us is to feed Africa. \nWe must substitute this idea of food aid, which was at \nthe origin of the Food and Agriculture Organization of \nthe United Nations (FAO), and replace it with the \nconcept of assistance to agriculture, because we have \ndemonstrated that we are able to carry out agriculture \njust like developed countries. Unfortunately, we suffer \nfrom certain shortages, including seeds, fertilizer and \nequipment, as I will show in a moment. In place of \ntraditional financing, we need to imagine what is \nreferred to now as innovative financing.  \n In June 2008, we raised an alarm over the \nincrease in the price of basic commodities and \nespecially of food products. The Secretary-General \nasked FAO to meet in Rome with heads of State. We \ndropped everything in order to go to Rome and respond \nto that appeal, believing that real solutions would be \nproposed. Solutions were proposed, but we are still \nwaiting for them to be implemented. At the same time, \nI drew attention to the fact that the countries of the \nSahel region have three to four months of rain each \nyear, during which time one could grow whatever one \nwanted if one had the means to do so. That is followed \nby eight or nine months of drought. \n We launched that appeal, but like the doctor who \narrives after the death, no one responded. Fortunately \nfor Senegal, we foresaw difficulties due to the weighty \nglobal mechanisms and launched a programme called \nthe Great Agricultural Offensive for Agriculture and \nAbundance. We were told it was too ambitious because \nit amounted to $800 million. \n The project, which began at the end of May, will \nbe completed in a month. I have the pleasure to inform \nthe Assembly that, beyond meeting its food needs, \nSenegal has met the challenge of achieving a surplus. \nSix months ago, Senegal was among the most food-\ndependent countries, importing all its food, including \nmore than 600,000 tons of rice annually. But a look at \nSenegal today reveals that there is green everywhere. I \ncalled on all Senegalese everywhere, including in the \nSenegalese diaspora, to farm as much as they \nwanted \u2014 on 10, 20 or 1,000 hectares \u2014 so long as it \nwas food. That great offensive, as I have said, has \nunquestionably been a great success. The world will \nnot see Senegal launching an appeal for food \nassistance. We have solved the problem and hope that \nwe have solved it once and for all.  \n Admittedly, we could not have done it without \nGod\u2019s help. The programme required $100 million, a \nthird of which was to be devoted to fertilizer. \nFortunately, our country is endowed with phosphate \ndeposits that can be directly used as fertilizer for crops, \nthus enabling us to save one third of the cost of our \ninvestment in the programme. This has been possible \nbecause of the belief I have adhered to for more than \n50 years. I have said for a long time that we could find \nphosphate. We have now gone out to find that hidden \nwealth. As I said in jest about the previous regimes, \nGod had hidden it from them, but we managed to find \nit. \n Africa has responded to the call to protect the \nenvironment. President Obasanjo and I launched the \nGreat Green Wall Initiative, whereby a band of trees \n15 kilometres wide and 7,000 kilometres long will \nstretch from Dakar to Djibouti. Once again, we were \ntold that it was a dream. No, as I speak, since, in the \nwords of the philosopher, we believe in going forward \nby walking, Senegal is in the process of building \n587 kilometres of the Great Green Wall. Everyone has \nsupported us in this endeavour \u2014 France, the United \nStates, the European Union \u2014 at least in words. We are \nlooking forward to your support, especially from the \nscientists, who we hope will help us to choose drought-\nresistant plants. It is possible. I contacted scientists \nthrough the Internet. They came from all over the \nworld \u2014 Europe, the United States, American \nuniversities and Australia. I accordingly called for the \nhelp now of the Science Without Borders association. I \ninvited scientists to Senegal because their knowledge \ncomes free of charge, and they are always willing to \nmake it available for the benefit of humankind.  \n The Great Green Wall will be backed by what we \ncall retention basins. Billions of tons of water that fall \nduring the rainy season are lost to runoff or the sea. We \nare trying to capture that water, as is being done so \nwell in countries such as Burkina Faso. We in Senegal \nare making that a systematic effort. The World Bank \n \n \n27 08-51749 \n \nhas labelled our effort conclusive, and we also want to \nbuild a green strip from Dakar to Djibouti. \n Africa is therefore responding to the call of the \ninternational community to protect the environment. \nHowever, I cannot fail to point out that the African \ncoast is in the process of disappearing, with several \ncentimetres being lost from Morocco to the Gulf of \nGuinea each year. In that connection, a first meeting \nwas held in Cotonou a few days ago to address the \nissue of coastal erosion.  \n As the Assembly is aware, the Secretary-General \nhas issued a challenge to Africa. Not long ago, the \nWorld Bank indicated that five African countries were \ncapable of achieving the Millennium Development \nGoals, including Senegal. The Secretary-General has \nsaid that no African country would achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals. I, for my part, \nrespond to challenges. I shall meet that challenge for \nSenegal, I shall take it up, and that is not a dream. Not \nlong ago, Senegal was very far down on the World \nBank\u2019s Ease of Doing Business Index. Just a few days \nago, thanks to our targeted efforts to overcome our \nshortcomings, Senegal was classified as the first \ncountry in Africa for doing business, and the fifth in \nthe world.  \n Child and maternal mortality is one of the \nobstacles to overcoming our shortcomings. After \ngiving thought to the problem, we decided a week ago \nin Senegal that, so long as the problem is left up to the \nState, we will not make progress. We have instituted a \nnew approach that entails putting in charge a woman in \neach neighbourhood of the affected areas to monitor \npregnancies and help pregnant women to visit doctors, \nas well as to immediately inform the authorities of any \nproblems. We hope that will enable us to reduce child \nand maternal mortality. We are even going so far as to \nprovide cell phones to women in the interior of Senegal \nso that they can report cases to health-care centres. \n There is also a need to establish a new \nmechanism to mobilize resources. That was our goal in \nsetting up a pilot group for solidarity levies to fund \ndevelopment. We have also launched a digital \nsolidarity fund. We Africans have done that, with the \nsupport of the entire world. We are therefore on our \nway to bridging the digital divide identified by the \nSecretary-General. \n As we begin our work here, more than 1 billion \nMuslims throughout the world are fasting in \naccordance with one of Islam\u2019s five pillars. Apart from \nreligion, for every Muslim the fast is a code of \nbehaviour inspired by the lofty values of peace, \nsharing, forgiveness, respect and brotherly love, \nirrespective of religion. On the basis of the letter and \nspirit of the message of Islam, which are being \ncelebrated during this Holy month of Ramadan, and in \nmy capacity as Chairman-in-Office of the Organization \nof the Islamic Conference, I should like here to \nreiterate the adherence of the Islamic Umma to the \nprinciples of the culture of peace and dialogue among \ncivilizations. We affirm that we condemn extremism, \nviolence, intolerance and discrimination, which are \ncontrary to the teachings of Islam and which our \nreligion condemns as a source of unhappiness and \ndiscord. It is for that reason that we are willing to \nengage in a dialogue with all civilizations.  \n The United Nations ideal of peace continues to be \ntested by the reality of conflicts in the world. Although \nwe have certainly seen fewer trouble spots in Africa, \nconflict still rages in Chad, the Sudan and Darfur. We, \nfor our part, will always continue to give our active \nsupport to peace and the United Nations. \n Quite sincerely, however, I believe that there will \nbe no solution in Darfur until we disarm all armed \ngroups, which have been clearly identified. As for \nZimbabwe, we welcome the progress that is being \nmade. In Mauritania, we, as a neighbouring country, \nare very concerned about what is taking place. But I \nshould like to reiterate here that we very much believe \nin the rule of law of the Republic, in accordance with \nthe position outlined by the African Union.  \n We are also continuing our efforts in the Middle \nEast, as we have been called on to give our support to \nintra-Palestinian dialogue and to dialogue between \nIsrael and Palestine. \n For many years now, I have consistently \nbemoaned the ineffectiveness of economic thinking. \nThe failure from which we are suffering today is the \nfailure of economists and financiers and, more \ngenerally, of the intelligentsia. I greatly appreciate the \nappeal just made to the intelligentsia made by the \nPresident of the Dominican Republic.  \n I continue to believe that the solution to the crisis \nis not to be found in the North; crises begin in the \nNorth, but we will not find their solutions in the North. \n  \n \n08-51749 28 \n \n The global economy moved from Europe to the \nUnited States where it created a new centre of \ndevelopment that has underpinned the global economy \nfor almost 200 years. Now that economy is running out \nof steam because of crises like the one we are facing \ntoday.  \n President Bush has told us about a solution \nadvocated by his financiers, but I am sorry: the \nsolution to the North\u2019s crisis lies in the South; the \nsolution lies in Africa. \n Rather than allowing capital to roam in every \ndirection to create inflationary situations, I think it \nbetter, as a Keynesian thinker, to call on Members to \ninvest in the creation of wealth and jobs in Africa, a \ncontinent possessed of great material and human \nresources and capable of taking its turn as the engine of \nthe exhausted global economy. That economy, which \nleft Europe for the United States, will finally be \ndeveloped in Africa. \n That is why we call on the entire world to invest \nin Africa because it is there that I sincerely believe that \nthe last advances will be achieved. It is true that some \ntrouble spots remain \u2014 as in every country \u2014 but with \nthe support of the General Assembly and the \nSecretary-General, and with all people of goodwill, we \nare sure that Africa will be able to play that role, \nprovided of course that Africans are trained as soon as \npossible to assume that historic mission. \n It is on this note of hope and as Vice-President of \nthe New Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development \n(NEPAD) and President-in-Office of the Organization \nof Islamic Conference (OIC) that I make an appeal to \nall countries to continue supporting efforts for peace \nand continue supporting investment efforts in Africa."

        "file_text": "On behalf of my \ndelegation and the Government and the people of the \nCommonwealth of Dominica, I would like to \n \n \n29 08-52265 \n \ncongratulate the President on his election to preside \nover the sixty-third session of the General Assembly. \nWe are especially pleased that, for the first time, a \nnational of Nicaragua is presiding over this body. Let \nme assure him of my delegation\u2019s fullest cooperation. \n We are meeting at a time of great international \nuncertainty. It stems from various global crises related \nto the availability and affordability of food, an \nincreasingly unstable international financial system and \nvolatility in the supply and cost of energy. In a \nstatement to the High-level Segment of the Economic \nand Social Council last July, China and the Group of \n77 commented on the predicament currently facing the \nworld. They observed, quite rightly, that it was  \n\u201cdriven significantly by a severely unbalanced\u2026 \neconomic system, made even more unbalanced by \nspeculation; a climate \u2026 and environmental \ncrisis; as well as a crisis of confidence in \ninternational institutions that were created to \nprovide policy advice and coordination on global \nissues.\u201d  \n  Mr. Siles Alvarado (Bolivia), Vice-President, took \nthe Chair. \n \n Today we endure the consequences. For small and \nvulnerable States in the Caribbean, such as ours, \nglobalization continues to significantly change the \ndynamics of economic survival and sustainability. Our \nefforts to diversify our economies, adjust to global \ndevelopments and stay competitive represent a \nformidable undertaking. As small States, we \nincreasingly feel we have fallen off the radar screen of \ndeveloped countries, which seem inconsiderate of our \nplight, especially in the key areas of trade and \nfinancing for development. \n We keep hearing about a need for change. Indeed, \naround the world, change is being proffered as the \npanacea to all challenges and problems facing \nhumankind. When everything else has failed, change, it \nwould appear, becomes the only answer. As one of the \nyoungest heads of Government who will address the \nGeneral Assembly, I believe I have a duty to \ncommunicate to the world body that the word \u201cchange\u201d \nis beginning to ring hollow with young people around \nthe world. \n Over the past decade, many countries have taken \nsteps to effect change, as recommended. Sadly, in far \ntoo many instances, things have remained pretty much \nthe same. What is really needed is meaningful change \nand a greater global commitment to making that \nchange happen. When I speak of meaningful change, I \nmean change that goes beyond lip service and makes a \nnoticeable difference in the lives of entire populations. \nMany countries cannot achieve such change alone. \nThey need vital support from countries with advanced \neconomies. \n Four years ago, when I addressed this body, I \nappealed for meaningful structures to be instituted to \nminimize the suffering and harmful effects of natural \ndisasters on small developing nations in particular. I \nam disappointed that no real progress has been made. \nToday, I address the Assembly against the backdrop of \nhundreds of fatalities and thousands of casualties from \nwhat so far has been a very active 2008 Atlantic \nhurricane season. Besides the loss of lives and personal \ninjuries, natural disasters have inflicted billions of \ndollars worth of damage on small developing States. \nMost of those States are incapable of starting any \nshort- or medium-term recovery programme on their \nown because of their limited resources. \n Compare their plight with that of some developed \ncountries where regions have been similarly devastated \nby hurricanes, earthquakes and mudslides. Those \nregions have been declared disaster areas and national \nresources have been mobilized to build and rebuild in \nrecord time, in some instances better than before. Let \nus compare the cases of two small countries: Haiti, in \nthe Caribbean, less than four hours away from where \nwe are meeting in the commercial capital of the world, \nand Georgia, on the Black Sea coast. Soon after the \nGeorgia crisis, the United States Administration \nannounced a $1 billion reconstruction package for \nGeorgia, pledging that $500 million of that package \nwas to be delivered by December of this year. That is \ncommendable indeed; but what of Haiti? \n That Caribbean country just south of the Florida \nkeys is the poorest country in the western hemisphere. \nIt is virtually a ward of the United Nations and the \nOrganization of American States. It was devastated by \nthe two worst hurricanes of this season \u2014 Gustav and \nIke. We saw heart-wrenching images of women and \nchildren who had lost everything, caught in razor wire \nas they fought each other for inadequate relief supplies. \nWhat is the response of the United States \nAdministration, the United States Congress and the \nUnited States presidential campaigns to the devastation \nin Haiti? What is the response of Canada and the \n  \n \n08-52265 30 \n \nEuropean Union? Where is the billion-dollar \nreconstruction package for the people and Government \nof Haiti? \n We, the international community, are in Haiti. \nThe United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti has \nbeen in the country for over three years now, and has \ndone a commendable job to help to restore the \ndemocratic, social and economic institutions of Haiti. \nBut we know what is needed to bring about real and \nmeaningful change, in the quality of life of the more \nthan 8 million people of that great country of Haiti. \nYet, we shrink from committing the resources and \nprogrammes needed to achieve those results. We are \nproviding life support to Haiti, not support for recovery \nand reconstruction. My question is: Why is the \nresponse to devastation in Georgia so different to our \nresponse to devastation in Haiti? \n In the international financial markets, turbulence \nof unprecedented and horrific proportions has taken \nplace. The last fortnight alone has broken decades-old \nrecords for corporate closures, collapses and job losses. \nThe effects of those events will be felt equally, and \nperhaps even more severely, in small developing \ncountries such as those in Latin America and the \nCaribbean. \n I speak today as the leader of a small developing \nisland State whose economy was effectively paralyzed \ndue to a series of decisions taken by representatives of \ndeveloped nations and multilateral agencies who \nseemed totally unmindful of or indifferent to the \nimpact of such actions on small and vulnerable \neconomies. In 2002 and 2003, the Commonwealth of \nDominica suffered one of the worst economic crises in \nits history. That was due in part to the deteriorating \nfortunes of the banana industry, precipitated by a \nUnited States of America-supported challenge to the \nEuropean Union banana import regime before the \nWorld Trade Organization. What might have been an \nacademic argument for some became an issue of \nsurvival for us. \n There is no country in the world that has been \nmore dependent on banana exports than Dominica. \nThat fact meant nothing to those who engineered the \nnear-demise of the industry in the Caribbean members \nof the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States \nas they put the WTO mechanisms to work to their \nbenefit. The result was severe economic crisis and \nhardship, from which our farmers are yet to recover. I \nbriefly recall those dire circumstances to emphasize the \nresolve, resilience and determination of our people, as \nwell as what may be described as the insensitivity or \nindifference of others to the plight of small developing \nMember nations. \n The meaningful change of which I speak and for \nwhich our populations yearn must be reflected in our \nattitudes and approaches to each other. Why speak of \nand proffer change if our attitude to the issue of the \nfundamental differences between nations \u2014 small and \nlarge, rich and poor \u2014 remains the same? \n I think here of the issue of climate change. The \nfourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change found that sea-level rise \ncaused by global warming is likely to exacerbate storm \nsurges and coastal erosion on small islands. What that \nmeans for us is severe damage to the infrastructure of \nhuman settlements, including contamination of fresh-\nwater supplies and agricultural lands and the pollution \nof marine eco-systems caused by the indiscreet and \nunsustainable practices of others. \n Why speak of change if industrialized nations, in \nparticular, refuse to heed the warnings and show \ngreater commitment to saving the planet and reversing \nclimate change? Meaningful change should quicken the \npace of the climate change negotiations at Poznan, \nPoland later this year, with the objective of providing a \nrealistic and attainable framework for the 2009 \nagreement in Copenhagen. \n Change ought not merely to be a slogan or an \nexcuse for inaction. Let me reaffirm that change can be \nreal and meaningful. \n Take, for example, the response of the nations in \nthe Caribbean and Central America to the global \nenergy crisis. As expected, the surging price of oil has \nadversely impacted the economies of the small island \nStates of the Caribbean. To address the energy crisis in \nthe region, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela came \nup with an innovative initiative known as Petrocaribe \nin 2005. That initiative supplies fuel through a flexible \npayment facility to some 18 net oil-importing countries \nin the Caribbean and Central America. Petrocaribe also \nmakes provisions to guarantee regional energy \nsovereignty by establishing an energy security \narrangement through providing a reliable and timely \nsupply of oil from Venezuela and increasing fuel \nstorage capacity in the Caribbean. \n \n \n31 08-52265 \n \n Since the volatility in oil prices has placed \nnational balance of payments and foreign exchange \nreserves at risk, the Petrocaribe pact has taken on \nincreased economic importance as a critical lifeline for \nmany developing economies of the Caribbean and \nCentral America. The initiative has become the single \nlargest source of concessionary finance to the \nCaribbean region, with credits to importing countries \nfrom June 2005 to December 2007 amounting to some \n$1.17 billion. In contrast, traditional donors and \nmultilateral assistance during the period in question \namounted to approximately one quarter of the \nPetrocaribe figure. \n The Commonwealth of Dominica joins with other \ncountries of our hemisphere in expressing our \nappreciation to Government of Venezuela for the \nPetrocaribe initiative. We also applaud the Government \nof Trinidad and Tobago for establishing in 2004 a \nSpecial Petroleum Fund for member States of the \nCaribbean Community, which has provided timely \ngrant funding to meet general development objectives. \n Those two initiatives by the petroleum-exporting \nStates of Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago are \nshining examples of South-South cooperation and are \ndeserving of emulation by other oil-producing States. \nThey demonstrate that meaningful change, if earnestly \npursued, can make a difference in the lives of the small \nand most vulnerable. \n The global crisis in the availability and price of \nfood presents yet another unprecedented challenge to \ndeveloping countries. It is another area where \nmeaningful change can make a difference.  \n Reports by the United Nations Conference on \nTrade and Development, which have helped to \nunderscore the gravity of the problem. One states that \n\u201cWorld food prices have roughly doubled over the past \nthree years, but between April 2007 and April 2008 \nalone they increased by 85 per cent.\u201d \n Of particular concern is the price of rice, a staple \nfor many people in the developing world. The price of \nrice has trebled since September 2007, rising by some \n160 per cent just within the first quarter of this year. \nWe concur with the views of the Secretary-General \nabout the worsening food crisis, which could push an \nadditional 10 million people into hunger and poverty, \nover and above the existing 800 million. \n We endorse the Secretary-General\u2019s conclusion \nthat the crisis is a moral outrage, as well as his concern \nthat the achievement of the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) is threatened by the double jeopardy of \nhigh food and fuel prices. \n All of that calls for meaningful change \u2014 change \nin attitude and change in practice. The people we are \nelected to serve are committed to and long for that \nchange. They have mandated us to make the necessary \nchange. The question is, are we so committed? Are we \nready? Are we going to agree to and effect meaningful \nchange? \n That, for many, is what the sixty-third session of \nthe General Assembly is all about: meaningful change \nfor the good of all, meaningful change that will make a \ndifference, meaningful change that will transform \nlives, meaningful change that will replace talk with \naction. For many small island States, securing a new \nglobal commitment to meaningful change will be the \nbenchmark for judging the success of the session. \n Let us therefore resolve at the sixty-third session \nof the General Assembly to effect the meaningful \nchange that can make a difference in the lives of our \npeoples. Dominica stands ready to play its part. "

        "file_text": "I congratulate you, \nMr. President, on your election to preside over the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-third session. You may \nremain assured of the full support and cooperation of \nthe Nigerian delegation as you guide our deliberations. \nMay I also express appreciation to your predecessor for \nthe able manner in which he presided over the work of \nthe Assembly\u2019s sixty-second session. \n In his address to this Assembly last year (see \nA/62/PV.7), the Nigerian President reaffirmed the \ndetermination of Nigeria to remain a stable and \nprosperous nation, anchored on the enduring principles \nof democracy, good governance, free enterprise, the \nrule of law and respect for fundamental human rights. \nIn pursuit of those objectives, we have raised the bar \non bold political, economic and social reforms aimed at \nmaking our economy more investment friendly and our \ndemocracy more inclusive. We continue to count on the \nsupport and understanding of the international \ncommunity, especially our development partners, as we \naccelerate measures to enhance the overall capacity of \nthe Nigerian State. \n A strong, safe and prosperous Nigeria means a \ndependable contributor not only to regional stability \nand well-being, but to the emergent global ethics so \ncrucial for the survival of humanity. From the very \nbeginning of our nationhood, our foreign policy has \nbeen tethered to a responsible and proactive role in the \nUnited Nations and its commitments everywhere. Thus, \nwe never hesitated to respond unconditionally to \ndemands for sacrifices whenever and wherever duty \ncalled, whether in the Congo, Sierra Leone, Liberia or \nnow in Darfur, and in the next few months, in Somalia. \nNigeria is as safe as the rest of the world. That for us is \nthe true meaning of global solidarity and the sense of \nequal partnership that informed the vision of the \nfounding fathers of this Organization. \n It is against that background that we raise before \nthe Assembly the concern and plight of many \ndeveloping countries, especially in Africa, suffering \nfrom the devastating consequences of the illicit trade in \nsmall arms and light weapons. Most of the civil wars \nand insurgencies in those countries have been carried \nout with such weapons, and because of their lethality \nand ready deployment, they may be described as \nAfrica\u2019s own experience of weapons of mass \ndestruction. \n We remain convinced that the best and most \neffective strategy to achieve the goal of preventing, \ncombating and eradicating that illicit and deadly trade \nis through the elaboration of a legally binding global \ninstrument, as well as the political will on the part of \nall to stem the uncontrolled proliferation of small arms. \nTherefore, urgent action is needed to criminalize oil \nbunkering, the sale of oil so acquired and the use of its \nproceeds to fuel new crisis situations in Africa, \nespecially in the Gulf of Guinea, through the \nproliferation of small arms and light weapons. The \nsame creativity and political will that was \ndemonstrated in confronting blood diamonds as a \nsource of regional instability must be available at this \ntime in dealing with the blood oil that now threatens \nthe Gulf. \n Nigeria has made enormous sacrifices on behalf \nof peace in Darfur. Over the years we have maintained \npeacekeeping troops in the region, first, under the \nambit of the African Union and now under the African \nUnion-United Nations hybrid peacekeeping force. We \ncall on the international community to take bold and \nrobust steps that would lead to the full deployment and \noperationalization of that force. In the same vein, we \ncall on the Government of the Sudan to take steps that \nwill facilitate the attainment of this objective. \n Midway towards the target year of 2015, it has \nbecome evident that the lofty Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) might not be attained by many \ncountries. This much is clear from the outcome of the \nHigh-level event on the MDGs that took place in the \nmargins of this session on 25 September 2008. Mindful \nof the importance of these Goals for our development, \nNigeria is determined to do everything to ensure their \nrealization. In this connection, we commend the efforts \nof the Secretary-General in creating the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals Africa Steering Group to map out \nstrategies for African countries to achieve the targets. \n It is time to urge, with the directness that these \nchallenging times demand, evidence of a more \nmanifest will on the part of the international \n  \n \n08-53141 10 \n \ncommunity, especially our development partners, to \nreally assist Africa to join the rest of the global success \nstory. Around this issue, the Nigerian delegation is \nlooking at ten such indicators. \n The first is the critical need for a big \ninfrastructure push, especially in energy and \ntransportation, without which nothing else is possible \non the continent. Secondly, the food crisis in Africa \nmust be addressed by redressing the trilogy of fertilizer \nimbalance between Africa and other regions of the \nworld, removing food subsides in the developed \neconomies, and transferring relevant technology for \nfood production and food processing. Thirdly, the Doha \nRound of trade negotiations must be revived. Fourthly, \nmassive investment in information technology and \nhigher education is needed to spur development of \nAfrica. Fifthly, strategies must be devised with African \nGovernments on how to transform the continent\u2019s \ncurrent brain drain into brain gain. Sixthly, a global \ncommitment to stem the flow of small arms and light \nweapons into Africa is needed. Seventh, national \nExtractive Industries Transparency Initiative projects \nin Africa must be encouraged and supported. Eighth, \nthere should be Security Council reforms that accord \nAfrica permanent membership in the Council. That \nwould ensure African ownership of its responses, since \nover 60 per cent of issues addressed by the Council are \nAfrican. Ninth, attention should be paid to \ndevelopment of clean energy technology and \nalternative sources of energy to avert the looming \ndisaster of climate change for a continent that is \nalready very vulnerable. Tenth, we need a breakthrough \nin the malaria vaccine, together with greater sustained \nsupport for the fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic, \ntwo major impediments to reaching our potential in \nAfrica. \n The recent steep rise in global food prices has \npresented us with a monumental challenge and the \nglobal embarrassment of compounds of misery sharing \nincreasingly crowded space with compounds of \naffluence in our global village. It is unacceptable that, \ndespite technological advancements and resources \nunimaginable two decades ago, children still die of \nhunger and malnutrition. How can one say that the \ngenius that permits us to make living in outer space \nfeasible looks the other way when over 1 billion people \nin the world are going to bed hungry and more than \n6 million children are dying each year of hunger and \nmalnutrition? This problem deserves the full attention \nof this Assembly. The right to food for all must be \npursued with renewed vigour. \n Nigeria condemns terrorism in all its forms and \nmanifestations. We reaffirm our support for the \ncounter-terrorism measures of the Security Council and \nthe United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. \nWe have also been implementing the four pillars of the \nGlobal Strategy through measures that have proven \neffective in combating terrorism. For us, the fight \nagainst terrorism is strongly anchored in the rule of law \nand respect for human rights. As we combat this \nscourge, it is important that, fundamental freedoms and \nhuman rights are neither compromised nor abused. \n The United Nations must not relent in its pursuit \nof the goal of a world in which all nations and peoples \nlive in freedom and dignity and in which all political, \neconomic, social, cultural and human rights are fully \nguaranteed. Our active participation in the activities of \nthe Human Rights Council and the African \nCommission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights is \nevidence of that commitment. \n In our subregion, we are concerned, that drug \ncartels, often based outside the region, are now \ntargeting West Africa as a transit route for the \nmovement of illicit drugs to other regions. The \nactivities of those drug cartels constitute a serious \nimpediment to development in the subregion. The \nworld must pay adequate attention to this growing \nproblem. \n Let me reiterate Nigeria\u2019s unwavering support for \nthe United Nations and its objectives and purposes. We \nare convinced that the Organization remains the most \nviable platform for consultations, consensus-building \nand action on the global challenges that we presently \nface. Mankind has not developed any better substitute. \n Nigeria believes in the pacific settlement of \ndisputes and peaceful coexistence with our neighbours. \nWe showed that when, on 14 August 2008, Nigeria, in \nfull compliance with the ruling of the International \nCourt of Justice, lowered its flag for the last time by \nwithdrawing from the Bakassi Peninsula. For that \nsingular act of statesmanship, Nigeria has justifiably \nreceived the commendation of the international \ncommunity. Our action accords with our long-standing \ntradition as a nation that honours its commitments. We \nbelieve that if we all, in concert, stand up for these \nshared values and purposes, our Organization and our \nworld will be a much better place. \n \n \n11 08-53141 \n \n This can, and should be a General Assembly like \nno other, for the crises that face us now have few \nprecedents in scope and complexity. What is required \nis a new posture to move from data to determination, \nfrom rhetoric to results and from words to wisdom. Our \nmany noble visions must begin to somehow find more \nvigorous forms of expression. A world so greatly \nchallenged must also be a world so much more capable \nof imagination and boldness. The platform for such \nboldness and such imagination is here, in this \nvenerable institution founded 63 years ago on the \npillars of peace, justice and freedom for all. \n Let us never forget the timeless words of the \ninternationalist and Nobel Laureate who warned that to \ndeal with the problems that we have created, we need \nto move unto a higher order of thinking than the one \nwith which we created them. The time to do so is now, \nfor the clock of humanity is ticking very fast. Our \nexistential challenge did not end with the cold war; \nindeed, it has just started.  "

        "file_text": "I congratulate you, Sir, on \nyour election as President of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-third session. We support the priorities that \nyou have identified for this session. I wish to express \nNamibia\u2019s appreciation for your predecessor, Srgjan \nKerim, for focusing the agenda of the sixty-second \nsession on matters of crucial importance to Member \nStates. We commend the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban \nKi-moon, for tirelessly taking up the challenging issues \nof peace, security and economic development. \n The sixty-third session of the General Assembly \nis taking place at a time when the global economy is \ndominated by four interrelated crises. I have in mind \nthe financial crisis in the industrialized countries, the \nglobal energy crisis, the devastating impact of climate \nchange as well as the food crisis which has adversely \naffected poor people around the world. Other, no less \ndaunting, challenges are the HIV/AIDS pandemic, \nunderdevelopment and abject poverty, as well as the \nneed to foster peace and security around the world. We \nmust act decisively and collectively at national, \nregional and global levels to overcome these \nchallenges. \n The devastating effects of climate change have \nbecome present-day realities in all parts of the world. \nNamibia has experienced the negative impact of \nclimate change. The floods and droughts during 2007 \nand 2008 were some of the most devastating in recent \n  \n \n08-51606 34 \n \ntimes. In their wake, they left poor harvests, livestock \nlosses, environmental degradation, damaged infrastructure \nand destroyed livelihoods, thus putting a severe strain \non our plans to invest in new development projects.  \n Namibia is committed to the Bali road map in \norder to conclude the negotiations on the post-Kyoto \nregime by 2009. We call on all parties to honour their \ncommitments under the Kyoto Protocol, including the \nimmediate and full capitalization of the Adaptation \nFund. Namibia will play its part in the lead-up to \nCopenhagen. \n We want to contribute to making Copenhagen a \nsuccess in terms of commitments and substantial \nmitigations, financial instruments for adaptation efforts \nin developing countries and mechanisms for sharing \nand harnessing appropriate technologies. \n As a net importer of food and fuel, Namibia has \nbeen hit hard by the soaring prices of commodities. \nThere will be catastrophic increases in the incidence of \nhunger, malnutrition and infant mortality in developing \ncountries unless the trend is reversed. That calls for a \ndecisive national, regional and international response. \nIn our case, the Government of Namibia has exempted \nsome basic foodstuffs from value-added tax in order to \nmitigate the effects of higher prices on food. Such \ninterventions can provide some relief to households. \nHowever, there remain long-term challenges, which \ndemand appropriate policies and substantial new \ninvestment to raise agricultural productivity and \nincrease food production around the world.  \n There is a real risk that the gains made by \ndeveloping countries in poverty reduction and the \nattainment of the other Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs) over the years will be reversed if we do not \nact rapidly. \n Global efforts to address the food crisis, the \nimpact of climate change and the drive to achieve the \nMDGs must go hand in hand. In that regard, we \nsupport the proposal for the General Assembly to hold \nthematic debates until 2015 to take stock of success \nachieved and setbacks encountered in the achievement \nof the MDGs. \n That will give development cooperating partners \nan opportunity to account for the fulfilment of their \ncommitments. On the other hand, developing countries \nshould also account for their commitments to \nstrengthen democratic institutions, enhance good \ngovernance and fight corruption. \n There is a need for genuine political will, \nespecially among donor countries, if the MDGs are to \nbe attained. In this context, open, predictable and \nnon-discriminatory trading and financial systems must \nbe developed. We call for the intensification of the \nimplementation of the Global Partnership for \nDevelopment as agreed upon at Monterrey in 2002. \n We also appeal to the Bretton Woods system and \nother international financial institutions to create \nspecial mechanisms to enable middle-income countries \nto access financial resources for development on \nconcessional terms. That was called for by the \nWindhoek Declaration on Development Cooperation \nwith Middle-Income Countries. \n The scourge of poverty is one of the most serious \nchallenges facing humanity today. I believe that, with \nthe requisite political will, poverty can be overcome. \nLet us act in unity of purpose to address not only the \nmanifestations of poverty, but also its underlying \ncauses, which make communities vulnerable. Let us \nharness the technological, financial and other resources \nnecessary to eliminate the dehumanizing effects of \npoverty on all members of the human family. \n Peace and security as well as social justice are \nparamount to the achievement of the MDGs and to the \nresolution of conflicts. In that regard, all countries \nmust commit themselves to implement the policies that \npromote economic growth, social justice, the rule of \nlaw, democracy, respect for human rights and the \nprotection of the environment, in order to guarantee \ndurable peace and security. \nMr. Beck (Solomon Islands), Vice-President, took \nthe Chair. \n On 15 September 2008, the political leaders of \nZimbabwe signed a power-sharing agreement designed \nto restore political and economic stability to their \ncountry. We wish to congratulate the leaders of \nZimbabwe on that important milestone and to express \nthe hope that it will put that sister country on the path \ntowards economic recovery. We commend the \nmediation efforts of the Southern African Development \nCommunity, led by President Thabo Mbeki of South \nAfrica, who invested extraordinary skill, time and \nenergy in the process. We urge the international \ncommunity to support the implementation of the \n \n \n35 08-51606 \n \nagreement by providing economic, financial and \nhumanitarian assistance. We call for the immediate \nlifting of all sanctions that have been imposed on that \ncountry. \n My delegation is concerned that the question of \nWestern Sahara remains unresolved. We support the \nongoing direct talks between the parties under the \nauspices of the Secretary-General. We also call for the \nimplementation of the United Nations settlement plan \nfor Western Sahara and of all relevant United Nations \nresolutions providing for a free and fair referendum in \nthat territory. Namibia is also concerned about the \nconflict situations in the Darfur region of the Sudan \nand in Somalia. We urge the respective parties to those \nconflicts to work to find lasting peace. \n The people of Palestine have an inalienable right \nto self-determination. Namibia is concerned about the \nlack of progress in the negotiations on the question of \nPalestine. We call for the immediate implementation of \nall United Nations resolutions on Palestine and for the \nestablishment of an independent State of Palestine \nliving side by side with Israel. \n My delegation reiterates the call that we have \nmade on several occasions in this House for the \nunconditional lifting of the economic, commercial and \nfinancial blockade against Cuba. Not only is the \nblockade against international law; its extraterritorial \nnature impedes free trade and economic development. \nNamibia calls for the implementation of all resolutions \nof the General Assembly calling for the lifting of the \nblockade. \n If we are to be able to respond effectively to the \nmanifold challenges of our time, we must accelerate \nthe reform of the United Nations. Member States \nshould work with resolve to strengthen our \nOrganization and to ensure that it delivers in terms of \nits mandate. However, the process will not be complete \nwithout reform of the Security Council. We have an \nobligation to make the Council more representative, \ndemocratic and accountable. It is an anomaly, and it is \nunjust, that Africa does not have permanent \nrepresentation on the Security Council. Namibia \nreiterates the African common position on Council \nreform as articulated in the Ezulwini Consensus and \nthe Sirte Declaration. Intergovernmental negotiations \non reform should commence without any further delay.  \n It is our duty to ensure that the United Nations \nremains true to its unique universal character and that \nit becomes a source of hope for a more secure and \npeaceful world for current and future generations."

I have \nalso talked about unjust systems governing the world; \npressures exerted by some Powers seeking to trample \nthe rights of other nations; oppression imposed on the \nmajority of the global community, especially on the \npeoples of Iraq, Palestine, Lebanon, Africa, Latin \nAmerica and Asia; about challenges we are faced with, \nsuch as efforts to shatter the sanctity of families, \ndestroy cultures, humiliate lofty values, neglect \ncommitments and expand the shadow of threats; as \nwell as about the arms race and the unfairness and \ninability of the systems governing world affairs to \nreform the status quo. \n \n \n9 08-51606 \n \n With the emergence of various new \ndevelopments, the debility of existing mechanisms has \nbeen revealed even more starkly.

Against the backdrop of the despair caused by \nthe new developments, that trend has ignited a glimmer \nof hope in the hearts of men for a brilliant, desirable \nand beautiful future. \n Today, I would like to talk to the Assembly about \nthe main reasons behind the conditions ruling the \nworld and the means to address them. Of course, the \nAssembly is already aware of what I am talking about, \nbut I think it is necessary to remind ourselves. It seems \nthat the roots of problems lie in the way one views and \nperceives the world and humankind, as well as in the \nimportant issues of freedom, obeisance to God, and \njustice. The world, humankind, freedom, obeisance to \nGod, and justice have been of the utmost importance to \nhumans throughout history. \n God Almighty purposefully created the world. \nThe world is the bedrock for the evolution and growth \nof a creature called man, and the laws governing the \nworld and all other creatures are at the service of \nhumankind\u2019s quest for loftiness. The world should \nprovide the needed opportunities for the fulfilment of \nthe purpose behind humankind\u2019s creation. No \nphenomenon, creature or, indeed, anything has been \ncreated in vain. Together they all pave the way for the \nflourishing of humankind in a complex and purposeful \nsystem, and they are each one of the signs of God \nAlmighty. All are His creations and He is the sole \ncreator and ruler of the world. All existence, including \npower, knowledge and wealth, comes from Him. \n With regard to humankind, God created the world \nfor humans, and humans for Himself. He created \nhumans from mud and in the soil, but He did not want \nthem to remain in the soil or with animal instincts. He \nkindled the light of guidance in their souls and asked \nthem to rise from the soil to the heavens and to Him \nwith the help of wisdom, prophets and perfect men. \n The world will ultimately disappear, but God has \ncreated humankind for eternity and has made it a \nmanifestation of Himself. Creativity, mercifulness, \nkindness, knowledge, wisdom, zeal, compassion, \nsplendor, justice, bounteousness, generosity, greatness, \nlove, glory, dignity, forgiveness, insight, kingship and \nall other goodness and beauty are attributes of God. \nGod did not create humans for aggression, bloodshed, \nrancour, selfishness and destruction. He made humans \nHis vicegerents on Earth and has asked them, on the \none hand, to make Earth prosper by using their God-\ngiven potentials, to prepare the ground for the growth \nof divine attributes in all humans and to provide all \nwith a life full of beauty, amity, freedom, justice and \ngoodness; and, on the other hand, in pursuance of that \npath, to prepare for a prosperous, everlasting life \nendowed by God\u2019s mercy. God has obligated humans to \nlive divinely and socially, for it is only through social \nlife and interactions with others that divine attributes \ncan emerge. \n With regard to obeisance to God, God Almighty \nhas tied the perfection and true freedom of humans to \nthe devotion and obedience to Himself. True freedom \nand obedience to God are in balance, and in fact are \ntwo sides of the same coin. Obeisance to God means \nconfessing to monotheism, obeying His commands, \nand being free from ungodly worship. Obeisance to \nGod means the acceptance of the absolute truth, the \nabsolute light and the absolute beauty. Obeisance to \nGod means abandoning selfishness, animal instincts, \npower-seeking and aggression and surrendering to \nrighteousness, justice, love and perfection.  \n In that way, humans can achieve their true \nfreedom and flourish. They can grow and manifest \ndivine attributes, have affection for others, stand up for \njustice, fear no power or threat and defend the \noppressed. In such an environment, one\u2019s freedom will \nnot impinge on any others\u2019. Contention and conflict are \ncharacteristic of materialistic freedom and animal \ninstinct. The essence of all divine religions and \nobeisance to God and true freedom is disassociating \nfrom oppressors and instead obeying and worshiping \nGod. \n God is omniscient and knows all that is revealed \nor kept secret, and He is kind and merciful. All \ncreatures are humble before Him and resign themselves \nto His will. God is alive and is the Creator of the \nuniverse and all life. God loves His creatures and \ndesires nothing but goodness, blessings and perfection \nfor them, and is against bullying, injustice, selfishness \nand domination. \n With regard to justice, it is the foundation of the \ncreation of humankind and the whole universe. Justice \nis tantamount to placing every phenomenon in its own \nplace and providing humans with opportunities to \n  \n \n08-51606 10 \n \nactualize all their divine capabilities. Without it, the \norder of the universe will collapse and the opportunity \nfor perfection will fade away. Without justice, it would \nbe impossible for human society to taste real peace, \nbeauty, joy and happiness. Justice is the main pillar of \nsocial life, and without it social life cannot continue or \ngrow. \n Humans need to know God in order to realize a \nprosperous society in this world as well as to strive for \na beautiful eternal life. To that end, they first have to \nknow themselves and strive for loftiness in themselves \nand their societies. However, as long as the world is \nconstrued as closed, limited and aimless; as long as \neternal life is considered imaginary and illusory, while \nthe afterlife and the judgment day, as well as reward \nand punishment, are thought of as fictional and unreal; \nas long as morals and commitment to them are called \nbackwardness, while immorality, lies, deceit and \nselfishness are considered desirable and humans are \nlimited to a materialistic life in this world; as long as \nattempts are made to replace obedience to God and \nfollowing His prophets and true freedom with servitude \nto materialistic tendencies, animal instincts and the \noppression of others, while contention reaches its \npinnacle; as long as the aggressors, because of their \nfinancial, political and propaganda powers, not only \nescape punishment but even claim righteousness; and \nas long as wars are started and nations enslaved in \norder to win votes in elections, not only will the \nproblems of the global community remain unsolved, \nbut they will be increasingly exacerbated. \n Let us look at the situation in the world today.  \n Iraq was attacked under the false pretext of \nuncovering weapons of mass destruction and \noverthrowing a dictator. The dictator was toppled and \nweapons of mass destruction were not uncovered. A \ndemocratic government is established by the votes of \nthe people, but after six years the occupiers are still \nthere. They insist on imposing colonial agreements on \nthe people of Iraq by keeping them under Chapter VII \nof the United Nations Charter. Millions of people have \nbeen killed or displaced, and the occupiers, with no \nsense of shame, are still seeking to solidify their \nposition in the political geography of the region and to \ndominate oil resources. They have no respect for the \npeople of Iraq and they disregard any dignity, rights or \nstatus for them. The United Nations is not capable \nenough to solve the problems and to stop aggression, \noccupation and imposition.  \n In Palestine, 60 years of carnage and invasion is \nstill continuing at the hands of some criminal and \noccupying Zionists. They have forged a regime by \ncollecting people from various parts of the world and \nbringing them to another people\u2019s land by displacing, \ndetaining and killing the true owners of that land. With \nadvance notice, they invade, assassinate and maintain \nfood and medicine blockades, while some hegemonic \nand bullying Powers support them. The Security \nCouncil cannot do anything and sometimes, under \npressure from a few bullying Powers, even paves the \nway for supporting those Zionist murderers. It is \nnatural that some United Nations resolutions that have \naddressed the plight of the Palestinian people have \nbeen relegated to the archives unnoticed. \n In Afghanistan, the production of narcotics has \nmultiplied since the presence of NATO forces began. \nDomestic conflicts continue, terrorism is spreading and \ninnocent people are bombarded on a daily basis in \nstreets, markets, and schools and at wedding \nceremonies. The people of Afghanistan are the victims \nof the willingness of NATO member States to dominate \nthe regions surrounding India, China and South Asia. \nThe Security Council cannot do anything about it \nbecause some of those NATO members also happen to \nbe the major decision-makers in the Council. \n In Africa, there are efforts to re-establish the \nrelationships of the colonial era. By starting civil wars \nin large countries, including the Sudan, the \ndisintegration of those countries is planned in order to \nserve the interests of some corrupt Powers. When there \nis national resistance, the leaders of the resistance are \nput under pressure by legal mechanisms created by the \nvery same Powers. \n In Latin America, people find their security, \nnational interests and cultures seriously endangered by \nthe menacing shadow of alien domineering \nGovernments, and even by the embassies of some \nempires.  \n The lives, property and rights of the people of \nGeorgia, Ossetia and Abkhazia are victims of the \ntendencies and provocation of NATO and certain \nWestern Powers and the underhanded actions of the \nZionists. \n The never-ending arms race, the proliferation and \nstockpiling of nuclear and other weapons of mass \ndestruction, and the threats to use them and the \n \n \n11 08-51606 \n \nestablishment of missile defence systems have made \nthe situation unstable. \n With regard to Iran\u2019s peaceful nuclear \nprogramme, despite the inalienable right of all nations, \nincluding the Iranian nation, to produce nuclear fuel \nfor peaceful purposes, and despite such facts as the \ntransparency of all Iranian activities and our country\u2019s \nfull cooperation with the inspectors of the International \nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Agency\u2019s \nrepeated confirmation of the fact that Iran\u2019s activities \nare peaceful, a few bullying Powers have sought to put \nhurdles in the way of the peaceful nuclear activities of \nthe Iranian nation by exerting political and economic \npressure on Iran and threatening and pressuring IAEA. \nThose are the same Powers that produce new \ngenerations of lethal nuclear arms and possess \nstockpiles of nuclear weapons that no international \norganization is monitoring. Moreover, the tragedies of \nHiroshima and Nagasaki were perpetrated by one of \nthem. \n Indeed, they are not against weapons, but they \noppose the progress of other nations, and tend to \nmonopolize technologies and to use those monopolies \nto impose their will on other nations. However, it is \nvery natural that the great Iranian people, with their \ntrust in God, with determination and steadfastness and \nwith the support of their friends, will resist the bullying \nand have defended and will continue to defend their \nrights. The Iranian nation is for dialogue, but it has not \naccepted and will not accept illegal demands. The time \nhas come for IAEA to present a clear report to the \ninternational community on its monitoring of the \ndisarmament of those nuclear Powers and their nuclear \nactivities, and for a disarmament committee to be \nestablished by independent States to monitor the \ndisarmament of those nuclear Powers. \n Theories of development that are in line with the \nhegemonic system and not in accordance with the true \nneeds of humankind and human societies have become \nrepetitive and bland tools for assimilating economies, \nexpanding hegemonic domination and destroying the \nenvironment and the social solidarity of nations. There \nis no end in sight to this. Poverty, hunger and \ndeprivation are hurting more than one billion of the \nworld\u2019s population and have dashed their hopes for a \ndecent life. \n The dignity, integrity and rights of the American \nand European people are being played with by a small \nbut deceitful number of people called Zionists. \nAlthough they are a miniscule minority, they have been \ndominating an important portion of the financial and \nmonetary centres, as well as the political decision-\nmaking centres of some European countries and the \nUnited States, in a deceitful, complex and furtive \nmanner. It is deeply disastrous to witness that some \npresidential or premier nominees in some big countries \nhave to visit those people, take part in their gatherings \nand swear their allegiances and commitment to their \ninterests in order to attain financial or media support. \n That means that the great people of America and \nvarious nations of Europe need to obey the demands \nand wishes of a small number of acquisitive and \ninvasive people. Those nations are spending their \ndignity and resources on the crimes, occupation and \nthreats of the Zionist network against their will. \n All that is due to the manner in which the \nimmoral and the powerful view the world, humankind, \nfreedom, obeisance to God and justice. The thoughts \nand deeds of those who think they are superior to \nothers and consider others to be second class and \ninferior, who intend to remain out of the divine circle \nand to be the absolute slaves of their materialistic and \nselfish desires, who intend to expand their aggressive \nand domineering natures, constitute the roots of the \nproblems in societies today. They are the hindrances to \nthe realization of material and spiritual prosperity and \nto security, peace and brotherhood among nations.  \n I explicitly state that the Iranian people and the \noverwhelming majority of peoples and Governments \nare against those deeds and perspectives of the world-\ndomineering Powers. The establishment of justice \nrequires people who have achieved moderation and \njustice inside themselves, restrained their domineering \nattitudes and actualized their attributes of self-sacrifice \nand are at the service of humankind. The complete and \nfull-scale manifestation of such characteristics can \nhappen only under the rule of the righteous and perfect \nhuman being who is obedient to God and who is \npromised by the divine prophets. \n Of course, with the grace of God Almighty, a \nhopeful trend is flourishing in the heart and soul of \nhuman societies. The universal eagerness for justice, \npurity, love for others, monotheism and the quest for \nperfection is clearly and increasingly on the rise. A \nuniversal resistance to the acquisitiveness, aggression \nand selfishness of the bullying Powers is being formed. \n  \n \n08-51606 12 \n \nToday, the bullying Powers\u2019 thoughts, practices and \nstrategies are rejected by nations and Governments, \nand all are seeking to establish new human relations \nbased on justice, with a view to attaining prosperity, \nperfection, security and sustainable welfare. That is the \nvery auspicious phenomenon that all the traditions of \ncreation and the ruling laws of the universe emphasize \nand support. \n Today, the Zionist regime is on a definite slope to \ncollapse, and there is no way for it to get out of the \ncesspool it and its supporters have created. The Islamic \nRepublic of Iran, while fully respecting the resistance \nof the oppressed people of Palestine and expressing its \nall-out support for it, submits to the Secretary-General \nof the United Nations its humane solution, based on a \nfree referendum in Palestine to determine and establish \nthe type of State in the entire Palestinian lands. \n The American empire in the world is reaching the \nend of its road, and its next rulers must limit their \ninterference to their own borders. Today, the thought of \nhegemony quickly becomes a demerit. \n I should now like to say a few words to \nexpansionist Governments ruling global relations. Be \naware that living with obedience to God and carrying \nout His orders, having compassion for people and \nstriving for the fulfilment of justice is to your \nadvantage too. I invite you to return to the path of God, \nthe prophets and the people of the world, as well as to \ntruth and justice. The only route to salvation is a divine \nstraight path. Otherwise, God\u2019s hand of power will \nemerge from the sleeve of oppressed nations and will \nmake your life difficult, and will put an end to your \nhegemony. Let us love the peoples of the world and \nrespect their rights. Rectify past behaviour. That will \nbenefit you and the human community. The Iranian \npeople are prepared, along with other nations, to help \nyou be rescued from your current situation and to \nestablish peace and prosperity. \n Fortuitously, opportunities are accessible. With \nthe grace of God Almighty, the existing pillars of the \noppressive system are crumbling. Great developments \nin favour of humankind, as well as its true and real \nrights, are on the way. A golden and brilliant future is \nawaiting humankind. A global community filled with \njustice, friendship, brotherhood and welfare is at hand, \nas I have elaborated \u2014 a community that will tread the \npath of beauty and love under the rule of the righteous \nand perfect human being, the one promised by all \ndivine prophets and the one who is the true lover of \nhumankind; a community that will be devoid of all \nfear, despair and privation. Such a community will \nsoon be ours. The community promised by the great \ndivine prophets Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus Christ \nand Muhammad is about to materialize. \n Let us, hand in hand, expand the thought of \nresistance to evil and the minority of those who are ill-\nwishers. Let us support goodness and the majority of \npeople who are good and the embodiment of absolute \ngood that is the Imam of Time, the Promised One who \nwill come accompanied by Jesus Christ, and \naccordingly design and implement just and humanistic \nmechanisms for regulating the constructive \nrelationships between nations and Governments. \n May the great Almighty deliver the saviour of \nnations and put an end to the sufferings of humankind \nand bring forth justice, beauty and love. Let us have a \nproper share in the establishment of that illuminated \nand promised divine age. "

        "file_text": "It is an honour to address \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-third session. \n Allow me to express my gratitude to Mr. Srgjan \nKerim, who ably presided over the Assembly during \nthe preceding year, and to congratulate you, Father \nMiguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, the new President of the \nGeneral Assembly. I also thank you, Sir, for an \ninspiring appeal for respect for basic, universal ethical \nvalues. \n The first time I stood at this rostrum was in May \n1992, as the Foreign Minister of a newly independent \nBosnia and Herzegovina. At that time, I recounted the \nunspeakable atrocities that were unfolding in my \ncountry. I also warned that, if not stopped, such \natrocities would only get worse. In fact, I merely asked \nthat Bosnia and Herzegovina be accorded the right to \ndefend itself, the right guaranteed by the Charter. \n We know what has happened since. Some in the \ninternational community insisted on maintaining the \narms embargo imposed by the Security Council in \n1991, thus adding to the obviously overwhelming \nmilitary advantage of Milosevic\u2019s regime, which was \nbent on destroying Bosnia and Herzegovina and its \npeople. They justified this course by claiming that \nlifting the arms embargo meant adding oil to the fire. \nThe result was that the fire was quelled with the blood \nof the innocent. \n According to International Committee of the Red \nCross data, 200,000 people \u2014 12,000 of them \nchildren \u2014 were killed, up to 50,000 women were \nraped, and 2.2 million people were forced to flee their \nhomes. This was a veritable genocide and sociocide. \nThe intent of the perpetrators of this genocide was to \nforever destroy the unique multi-ethnic fabric of \nBosnia and Herzegovina through mass slaughter, rape, \ntorture, abuse, expulsion and plunder. In spite of this, \ndefenders of our country conducted themselves \nhonourably, as demonstrated by the acquittal by the \nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the former \nYugoslavia of most of Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s \nmilitary leadership. \n All this culminated in Srebrenica in July 1995. \nThe International Court of Justice \u2014 the court of this \nOrganization \u2014 ruled in its Judgment of 26 February \n2007 that \u201cthe Bosnian Serbs devised and implemented \na plan to execute as many as possible of the military \naged Bosnian Muslim men present in the enclave\u201d \n(para. 292) and that \n \u201cthe acts committed at Srebrenica ... were \ncommitted with the specific intent to destroy in \n  \n \n08-51606 4 \n \npart the group of the Muslims of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina as such; and accordingly \u2026 these \nwere acts of genocide, committed by members of \nthe [Army of Republika Srpska] in and around \nSrebrenica from about 13 July 1995.\u201d (para. 297) \n Through its acts and omissions, the United \nNations, by its own admission, bears part of the \nresponsibility for the crimes committed at Srebrenica. \nIn fact, the Secretary-General\u2019s 1999 report on \nSrebrenica unequivocally states: \n \u201cThrough error, misjudgement and an inability to \nrecognize the scope of the evil confronting us, we \nfailed to do our part to help save the people of \nSrebrenica from the Serb campaign of mass \nmurder ... Srebrenica crystallized a truth \nunderstood only too late by the United Nations \nand the world at large: that Bosnia was as much a \nmoral cause as a military conflict. The tragedy of \nSrebrenica will haunt our history forever.\u201d \n(A/54/549, para. 503) \n We do not want the United Nations to be haunted. \nThis Organization\u2019s credibility is too important to the \nworld to carry the burden of this failure. Errors can be \ncommitted, but errors must not be repeated. We want \nthe United Nations to right the wrongs. In fact, \ninternational law mandates that this must be done. The \nInternational Law Commission\u2019s articles on State \nresponsibility for internationally wrongful acts, \nadopted in resolution 56/83 of 12 December 2001, \nmandate that \u201cNo State shall recognize as lawful a \nsituation created by a serious breach [of a peremptory \nnorm of general international law]\u201d, which clearly \nincludes the crime of genocide and crimes against \nhumanity, \u201cnor render aid or assistance in maintaining \nthat situation\u201d (article 41). \n If those principles had been applied, would the \ninstitutions identified by the International Court of \nJustice as perpetrators of genocide still exist? Would \nvast portions of a country remain ethnically clean? \nWould over a million refugees and displaced persons \nremain outside their homes? In short, do these \nprinciples allow for the arrest of Karadzic and the \nsimultaneous preservation of the results of his project? \nIn fact, just today The Hague Tribunal announced a \nrevised indictment against Karadzic that charges him \nwith genocide and crimes against humanity, against \nboth Bosnians and Croats in 27 municipalities in \nBosnia and Herzegovina. This process will further \nimplicate the Milosevic regime in the planning and \ncommission of those crimes.  \n We cannot bring back the dead, but we can give \ndignity and justice to the survivors. What we say today \nis aimed not at the past, but at the future, and not only \nfor Bosnia and Herzegovina. We owe it to not only the \nvictims and survivors, but humanity as a whole. The \nmessage to the would-be perpetrators of crimes in the \nname of a twisted ideology should be crystal-clear: do \nnot even think about it; your terror will not pay off. \nThat should be the message. \n In Bosnia and Herzegovina, we had the \nopportunity to make that true by a consistent \nimplementation of the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement, \nwhich ended the aggression, stopped the genocide, and \nbrought peace. These were its major accomplishments, \nand their value cannot be overemphasized. \n The Dayton Peace Agreement, however, was also \nintended to reverse the effects of genocide and ethnic \ncleansing. It had all the necessary elements to do so. \nInstead, in the words of the Constitutional Court of \nBosnia and Herzegovina, its main provisions have been \na victim of:  \n \u201ca systemic, continuing and deliberate practice of \nthe public authorities of Republika Srpska with \nthe goal of preventing the so-called minority \nreturns, either through direct participation in \nviolent incidents or through the abdication of \nresponsibility to protect the people from ... \nviolent attacks due solely to their ethnic \nbackground\u201d. \n Dayton never intended such ethnic apartheid to \ntake root in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is not the \nimplementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement, but \nthe violation of its core principles, that led to this \nresult. It would be a grave mistake to recognize this \nresult as lawful and legitimate. It is the responsibility \nof this Organization to make it right. Just as we should \nnot have been forced to smuggle arms into our own \ncountry to defend ourselves, we should not be forced \nnow to smuggle basic human rights, justice and \ndemocracy into Bosnia and Herzegovina. \n Without righting this wrong can we genuinely \ncelebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the adoption of the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights this \nDecember? Moreover, can we celebrate the sixtieth \nanniversary of the adoption of the Convention on the \n \n \n5 08-51606 \n \nPrevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide \nif the first and only Judgment of the International \nCourt of Justice on the crime of genocide remains in \nthe Court\u2019s archives? \n Now is the time to right these wrongs. We are \nabout to start work on the new Constitution of Bosnia \nand Herzegovina, and the outcome of that process will \nanswer many of these questions. \n To those who now seek to legitimize the systemic \nviolations of the Dayton Peace Agreement, we all must \nsay: make no mistake, genocide will not be rewarded. \nThat is the responsibility of this Organization. \nRewarding genocide would send a dangerous message \nthroughout the world, and would surely undermine the \nchances of peace and stability in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina and the region.  \n Seekers of justice are not the enemies of peace. \nThey are the guardians of peace. As the Secretary-\nGeneral said today, justice is the pillar of peace and \nstability. That is what this statement is all about. \nCertainly, there are those in Bosnia and Herzegovina \nwho would not agree, but they are surely not the \nvictims of genocide. \n We have not forgotten the help we received from \nmany of the countries represented here today, a number \nof whose soldiers, diplomats, aid workers and \njournalists died in Bosnia and Herzegovina while \nworking to end the aggression, bring peace and ease \nthe suffering, or to make sure that the rest of the world \nknew about it. For that we thank them once again, and \nrenew our sympathy to their families.  \n An even greater number of countries have \nassisted us in rebuilding our society after the \naggression, and we extend our heartfelt gratitude for \nthat as well. Bosnia and Herzegovina still needs help in \nthis regard, and we hope that we can work together in \norder to ensure permanent peace and stability in my \ncountry, the region and the world. "

        "file_text": "At \nthe outset, it is my pleasure to congratulate the \nPresident of the Assembly on his election to preside \nover the sixty-third session of the General Assembly \nand to wish him every success. We also wish to thank \nhis predecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, for his successful \npresidency of the Assembly during the previous \nsession.  \n We should also like to express our appreciation \nfor the important and outstanding role of the Secretary-\nGeneral of the United Nations, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, in \nsupport of the purposes and principles of the Charter of \nthis Organization. \n More than a year ago, the world witnessed the \nemergence of new international challenges and perils \nthat hinder and disrupt efforts to achieve sustainable \ndevelopment in numerous countries, especially \ndeveloping countries, and in particular the least \ndeveloped among them. Most significant among those \nperils are the rise in the cost of food, basic \ncommodities and energy, as well as climate change. \nThe danger of those challenges lies in their global \nimpact; their effects transcend national borders. No \nbarrier or artificial restraint can withstand them. They \nwill cause the international community to backslide \nsignificantly in achieving the Millennium Development \nGoals. Indeed, we have begun to see the negative \neffects of those threats in the African continent, which \nhas achieved no significant progress in the eradication \nof poverty and hunger or in the struggle against such \ndangerous infectious diseases as AIDS and malaria. \nInstead, these challenges have exacerbated the \nsuffering of most African States. \n Those challenges, alongside such dangers to \nsecurity as terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction and human rights violations, pose a \nserious threat to international peace and security, and \nmeeting them will require prompt, collective, united \nand firm action under the umbrella of the United \nNations and its various agencies. We must also remain \nfirmly committed to the agreements and conventions \nthat we have signed and ratified, and implement \ntransparently and honestly the resolutions we adopt in \ninternational meetings and conferences. \n While the State of Kuwait supports the reforms \nthat have been adopted in our international \nmechanisms, the ongoing changes in and \ntransformation of the world order and the emergence of \nnew problems and challenges call for continued reform \nand the restructuring of many United Nations bodies to \naccompany those changes and improve their \nperformance. In that regard, we reiterate our demands \nfor necessary improvements in the working methods of \nthe Security Council, including greater transparency in \nits work and an expansion of its membership pursuant \nto standards and controls to ensure equity in its \nrepresentation and efficiency in the performance of its \nduties and responsibilities in the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security. Such reform must also \ntake into consideration the legitimate demands of Arab \nand Islamic countries and the aspirations and interests \nof small States. \n The State of Kuwait is pursuing its efforts to \nachieve economic and social development and to \nimprove the living conditions of Kuwaiti citizens and \nalien residents. Kuwait has made good progress in \nimplementing the commitments and resolutions of the \n2005 World Summit. It has achieved all the \nMillennium Development Goals, including those on \neducation and health, and advanced the role and \nempowerment of women in society. Furthermore, in \ncarrying out the wishes of His Highness Sheikh Sabah \nAl-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, Amir of the State of \nKuwait, to transform Kuwait into a regional financial \nand business centre, the Kuwaiti Government has taken \nnumerous important decisions and adopted new \npolicies with a view to restructuring the national \neconomy and consolidating trade and investment \nactivities so as to provide an investment atmosphere \n  \n \n08-51851 30 \n \nconducive to attracting national and foreign capital \ninvestment in such vital economic sectors as energy \nand infrastructure. \n The State of Kuwait has spared no effort in \ncontinuing to provide development assistance to \ndeveloping countries, particularly the least developed, \nthrough its official and non-official institutions. That \nconsistent approach of Kuwait\u2019s foreign policy \nemanates from its conviction that strengthening the \neconomies of the developing countries and helping \nthem fulfil their development goals will be beneficial \nto all. It will broaden the horizons of partnership, \ncooperation and solidarity and consolidate the global \neconomic and trading systems.  \n Since its establishment in 1961, the Kuwait Fund \nfor Arab Economic Development has provided grants \nand loans to finance infrastructure projects in \ndeveloping countries. The gross total amount disbursed \nin grants and concessionary loans by the Fund since its \nestablishment in 1961 is over $12 billion and has \nbenefited more than 100 countries.  \n The State of Kuwait continues to meet its \nfinancial obligations to international financial \ninstitutions and specialized international agencies in a \nfull and timely fashion. The Government of the State of \nKuwait decided in December last year to allocate \n10 per cent of all its contributions and donations to \ndisaster-affected countries to specialized international \norganizations and agencies working in the field. \n In response to the suffering of many developing \ncountries in the difficult economic conditions resulting \nfrom the increase in food and energy prices, the State \nof Kuwait has established the Decent Life Fund, with a \ncapital of $100 million, to develop and improve \nagricultural production in developing countries. \nKuwait has also announced the donation of \n$150 million to the Fund, which was established at the \nmost recent summit conference of the countries \nmembers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting \nCountries, held in the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi \nArabia. That donation was earmarked for research \nstudies in the fields of energy, environment and climate \nchange.  \n The State of Kuwait continues to follow a \nbalanced oil policy that takes into consideration the \ninterests of consuming and producing countries alike \nand seeks to maintain stable oil prices on the world \nmarket. However, the unjustified rise in prices, which \nis a source of concern, is caused by factors that are out \nof the control of the producing countries. They include \nspeculation, additional taxes on fuel, and the failure to \nbuild new refineries and to upgrade existing ones. The \nongoing impact of all of those factors has aggravated \nthe economic crises and led to rising rates of inflation \nin the developing countries.  \n In that context, we express our deep concern over \nthe financial crisis in the world markets. We welcome \nin that regard the bold steps and actions taken by the \nUnited States Government to address the mortgage \ncrisis and to mitigate its negative effects not only on \nthe United States economy, but also on the economies \nof other States around the world. \n Achieving sustainable development in the Middle \nEast will depend to a large extent on the ability of the \ncountries of the region and the international \ncommunity to address security issues and challenges \nthat are a constant source of tension and instability. In \nour desire to achieve peace, we call on the international \ncommunity now and in the future to help calm the \nhotbeds of tension and instability.  \n Any genuine and serious desire to achieve a \ncomprehensive, just and lasting peace must adhere to \nthe relevant resolutions of international legitimacy, the \nprinciple of land for peace, the road map adopted under \nSecurity Council resolution 1515 (2003) and the Arab \npeace initiative, leading to the attainment by the \nPalestinian people of all their legitimate political rights \nand the establishment of their independent State on \ntheir own land. We reaffirm our full support for the \nsisterly Syrian Arab Republic in recovering its \noccupied lands. We also express our support for the \nsisterly Republic of Lebanon as it pursues dialogue \nbetween all Lebanese parties in implementation of the \nagreement signed in Doha, capital of the sisterly State \nof Qatar. \n The State of Kuwait welcomes the progress \nachieved by Iraq in combating terrorism. It commends \nthe Iraqi Government\u2019s efforts and diligent endeavours, \nwhose fruit include an obvious improvement in the \nsecurity conditions in most Iraqi provinces. The State \nof Kuwait hopes that those endeavours will continue \ntowards comprehensive national reconciliation and \nconsensus leading to a democratic, free, secure and \nindependent Iraq, living in peace with itself and its \nneighbours and respecting its international obligations \nand commitments. \n \n \n31 08-51851 \n \n For its part, Kuwait will spare no effort in \nsupporting regional and international efforts to assist \nIraq in facing its security, political and economic \nchallenges, as well as its efforts to ensure its security, \nstability, political independence, sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity, and non-interference in its political \naffairs. \n In that context, the State of Kuwait hopes that \ncontacts between the sisterly United Arab Emirates and \nthe friendly Islamic Republic of Iran will continue at \nall levels in order to find a solution to the conflict over \nthe occupied islands of the Emirates in accordance \nwith the principles and rules of international law and \nthe policy of good-neighbourly relations. \n While the State of Kuwait stresses the right of all \nStates to produce, develop and use nuclear energy for \npeaceful purposes within the framework of the Treaty \non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), it \ncalls upon the friendly Islamic Republic of Iran to \npursue its cooperation with the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency in order to dispel the fears and doubts \nabout the nature of its nuclear programme. It also urges \nIran to address all other outstanding issues. \n We call on the international community to \ncontinue its efforts and endeavours to seek a peaceful \nsolution that would spare our region from crises or \nwars that could undermine its security and stability, \nand to deal seriously and without favouritism with any \ncountry in the region not party to the NPT. That would \npave the way for declaring the Middle East a region \nfree from weapons of mass destruction of all kinds. \n All the peoples of the world yearn to live a free, \ndecent life in a safe and stable world in which justice, \nequality and a clean environment free of conflict, \ndiseases and catastrophes prevail. It is our collective \nresponsibility to lay the foundations for a new \npartnership, based on fair and balanced rules of justice \nand equality, in which each party would assume its \nresponsibilities and obligations to realize the \naspirations and hopes of our peoples.

        "file_text": "It is my honour and \npleasure to welcome the election of Mr. Miguel \nd\u2019Escoto Brockmann as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-third session. I wish him great \nsuccess in carrying out that complex, responsible and \nchallenging task. I would also like to express my \nsincere gratitude and great respect to Mr. Srgjan \nKerim, President at the sixty-second session, for \nsuccessfully leading the Assembly during his tenure. In \naddition, I would like to pay tribute to the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, and to emphasize our full \nsupport for his efforts to strengthen the position of the \nUnited Nations as a valuable factor in resolving the \nissues on the ever-expanding international agenda. \n Now, if the Assembly will permit me, I should \nlike to continue in my native language.  \n(spoke in Montenegrin; interpretation provided by the \ndelegation) \n As the youngest United Nations Member, \nMontenegro has left its mark on the international \nscene. It gained its statehood centuries ago and \ndemocratically restored it in 2006. For us, statehood \nrepresents political freedom, but also political \nresponsibility. Both are qualities that we look for and \nfind in the United Nations: in the spirit of its Charter, \nand in the promotion of mutual respect and equality \namong nations and peoples. \n Multilateralism lies at the core of the \ninternational system and inspires strong motivation and \ncommitment. That is why the United Nations provides \na reliable framework for maintaining international \npeace and security, strengthening democracy, \nprotecting human rights and freedoms, respecting \ninternational law and fostering the economic and social \ndevelopment of all States. \n Today, the world Organization is going through a \nprocess of necessary reform prompted by great \nachievements, but also by some setbacks, and even \nfailures. Montenegro supports a process of pragmatic \nreform at the United Nations. As a small State, we are \nparticularly interested in strengthening the authority of \nthe General Assembly and other main United Nations \nbodies. \n  \n \n08-52272 2 \n \n The Security Council lies at the heart of the \noverall reform process and needs to be transformed \ntaking into account equitable regional representation, \ntransparency and improvement in its working methods. \nMontenegro supports intergovernmental negotiations. \nWe are undoubtedly faced with a very challenging and \ncomplex process, but one to which Montenegro will \nstrive to contribute. \n Respect for human rights and freedoms, \nimprovement of minority and faith-based rights and the \nstrengthening of good-neighbourly relations will \ncontinue to be the foundation of our national stability, \nas well of regional stability. Our engagement at \nnational, regional and international levels is therefore \nfocused on the rule of law and the fight against \ncorruption and organized crime. \n This year we mark the sixtieth anniversary of the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. The \nDeclaration is still vital and applicable. We are fully \ndedicated to its implementation and determined to \nuphold its values and principles. In support of that, \nMontenegro has presented its candidature for \nmembership of the Human Rights Council for the \nperiod 2012-2015. \n As the achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals represents one of the key \nobjectives of United Nations policy, it is only natural \nthat small and developing States, such as Montenegro, \nshould be resolved to make a concerted effort towards \nthose goals. Aware of all the challenges in \nimplementing that agenda, Montenegro shares the \nSecretary-General\u2019s opinion that yesterday\u2019s high-level \nevent contributed positively to the increased \ncommitment to realize the goals that have been set. \n Challenges that we are facing today, including \npolitical problems, hotspots, blatant violations of \nhuman rights and freedoms, proliferation of weapons \nof mass destruction, terrorism, environmental \ndegradation and climate change, require an adequate \nresponse and decisive action. We believe that no \neffective or lasting response is possible without joint \naction by the entire international community. \n Countries in transition, such as our own, have \nrelevant experience and are strongly motivated to offer \ncontinuous support to the implementation of the \nMonterrey Consensus, in the light of the forthcoming \nInternational Conference on Financing for \nDevelopment, to be held in Doha. Economic challenges \nfaced by countries in transition affect the dynamics and \nquality of the way we tackle other issues, thus making \nthe implementation of the Millennium Declaration \nimperative. Therefore, the development needs and \npriorities of the African countries, discussed at length \nduring the 22 September high-level meeting, require \nurgent global solidarity and support. \n Montenegro fully supports United Nations efforts \nto resolve the problems caused by the energy crisis, \nespecially rising food prices worldwide. We also fully \nsupport the intention of the Secretary-General and of \nthe United Nations to focus the attention of the \ninternational community on vital issues such as food \nprices and food security, in addition to the issues of \nclimate change and the MDGs. The reason behind this \nis obvious: everyone is affected and is hence \ncommitted to solving those problems. \n In the light of that, we agree with the proposed \nUnited Nations action in the multilateral framework. \nWe commend the recent adoption of the Rome \nDeclaration on World Food Security, and strongly \nbelieve that integrated international action is the best \nresponse. \n As an ecologically concerned State, Montenegro \ncherishes an interactive relationship between the \nenvironmental aspects of the protection of natural \nresources, on the one hand, and the production and \ndistribution of organic food on the other hand. \nFurthermore, Montenegro encourages the creation of \nan international trade environment that favours small-\nscale producers and developing countries. Public-\nprivate partnerships on specific projects, as one form \nof cooperation between my Government and United \nNations agencies in the field of energy efficiency, are \nalso of special importance for us. \n Montenegro has many reasons to be satisfied with \nthe dynamics and results of its ongoing reform \nprocesses. Promotion of democracy, equality and \ntolerance among States and peoples has been and will \ncontinue to be our political doctrine. We are motivated \nby a desire for stability and economic and cultural \ndevelopment, and we demonstrate this in practice in \nour relationships with neighbours and regional \npartners. It is also a basis for Montenegro\u2019s progress in \nEuropean and Euro-Atlantic integration. \n Our European Union (EU) and NATO agenda is \nbased on the principles of democracy, a functional \nmarket economy, efficient institutions and the rule of \n \n \n3 08-52272 \n \nlaw. In the process of integration, special emphasis is \nplaced on the dynamics and time frame in which our \nprogress is being achieved \u2014 in all areas, including \npolitical, legislative, economic and public administration \nreform. \n This year, Montenegro joined the Union for the \nMediterranean. We appreciate the support offered by \nour EU partners and other members of that significant \ninitiative. Montenegro stands ready to make its \ncontribution and to take an active part in the \nrevitalization of the projects within that initiative. \n Montenegro is taking a step forward in its \nsecurity policy, centred on multilateral cooperation, \nwith the aim of creating a legislative framework for the \ndeployment of our police, military and civilian \npersonnel to United Nations peacekeeping missions. \nMontenegro contributed to similar missions more than \n100 years ago, in the nineteenth century, and we are \nnow preparing to implement our commitment again in \norder to meet the current needs for fostering peace and \ndemocracy. \n In conclusion, I would like to reiterate the \ncommitment of Montenegro to contribute to the \nstrengthening and promotion of the United Nations in \nour common effort to identify adequate responses to \nmultifaceted challenges the world faces today.

        "file_text": "First, let me express, on behalf of the \ndelegation of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, \nmy heartfelt congratulations to Mr. d\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann, a veteran diplomat of Nicaragua, on his \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-third session. I trust that, with him at the helm, \nthe work of the General Assembly is in good hands.  \n The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic is of the \nbelief that the United Nations remains an important \nand pre-eminent forum for addressing issues related to \ninternational cooperation for economic development, \npeace and security, human rights and the rule of law, \nbased on dialogue, cooperation and consensus-building \namongst States. For over half a century, the United \nNations has played a crucial role in maintaining \ninternational peace and security and in promoting the \nsocio-economic advancement of Member States, \nespecially developing countries.  \n Yet, as the world situation becomes ever more \ncomplex and unpredictable, the United Nations \nincreasingly needs more robust and effective \ninstitutions. In our opinion, United Nations reform \nmust be comprehensive, transparent, inclusive and \nbalanced. We must strengthen the role and authority of \nthe General Assembly and revitalize its work.  \n We must also reform the Security Council, \nturning it into a more democratic and representative \norgan comprising new permanent and non-permanent \nmembers alike. No less important is the need to \nsubstantially reinforce the development pillars of the \nUnited Nations, which include the Department of \nEconomic and Social Affairs, the United Nations \nConference on Trade and Development, the regional \ncommissions and the United Nations Development \nAccount, enabling them to better support developing \ncountries. \n In that context, we commend Secretary-General \nBan Ki-moon\u2019s reform efforts aimed at transforming \nthe United Nations into a more responsive, dynamic, \nmultifunctional and effective Organization. The \nSecretary-General\u2019s personal dedication to the cause of \npeace, and his endeavours in search of solutions to the \nthree global crises of finance, fuel and food deserve \nspecial recognition. \n The current difficult and complex situation in the \nfield of disarmament continues to be a cause of \nconcern. We recognize the threat posed by the \ncontinuing existence of nuclear weapons. It is hence \nincumbent upon the nuclear-weapon States to honour \n  \n \n08-53135 2 \n \ntheir unequivocal commitment to work towards the \ntotal elimination of nuclear weapons. Renewed efforts \nare needed to resolve the impasse in achieving nuclear \ndisarmament and non-proliferation in all its aspects. \n While globalization brings with it numerous \nopportunities for economic development, the obstacles \nthat the world faces deserve significant attention. \nDeveloping countries, in particular the most vulnerable \ngroup of countries \u2014 the least developed countries \nlandlocked developing countries and small island \ndeveloping States \u2014 have taken important steps to \nfurther integrate themselves into the global economy. \nNevertheless, those countries remain beleaguered by \nbasic infrastructure of poor quality, limited access to \nmarkets, capital and new technology, and low supply of \nfinance and investment. \n The sudden increase in oil and food prices has led \nto a period of economic instability in many countries. \nTo combat that problem, we stress the need for the full \nand effective implementation of the Rome Declaration \non World Food Security and the establishment of a \nglobal food bank and an international food fund to \nensure long-term food security for developing \ncountries, particularly the most vulnerable among \nthem.  \n In addition, the great untapped potential of those \ncountries should be explored and exploited to the \nmaximum extent through increased investment and \ntechnology transfer by developed countries and other \ndevelopment partners for mutual benefit.  \n The goal of achieving peace and prosperity \nremains the highest priority of the international \ncommunity, yet inter-State conflict, terrorism and \nunlawful unilateral sanctions and interventions \ncontinue to impede that goal. We are greatly distressed \nby the persistent conflict that has plagued the lives of \nthe peoples of the Middle East for decades, particularly \nof the Palestinian people, who have been fighting to \nexercise their right to self-determination and \nStatehood.  \n We are deeply saddened by the number of \ncasualties and the material damage inflicted upon the \nnations of Iraq and Afghanistan. We remain troubled by \nthe embargo that has been imposed on the Republic of \nCuba by the Government of the United States of \nAmerica, an act that is clearly illegal and not \nresponsive to the legitimate interests of the peoples of \neither nation. In that regard, the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic sincerely urges the parties \nconcerned in the aforementioned conflicts to seek ways \nto peacefully resolve their differences. It is our fervent \nhope that the peoples living in those conflict-affected \nareas may enjoy peace and prosperity as swiftly as \npossible. \n Unlike most calamities, global warming affects \nnot only the livelihood of every being on the planet, \nbut also the course of human history. Climate change \nwill become all the more worrisome as it leads to many \nother social and economic problems in addition to \nthose faced by our world today. That is why there is a \nneed for immediate global action to address climate \nchange in accordance with the principle of common but \ndifferentiated responsibilities. In formulating policies \nto confront climate change, we should promote the \nintegration of all three components of sustainable \ndevelopment \u2014 economic development, social \ndevelopment and environmental protection. In that \nrespect, we call for the full implementation of the Bali \nRoad Map. \n As widely expressed at the high-level event on \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the lack \nof effective implementation of the internationally \nagreed development goals, including the MDGs, \nremains of deep concern. Therefore, the highest \npriority should be given to securing the effective and \nfull implementation of the agreed goals and \ncommitments. In that context, we underscore the \nurgency of addressing the special needs of least \ndeveloped and landlocked developing countries \nthrough the full, timely and effective implementation \nby all stakeholders of the Brussels Programme of \nAction and the Almaty Programme of Action, as called \nfor in the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document. \n Landlocked developing countries face a unique \nimpediment in not having access to the sea. \nInternational cooperation is crucial to the success of \nthe development goals of those countries. We therefore \nwould like to stress the significance of the upcoming \nmidterm review of the Almaty Programme of Action, to \nbe held on 2 and 3 October 2008 here in New York, \nwhich should provide the international community with \nthe opportunity to assess progress made, lessons \nlearned and constraints encountered in the \nimplementation of the Almaty Programme of Action. \n As a member country, the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic is gratified to witness the \n \n \n3 08-53135 \n \ncontinuing stability resulting from strengthened and \nenhanced integration of the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN), which is an important \ncontribution to the maintenance of peace and further \ncooperation in the region and the world. A recent \nmomentous and milestone event was the signing of the \nASEAN Charter, which has transformed ASEAN into a \nrule-based regional organization. \n The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic continues \nto enjoy solid political stability and social order. Thus, \nour socio-economic development has registered \nsignificant achievements, as reflected in the high and \nsustained growth of our gross domestic product. \nNotwithstanding those achievements, the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic still faces impediments. Rising \noil prices, inflation and the global economic slowdown \nall stand in the way of our path to economic prosperity. \n This year, we have also experienced severe \nflooding that has inflicted huge material losses \nnationwide. Yet, in spite of all that, by improving the \nquality of basic infrastructure and human resources and \ncooperating with international partners, we are \ndetermined to pursue our twin strategies of poverty \neradication and regional integration. At the current \npace, we hope to extricate our country from the \nshackles of underdevelopment by the year 2020. \n I cannot conclude without reaffirming that \ndevelopment remains central and must come first if \npeace and respect for human rights, which are \nintertwined, are to be achieved. The Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic reiterates its unshakable \ncommitment to continued full cooperation with the \ninternational community in pursuit of a world free \nfrom fear and want, and rooted in a new, just and \nequitable order. Together, I am sure, we will be able to \nreach new heights. "

I wish him \nevery success at this critical time. \n I am confident that we all have the same feeling. \nEmpty words and general discussions have had their \nday. We feel a cool wind in international relations that \ncomplicates and tempers mutual responsibilities. The \ndifference in temperature and pressure leads to a \nhurricane. Atmospheric changes in worldwide politics \nhave comparable effects. \n \n \n5 08-51749 \n \n The great illusion of power becomes today\u2019s \nultimate weakness and the giant vehicle of ideals and \nshaping forces. The principal challenge before us lies \nin the neglect and undermining of the standards of \ninternational law and foreign affairs. \n We see a trend towards the demolition of the \nglobal system, whose cornerstone is the unflagging \ninternational will and respect for the sovereignty, \nterritorial integrity and established boundaries of \nStates. \n Ukraine has the right to speak these words. We \nwere among the founders of the United Nations and \none of the co-authors of its Charter. \n We are a nation that underwent fatal trials and \nregained a commonwealth in a legitimate and \nrecognized way. The representatives of dozens of \nStates that share such a fate with us are here in this \nroom.  \n The latest events in the Caucasus are of the \nutmost concern to us. I express condolences for the \ntragedy suffered by each human being and each family \nregardless of race or allegiance  \u2014 Georgians, \nOssetians and Russians. Suffering does not \ndiscriminate among peoples. Each person has dignity \nand the ability to recognize truth, hypocrisy, deliberate \naggression, manipulation of public opinion and candid \nsupport for separatism.  \n Ukraine condemns all acts of aggression and use \nof force that occurred in the region. Ukraine vigorously \ndenounces violation of the territorial integrity and \ninviolability of the Georgian frontiers and the armed \nannexation of its territory.  \n Ukraine does not recognize the independence of \nthe self-proclaimed republics of South Ossetia and \nAbkhazia. Ukraine does not acknowledge, and \ncondemns, the attempt at illegitimate and separatist \naffirmation of the statehood of any territories. This \nposition is fundamental for Ukrainian foreign policy. \n Deviation from the United Nations principles, \nsuch as the use of force, and the renewal of cold-war \nrhetoric provoke our deep concern. Those processes \ncreate a potential threat both for Ukraine and for other \ncountries in the region. \n The problem cannot be solved through isolation, \nself-isolation or mutual accusations. There is only one \nway out. With common and good will we are to \nconsolidate our values and the aims contained in the \nUnited Nations Charter and the Millennium \nDeclaration. \n With full responsibility for peace and security, we \nneed to stop disturbances by separatist spirits, which \ncan turn into misfortune for the instigators themselves. \nIt is essential to reject blackmailing and threatening \nvocabulary. Ukraine rejects pressure of any kind \nregarding ways to ensure its own security and to \ndetermine membership in collective security structures. \nSuch attempts at infringement are short-sighted and \ncounterproductive. \n We call for the strengthening of the role of the \nSecurity Council, the only body with exclusive \nauthority in issues of global peace and security. We \nneed its decisions to be balanced and its actions to be \neffective. \n Ukraine supports all efforts aimed at peaceful \nsettlement and unblocking of the situation on the South \nCaucasus and will fully cooperate in that process. We \nwill continue our peacekeeping activities firmly and \nvigorously, and we will participate in the settlement of \nthe protracted conflicts on the basis of respect for the \nprinciples of sovereignty, territorial integrity, \ninviolability of borders, human rights, freedoms and \ndignity. \n The world is waiting for a confident and positive \nresponse from the United Nations. The world needs \nrenewed confidence in our collective efforts and strict \nadherence to the norms of international law and to the \nUnited Nations Organization. \n Our national agenda is concordant with the main \nchallenges facing the international community. As a \ncountry possessing the best black-earth soil in the \nworld, Ukraine is going to contribute tangibly to the \ncommon work on solving the global food crisis. \n We plan to consolidate all possible efforts to \nrealize an effective and just energy policy. The \nprinciples that should be implemented are mutual \nbenefit, the continuous fulfilment of obligations and \nthe inadmissibility of any energy pressure. \n We reinforce our call for more active global \ncooperation in the sphere of the environment. Ukraine \nputs forward an initiative to develop a binding \nframework agreement \u2014 a World Environmental \nConstitution \u2014 and to establish a single-structure \nsystem for ecological and environmental protection, \n  \n \n08-51749 6 \n \nwith relevant authority and mechanisms in the United \nNations. \n We plan to revitalize efforts in the fight against \nHIV/AIDS and other dangerous diseases. This problem \nremains highly topical for Ukraine. \n Undoubtedly, Ukraine will continue to keep an \neye on the whole range of common tasks and \nchallenges, from poverty problems to trafficking in \nhuman beings, international terrorism and proliferation \nof weapons of mass destruction. \n The line we follow is clear. Our policy is based \non democratic values, open dialogue with all partners \nof different cultures, and unconditional respect for \nfundamental human rights. I have the honour to appeal \nto the world community with a request for solidarity. \n This year Ukraine will mark the seventy-fifth \nanniversary of the Great Famine \u2014 the Holodomor, \nwhich took the lives of about 10 million of our \ncompatriots. Our intention is not directed against any \npeople or State. We neither overstate nor understate our \nsorrow. The tenor of hunger in Ukraine was oriented \ntowards genocide and was accompanied by the total \nelimination of the national elite, the public leadership \nand the priesthood. The goal was to overpower a nation \nof millions, because, according to the regime, there \nwere too many people to displace to Siberia. \n It is important that our steps encourage other \ncountries of the former Soviet Union to find the truth. \nWe share the pain of all the people affected \u2014 \nRussians, Belarusians, Kazakhs and dozens of other \nnations. We invite a joint commemoration of each \nnational tragedy and no toleration of new attempts to \ncreate a heroic aureole around Stalin and his regime. \nWe have invaluable examples of mutual understanding \nwith Poland, Hungary and other States. Honest and \nsincere memories about the past have not split us but \nhave united us. It is our aspiration that memories of the \nvictims of the Holodomor and other crimes of \ntotalitarian regimes will prevent the world from \nrepeating such catastrophes. \n I believe in our ability to respond effectively to \nevery challenge the world is facing. Ukraine is \ndetermined to work on this. We will act as dedicated \npartners. Everything is in our hands. I believe in our \npower, will and wisdom. "

        "file_text": "I should like \nat the outset to welcome the fact that Nicaragua, \nrepresented by Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, is \npresiding over the General Assembly at its sixty-third \nsession. Cameroon wishes him every success in \ncarrying out his mission and assures him of its full \ncooperation. I wish also to pay a well-deserved tribute \nto Ambassador Kerim for the skill with which he led \nthe work of the Assembly at its sixty-second session. \nFinally, I congratulate His Excellency Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon, and reiterate our appreciation \nand support for his remarkable efforts in discharging \nhis lofty mission. \n By proposing the impact of the global food crisis \non poverty and hunger in the world and the need to \ndemocratize the United Nations as main themes of the \ngeneral debate at the sixty-third session, the President \nfocused our deliberations on core problems currently \nfaced by the international community. I support this \nproposal all the more because Cameroon, like other \ncountries throughout the world, has recently \nexperienced social upheaval caused by the increasingly \nhigh cost of living. \n As a result, we decided on and implemented a \nseries of corrective measures, ranging from a reduction \nof taxes and customs duties on certain basic \ncommodities to an increase in the salaries of State \nemployees and measures to stabilize fuel prices. Those \nmeasures were lauded by the International Monetary \nFund and undoubtedly had very positive effects. They \ndid not, however, totally eliminate a problem of global \nproportions and one which requires global responses. \nThe food crisis, which is one manifestation, has taken \non alarming proportions throughout the world. All \neconomies, irrespective of size, but particularly those \nof poor countries, are seriously affected. The most \nvulnerable populations are forced to forego health care \nand education just to feed themselves. \n If appropriate responses are not found rapidly, \nthere will be reason to fear dramatic repercussions on \ninternational trade, economic growth, social progress, \npolitical stability and, hence, global security. There is \ntherefore an urgent necessity to act rapidly and \ncollectively. We believe an appropriate response to the \nsituation lies in ensuring coordination at the highest \nlevel. That is why I welcome the fact that the \nSecretary-General took the initiative to establish the \nHigh-Level Task Force on the Global Food Security \nCrisis, whose aim is to promote a coherent and unified \n  \n \n08-51851 14 \n \nresponse to the crisis. Cameroon shares the vision \ncontained in the Comprehensive Framework for Action \nprepared by the Task Force. \n We are of the view that a lasting solution to the \ncrisis requires short- and medium-term actions, \nincluding increased food aid and investment in \nagriculture, the promotion of social welfare initiatives, \nreduction of agricultural subsidies in developed \ncountries and restrictions on food exports from \ncountries of the South. It is obvious that such solutions \ncannot be implemented without the participation of all \nand without the establishment of global food and \nagriculture partnerships involving all stakeholders, \nnamely Governments, the private sector, civil society, \ndonors and international institutions. \n At a time when the midterm assessment of the \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals is \nunder way, the global food crisis appears as one of the \nmajor challenges the international community will \nhave to face. In that regard, Cameroon wishes to join \nits voice to that of the Secretary-General in appealing \nfor financing of the measures recommended by the \nTask Force. But, however acute the food crisis may be, \nit is far from being the only snag in the implementation \nof the Millennium Development Goals.  \n Concerning Africa in particular, there are many \nother challenges, such as persistent poverty, peace and \nsecurity issues and the effects of climate change. \nConcerning poverty alleviation, our continent placed \nmuch hope in globalization which it supported in good \nfaith, despite legitimate fears concerning the \nglobalization of trade. It should be acknowledged that, \non the whole, these hopes were dashed.  \n Beyond the global food crisis, it is obvious that \nAfrica has felt the negative effects of the international \nfinancial crisis and the exponential oil price hikes: \nphenomena well beyond its control. In addition, it \nhelplessly watched the erosion of official development \nassistance and the failure of the Doha Round \nnegotiations, where its interests were relegated to the \nbackground. This role of powerless onlooker can only \nlead to deep frustration and cast doubts on the chances \nof achieving the Millennium Development Goals \nwithin the set time frames. \n Nevertheless, Africa wants to believe that the \ninternational community will not give up assisting it to \nemerge from poverty and underdevelopment. For that \nreason, we fully appreciate the initiative of the \nUnited Nations to organize high-level meetings \ndevoted to the development of our continent, on the \nsidelines of this session. On the economic front, \nAfrica\u2019s immense potential remains largely untapped, \nand, although many African countries have been \nrecording good economic performance, the continent \nremains the poorest on the planet. Hence the need for \nincreased solidarity of the international community. \n The growing impact of climate change, especially \nin Africa, is particularly disturbing; more than \nelsewhere, it affects areas on which the fate of future \ngenerations depends. There is thus an urgent need for \njoint action by the international community. \n Such solidarity should also prevail when \naddressing the issue of migrants. The tragedies they \nexperience are, to put it bluntly, inhuman. The \natrocities and acts of discrimination they endure on a \ndaily basis are intolerable. There is urgent need to \njointly seek solutions to manage this exodus which \ndrains Africa of the human resources it greatly needs. \nThere is no gainsaying that the economic development \nof the continent is the one and only solution to that \npainful problem. \n As regards peace and security, perhaps more than \nin any other area, Africa needs the active solidarity of \nthe international community. There is reason to be \nsatisfied with the progress made in several countries \nthat were hitherto plagued by deadly confrontations, \nthough it should be acknowledged that many hotbeds \nof tension and conflict still exist on the continent.  \n Here, the peace agreements signed after lengthy \nnegotiations are yet to enter fully into force. There, \nforce is used to jeopardize democratic achievements. \nContinuing confrontations in Somalia, the chronic \ninstability along the borders of Chad, the Central \nAfrican Republic and the Sudan, the daily tragedy \nfaced by the population of Darfur and the recurrent \neruption of violence in the east of the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo and in Burundi are all cause for \nserious concern. \n Unfortunately, nor is our continent spared the \nthreat of terrorism, which now has a global dimension. \nI am convinced that only global and resolute action \nwill help address that issue. Cameroon will contribute \nits support as necessary. \n The international community, and in particular \nthe United Nations, are making commendable efforts to \n \n \n15 08-51851 \n \npromote peace in Africa. That is why the Organization \nmust receive from all its Members the resources that it \nneeds to ensure the effectiveness of its action. To that \nend, it should constantly express the common will and \ncontinue to be the crucible of the democratization of \ninternational relations. \n The historic achievement recorded in the \nsettlement of the dispute over the Bakassi peninsula is \none of the best examples of the remarkable results that \ncan be generated by an authentic desire for peace \nshared by the parties, with the judicious support of the \ninternational community. \n The ceremony in Calabar on 14 August 2008, \nwhich marked the withdrawal of the Nigerian \nadministration and police force from Bakassi and the \ntransfer of authority to Cameroon, was undoubtedly the \nresult of the commitment to peace shown by the \nleaders and peoples of both countries. In that regard, I \nwish to express my profound gratitude to friendly \ncountries for the support they have continued to give to \nthe implementation of the ruling of the International \nCourt of Justice and to the Greentree Agreement. I \nwish to thank in particular the States witness to the \nAgreement, namely, the United States of America, \nFrance, the Federal Republic of Germany and the \nUnited Kingdom. \n The United Nations also played a decisive role in \nthe settlement of that matter. The tireless efforts of \nSecretaries-General Kofi Annan and Ban Ki-moon and \ntheir representatives within the Mixed Commission \ndeserve our gratitude. \n Thus dawned a new era in relations between \nCameroon and Nigeria, geared towards the quest for \nprogress and development to which our two peoples \naspire. It goes without saying that the two countries \nmust henceforth do everything possible to consolidate \nthe settlement and seize the opportunities offered to \nthem to develop their relations in all areas. In that \nregard, I wish to reaffirm that Cameroon will respect \nall its commitments. \n The delay in the attainment of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals must spur us to redouble our \nefforts to carry out vigorous, joint and mutually \nsupportive actions in fighting against poverty and for \ndevelopment. \n The Government of Cameroon is resolutely \ncommitted to that end. I wish to pay homage to our \npopulation for the sacrifices they have made in that \nrespect, as well as to our bilateral and multilateral \npartners for the multifaceted assistance they are \nproviding to us. That assistance is invaluable to us, \nparticularly in our efforts to promote better \nmanagement of public resources. Within that \nframework we have launched a fierce fight against \ndishonest managers, which we intend to pursue \nruthlessly. \n Guided by a concern to improve the well-being of \nour people, we reaffirm from this rostrum our \ndetermination relentlessly to pursue our efforts to \nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. To \nperform that task successfully, we know that we can \ncount on the understanding and support of the United \nNations. "

        "file_text": "I am honoured to \naddress the General Assembly on behalf of the \nGovernment and the people of Liberia, the second time \nI am doing so since I assumed office in 2006.  \n I congratulate you, Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann, and your country, Nicaragua, on your \nelection as President of this historic sixty-third session. \nThere is no doubt that you will bring your vast \nexperience to bear in guiding this session to a \nsuccessful conclusion. You can rest assured of the full \ncooperation and support of the Liberian delegation. \n Let me also seize this opportunity to pay tribute \nto your predecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim of the Republic \nof Macedonia, for the exemplary leadership he \nprovided this body over the past year. \n By the same token, I would like to commend the \nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his \nfarsightedness and wisdom in carrying out his mandate. \nThe Liberian people still recall with fondness his visit \nto Monrovia earlier this year, when they shared with \nhim their respect and appreciation for the United \nNations, which has provided exceptional support as a \nguarantor of the peace we now enjoy in our country \nafter 14 years of war. \n In our 161 years as the first independent republic \nin Africa, we navigated for nearly a century among the \nsharks of racism, colonialism, prejudice, human \ndegradation and underdevelopment. We have \nexperienced a war that killed nearly 8 per cent and \ndisplaced 40 per cent of our population, a war that \ndestroyed our underdeveloped economy and inadequate \ninfrastructure. Through it all, Liberia has come to \nappreciate the United Nations as a truly fundamental, \nrelevant and important forum and instrument for world \npeace. \n In its 63 years of existence, the United Nations \nhas expanded in scope, form and content. It is, \ncorrectly, still primarily concerned with the promotion \nof international peace and security. On the basis of our \nexperience as a founding Member, Liberia is \ncommitted to contributing to the redefinition of that \ninternational peace and security that it is very strongly \nlinked to and demands the promotion of economic \ngrowth and sustained development, particularly food \nsecurity, relief from the debt burden, globalization and \nfair trade. \n  \n \n08-51570 18 \n \n We believe in a peace and security environment \nthat combats HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases \nand that promotes poverty eradication and human \nrights, especially the rights of women and children. We \nbelieve in the fight against international terrorism, \ndrugs and other international crime, and we believe in \ndisarmament, especially the elimination of nuclear \nweapons and the control of small arms and light \nweapons. \n The history and experience of Liberia have taught \nus to have faith in the United Nations, which today \nmaintains nearly 11,000 men and women from all over \nthe world helping our country consolidate its newly \nwon peace. We wish to thank the Security Council, \nwhich has correctly seen the necessity to renew the \nmandate of the United Nations Mission in Liberia \n(UNMIL). We particularly thank the resource-\ncontributing countries, for, without them, we would \nnever be able to save the lives we are saving and \npromote the development we are promoting. \n Our history and experience have taught us to \nbelieve in regional peace and security and cooperation. \nLiberians still say, with passion: \u201cThank God for \nECOMOG\u201d \u2014 the Monitoring Group of the Economic \nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) \u2014 \nreferring to the period of our war when young men and \nwomen from ECOWAS countries, led by Nigeria and \nincluding Senegal, Ghana, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Mali \nand Benin, laid down their lives to save our country. \nSubsequently, a Nigerian-led military mission, the \nECOWAS Mission in Liberia. provided the beachhead \nfor the establishment of UNMIL. We shall always be \ngrateful to ECOWAS, which is now dedicating itself to \nits prime objective of economic integration and \ndevelopment. \n We also believe in our subregional entity, the \nMano River Union, which comprises the countries of \nLiberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone and now, C\u00f4te \nd\u2019Ivoire, which joined us earlier this year. The Mano \nRiver basin, as is well known, had been the epicentre \nof the conflict system in West Africa since 1990. As the \ncurrent Chair of the Union, I can say on behalf of my \ncolleagues that the countries of that basin have \ndeclared never again to war and all forms of armed \nviolence. The Mano River Union will henceforth be a \nnet exporter of peace and all the dividends that come \nwith peace in West Africa. \n I am proud to say that Liberian history and \nexperience have taught us never to shirk in our \nopposition to wars and the causes thereof, to man\u2019s \ninhumanity to man, to oppression, racism, human \nrights abuses, especially those against women and \nchildren, and abuses inflicted on the basis of race, \ncreed and religion. \n In doing so, we know that we may at times not be \nseen as following the party line, be it in Africa or on \nAfrican issues, or the positions of some close allies. \nWe continue to ask our friends to realize that we will \nbe guided by our principles, history and experience to \nact in the best interest of our people and of the greater \nworld community. \n It is in this connection that we took a stand on the \nsituation in Zimbabwe, because we had faith that the \nleaders of that wonderful and great country needed to \nknow that fairness in elections and justice in political \nparticipation were the best ways to ensure durable \npeace. My Government wishes to thank the \nZimbabwean leaders and their people for choosing the \npath of negotiation for the comprehensive agreement \nthat has now been reached. We thank the leaders of the \nSouthern African Development Community \u2014 \nespecially South African President Thabo Mbeki, for \nhis role in facilitating the peace deal. May all \nZimbabweans work to ensure full implementation of \nthe agreement. \n Over the past year, Africa has registered \nunprecedented economic growth and has experienced \nrelative peace in many hitherto-turbulent regions and \ncountries. Unfortunately, people in Somalia, in parts of \nthe Sudan \u2014 especially the Darfur region \u2014 Chad, \nNiger, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other \ncountries have yet to breathe the air of relief and peace. \nThey need the concerted efforts and support of the \nUnited Nations for the African Union and subregional \nbodies to take the actions necessary for peace. Where \nthere is evidence of non-cooperation and even \naggression against peace forces, the world must move \ninto gear under Chapter VII of the United Nations \nCharter. \n As we have seen in Liberia and throughout the \nworld, armed conflicts are exacerbated by easy access \nto small arms and light weapons. Thus, as part of the \nefforts for durable peace in conflict zones, we must put \nin place rigid measures to ensure effective control of \nsuch weapons. In that connection, my Government \n \n \n19 08-51570 \n \nsupports an arms trade treaty. We continue to champion \nthe call for total and complete nuclear disarmament in \norder to prevent the world from annihilating itself. \n Those fears are not unfounded if we imagine such \nweapons in the hands of a terrorist. But the threat of \nterrorism \u2014 the senseless destruction of innocent lives \nand property \u2014 oftentimes even defies the \nimagination. The world must unite to fight that \nscourge. No nation or person is protected against it. \nThose who feel angry enough to carry out such \ndastardly acts defeat their own purposes because they \nend up killing those who may be ready to let the world \nhear about their causes. They actually end up losing \neverything. We grieve with those who lost their loved \nones during the terror attacks in Pakistan even while \nthe world was meeting here. \n While some plot evil deeds, there are those who \nare committed to working with Liberia and Africa and \nthe rest of Africa to fight poverty and to promote \npositive, all-around international cooperation. We are \ngrateful for the many avenues for cooperation that have \nbeen provided. We thank the United States for its \nAfrican Growth and Opportunity Act, which aims to \npromote trade rather than aid; we thank the European \nUnion for its Everything but Arms facility; we are \ngrateful for the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation; \nwe thank the Japanese Government and its partners for \nleading the Tokyo International Conference on African \nDevelopment; and we thank others to whom the \ncontinent is looking for new avenues for sustained \ndevelopment. We are pleased to note that our \ncooperation efforts have included intra-Africa and \nSouth-South endeavours, with great successes having \nbeen achieved so far. \n Beyond Africa, my Government believes, with \ngreat interest, that a durable solution can be found to \nthe Israeli-Palestinian and Arab-Israeli conflict. Late \nlast year, I had the opportunity to visit and hold talks \nwith Israeli and Palestinian leaders alike in Tel Aviv \nand Ramallah. I gathered from conversations and \nreports regarding other sustained efforts in search of \npeace that the solution of two States, with secure and \nrecognizable borders and mutual recognition of each \nother, is the way forward. We must never give up \nworking for a formal end to the conflict and for a \ndurable peace for all in the region. \n I should now like to report briefly on Liberia, the \ncountry for which, we dare say, the United Nations is \nmost likely to receive its best-ever performance record. \nOn 19 September 2006, approximately eight months \nafter I had assumed the presidency of Liberia as the \nfirst woman to have been so elected in Africa, I \naddressed this body, laying out my vision for a country \nthat had suffered near-total devastation \u2014 a country \nthat was the best example of a State that had nearly \ncollapsed. At that time, I said that Liberia was back, \nmoving forward on an irreversible path of peace and \ndevelopment. \n Today, I have come to renew that pledge. I have \ncome to report how much progress has been made in \nthe light of what we inherited. It should be \nremembered that we inherited a situation in which \nnearly two thirds of Liberians lived below the poverty \nline, with an even higher poverty rate in rural areas. \nThe economy collapsed, with gross domestic product \nfalling 90 per cent from 1987 to 1995 \u2014 one of the \nlargest economic free-falls ever recorded in the world. \nIndicators in the areas of health, education, water, \nsanitation, food security and infrastructure were very \npoor and sometimes beyond measure. \n My Government, with the support of international \npartners, began to take steps to move the whole \ncountry into gear. There was a need, first, for clear \ndirection in the form of a national vision or agenda, \nformulated and contributed to by the people as their \nown; secondly, to restore the international reputation \nand creditworthiness of the country; and thirdly, to \ndemonstrate the necessary leadership \u2014 strong, \ncommitted and focused \u2014 for the people. \n The Government, in collaboration with civil \nsociety, undertook broad consultations with people in \nall parts of the country. That resulted in a framework \nfor reducing poverty and making progress towards the \nMillennium Development Goals. Our poverty reduction \nstrategy for the period 2008-2011 is now in place, \nanchored on the pillars of consolidating peace and \nsecurity, revitalizing the economy, strengthening \ngovernance and the rule of law, and rebuilding \ninfrastructure and delivering basic services. \n Clearly, those three years are not enough time to \naccomplish the daunting tasks laid out in our poverty \nreduction strategy; they are part of a process aimed at \nlong-term development that will continue far beyond \n2011. They are part of a process that must identify \neffective responses to the food and energy crises and to \nthe as-yet-undetermined effects of climate change. \n  \n \n08-51570 20 \n \nHowever, the Liberian people are gaining confidence in \nthe strategy, for they are seeing that our national \nsecurity policy, supported by the United Nations, is \nnow producing the desired results.  \n They also know that, starting at a low base, we \nsaw growth of more than 9 per cent in 2007. Roads and \nbuildings are sprouting up in many places; health \nclinics are reopening or being established where they \ndid not exist before; agricultural production is \nincreasing; and a huge external debt is well on the way \nto being cancelled, with exceptional support from our \npartners. \n We believe that that is truly a success story for a \ncountry emerging from so much destruction in so short \na period of time. But we owe it first to our people \u2014 \nthe Liberian people \u2014 and, very strategically and \nimportantly, to the international community, led by the \nUnited Nations. The presence of the United Nations \nMission in Liberia has given hope to the people that \nthey need not surrender to the threat to peace and \ndevelopment represented by the large percentage of \nunemployed youth who cannot be absorbed by an \neconomy that is still too weak, despite its high level of \ngrowth. \n I come from a continent where female \nleadership \u2014 particularly a female head of State or \nGovernment \u2014 is still unthinkable in some quarters. I \nhave only a handful of female colleagues at the global \nlevel. To help sensitize and energize the world with \nregard to the reality of female leadership, my friend \nand colleague Ms. Tarja Halonen, President of Finland, \nand I are organizing an international colloquium on \nwomen\u2019s empowerment, leadership and development \nthat will be held on International Women\u2019s Day in \nMarch 2009 in Monrovia. I believe that this will \nprovide us with the opportunity to make special efforts \nin support of women who are desirous to seek elective \npublic office and to encourage other women to seek \nsuch office. \n Mr. Golding (Jamaica), Vice-President, took the \nChair. \n As I conclude, let me thank the President for the \ngreat work he and his colleagues are doing for a world \nmeant for succeeding generations. Let me also say \nunequivocally that not only is Liberia back, but we are \nlifted and we are blessed. We thank all who have \ncontributed to this progress. "

        "file_text": "At the outset, \nallow me to congratulate Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann on his election as President of the General \nAssembly and to assure him of my delegation\u2019s full \ncooperation in discharging his responsibilities. I also \nthank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive \nreport on the work of the United Nations (A/63/1) and \nhis positive reference to the situation prevailing in \nNepal. \n It is, indeed, a historic opportunity for me to \naddress this Assembly as the first Prime Minister of \nNepal, the newest republic of the world. As I stand \nhere in front of the global leadership, I think of the \nlong struggle that I and my party waged with single-\nmindedness for the liberation of the common man from \nthe clutches of the age-old suppression, deprivation, \nmarginalization and outright negligence of the \npreviously existing polity. My fellow countrymen and \nwomen, toiling in the mountains and valleys, working \nday and night in the lowlands and the urban areas and \nyet unable to ensure even the simple necessities of life \nfor their families, had a hope and expectation that one \nday they would lead a decent life with equal rights and \nopportunities and be recognized as respected citizens \nof the country.  \n \n \n15 08-52272 \n \n We are at that significant turning point in the \npolitical history of Nepal, and I and my party are proud \nto be the leading force of that positive historical \nchange. Today, I see a great hope in the glinting eyes of \nthe Dalit boy from the far west, the downtrodden \nwoman from the indigenous nationality in the east, the \nhomeless Tharu girl, the landless Madhesi and other \npeasants from the hills living under thatched roofs. I \nintend to lead them with conviction and sincerity in a \nnew journey of sustainable peace and equitable \nprogress in a modern Nepal. I have, therefore, the \nhonour and great privilege of bringing with me to the \nAssembly the greetings and best wishes of the people \nand the Government of that new Federal Democratic \nRepublic of Nepal. \n Following the Comprehensive Peace Agreement \nin November 2006, after a decade-long armed struggle, \nwe began our peace process and eventually held \nelections to the Constituent Assembly in April this \nyear. People overwhelmingly voted for my party and \nmade us the single largest political party in the \nAssembly with great hope and expectations. At its first \nmeeting, the Constituent Assembly declared Nepal a \nfederal democratic republic, formally ending the 240-\nyear-old monarchy and creating a new opportunity to \ntransform the old feudalistic State into an inclusive and \nfederal new Nepal. That was in keeping with the long-\nstanding aspirations of the Nepalese people. They \nvoted in favour of the change and transformation that \nmy own party had fought for over so many years. After \nthe historic political transformation, our agenda now is \nto bring about an equally historic socio-economic \ntransformation of the country.  \n Today, I must report with all humility that our \nConstituent Assembly is the most inclusive representative \nbody, of which all marginalized, oppressed ethnic \ncommunities, indigenous nationalities, Dalits, the \ndisadvantaged and people from the backward regions and \ncommunities are members, which will herald a new \nbeginning in the country. That may very well be an \nexample of representativeness to the world in the first \ndecade of the twenty-first century. \n The Government is committed to restoring law \nand order, providing immediate relief to the people \naffected by the conflict, fighting against the cancerous \ngrowth of corruption and starting an economic \nrecovery package, focusing on pro-poor growth, \ninfrastructure development and public-private \npartnership. The Government will build an effective \npartnership with the international community in \ncreating an atmosphere for unleashing a new socio-\neconomic transformation, for which the Nepalese \npeople have so long been waiting. \n Nepal\u2019s peace process is unique in its \ncharacteristics and is based on multiparty democracy, \ninclusiveness, accommodation, dialogue and the \nrecognition of the people as the ultimate arbiter. It is \nthe outcome of our own creative disposition towards \npeace, and we feel that it can also serve as a reference \nmodel for peace elsewhere. \n We appreciate the continued support of the \nUnited Nations for the peace process, especially in \nmonitoring the management of arms and personnel \nthrough the United Nations Mission in Nepal. The \nUnited Nations Mission has undertaken its mandated \ntasks well. I also take this opportunity to thank our \nneighbours, friends and donors for their continued \nsupport in favour of the peace process and the \ninstitutionalization of democracy in Nepal. I am \nconfident they are doing so to unleash Nepal\u2019s \ndevelopment potential, in accordance with the wish of \nthe Nepalese people. \n As we proceed in the peace process within the \ncountry, new problems in the form of the global food \ncrisis, rising oil prices and imminent danger from \nclimate change stare us in the face. Those challenges \nalso undermine our achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). There will be no success \nin achieving the MDGs without ensuring that they are \nachieved in the least developed countries. Solemn \npledges were made in the 2000 Millennium Declaration \nand at the 2002 International Conference on Financing \nfor Development held in Monterrey. Many of those \ncommitments are yet to be fulfilled and the \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \nremains elusive to most of the world\u2019s poor people. \n The United Nations agenda today has to tackle \nthose development challenges and many other issues, \nsuch as religious extremism, terrorism, the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass \ndestruction; transnational crimes, such as drugs, human \ntrafficking and money-laundering; continuing conflicts \nwithin and among States; and gross violations of \nhuman rights, genocide, war crimes and crimes against \nhumanity. It is more than obvious that many of those \nglobal problems require global solutions. Together, we \ncan rise to the occasion and adopt the vision and \n  \n \n08-52272 16 \n \nstrategy that the founders of the United Nations charted \nin the purposes and principles of the Charter of the \nOrganization. Multilateralism, not unilateralism, is the \nanswer to those problems. \n Least developed countries like Nepal are faced \nwith a special predicament in their development \nefforts. We are trapped in a vicious circle of poverty. \nFor many historical reasons, we have low economic \ngrowth, low productivity, underdeveloped industries \nand traditional agriculture. Because of the low level of \nsocial indicators and fewer opportunities, conflict and \ncrisis continue to be prevalent in those countries.  \n Today, the growing gap between rich and poor \nwithin countries as well as between nations is a sure \nsign of a looming disaster. It is also inhuman and \nunjust that such a high level of inequality is still so \ncommon in this age of human achievements, \nabundance and progress. Equally important is the fact \nthat islands of prosperity in a sea of poverty are not \nsustainable and certainly not in the enlightened self-\ninterest of even the developed countries themselves, as \nthey breed resentment, fuel conflict and undermine \ntheir own progress in the long run. They also go \nagainst the fundamental spirit of the United Nations.  \n Because of the peculiar nature of the least \ndeveloped countries and their high level of \nvulnerability, I strongly urge that the issues of least \ndeveloped countries be looked at by the United Nations \nseparately and addressed with special and focused \nprogrammes. They should be ensured dedicated \nsupport and cooperation if we want to make our world \nthe just and inclusive place that the United Nations so \nproudly espouses. \n We are not only least developed, but also \nlandlocked. That is a double disadvantage in our efforts \nto fulfil our development aspirations. In fact, we feel \nfurther marginalized by the overwhelming impact of \nthe downside of globalization and the high cost of \ntrade. We want full implementation of the respective \nglobal compacts, the Brussels Programme of Action for \nthe Least Developed Countries and the Almaty \nProgramme of Action for the landlocked developing \ncountries. In particular, I would like to highlight the \nneed on the part of our developed country partners to \nfulfil their commitments and pledges in allocating a \ncertain percentage of their gross national product to \nthose countries and in making trade concessions, debt \nrelief and other capacity-building measures available in \naccordance with those compacts. On our part, I would \nlike to undertake that Nepal will fulfil its pledge to \nown its development programmes in accordance with \nits national priorities, including those on poverty \nreduction and pro-poor governance policies. \n We need to protect our people from the growing \nvulnerabilities of climate change. For example, in my \nown country, Nepal, melting glaciers and shifting \nweather patterns are threatening life-support systems, \nundermining the sustainability of agriculture and \nunleashing extreme climate-induced disasters, such as \nfrequent floods and landslides. The Himalayan range \nprovides life-supporting water downstream for more \nthan 1 billion people. Mount Everest, as the roof of the \nworld, and the Himalayan range need to be protected \nand utilized properly to contribute to humankind as a \nwhole.  \n I therefore strongly appeal to the international \ncommunity to extend all necessary support and \ncooperation to protect and promote that pristine \nenvironment. We need to create a regime of common \nbut differentiated responsibilities in which the \ndeveloped countries will mitigate the burden of \nadaptation for the vulnerable countries, such as the \nleast developed and small islands. The world stands to \nbenefit from addressing climate change if we are able \nto harness the tremendous potentials of Nepal\u2019s \nhydropower, which is a renewable and clean source of \nenergy. To that end, Nepal is ready to invite and \nencourage investment in its hydropower projects. \n I am pleased that the United Nations Regional \nCentre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the \nPacific is now operational in Kathmandu 20 years after \nit was established by this Assembly. I thank all \nMembers, countries of the region, the Secretary-\nGeneral and the officials of the Secretariat for the \nsmooth relocation of the Centre from New York to \nKathmandu. I would like to take this opportunity to \nreiterate Nepal\u2019s commitment to making the Centre \nsuccessful through the cooperation of all countries \nconcerned. \n Over the years, peacekeeping has evolved as the \nsoul of the United Nations. With that in mind, since \n1958 Nepal has regularly placed its peacekeepers at the \ncall of the United Nations. We are celebrating the \nfiftieth anniversary of Nepal\u2019s continuous participation \nin United Nations peacekeeping operations. I take this \nopportunity to reiterate Nepal\u2019s commitment to \n \n \n17 08-52272 \n \ncontinuing to provide our troops for the cause of peace \nworldwide. Today, Nepal is the fifth largest contributor \nof troops and police personnel to United Nations \npeacekeeping operations. We are glad that they have \nearned accolades for their professional competence and \nperformance both at home and abroad. We consider \nthat to be our modest contribution to international \npeace and security. \n The enjoyment of universal human rights is \nabsolutely essential to creating an environment of \npeace, justice, democracy and development. As a \ndemocracy, Nepal is fully committed to protecting and \npromoting the human rights of its people under all \ncircumstances, with constitutional and legal guarantees \nand implementation of the international human rights \ninstruments to which Nepal is a party. The Government \nis committed to ending the environment of impunity. \nThe proposed truth and reconciliation commission will \nseek to arrive at a necessary balance between peace \nand justice in order to ensure that justice is served and \nthat the centrality of the peace process is preserved. We \nwill continue to strengthen our National Human Rights \nCommission so that it can take up its statutory \nresponsibility for the protection and promotion of \nhuman rights in the country even more effectively. It \ngoes without saying that the environment for the \nprotection and promotion of human rights in Nepal has \nsignificantly improved, especially after the signing of \nthe comprehensive peace agreement in November \n2006. \n As a least developed country that entered the \nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) not too long ago, \nNepal is concerned at the lack of tangible progress in \nnegotiations on the Doha Development Agenda. We \nthink that the opportunities in world trade through the \nmultilateral trading framework of WTO should not be \ndelayed any further. The least developed countries \ndeserve genuine duty-free and quota-free market access \nfor all their tradable products from all the major \ncountries, together with more favourable rules of origin \nand support for enhancing their supply-side capacity. \nOnly then will the Doha Round be a development \nround in the real sense of the word. Without the \nmeaningful integration of the least developed countries \ninto the global regime, I do not know how we can \nmake the global trading regime sustainable, equitable \nand inclusive. Similarly, the least developed countries \nneed more aid for trade and trade facilitation measures \nto enhance their trading capacity. \n Today, the United Nations needs to reform and \ndemocratize itself in order to take on the numerous \nchallenges in international peace and security \neffectively, and it should reflect the current realities of \nthe world. We should also give the necessary \ncredibility, legitimacy, competence and effectiveness to \nthe world body in solving global problems.  \n I take this opportunity to reiterate Nepal\u2019s solemn \nfaith and commitment to the purposes and principles of \nthe Charter of the United Nations. On behalf of the \npeople and the Government of Nepal, I pledge to work \nwith all States Members in a spirit of goodwill, \ncooperation and mutual solidarity in order to take on \nthe challenges that face the world. Indeed, we have \nadopted that spirit as one of the main tenets of Nepal\u2019s \nforeign policy.  \n Nepal is an example of how swords can be turned \ninto ploughshares. That is what the United Nations is \ndedicated to. Therefore, as I address this Assembly \ntoday, I have a special feeling about the objectives and \nideals that the United Nations stands for and the \ncorrelation between those ideals and the political, \neconomic and social transformation that we would like \nto achieve in our country. May we all succeed in \nattaining our common objectives through our collective \nand sincere efforts as united and inseparable members \nof a single global family. "

        "file_text": "As the last \nspeaker on your list, Mr. President, I think I can \ncongratulate you on this important debate, and quote \nthe Latin saying, dulce est in fundo, which you know \nvery well \u2014 sweetness comes at the end. \n As you assume the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-third session, my delegation \nwishes you all the best in your endeavours and looks \nforward to working with you in order to address the \nmany challenges facing the global community. \n This general debate is an occasion for those \nresponsible for the national life of every country to \ncome together to take the pulse of the world situation. \nBy its nature and structure, the United Nations \nnormally creates neither events nor trends, but rather \nserves as a sounding board where events and trends are \nsubmitted for debate and a coherent, consensual and \ntimely response. \n This year has been dominated by a number of \nchallenges and crises: natural and man-made \ncalamities, staggering economies, financial turmoil, \nrising food and fuel prices, the impact of climate \nchange, local wars and tensions. We have been called \nto this Hall once again to identify the common causes \nand denominators underlying those diverse crises and \nto craft adequate long-term solutions. \n One of the clear facts, recognized by all, is that \nevery crisis presents a mixture of natural factors and \nelements of human responsibility. However, they are \nall too often compounded by the tardy responses, \nfailures or reluctance of leaders to exercise their \nresponsibility to protect their populations. \n When speaking within these walls of the \nresponsibility to protect, the common understanding of \nthe term is found in the 2005 World Summit Outcome \nDocument, which refers to the responsibility of the \ninternational community to intervene in situations \nwhere individual Governments are not able or willing \nto assure the protection of their own citizens. \n In the past, the language of protection was too \noften a pretext for expansion and aggression. In spite \nof the many advances in international law, that same \nunderstanding and practice tragically continues today. \nHowever, during the past year, in this same Hall there \nhas been growing consensus and greater inclusion of \nthis expression as a vital component of responsible \nleadership. The responsibility to protect has been \ninvoked by some as an essential aspect of the exercise \nof sovereignty at the national and international levels, \nwhile others have relaunched the concept of the \nexercise of responsible sovereignty. \n For his part, Pope Benedict XVI, in his address to \nthe General Assembly last April, also recognized that, \nfrom the very ancient philosophical discourses on \ngovernance to the more modern development of the \nnation State, the responsibility to protect has served \nand must continue to serve as the principle shared by \nall nations in governing their populations and \nregulating relations between peoples. Those statements \nreassert the historical and moral basis for States to \ngovern. Likewise, they reassert that good governance \n  \n \n08-53141 50 \n \nshould no longer be measured simply within the \ncontext of a State\u2019s rights or sovereignty, but rather by \nits ability to care for those who entrust it with the grave \nmoral responsibility to lead. \n We the peoples who formed the United Nations \nconceived the responsibility to protect as the core basis \nfor the United Nations. The founding leaders believed \nthat the responsibility to protect would consist not \nprimarily of the use of force in order to restore peace \nand human rights, but rather in States coming together \nto detect and denounce early symptoms of every kind \nof crisis, mobilizing Governments, civil society and \npublic opinion to find the causes and to offer solutions. \nThe various agencies and bodies of the United Nations \nalso reaffirm the importance of the responsibility to \nprotect in their ability to work in close proximity and \nsolidarity with affected populations and to put \ndetection, implementation and monitoring mechanisms \ninto place. It is incumbent not only upon States, but \nalso upon the United Nations to ensure that the \nresponsibility to protect serves as the underlying \nmeasure and motivation of all its work. \n While many continue to question and debate the \nreal causes and medium- and long-term consequences \nof the various financial, humanitarian and food crises \naround the world, the United Nations and its \nmembership have the responsibility to provide \ndirection, coherence and resolution. It is not only the \ncredibility of the Organization and our global leaders \nthat is at stake, but rather and more importantly the \nability of the human community to provide food and \nsecurity and to protect basic human rights so that all \npeoples have the opportunity to live with freedom from \nfear and want, thus realizing their inherent dignity. \n One area in which our best intentions require \nurgent action is climate change. My delegation \ncommends Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \nleadership in recognizing the urgency of tackling that \nissue, and we commend States and civil society for \nmaking the necessary political and personal sacrifices \nto ensure a better future. \n The challenge of climate change and the various \nsolutions proposed and put into action have led us to \ncall attention to a preoccupation and inconsistency \nexisting today in the realm of international and national \nlaw \u2014 that all that is technically possible must be \nlegally licit. \n In adopting ever more stringent norms to protect \nthe environment and nature, it is often rightly affirmed \nthat not all environmental activity should be allowed \nand sanctioned by law just because it is technically \npossible and economically profitable. Indiscriminate \ndeforestation, the dumping of radioactive waste and \ninvasive and devastating acts on nature are often more \nexpedient and technically possible, but because they \nprovoke our conscience, as well as our responsibility \ntowards creation, we decide to invoke the principle that \neven though it is possible it should not be legally licit. \n However, when passing from the ecological field \nto that of humans, we have a tendency to affirm the \nopposite principle \u2014 that all which is technically \npossible should be legally licit and consequently \npursued. Whether regarding the production of arms for \nwar, biotechnological engineering, the taking of human \nlife, reproductive technology or the structure of the \nfamily itself, we have the tendency to advocate that all \nwhich is technologically possible should also be legally \nlicit. That inconsistency calls into question whether we \ntruly place humans at the centre of decision-making. \n The global community must come together to \nreverse that contradiction and engage in a political \ndiscourse that recognizes the centrality of humans in \nall aspects of political and technological development. \nThe same principles that lead us to oppose unchecked \ntechnology and policies that destroy the environment \nshould also guide us in our prudent use of technologies \nand the creation of policies that directly impact the \nlives of individuals. Short of that, we will succumb to \nan inconsistency that penalizes the individual and \nhuman society and risks paving the way towards the \nimposition of laws by the more powerful and the \ncreation of a new mass of losers. \n As we embark on this session of the General \nAssembly, we strive to fashion an Organization that \nreflects our highest and best intentions and carefully \nplaces the needs of all people, regardless of their \neconomic and political standing, at the centre of our \ndecisions and responsibility.

        "file_text": "I would like to take this \nopportunity to congratulate Mr. D\u2019Escoto Brockmann \non his election as President of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-third session. I also take this opportunity to \ncongratulate his predecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, for the \nwise leadership he provided to the General Assembly \nduring the past year. \n I wish to start by stressing that the global food \ncrisis is a collective challenge to the United Nations. \nThroughout the world, more people are now unable to \nfind enough food to feed themselves. There are \nincreased cases of food riots that, in turn, lead to \npolitical instability. The food crisis has resulted from \nthe failure of all nations to increase and sustain the \nproduction of staple food crops such as wheat, rice, \nmaize, millet, potatoes and lentils, as well as of fish, \nmeat and poultry. \n As leaders in the United Nations, we were aware \nof the signs pointing towards the global food shortage, \nwidespread famine and malnutrition, but we decided to \nignore those signs. We the world leaders failed to \nacknowledge that the food crisis poses a new threat to \nthe stability of the social framework and economic \nprosperity of all nations, especially small ones. \n I submit to the Assembly that the global food \ncrisis is beginning to erode and even negate the gains \nmade in national and global economic growth and trade \nthat were manifested in many developed and \ndeveloping countries. If those negative trends are not \naddressed effectively, there will be growing conflict \nwithin and among nations as the scramble for food to \nfeed the people intensifies. Several factors have \ncontributed to the global food crisis, but I will mention \nonly a few. \n First, during the past two decades food \nproduction in many countries has been affected by \npersistent severe climate changes, such as cyclones, \nhurricanes, typhoons, floods, drought, rising sea levels \nand desertification. Those climate changes reduce \nproductivity in agriculture and food security. The high \ndependence on rain-fed agriculture, especially in \ndeveloping sub-Saharan countries, has also placed such \ncountries at the mercy of the vagaries of nature. It is a \nmatter of great concern that global responses to those \nproblems have been in the form of world conferences, \nseminars and workshops on climate change, but that \nnot much has been done by way of concrete global \naction. \n Secondly, agriculture and food production have \nbeen given low priority by international development \ninstitutions in their allocation of resources and \ninvestment funds. That has been compounded by low \nnational budgetary allocations to food production in \n  \n \n08-51839 10 \n \nmany countries, especially in Africa. The recent \ndiversion of food crops towards the production of \nbiofuels has also reduced the stock of food and created \nfood insecurity in some countries. That is further \naggravated by the preference of commercial farmers to \ngrow cash crops rather than food crops, thereby \ncreating deficits in food production. \n Thirdly, there is general concern in Africa that \nmultilateral and bilateral institutions continue to \noppose subsidies to agriculture and food production, \nespecially in sub-Saharan Africa, South-East Asia and \nLatin America. That has been the case despite \noverwhelming evidence that smallholder farmers \ncontinue to find enormous difficulties in accessing \nagricultural inputs, such as fertilizers, improved seeds, \ninsecticides and herbicides. Those institutions also \nknow that farmers are unable to produce enough food \nto feed themselves without subsidies. \n A matter of global concern is that food \nproduction in many developing countries has been \nadversely affected by environmental destruction and \nthe degradation of agricultural lands caused by serious \npollution through the deliberate dumping of toxic \nwaste and hazardous materials in rivers, lakes, seas and \nother water sources, largely by industries from the \nNorth. That has deprived many farmers of land to \nproduce more food. The dumping has spoiled coastal \nlands, destroyed tourism and brought misery to people \nwho can depend on neither agriculture nor on fish in \ntheir waters in order to earn a living. \n The problems I have enumerated pose a serious \nchallenge to global food security. World leaders in the \nUnited Nations can no longer detach themselves from \nthose serious issues. We should be part of the solution. \n First, the Government of Malawi sees the \nattainment of global food security as a collective \nchallenge. It must be premised on the ability to \nproduce sufficient food and to move it from surplus \nareas anywhere in the world to food deficit areas. In \norder to alleviate the global food crisis, Malawi \nproposes that a compact should be reached by which \ncountries that can produce sufficient food surpluses \nshould be empowered to share with others in the world, \nwherever they may be, through a fair international \ntrading system. That would ensure that all of \nhumankind has enough food. \n Secondly, Malawi proposes that the United \nNations urge industrialized countries to make \nsignificant increases in resource allocation to \nagriculture, especially food production. Special \nattention should be given to improving infrastructure, \nmachinery, equipment and capacity-building for \nfarmers, especially smallholder farmers. The private \nsector in industrialized countries should be persuaded \nto increase investment in food production, paying \nspecial attention to the application of science and \ntechnology to agriculture, and in research on climate \nchange and on measures to protect food-producing \nnations from the vagaries of climate. \n Thirdly, Malawi believes that the global food \ncrisis could be mitigated if the United Nations, the \nWorld Bank and other multilateral and donor agencies \nwere seriously to consider granting subsidies for \nagriculture and food production as an integral part of \ntheir global development policy and aid packages to \ndeveloping countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. \nIt would also be useful if the international community \nwere to acknowledge Africa\u2019s potential and capacity to \ncontribute significantly to the solution to the global \nfood shortage. To that end, the United Nations should \nfully support the Alliance for a Green Revolution in \nAfrica, which is chaired by former Secretary-General \nKofi Annan. \n More specifically, Malawi appeals to the Group \nof Eight countries to support us in creating a green belt \naround our lakes and along our rivers to irrigate land \nup to 20 kilometres from the shores. The Malawi \nGovernment plans to grow a lot of rice, wheat, maize, \nmillet, cassava, potatoes, beans and lentils for local and \ninternational markets. \n I wish to conclude by stating that Malawi is \nconvinced that, in order to achieve global food \nsecurity, the United Nations must persuade the rich \nindustrialized countries to share research, science and \ntechnology in food production and processing with the \npoor countries. Furthermore, the industrialized \ncountries should consider funding food research \nprogrammes and subsidizing agriculture in developing \ncountries as part of attaining global food security. \n The global food crisis is not beyond the capacity \nof the community of nations to resolve. The global \npolicy to create a hunger-free world must be adopted \nhere in the General Assembly. All nations big and \nsmall, rich and poor, must work together to eliminate \nthe global food shortages, famines, hunger and \n \n \n11 08-51839 \n \nmalnutrition. Together we can do it. God bless the \nUnited Nations. "

        "file_text": "I warmly \ncongratulate the President on his election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \nsession. Benin, my country, will make its modest \ncontribution to the work of this session and will strive \nto promote the ideals of the Charter, to which my \ncountry here reaffirms its full commitment. His \npredecessor strove to find ideal solutions to the great \nchallenges facing humankind during his mandate. We \npay tribute to him for his good and faithful service to \nthe international community. \n I also wish to commend the diligent and resolute \nefforts of the Secretary-General, who has understood \nthe scope of the grave crises that have shaken the \nworld over the past year. Thanks to his bold initiatives \nto promote international cooperation, he has been able \nto revive the virtue of multilateralism as the best way \nto manage world affairs in an inclusive and \nparticipatory framework highlighting the uniqueness of \nour world and the shared responsibility of the human \nspecies to maintain the fundamental equilibriums on \nwhich its survival on the Earth and the permanence of \nthe biosphere depend.  \n In 2007, responding to the alarm raised by the \nscientific community, we focused our attention on \n  \n \n08-51606 36 \n \nclimate change as a global problem affecting the \nenvironment on our planet, with far-from-rosy \nprospects for the future of humankind and obvious \nconsequences in our daily lives. The two major crises \nthat we have been attempting to contain for several \nmonths are unfolding against that backdrop. The \nenergy and food crises, both of which are on our \nagenda, are two of the world\u2019s most serious crises in \nrecent history. They mark a departure from our \nprevious certainty as regards uninterrupted and lasting \nsupplies of energy and food for our peoples.  \n The Secretary-General has demonstrated \noutstanding leadership by sounding the alarm and \nwarning us of the risks of hasty and non-viable \nresponses that could lead to panic and serve to \nexacerbate the situation. The Rome Conference \norganized under the aegis of the Food and Agriculture \nOrganization of the United Nations made it possible to \nundertake a comprehensive assessment of the \ncomplexity of the crisis and to develop an outline for a \ncomprehensive strategy. That strategy includes \nimmediate steps to address the emergency, as well as \nseveral cohesive measures in the short, medium and \nlong term to preserve peace and stability in vulnerable \ndeveloping States. Those are the countries most \naffected by the food crisis, which undermines their \nefforts to combat poverty and hunger. \n The response to the food crisis emergency should \nnot lead us to lose sight of the timetable for the \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. \nThe international community has a duty to mobilize the \nnecessary resources to correct the serious distortions \nthat are at the heart of the food crisis. Our performance \nin that regard could be improved if vulnerable \ncountries were able to make the investments necessary \nto relaunch agricultural production throughout the \nworld in a sustainable manner.  \n In addition, there is a need to maintain sustained \ngrowth rates that can produce prosperity and \nsustainable human development in the long term. We \nmust continue to work to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and make them a lasting reality.  \n In this emergency, the United Nations should \nbring to bear all its influence in order to help countries \nexperiencing difficulties ensure the survival of \nthreatened and vulnerable segments of the population, \nwho risk being decimated by hunger and famine if no \none comes to their aid.  \n The time has therefore come to give concrete \nexpression to the right to food. It is intolerable that \nhunger continues to be a scourge afflicting humankind \nin the twenty-first century. In the short term, priority \nshould be given to strengthening social protection \nsystems in least developed countries. Our efforts \nshould make it possible to activate the dormant \npotential of local productive capacity in order to \nstimulate small and medium-sized businesses. \nProblems must be addressed through an integrated \napproach that makes it possible to maximize \nagricultural production, as well as of preserving, \nbringing to market and distributing food crops in order \nto improve the living conditions of the most vulnerable \ngroups of the population, whose welfare we must \neffectively ensure. In the medium and long terms, we \nmust rethink agricultural investment policies in order \nto re-establish the balance between cash crops and food \nproduction, so as to ensure food security for States \nwhile taking cultural specificities into consideration. \n Overall, this crisis illustrates that humankind is \nnot well equipped to manage the consequences of the \nunfolding emergency. This proves that we are not \ndoing enough for the future and that we run the risk of \nbeing subject to all sorts of ills. It is for that reason that \nthe proposal made by the High-Level Task Force on the \nGlobal Food Security Crisis for an increase in the \nproportion of official development assistance allocated \nto agriculture from 3 to 10 per cent constitutes a \nstrategic approach that should be implemented with \ncommon political will commensurate with the stakes \ninvolved. I would like to pay tribute to the countries \nthat have already made firm commitments to provide \nadditional resources in that regard.  \n Benin is being seriously affected by the food \ncrisis, but we are resolutely committed to undertaking \nthe necessary reforms. To that end, in 2006, my \nGovernment launched a national agricultural \nmodernization programme in order to address \nheightened distortions. To date, agriculture in Benin \nhas been characterized by small-scale family farms and \nbased on the use of outdated equipment. In order to \nchange that situation, which has confined food \nproduction to subsistence farming, a year ago my \nGovernment initiated a mechanization programme to \nimprove the competitiveness of the agricultural sector.  \n Given that that mechanization alone cannot bring \nabout the expected results without the marshalling of \nwater resources, we are considering a programme for \n \n \n37 08-51606 \n \nrational water management to better utilize that \nresource while preserving it for the future. The goal is \nto promote irrigation agriculture, primarily by building \nirrigation dams in valleys in the north of our country as \npart of an overall development plan.  \n Soil degradation, coastal erosion and the \ncombined effects of frequent flooding due to climate \nchange that seriously affect all of West Africa are \namong the underlying factors contributing to the drop \nin local food production. In that connection, I should \nlike to express our great appreciation for the \nawareness-raising efforts of the secretariat for the \nConvention to Combat Desertification.  \n Financing mechanisms, including the World \nBank\u2019s Adaptation Fund, must function with a \nheightened sense of the urgent need for aid to affected \nregions. They should promote the implementation of \nsoil regeneration projects, irrigation agriculture and \nreforestation with species that will increase the \navailability of basic foodstuffs. \n As part of efforts to promote diversification in the \nagriculture sector, my Government also intends to \nencourage the cultivation of crops suitable for biofuels \non marginally arable lands. The goal is to reduce \ndependence on hydrocarbons, which has become more \nacute following the dramatic drop in the generating \ncapacity of hydropower plants as a result of climate \nchange, whose impact has seriously affected economic \nactivity in my country over the past two years. These \ndifficulties have been exacerbated by the dizzying rise \nin oil prices. \n The tax cuts and import subsidies to which my \ncountry has resorted in order to protect the buying \npower of taxpayers have had a negative impact on \npublic finances. Those stop-gap measures are simply \nnot sustainable in the long-run.  \n This year we are commemorating the sixtieth \nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights. Benin initiated resolution 62/171, which the \nGeneral Assembly adopted to proclaim the \nInternational Year of Human Rights Learning, which \nwill begin on 10 December 2008. My country proposed \nthat new approach in order to once again place the \nhuman person at the very centre of sustainable human \ndevelopment efforts. Human rights learning leads to \nincreased demands for human rights, which society is \nsupposed to provide. It is the duty of the international \ncommunity to guarantee them. We call upon all \nMember States to give real effect to the International \nYear, in line with their national specificities, as well as \nto take all the steps they believe necessary to promote \nownership and the effective enjoyment of human rights \nby all individuals on their territory. \n The activities that will take place during the \nInternational Year of Human Rights Learning will \nprovide additional impetus to the efforts we have \nundertaken to ensure that all citizens subscribe to the \nMillennium Development Goals, especially in Africa, \nwhere the risk of not meeting the Goals by the \nestablished deadline is the greatest. \n We welcome the recommendations of the \nSteering Group for achieving the MDGs in Africa. \nBenin is honoured to be one of the 10 pilot countries \nchosen. Benin has begun to integrate the concept of \n\u201cunited in action\u201d within the framework of its \ncooperation with the United Nations system and \neagerly awaits its inclusion in the second group of test \ncountries for the implementation of the \nrecommendations of the High-level Panel on System-\nwide Coherence. This will enable us to develop \nsynergies to accelerate the achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals.  \n At the national level, we have integrated the \nachievement of the MDGs into our national \ndevelopment strategies, which are based on attaining \nthose Goals as part of a sustainable development \nprocess focused on and sustained by our nation and \naimed at supporting economic growth, which will \nenable us to achieve lasting success. \n We welcome the ongoing consideration of ways \nto enhance the effectiveness of development assistance, \nand we hope that this will enable us to develop a \nconsensus vision on the best possible way to revitalize \nthe global partnership for development, with the \nultimate objective, in our view, of reducing the \nscandalous inequalities which still afflict humankind. \n It is clear that democratization of the United \nNations and the promotion of the rule of law at an \ninternational level are endeavours which will \ncontribute to the effective and efficient participation of \nall peoples in managing world affairs, for the benefit of \npresent and succeeding generations. The promotion of \nthe rule of law at the international level requires the \nincreased representation of developing States in the \ndecision-making bodies of the international financial \ninstitutions, as well as a redefinition of their \n  \n \n08-51606 38 \n \ninstitutional mandates to ensure that better use is made \nof them to mobilize resources for the development of \nthe least developed countries, while preserving the \nstability of the international financial system. \n The democratization of the United Nations also \nincludes the long-awaited reform of the Security \nCouncil. As a hostage of the inherent contradictions of \ntoday\u2019s international relations, it has remained \nhopelessly stuck, even though it is recognized as being \nof cardinal importance to the effectiveness of the \nOrganization. The negotiations to that end should be \ncarried out with a heightened sense of responsibility. \nWe must ensure equitable representation of Member \nStates within the Security Council. I reiterate here the \nlegitimate demands of Africa, as expressed in the \nEzulwini Consensus, within the framework of reform \naimed at ensuring transparency, legitimacy and \nincreased effectiveness of the Council\u2019s decisions as it \ndischarges its primary role in maintaining international \npeace and security. The democratization of the United \nNations also means a firmer commitment by Member \nStates to respect international and national legality. \n In conclusion, I wish to make an urgent appeal to \nall parties to the armed conflicts that continue in \nvarious hotspots throughout the world, whether they be \nin the Middle East, Asia, Latin America or Africa, to \nchoose the path of peace and dialogue and to respect \ndemocratic values.

We wish him every \nsuccess as he guides these important deliberations at \nthis most critical time. We also wish to express our \nappreciation to his predecessor, His Excellency \nMr. Srgjan Kerim, for the professional manner in \nwhich he spearheaded the work of the Assembly at its \nsixty-second session. In addition, we wish to \nacknowledge the important work undertaken by the \nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \nand his team in continuing to promote the noble \nprinciples and values of the United Nations.  \n We have passed the midpoint in our quest to \nachieve the ambitious but achievable Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by the projected year, \n2015. Since the adoption of that timetable in 2000, \nhowever, the global economy has experienced a \nnumber of shocks that have served to challenge our \nability to achieve the MDGs within the allotted time. \nWe and the rest of the international community must \nredouble our efforts to meet those challenges by \naddressing them with serious conviction. \n As the Secretary-General has said, we face a \ndevelopment emergency, and emergencies require \nimmediate action. It is therefore imperative that the \ninternational community move with the utmost urgency \nto enact measures to address the challenges that have \nemerged. Inaction or indifference will only threaten to \nreverse the gains already made in some areas. We must \nensure that our annual reaffirmations of the right to \ndevelopment and the rights to food, shelter, security \nand peace do not ring hollow. \n In spite of the numerous difficulties and \nchallenges with which it is faced, Saint Lucia \nmaintains its commitment to the realization of the \nMDGs by 2015 and will do all within its means to \nattain that objective, even as new difficulties arise. For \nthat reason, Saint Lucia\u2019s social indicators are fairly \nreasonable and reflect the investment that has been \nmade in human development over the years.  \n The reduction of poverty remains a top priority \nfor my Government, and increased resources have been \nmade available to programmes and institutions \ndedicated to the attainment of that objective.  \n In the education sector, universal access has \nalready been achieved at the primary and secondary \nlevels. Emphasis is currently being placed on \nimprovement of quality at the primary and secondary \nlevels, on expanded access at the tertiary level and on \nearly-childhood education. More attention is also being \ngiven to the higher school-dropout rates among young \nmen.  \n In the area of health care, reform of the health \nsector continues to be a priority, and significant \nprogress continues to be made towards the achievement \nof free health care for all. Success continues to be \nrecorded in respect of key indicators such as life \nexpectancy, infant mortality and immunization \ncoverage. Saint Lucia has achieved an even lower \ninfant mortality rate than the 30-per-1,000 target set for \nthe Caribbean by the World Health Organization, and \nwe have already achieved 100 per cent immunization \ncoverage. At the same time, the incidence of \ncommunicable diseases has been significantly reduced, \nalthough there is concern over chronic \nnon-communicable diseases. \n The AIDS pandemic continues to be the focus of \nour attention, and, with the assistance of regional and \ninternational partners, Saint Lucia has made important \nstrides in addressing that challenge. Our current HIV \nprevalence rate is 0.12 per cent. We continue to focus \non education as one of the main instruments in this \nfight, even as we devote increased resources to \nprogrammes geared towards early detection and the \nprovision of free or subsidized antiretroviral drugs. \n There are, however, two additional issues that are \ncritical to development in Saint Lucia and that are not \nproperly covered under the existing MDG framework. \nThe first issue encompasses violence, crime and \nsecurity. It is an issue that takes many forms, including \n \n \n35 08-52265 \n \ngender-based violence, which should be addressed in \nthe MDGs. The second issue is that of migration in all \nits dimensions, including the impact of the emigration \nof skilled workers \u2014 especially teachers and nurses \u2014 \non national development. It is imperative that we also \nconsider those two issues, as they affect the \nachievement of the MDGs and the development of \nSaint Lucia and many other countries. \n A particular challenge confronting us is the \nemergence of serious climate change and its \ndetrimental impact on the environment. Those \nconditions continue to disproportionately affect small \nisland developing States, such as Saint Lucia and the \nother States members of the Alliance of Small Island \nStates, whose national territories in the Atlantic, \nPacific and Indian Oceans and the Caribbean Sea are \nextremely vulnerable.  \n Increased drought on the one hand and torrential \nrains and flooding on the other are affecting all parts of \nthe globe and serve as recipes for disaster and human \nsuffering. Those conditions are being attributed more \nand more to the unbridled and unsustainable use of \nfossil fuels and the concomitant release of greenhouse \ngases. \n A second major challenge taxing our resolve, and \nalso associated with fossil fuel use, is the astronomical \nrise in energy prices. The astronomical rise in energy \nprices has created a new challenge as the world seeks \nto replace fossil fuels with cleaner and more cost-\neffective biofuels. The trouble with that approach is \nthat the decreased availability of agricultural \nproduction for food has resulted in higher prices for the \nstaple foods of people around the world, especially in \ndeveloping countries, but also among the marginalized \nof the developed world. That trade-off \u2014 food for \nfuel \u2014 if not carefully balanced, could cause increased \npoverty, hunger and economic and social \nmarginalization, which would serve to exacerbate \nalready unacceptable levels of poverty and hunger. \n That notwithstanding, we are heartened by the \nrenewed efforts and improvements in the renewable \nenergy agenda, but we lament the slow pace of their \nuse in developed countries and the high cost of those \ntechnologies to developing countries. There must be \ngreater liberalization and availability of new \ntechnologies in order to allow developing countries \nmore access to development models. In the meantime, \nwe must redouble international efforts to reduce the \nemissions of greenhouse gases to the levels already \naccepted by the large majority of the members of the \ninternational community. \n Last July, I joined with my fellow Caribbean \nCommunity (CARICOM) heads of Government in \nreviewing the impact of rising global prices, the issues \nsurrounding energy use and climate change and the \nimplications for the region\u2019s food and nutrition \nsecurity. Among the issues arising from our \ndeliberations, we emphasized the need for \nGovernments to provide the necessary budgetary \nsupport and incentives for investment in agriculture, \nparticularly at this time. And, given the importance and \nthe development implications of climate change, we \nagreed to the establishment of a Task Force on Climate \nChange to give direction for the way forward. \n It is from that perspective that Saint Lucia and \nmany other like-minded countries have continued to \nemphasize the urgent need to focus on development \nbased on sustainable economic growth as the most \neffective means of transforming developing countries \nand enabling them to reach levels where they can \nrealize their long-term capacity for a significant \nenhancement of the quality of life of their people. \nAccordingly, Saint Lucia reiterates its strong \nconviction that the United Nations should regard \ndevelopment as the most essential tool for eradicating \npoverty and achieving the Millennium Development \nGoals. \n As food prices and energy costs rise, \ndevelopment finance is becoming even less available. \nWe appreciate the efforts of the countries that have met \nthe established official development assistance target \nof 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product. We urge \nother countries in a position to do so to act quickly so \nthat the target may not have to be shifted upwards due \nto increased poverty worldwide. \n Of particular concern to us is the difficulty facing \nthe lower-middle-income group of countries, to which \nSaint Lucia and many of the small island developing \nStates belong. In spite of their limited resources, the \nmembers of that group have initiated prudent economic \nmeasures and have been able to make significant \nstrides in their efforts to bring a reasonable level of \neconomic and social benefits to their people. \n However, policies that are ill-conceived and ill-\nadvised will continue to negate our efforts and reverse \nsome of the gains that have been made, forcing a \n  \n \n08-52265 36 \n \nreclassification of our status. We look forward to \nmeaningful progress at the Follow-up International \nConference on Financing for Development to Review \nthe Implementation of the Monterrey Consensus, to be \nheld in Doha later this year, and call on our \ndevelopment partners to give practical expression to \nthe numerous commitments that have been offered in \nthe past, but that remain unrealized. \n In Doha, we expect greater momentum on the \nquestion of trade and development. Many of our \ncountries are characterized by small size and the \nassociated vulnerabilities. While the products and \nservices we have to offer are few, they are nevertheless \nthe source of our livelihood. The investments in those \nproducts and services are significant for our countries, \nand while the pressure of competition from larger and \nmore diversified economies may force the \nconsideration of a wholesale shift in production focus, \nthe economic dislocation that would result from the \npursuit of such a strategy would be too overwhelming. \n In addition, as small as our population may be, \nthe youth sector is a sizable portion of our society, and \nthey need to be given hope. The best avenue is through \neducation and the development of small and medium-\nsized enterprises. Many countries have successfully \ndeveloped through that route, but have failed to share \ntheir experiences with others. We therefore need the \ntrade links to be open and fair, with greater \nconsideration given to the very small States, so that we \ntoo can meet the hopes and aspirations of our young \u2014 \nand until now, patient \u2014 populations. In that respect, \nwe call upon the United Nations Industrial \nDevelopment Organization to play a more meaningful \nrole in that endeavour. \n South-South cooperation continues to be a \nsignificant component of Saint Lucia\u2019s approach to \ndevelopment. Saint Lucia continues to benefit from the \ngenerous economic and technical cooperation among \ndeveloping countries within and outside of the \nCaribbean region, including Cuba, Trinidad and \nTobago, Brazil and Mexico, to name a few, while we \ncontinue to develop closer cooperation with our Latin \nAmerican neighbours. \n We therefore applaud the establishment of the \nSouth Fund for Development and Humanitarian \nAssistance approved at the second South Summit, held \nin 2005 in Qatar, as a financing mechanism to assist \ndeveloping countries in economic, social, health and \neducational development, and in the alleviation of \nhunger, poverty and the impact of natural disasters. \n While developing countries have made great \nstrides in financing their own development and the \ndevelopment of other countries of the South, greater \ncooperation in the area of technology transfer, \nparticularly capacity-building and technical assistance, \nis required from the North. Capacity-building among \nyoung people is crucial to the development of the skills \nrequired to implement our commitments to achieve the \nMDGs.  \n We recognize the valuable role that both South-\nSouth and North-South cooperation play in the \nadvancement of the development agenda. However, we \nknow that triangular cooperation can be an equally \nuseful and cost-effective tool for furthering our \ndevelopment objectives. We therefore welcome efforts \nin that area. Critical also to the realization of the \nMDGs is the delivery of aid commitments to \ndeveloping countries without the burdensome \nconditionalities that are a typical feature of \ninternational programmes of development assistance. \n The sustainable development of our sister \nCARICOM country of Haiti continues to be a \nformidable challenge faced by our region and the wider \ninternational community. It is one that requires the \nimplementation of a long-term assistance programme \nthat ensures that economic and social recovery take \nroot and that the people of that country can be assured \nof a brighter future. \n We wish therefore to applaud the Government of \nHaiti for its successful completion of the national \ngrowth and poverty reduction strategy focusing on \nimproving democratic governance, security and justice, \nand the delivery of basic services. We call on the \ninternational community to assist Haiti in the speedy \nimplementation of the national growth and poverty \nreduction strategy. \n We therefore continue to call for the sustained \nrelease of pledged development resources so that the \nGovernment and the people of Haiti may continue to \nmeaningfully, and in a sustainable manner, undertake \nmeasures to confront the numerous challenges to the \ndevelopment of their country. \n Saint Lucia\u2019s relationship with its partners is \nbased on a commitment to mutual respect and \nunderstanding for each other. In that vein, Saint Lucia \n \n \n37 08-52265 \n \npays tribute to the Government and the people of the \nRepublic of China, Taiwan, a democratic country that \nhas continued to abide by the very principles that the \nUnited Nations holds dear, seeking to nurture and \npreserve human rights and development. We \nacknowledge the contribution that the Republic of \nChina, Taiwan, has made to international development \nby its provision of substantial development assistance \nto developing countries in the spirit of South-South \ncooperation. The Government of Taiwan has provided \nsignificant cooperation assistance to Saint Lucia and \nother States in the areas of education, health, \nagriculture and tourism. \n We are also heartened by recent bilateral \ndiscussions that would serve to reduce tensions in the \nTaiwan Straits and would result in an increase in \neconomic cooperation, investment and transportation \nlinks. Natural disasters, epidemics and food and energy \ncrises know no boundaries. The 23 million people in \nTaiwan are inextricably linked to the world scene and \nhave the same responsibilities and obligations as others \nto collaborate in the prevention of global catastrophes. \nWe hope therefore that this body will take that fact into \nconsideration and allow them to meaningfully \nparticipate in the United Nations specialized agencies \nin the fight against such catastrophes. \n Saint Lucia is seriously concerned about the \nproliferation of small arms in our part of the world. \nThe presence of small arms in our region poses serious \nchallenges for the security and stability of our \nsocieties. As we struggle to address that problem \nwithin our limited resources, we call on those States \nthat are engaged in the production and trade of small \narms and ammunition to enact appropriate measures to \ncurb that illicit trade, which threatens the stability and \nsecurity of our societies. \n Saint Lucia remains concerned about the pace at \nwhich the matter of reform of the Security Council is \nproceeding. Reform of the Security Council has been \non the agenda of the United Nations for much too long. \nWe continue to support the view that it is time for the \nSecurity Council to be more democratic, in order to \nmake it better able to deal with the increasing number \nand complexity of issues it must deal with and more \nreflective of post-1948 reality. In that respect, Saint \nLucia supports the call for, at a minimum, a permanent \nseat on the Council for the African continent, just as \nother continents have such a seat. \n Recent events are providing a vivid illustration of \nthe need for reform of the Security Council. Large size, \nmilitary power, economic power, or large population \nare not in themselves sufficient criteria for a permanent \nseat on the Council. Adherence to the principles \nenshrined in the Charter of this Organization should be \nparamount over all others. \n In closing, Saint Lucia is a small country with \nresources that would fail to register in global terms. \nYet, small as we are, our people have hopes, \naspirations and ambitions like any other. Moreover, we \nhold the firm belief that we have the capacity to \ncontribute to the world in a measured way beyond our \nsize. We are probably best at economics, working \nmiracles with limited resources, and literature, where \nour aspirations are clearly articulated \u2014 having two \nNobel Laureates in these areas. We hold the view that \nour limited resources should be utilized and focused on \nimproving the quality of life of our people in \neducation, health, social services and economic \nopportunity. Those are our primary aims, and we \nbelieve them to be in conformity with those of this \neminent Organization. "

        "file_text": "I am honoured to join \nthose who have spoken before me in congratulating the \nPresident on his election to guide the work of the sixty-\nthird session of the General Assembly, and in \ncommending his predecessor for his stewardship of the \nAssembly over the past year. I also take this \nopportunity to commend the Secretary-General and his \nstaff for their continued dedication in advancing the \nwork of the Organization. \n The world has entered an era where the basis of \ninternational engagement is driven more by the trade in \ngoods and services and the distribution of the \n  \n \n08-52265 44 \n \nownership of technology than by notions of \nsovereignty. As a result, small vulnerable States like \nGrenada are being relentlessly pressed to justify their \neconomic viability. That, along with globalization and \nother challenges, has negative implications for the \nstability of our countries. Against that backdrop, \nGrenada believes that its diplomacy must undergo \nfundamental change, not only to satisfy domestic \nexpectations but also to enhance our chances for \nsuccess. \n Just over two months ago, the people of Grenada \nvoted overwhelmingly for new leadership and a change \nof direction for our nation. We humbly offer our \nGovernment as an example of peace and reconciliation \nin action. We bring together people committed to \nservice notwithstanding our politically turbulent \nhistorical background. In our country, we have \nmanaged to release the distrust and divisiveness that \nhave existed for more than 30 years in order to \nembrace peace and reconciliation and move our \ncountry forward. We stand as an example of hope and \nencouragement to those who are still fighting and \ncannot let go of the blame, the hatred and the anger \nassociated with the past. \n We stand today as proof that peace and \nreconciliation are possible, that our collective hope for \nthose world regions where brothers fight brothers and \npeople die needlessly is not a fanciful or vain hope: it \nis a valid hope that can be realized. It is a hope that has \nmaterialized in our country as we move forward \ntogether, reconciled from a divisive past to serve our \npeople and to serve our world through our participation \nat the United Nations. From that platform of \nreconciliation, we focus on and emphasize the strategic \nsignificance of partnerships in governance. Our aim is \nto build strong and meaningful relationships between \nGovernment, the private sector, trade unions and other \ngroups within civil society. \n Grenada believes it must play an active role in \nworld affairs, since our own domestic agenda coincides \nwith many aspects of the global development dialogue, \nparticularly as it relates to the achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). Substantial \nprogress has been made in many of the targeted areas. \nMoreover, the plans and programmes presently being \npursued will ensure that social and economic \ndevelopment does benefit all our people. \n Grenada\u2019s main strategy to eradicate extreme \npoverty and hunger focuses on expanding the \nproductive sectors of the economy, particularly the \nagricultural sector. Emphasis will be placed on \nattracting young people to agriculture, stimulating the \nrural economy and providing for food security.  \n Grenada understands the importance of having a \nwell-educated populace. We are pleased that the goal of \nachieving universal primary education has already been \naccomplished. We are now striving to ensure that each \nhousehold has at least one university graduate by the \nyear 2025. \n Similarly, technical and administrative capabilities \nthroughout the public service must be strengthened to \nsupport our developmental agenda. Grenada is \nconvinced that we will not properly advance unless \nthere are fundamental improvements in the \ndevelopment of our human resources. That is an area \nwhere international support is especially needed. \n Grenada has made relatively good progress in the \narea of health care, especially in improving maternal \nhealth, decreasing the rate of child mortality and \ncombating HIV/AIDS and other diseases. Our gratitude \ngoes out to international donors and other partners \nassociated with effective programmes in this area. \n Global climate change represents a most pressing \nand serious challenge to the viability and the very \nexistence of small island developing States. Climate \nchange is not only an environmental or sustainable \ndevelopment issue; it is first and foremost a human \nissue. With the release of the fourth assessment report \nof the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, \nthere is now scientific certainty that human activity is \nthe main cause of global climate change. Thus, the \nopportunity to avoid irreversible damage to the climate \nsystem will be lost if urgent and definite actions are not \nimmediately taken. \n Small island developing States have contributed \nvery little to the release of greenhouse gases in the \natmosphere. Yet we are being forced to contend with \nthe devastating effects of those emissions. We are faced \nwith coral bleaching, sea level rise, salt water \nintrusion, water scarcity and increasingly severe \nweather events, all with very real financial and social \ncosts for our already vulnerable economies. \n The recent devastation wrought by four major \nhurricanes in the northern Caribbean highlights the \n \n \n45 08-52265 \n \nserious problems we face as a direct result of climate \nchange. Our solidarity goes out to the countries hardest \nhit, especially Cuba, Haiti, Jamaica and the Turks and \nCaicos islands. We call on the international community \nto respond appropriately to their plight. \n In that regard, Grenada takes the opportunity to \nstrongly voice its support for the Alliance of Small \nIsland Developing States political declaration on the \nurgency of responding to climate change, which is \nslated to be adopted on Monday, 29 September. \n Members will appreciate why Grenada speaks \npassionately on this issue. We have had first-hand \nexperience of the trauma, pain and economic loss \nassociated with natural disasters. Four years ago, \nHurricane Ivan literally destroyed our country. Thanks \nto the international community and, of course, to our \nresilient and resourceful people, we have since become \nmore conscious of the imperatives of disaster \npreparedness and crisis management. As a consequence, \nwe will continue to be at the forefront of activities to \nhave this issue properly debated and appropriate action \nplans adopted and implemented. The leadership role we \nhave played over the last several months, through the \nchairmanship of Alliance of Small Island States, is \nconsistent with that mission. \n Grenada welcomes Japan\u2019s important grant-aid \nprogramme for environment and climate change under \nits Cool Earth Partnership initiative. \n Another issue of utmost importance to Grenada is \nthe protection of the Caribbean Sea, an issue which has \nbeen repeatedly spoken of in this forum. Indeed, \nGrenada and other Caribbean Member States derive \ntremendous economic benefits from those pristine \nwaters, which are threatened by transhipment of \nnuclear waste and other hazardous materials. Grenada \nreiterates the call for increased attention to be given to \nthis serious matter with a view to having our concerns \nadequately reflected in a stronger General Assembly \nresolution. \n Grenada cherishes the democratic style of \ngovernance. We therefore pledge to contribute to any \nmultilateral dialogue to promote and enhance the \ncorresponding principles of transparency, accountability, \nconsensus-building and respect for institutions and \nindividual human rights. In that respect, we intend to \nimplement, in the short term, several critical pieces of \nlegislation, already passed by parliament, which are \ndesigned to bring about improvement in the rule of law.  \n Notwithstanding the atmosphere of peace and \nsecurity prevailing in Grenada, our main task is to \ncontinue to enhance the daily livelihood of our people \nas we strive to achieve and sustain economic growth \nand to restore fiscal balance and debt sustainability. \nThat challenge is compounded by unfavourable \nexternal factors including high energy costs, escalating \nfood prices and the worrying slowdown in major world \neconomies and financial markets. \n Grenada is determined to pursue the construction \nof a new economy through the implementation of \nstrategic initiatives. As we proceed with our \ndevelopment, we appeal to the international community \nfor technical assistance and other forms of support. The \nusual role of United Nations bodies, including the Food \nand Agriculture Organization, the World Health \nOrganization, UNESCO, the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme and others, will be critical in \nthe process. \n No one in the developed world can deny the \nvalue of a small country like Grenada in the expansion \nof democracy and the fight against terrorism. \nCurrently, environmental issues also demand urgent \naction on the part of all States. Those shared goals and \nvalues reshape relations between States. These issues \nunderscore an urgent need for new platforms to address \nthe issue of support for the developmental needs of \nStates. Grenada believes that the realization of a global \npartnership for development is of urgent importance. \nSerious attention should be paid to addressing the \nspecial needs of the least developed countries in the \nareas of trade, debt relief and the environment. \n It is Grenada\u2019s hope that the sixty-third session \nwill be filled with a spirit of camaraderie, goodwill, \ncollaboration, equity, trust and confidence in our \nability to improve the general well-being of mankind. \nIt is our hope that the Organization\u2019s reform will take \nplace in such a way that the perceived dominance by \nsome will not be a standard of inflexibility, but will \ngive way to genuine dialogue and cooperation. \n I can assure the Assembly that Grenada intends to \npursue its external relations based on the principle of \nmutual respect. Thus, we will be an active participant \nin multilateral debates on current issues. \n Grenada maintains its staunch and unwavering \nstance in the fight against terrorism, illicit drugs, \nweapons and human trafficking. We will continue to \nunconditionally support all initiatives that promote and \n  \n \n08-52265 46 \n \nenhance global peace and security. Grenada strongly \ncondemns all violent acts by those who are bent on \ncreating chaos and panic in regions around the world, \nand thus supports all efforts to bring the perpetrators to \njustice. Additionally, Grenada is committed to the full \nimplementation of the recommendations adopted by \nthe Caribbean Financial Action Task Force to combat \nmoney-laundering and terrorist financing. \n Grenada is optimistic about the opportunities for \nwider and deeper engagement among Caribbean \ncountries. We strongly believe that all countries should \nbe allowed to develop without hindrance and undue \npressure. Accordingly, Grenada calls on all countries to \nconstructively engage Cuba at this historic juncture. \nGrenada is a friend both of the United States and of \nCuba, and thus wishes to use this occasion to call on \nthe former to use its diplomatic experience to assist the \nprocess of economic and social change now taking \nplace in Cuba. Grenada contends that the stringent \nunilateral economic measures in place against Cuba \nwill benefit no one and do not facilitate the world\u2019s \ngoal of achieving a global partnership of equals. \n Additionally, Grenada calls on the United Nations \nto continue its vital role in assisting the African continent \nin realizing its development objectives. In keeping with \nthe declaration of the recently concluded high-level \nmeeting on Africa\u2019s development (resolution 63/1), we \nurge the Secretary-General to use his good offices to \nremind world leaders of their commitments for the \nbetterment of the African people. \n Similarly, the plight of Haiti, my fellow \nCARICOM neighbour, must be addressed with utmost \ncompassion and urgency. Grenada recently pledged a \nmodest monetary donation, and is proud to be a police-\ncontributing country with the United Nations \nStabilization Mission in Haiti. In that vein, Grenada \nurges the other States Members of this Organization to \ndo likewise. \n Grenada urges that we capitalize on the spirit of \ncooperation and collaboration to assist the poor and \nmore vulnerable nations to become and remain viable \nand to actively participate in a global process that \nneeds the input of all nations of the world, big and \nsmall. In this regard, I wish to salute the Government \nof the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela for \nconsiderably easing some of the financial pressure \ninflicted on our fragile economy by the sharp increases \nin oil prices. Through the Petro Caribe Initiative, \nseveral Caribbean countries are able to buy oil from \nVenezuela on softer terms. \n Grenada is convinced that the principles upon \nwhich this great organization was founded, as \narticulated in its Charter, should be given full vitality. \nThat would certainly redound to our individual and \ncollective benefit as we seek to confront the many \nchallenges of this modern and complex era. \n Grenada commends the Secretary-General for his \noutstanding leadership of this Organization. Finally, \nGrenada once again congratulates the President on his \nelection to facilitate and direct the debate of this sixty-\nthird session of the General Assembly. I assure him of \nour full support as he guides the process."

        "file_text": "Romania fully associates itself with the statement made \non behalf of the European Union by President Nicolas \nSarkozy. I should simply like to make a few remarks \nwith regard to issues of particular interest to my \nGovernment. I should like to frame my statement \naround two words: responsibility and solidarity. \n The basic purpose of the high-level meeting that \ntook place on 25 September was to review the progress \nmade in the implementation of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and evaluate the feasibility of \nachieving them. It was a matter not of whether they \nwere appropriate or reasonable, which they obviously \nare, but rather of determining the viability of \nimplementing them in the face of new challenges. The \nconclusion was that international cooperation and \ndetermination could provide a solution, provided that \nresponsibilities were met and solidarity forthcoming. In \ndoing so, we would be making the idea of community \nconcrete. \n With regard to climate change, the world energy \ncrisis and food security, I should simply like to say that \nthe vulnerability of nature is inevitably linked to our \nincreased technological capacity to influence the \nclimate \u2014 sometimes irreversibly \u2014 through the \ncumulative effects of human activity; hence the moral \nimperative of responsibility to the future. We cannot \nseparately or individually find solutions to the \nproblems that affect us all, in particular global \nwarming and the energy crisis. \n In the face of all those interconnected challenges, \nit is our responsibility to better equip the United \nNations with the necessary means to coordinate \neffective joint efforts. The revitalization of the General \nAssembly, system-wide coherence, Security Council \nreform and, not least, the reform of the Department of \nPolitical Affairs are all areas in which we have a \nresponsibility to make significant progress. It is \nencouraging that there has been an effort to find \ncommon denominators in many projects and initiatives. \n Any reform of the Security Council must take \ninto account the legitimate aspirations of the regional \ngroups, with the ultimate goal of ensuring a more \nrepresentative, legitimate, transparent and effective \nCouncil. \n If we expect results from the United Nations, we \nmust provide it with the appropriate resources. \nFollowing the reform of the Department of \nPeacekeeping Operations, it is only logical to \nstrengthen the capacity for analysis, political \nmediation, foresight and preventive diplomacy of the \nDepartment of Political Affairs. My country is ready \nonce again support the initiative for institutional \nconsolidation, in particular as regards a European \nregional office charged with expanding its reach to the \nWestern Balkans and the Black Sea region.  \n United Nations regional political offices could \nalso increase their cooperation with regional and \nsubregional organizations, whose resources should be \nin synergy with those of the global Organization. The \ncooperation between the United Nations, the African \nUnion and other subregional organizations during the \nrecent crises in the Darfur region of the Sudan, in \nKenya and in Zimbabwe are all encouraging examples. \nWe also welcome the ongoing cooperation between the \nUnited Nations and the International Organization of la \nFrancophonie. \n I should now like to say a few words on \ndemocratization. Romania welcomes the substantial \nexpansion and improvement of cooperation in the \nConference of New or Restored Democracies, \nincluding the unprecedented efforts of Qatar in that \nregard.  \nA/63/PV.13  \n \n08-53122 34 \n \n The current challenges should give rise to \nrenewed international cooperation. The network of \ndemocratic solidarity that provides support to countries \nemerging from conflict or from autocratic regimes is \nfounded on a philosophy of freedom that repudiates \nthreats from international terrorism or radicalism, \nwhich have developed their own network as a sort of \nparallel globalization based on fear. However, the \ninternational network of cooperation should not have \nanxiety and fragility as its common denominators, but \ninstead the natural propensity of States and \norganizations that share the same values, principles and \nobjectives, namely, freedom and respect for the law \nand the dignity of the human being. Allow me to recall \nthat, on Romania\u2019s initiative, in 2000 the General \nAssembly adopted its comprehensive resolution 55/96, \nwhich set out the defining characteristics of \ndemocracy. \n Peacekeeping missions remain the backbone of \nthe international role of the United Nations. Post-\nconflict normalization and rebuilding should be an \nintegral part of the international strategy to deal with \npotential breaches of peace or the reignition of \nconflicts. My country acknowledges and praises the \nendeavours of United Nations personnel in Kenya, \nIraq, Myanmar, northern Uganda, Somalia, Cyprus, the \nCentral African Republic and Nepal. \n The progress made in Iraq and Afghanistan \nshould trigger renewed solidarity with the peoples of \nthose countries. The efforts of the international \ncommunity to stabilize and ensure the success of the \nongoing deep transformations in Iraq and Afghanistan \nshould be matched by renewed commitment on the part \nof the Iraqi and Afghan political leadership to reach \ncompromises and comprehensive agreements allowing \nfor political reconciliation and economic development. \n Romania remains committed to the democratic \nfuture of both countries. Romania was first among the \ncountries that are not members of the Paris Club to \nagree, in 2005, to the terms of debt relief for Iraq. The \nNATO summit held this year in Bucharest reconfirmed \nsolidarity and engagement with Afghanistan. Any \nsecurity agreements to complement or replace the \ncurrent security arrangements in Iraq have to take into \naccount the need to ensure the protection of United \nNations personnel in order that the United Nations \nAssistance Mission for Iraq and the Organization\u2019s \nspecialized agencies, funds and programmes can \nproperly fulfil their extended mandates in Iraq. \n I should now like to say a few words about the \nHuman Rights Council. Romania has encouraging \nexpectations following the start of the activities of the \nCouncil\u2019s Universal Periodic Review mechanism. \nUnder the Romanian presidency, the Council examined \n32 national reports, including my country\u2019s own report. \nThe debates generated valuable recommendations and \nentailed remarkable commitments with regard to the \nuniversal application of recognized international \nstandards for human rights and fundamental freedoms. \nWe should not weaken our support for the Human \nRights Council or for the Office of the High \nCommissioner. \n The widespread impact of humanitarian crises \nresulting from conflicts and natural disasters requires, \nagain and again, our solidarity with the people in need. \nThe tragedy of 7 million Sudanese, almost 5 million \nPalestinian refugees, 5 million Iraqi internally \ndisplaced persons and refugees, 3 million Afghan \nrefugees and 1.4 million Congolese and 1 million \nSomali internally displaced persons should catalyse \nconcrete actions of assistance. The recent Georgian \ncrisis also added to the international statistics on \ninternally displaced persons and refugees. Yet, numbers \nas such should not obscure in our conscience the \nterrible individual tragedies implied by these \nhumanitarian catastrophes. \n Aware of that plight, Romania is preparing to \nhost a special evacuation transit centre for persons in \nurgent need of international protection and onward \nresettlement. The centre would provide temporary \nshelter for refugees facing immediate danger in their \ncountries of origin, pending final resettlement in third \ncountries. \n The appalling humanitarian crises of recent \ndecades should prompt a renewed effort to define ways \nto prevent and adequately react to such situations and, \nfurthermore, to rebuild for durable conflict resolution. \nFurther efforts should be made to forge a common \nunderstanding of the conditions and application of the \nprinciple of the responsibility to protect.  \n Romania resolutely promotes international \ncooperation in the areas of crime prevention and \nbelieves that prosecutorial services represent one of the \nmain pillars of the criminal justice system. My country \nis preparing to host, in March 2009, the third world \n A/63/PV.13\n \n35 08-53122 \n \nsummit of attorneys general, prosecutors general and \nchief prosecutors. The meeting is to be organized with \nthe support of the United Nations Office on Drugs and \nCrime and will focus on prosecutorial independence \nfor effectiveness, integrity and public confidence. We \nlook forward to welcoming the international \ncommunity\u2019s representatives in Bucharest next spring. \n Allow me now to turn to the issue of protracted \nconflicts. It has always been striking to hear the \nrecurrent references to frozen conflicts. Let us be \nhonest: no conflict stays frozen indefinitely without \nconsequences. The recent crisis in Georgia proved that \nthe international community cannot hide or shy away \nfrom dealing with uncertain situations under the \nassumption that they will simply disappear eventually. \nOn the contrary, uncertain situations and grey zones \ngradually produce effects, effect changes in the status \nquo and can, from apparent tranquillity, spew forth the \nmagma of delayed \u2014 and thus amplified \u2014 conflicts. \nA dormant volcano can still be an active one. Unsolved \nissues carrying latent threats are not socially or \npolitically neutral, since they generate new realities \nand risks to stability and security. \n Deferring the solution of a crisis is not a suitable \nanswer. Only a negotiated formula, with the support of \nbona fide international and regional mediation and \nassistance, can provide long-term and enduring \nsolutions. The crisis in South Ossetia, with its \nreverberations in Abkhazia and the entire State of \nGeorgia and beyond, should focus the attention of the \ninternational community on all protracted conflicts in \nthe area, including Transdniestria and Nagorny \nKarabakh. \n We have to have a new energetic and \ncomprehensive approach to the so-called protracted \nconflicts. It is time to jointly understand the danger and \ntake action. The United Nations and its Security \nCouncil should play their parts and accordingly assume \ntheir responsibility. Hesitation is not helping. Full \nobservance of all principles and norms of international \nlaw, including the territorial integrity of States, is a \nmust for all of us if we want peace, security, stability \nand prosperity to prevail. \n One of the main objectives of the international \ncommunity should be to consolidate stabilization and a \ndemocratic future across the entire Black Sea region. \nRomania promotes a wide range of cooperation ideas \nin the Black Sea area. If we take a closer look, we can \nsee a region with a large population, an important hub \nfor energy and transport flows and great economic \npotential. The United Nations should be there to assist \nthe region, not only in unfreezing conflicts but also in \nhelping coastal countries to cooperate to solve \nproblems related to pollution, illegal migration, \norganized crime and drug trafficking, so as to project \nstability and to support development. \n I now turn to disarmament, non-proliferation and \nthe fight against terrorism. I should like to underline \nthat responsibility and solidarity are also basic pillars \nof the international norms in that regard. That leads me \nto say, as many before me have done, that statements \nsuch as the one made a few days ago in the Assembly \nabout Israel are unacceptable. \n First, every State has an essential responsibility \nto effectively and comprehensively implement its \ncommitments by promoting the necessary legal \nframework and establishing appropriate mechanisms \nfor verification and control. \n Secondly, there is a need for solidarity and \ncooperation at the regional and multilateral levels so \nthat national measures and actions are recognized and \nimplemented. Romania has always demonstrated its \ninterest and readiness to work together with all States \nmembers of the international community in that \nrespect. The most recent proof of that is the \ncontribution of my country to the seven-nation \ninitiative on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation \nlaunched by Norway in 2005. Concrete examples of \nour involvement include the international seminar on \nhow the Black Sea region can contribute to improved \nglobal security, which was hosted in Bucharest in 2007, \nand other activities aimed at promoting the objectives \nof that cross-regional initiative. \n Allow me to conclude by calling for effective \nmultilateralism and the strengthening of the United \nNations. After all, some questioned the relevance of the \nUnited Nations after the end of the cold war. The \nOrganization has never lacked for criticism or \nscepticism. We do not believe the issue to be one of \ntrying to regain a sense of lost purpose. The United \nNations continues to be the broadest and most \ninclusive Organization in the world and enjoys a \nspecial reputation and legitimacy. The United Nations \nprovides a forum for all Member States \u2014 large or \nA/63/PV.13  \n \n08-53122 36 \n \nsmall, rich or poor, developed or developing \u2014 to have \ntheir voices heard and heeded.  \n Instead, the question for all Member States is \nhow to make the world Organization and its specialized \nagencies, funds and programmes more effective, \nresponsible and coherent in the face of new and \nongoing challenges. If the moral imperative that should \nlead us to carry out our responsibilities and \ndemonstrate solidarity in order to advance the cause of \nhumankind is not enough, then what we need is to look \ntowards the pragmatic aspect, namely, the utility and \nsense implied in the fact that the world\u2019s well-being \ncontributes to the well-being of our own countries and \ncitizens. \n History is a good teacher, provided we learn from \nits lessons. History shows us the virtues of joint efforts \nand the benefits of cooperation. We are still far from \nthe Kantian dream of a stable world order that is \ndemocratic and prosperous. But we can move ever \ncloser to it through multilateralism and the \nstrengthening of the United Nations. "

        "file_text": "I \nbelieve that nearly everything has already been said \nhere since the beginning of the sixty-third session of \nthe General Assembly. Some were things that we \nAfricans wanted to hear and some we could have done \nwithout. But I have come to New York once again to \njoin other heads of State who are concerned with the \nstate of the planet, which faces armed conflicts, \nenvironmental catastrophes \u2014 some naturally \noccurring and some the result of thoughtless and \nselfish behaviour and attitudes of some among us \u2014 as \nwell as multiple financial crises, including extreme \nincreases in the price of oil and basic food products.  \n On behalf of the people of the islands of Sao \nTome and Principe, I should like to congratulate \nMr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann on his election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \nsession and to wish him every success. I am certain \nthat the themes he has put forward for discussion at \nthis session are a reflection of his concern about the \nvarious international problems currently affecting the \nworld. I would dare say that we are doubly blessed by \nhis qualities as a diplomat, which are well known, and \nas a priest. Allow me also to take this opportunity to \n \n \n23 08-51845 \n \nthank and commend his predecessor for a job well \ndone. \n The report (A/63/1) of the Secretary-General to \nthe Assembly exhaustively describes the world in \nwhich we live and reflects the major concerns of \nMember States while providing guidance on how to \nresolve them. I believe it to be an important working \ndocument that deserves the closest attention from \nMember States.  \n The recent upheavals and conflicts that the world \nhas experienced are proof of the fragility of the current \nsystem of international relations. That makes it \nnecessary for the world\u2019s main political actors to \nengage in permanent dialogue to find lasting solutions \nthat will make it possible for nations and peoples to \nconcentrate on social and economic development \nissues.  \n With regard to development, I would like to \ncommend the Secretary-General on his selection of \nthemes for the high-level meetings, the first of which \ntook place the day before the opening of the general \ndebate and the second of which is taking place today. \nWe hope that those who, during the first three days of \nthe general debate, have reaffirmed their determination \nto continue their solidarity towards Africa will translate \nthe intentions expressed here into action.  \n I need not reiterate my country\u2019s position with \nregard to chronic unresolved conflicts, especially the \nsituation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian \nissue, the perennial latent conflict in our subregion that \nis taking place in the Democratic Republic of the \nCongo, and the humanitarian situation in Darfur and its \nimpact.  \n Our attention and available resources are focused \non efforts to eradicate poverty, ensure food security \nand achieve the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs). Despite the enormous efforts of my people \nand the hardships they have suffered, my country will \nnot be able to achieve all the Goals by 2015. The food \ncrisis, the financial crisis and the constraints of \ninsufficient aid linked to inadequate processes are all \ncontributing to deteriorating prospects. Paradoxically, \nthe number of poor people is increasing rather than \ndecreasing. We are continuing our efforts to reverse \nthat situation, by example, by greatly increasing \nmicrocredit loans in the agriculture and fisheries \nsectors in an attempt to ensure some measure of food \nsecurity.  \n However, despite the relatively unfavourable \noverall environment, there have been some success \nstories. For example, in recent years, Sao Tome and \nPrincipe has made great progress with regard to child \nmortality indicators; we are certain that we will \nachieve the targets established in the MDGs. We have \nalso made progress in the area of education. With \nadequate support from our partners and the \ninternational community, we will be able to achieve the \nrelevant targets set out in the MDGs.  \n According to data published in 2007, the \nincidence of HIV/AIDS infection has increased in my \ncountry. We have attempted to provide free or \nsubsidized antiretroviral treatment for all, with help \nfrom the Federative Republic of Brazil. We are also \ncarrying out an aggressive policy to educate people in \norder to prevent the disease and promote safe sexual \npractices.  \n Sao Tome and Principe is an archipelago that \nincludes three mountainous islands. Despite our \nmountainous terrain, however, our people are \nincreasingly concerned about the advancing sea at high \ntide. According to records, no waves higher than three \nmetres have broken on our shores in the past 110 years. \nHowever, giant waves have begun to wash over our \ncoastal highways in the past 10 years, temporarily \ncutting off certain regions of our country. I cannot \noveremphasize the strong appeal I made from this \nrostrum in the past to those who are primarily \nresponsible for the global warming that afflicts the \nplanet, namely, that they address this phenomenon and \nthe means to mitigate its effects with much greater \nseriousness.  \n In his statement at the opening of the sixty-third \nsession of the General Assembly (see A/63/PV.1), the \nAssembly President said that love was the greatest \nneed in today\u2019s world and that the selfishness of some \nhas led to the current situation. This may perhaps be \nconsidered overly simplistic coming from the mouth of \na head of State, but I believe that that is precisely the \ncore of the problem. Our Governments, diplomats and \npoliticians rarely think in such terms. No people \nchooses to be poor. Being poor does not imply that we \nare less intelligent or lazier than others. It all has to do \nwith the opportunities available at the time of birth, as \nwell as to the solidarity and compassion one \nencounters thereafter \u2014 when these are not empty \nwords. Yes, we must re-establish generosity and \nsolidarity among human beings.  \n  \n \n08-51845 24 \n \n An example of that is the fact that there was a \ndecrease of more than 95 per cent in the number of \ncases of malaria recorded in Sao Tome and Principe in \n2007. As a result, we expect that the disease will soon \nbe eradicated from our country through an ongoing \ncontrol programme. For the first time in centuries, as \nconfirmed by the most recent report of the World \nHealth Organization on the state of the world\u2019s health, \nmalaria is not the main cause of child mortality and \nmorbidity among the people of my country. That has \nbeen possible thanks to the Republic of China on \nTaiwan.  \n Speaking of solidarity and Taiwan, once again \nfrom this rostrum, I would like to appeal to the \nconscience of each and every member to consider the \nfate to which 23 million Taiwanese have been \nrelegated. Will the community of nations represented \nhere continue to ignore the existence of a population \ncomprising more than 23 million people? I must \nremind the Assembly that the Republic of China on \nTaiwan is a country with a vibrant democracy and an \nenviable economic and technological record that has \nserved as a development model for the global economy. \nOn 20 May 2008, we were pleased to see the \ninauguration of the new President of that friendly \ncountry. We paid close attention to his inaugural \naddress, which was a genuine call for peace and good \nrelations in the Taiwan Strait. \n Also regarding the lack of solidarity in the world, \nthe embargo against Cuba is another cause for concern \nthat requires our urgent attention. That relic from the \npast must be lifted on an urgent basis, especially in the \naftermath of the destruction caused by the two \nsuccessive hurricanes that recently struck that friendly \nnation. The United States Administration has a golden \nopportunity to demonstrate to the world that the \nstatements of its leaders are not just rhetorical \nexercises.  \n At the same time, I would like to make it very \nclear that Sao Tome and Principe is a tenacious \ndefender of the measures to combat international \nterrorism and to prevent the further loss of innocent \nlife.  \n Development strengthens diplomacy and security, \nreduces threats against our collective security and \nproduces peaceful, stable and prosperous societies. \nThat must be the focus of our efforts. I should \ntherefore, in conclusion, reiterate what I said at the \noutset: we must all be less selfish and care more about \neach other, rather than just ourselves.  "

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to convey to the President my \ncongratulations on his election and to acknowledge, \nthrough him, the Latin American and Caribbean States \nthat made his presidency of the General Assembly \npossible. Let me assure him and the other Assembly \nofficers that my delegation will support them \nthroughout the sixty-third session of the General \nAssembly.  \n I also wish to thank the Secretary-General for his \nresolute action in favour of peace and reiterate to him \nour sincere and full support. \n Finally, allow me to state what a great honour it \nis for me to take the floor today for the first time at the \nrostrum of this prestigious Hall. \n The great and deeply missed poet Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire \nsaid: \u201cA civilization that is unable to resolve the \nproblems that beset it is a decadent civilization.\u201d We \nknow what the sufferings of our civilization are. We \nhave identified the solutions needed to treat them. The \nissue at stake here is implementing those solutions. \n Eight years ago, in this very Hall, all the States \nMembers of the United Nations adopted the \nMillennium Declaration, the decisive tool in the fight \nagainst poverty, to promote peace, security and human \nrights, and to ensure a sustainable environment. It \nprovided the framework for eight precise goals \naccompanied by clear time frames \u2014 the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). \n My message today is a simple one. The \ninternational community cannot afford to fail in the \nimplementation of the MDGs, in spite of the threefold \nfood, energy and environmental crisis seriously \naffecting the whole planet. To achieve the goals that we \nset ourselves at the dawn of the new millennium, we \nwill have to step up our efforts and pursue concerted \naction in the only universal forum we have \u2014 the \nUnited Nations. \n Eight years ago, we drew up together a scorecard \nwith quantified goals and defined the steps to be taken \nto reduce poverty, fight hunger in the world and \ncombat pandemics. Eight years ago, the situation was \nvery alarming; we could not have imagined that things \nwere to get worse.  \n Since then, we have been faced with the energy \ncrisis and increasingly scarce resources, the food crisis \nand soaring prices of basic food products, and the \n  \n \n08-53129 18 \n \nclimate crisis resulting from the impact of human \nactivities on the environment. Adding to that already \nvery dark picture, we must now face the financial \ncrisis, whose repercussions continue to be felt and \nwhose full impact is yet to be seen.  \n Each country is suffering the consequences of \nthose crises in a different way depending on its \ngeography, its economy and its commercial and \nfinancial market exposure; and each country is \nattempting to face them with its own means. The \nPrincipality of Monaco, within its capabilities, has \nchosen to fight two of those crises \u2014 the food crisis \nand the climate crisis \u2014 with the resources at its \ndisposal. \n Much of the progress achieved in recent years in \nhelping those populations suffering from hunger and \nmalnutrition has been erased by soaring increases in \nthe price of basic foodstuffs. Two billion human beings \nare seriously at risk even as world cereal production \nhas reached a record high in 2008. The African \ncontinent, and in particular sub-Saharan Africa, with \n60 per cent of its population affected by the crisis, is \nonce again the worst-affected continent. \n It remains nonetheless undeniable that the right to \nfood is among the basic human rights. During the \nHigh-Level Conference in Rome last June, the \ninternational community adopted the Declaration on \nWorld Food Security: the Challenges of Climate \nChange and Bioenergy. Monaco fully supports the \nmeasures advocated in the Declaration and joins the \ncall for the establishment of a world partnership \ncentred on the High-Level Task Force on the Global \nFood Security Crisis. \n A year ago, His Serene Highness Prince Albert II \nannounced here his decision to substantially increase \nMonaco\u2019s official development assistance (ODA). The \nPrincipality\u2019s Government is sparing no effort to reach \nthe target of allocating 0.7 per cent of its gross national \nincome by 2015 by increasing our ODA by 25 per cent \nevery year and focusing its actions on the least \ndeveloped countries.  \n In 2008, 22 countries, mainly located around the \nMediterranean basin and in sub-Saharan Africa, have \nbenefited from a development partnership with the \nPrincipality. In addition to that bilateral cooperation, \nMonaco contributes on a regular basis to large-scale \nprogrammes of the United Nations system, such as the \nWorld Food Programme, the United Nations Children\u2019s \nFund (UNICEF), the World Health Organization, the \nUnited Nations Development Programme and the \nUnited Nations Population Fund, whose expertise and \nstructures facilitate the greatest assistance to the \npoorest populations. \n Moreover, climate change and the imbalances it \ncreates have a direct impact on the sustainability of our \nactions for development. The climate crisis, \ndesertification and the shortage of water resources have \nexacerbated the food crisis.  \n Antoine de Saint Exup\u00e9ry said: \u201cWe do not \ninherit the Earth from our parents; we borrow it from \nour children.\u201d Pursuing that analogy, the international \ncommunity is not allocating sufficient funds to repay \nthat loan. \n Under the leadership of our Head of State and in \ncollaboration with the Prince Albert II Foundation, the \nGovernment has committed itself actively in the \nInternational Polar Year to raise awareness among as \nmany people as possible of the consequences of global \nwarming. In that regard, the Arctic ice cap deserves all \nour attention since it serves as both an indicator of the \nconsequences of global warming and as a vector of \nclimate change through its gradual disappearance. \n Last year, when adopting the resolution on oceans \nand the law of the sea, member States expressed their \ndeep concern over the vulnerability of the environment \nand the fragility of ecosystems of the polar regions, \nparticularly the Arctic Ocean and the Arctic ice cap. At \nMonaco\u2019s initiative, the decision on sustainable \ndevelopment of the Arctic region was adopted at the \ntenth special session of the Governing Council of the \nUnited Nations Environment Programme, which was \nheld in the Principality in February 2008. \n We will pursue our commitment to that cause in \nthe coming months when Monaco will host meetings \non the Arctic: the first in November 2008, organized by \nthe French presidency of the European Union, and the \nsecond organized by UNESCO early next year. I would \nalso note that the Principality has solemnly confirmed \nits interest in the polar regions by acceding to the \nAntarctic Treaty on 31 May, and that His Serene \nHighness Prince Albert II will join a scientific mission \nto Antarctica in January. \n Notwithstanding the obstacles we have \nencountered on the road since 2000, we have to stay on \ntrack. Indeed, let us roll up our sleeves, consult each \n \n \n19 08-53129 \n \nother and work together to multiply our forces and \ncreate genuine synergy. \n I would like to reiterate here the deep \ncommitment of the Principality of Monaco to the \nUnited Nations, the only genuinely universal \norganization, which has human rights and the \npromotion of dialogue among nations at its very core. \nThe Charter of the United Nations guarantees the \nsovereign equality of States and the rule of law. \nMonaco has been a Member of the United Nations for \n15 years. Since joining, our small Principality has \ncovered a lot of ground on the international scene, \nbecoming a member of the Council of Europe in 2004 \nand, very recently, joining the Union for the \nMediterranean. \n Without the United Nations, it is doubtful that \nhuman rights would have acquired their universal \nstatus, which today is indisputable. This year and next, \nmany anniversaries remind us yet again of the essential \nrole of the United Nations: the sixtieth anniversary of \nthe adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights, the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the \nDeclaration of the Rights of the Child, and the \ntwentieth anniversary of the adoption of the United \nNations Convention on the Rights of the Child. \n The world has changed since the San Francisco \nConference. Today, our task is to modernize the United \nNations and ensure that its institutions adequately \nreflect our democratic principles and new geopolitical \nbalances. As His Serene Highness Prince Albert II \nstated here last year, Monaco supports the expansion of \nthe Security Council. \n Only the combined efforts of all partners will \nallow us to make real progress in the fight against \npoverty, to promote health care and education, improve \naccess to water and protect the environment. As \nindicated in the June 2008 recommendations of the \nMDG Africa Steering Group, the primary responsibility \nfor achieving the MDGs remains with African \nGovernments, which have shown tremendous \nleadership in recent years and launched ambitious \nprogrammes to attract the financial support of their \ndevelopment partners. \n We have seen real progress since 2000, in \nparticular in the area of health. Monaco, for its part, \ncontributes to various WHO and UNICEF programmes \nand participates in efforts to combat HIV/AIDS, sickle \ncell anaemia, tuberculosis and malaria. However, the \ngreatest national efforts, if made on an individual basis \nand without coordination, will not be enough to fight \nthe scourges that affect our planet, and the African \ncontinent in particular. \n The evaluation of ODA policies, the sharing of \ngood practices, the coordination of development \nassistance, partnership with the private sector, \nmicrofinance and the pursuit of alternative revenue \nsources are all instruments that, together with the \npriority to be given to the central role of women in the \neconomy, will enable us to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals in the next seven years.

        "file_text": "May I, at the outset, convey my heartfelt \ncongratulations to you, Sir, on your election as \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \nsession and assure you of the commitment of the \nKingdom of Bahrain and its delegation to working \nclosely with you towards achieving our shared \nobjectives. I have no doubt that your experience and \nabilities will play a crucial role in ensuring the success \nof this session. I also want to take this opportunity to \nthank your predecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, for his \nleadership of the General Assembly at its previous \nsession and to express our continued and deep \nappreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \nongoing, unflinching dedication and initiative in \naddressing the many challenges facing the United \nNations and the world. \n These General Assembly meetings provide a \nvaluable opportunity for all of us in the international \ncommunity to reflect on the challenges, problems and \nissues facing us all in order to form a more \ncomprehensive view of the issues, to understand their \ncauses, be it through success or failure, and to work \ntogether to develop a shared vision of the future and \nthe tools necessary to achieve our aims and realize our \nvision. \n Today, the international community faces many \nchallenges in achieving the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs), notably those related to energy, the \nenvironment, natural disasters, food shortages, \neducation and the financial crisis that has recently \nshaken the world. These challenges make achieving the \nMDGs difficult for many States, to a degree that affects \ntheir economic development and increases the rate of \npoverty in them. We therefore need an urgent and \neffective response from the international community to \ndeal with those pressing issues in order to achieve the \nMDGs. Yet, as we review our progress to date, the \nglobal effort to achieve the Goals has been uneven, at \nbest, to the point that we are today on the verge of a \ndevelopment emergency. \nA/63/PV.13  \n \n08-53122 26 \n \n The Kingdom of Bahrain welcomes the \nopportunities provided by the high-level event on the \nMDGs, held on 25 September, and the high-level meeting \non Africa\u2019s development needs, held on 22 September, to \nrenew the commitments of all States. \n In addressing these important issues, we must not \nlose sight of the impact of disasters, both natural and \nman-made, in holding back progress towards achieving \nthe MDGs. It is thus imperative that States integrate \ndisaster risk reduction into their development plans. \nWe simply cannot afford to ignore or delay these \ndevelopment issues. Nor can we dismiss them as soft \nissues, for if action is not taken soon, they will become \nreal threats to global security and prosperity. The \nKingdom of Bahrain therefore fully supports the \nGlobal Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \nand plans to host the launch of the report in May 2009. \n As we all know, the issue of climate change is of \nutmost importance. As the world prepares to meet to \nnegotiate a successor to the Kyoto Protocol by the end \nof 2009, global demand for energy is rising fast, as \npopulations increase and some developing countries \nundergo dramatic economic growth. The International \nEnergy Agency predicts that the world\u2019s energy needs \ncould increase by 50 per cent by 2030. We therefore \nlook forward to the meeting to be held in Poland later \nthis year in advance of the United Nations Climate \nChange Conference to be held in Copenhagen in 2009. \nWe are hopeful that all sides will realize the \nimportance of the climate change issue and will \ncommit themselves to addressing the overriding \ninterests of the future of our planet and of future \ngenerations. Our hope is that a comprehensive and \neffective agreement can be concluded and \nimplemented. \n The peaceful use of nuclear energy has become a \npreferred option for many countries, and here the \nKingdom of Bahrain therefore shares the concerns of \nthe international community. Therefore, future \nagreements on the use of nuclear energy for peaceful \npurposes must be made within a strengthened  \nnon-proliferation regime, with improved safeguards \nand an expanded verification mechanism, in order to \nensure that our peoples are not put at risk. Indeed, a \nhighlight of the twenty-eighth Supreme Council of the \nGulf Cooperation Council, held last December in \nDoha, was the acknowledgment of the right of \ncountries of the region to seek nuclear expertise and to \npossess nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, in close \ncooperation with the International Atomic Energy \nAgency. \n Given its universal impact and implications, \nenergy and its various sources are in need of a holistic, \nglobal approach, yet they are dealt with in a \nfragmented, piecemeal manner. That unsatisfactory \nsituation leads us to suggest the establishment of a \ntruly comprehensive energy organization. Such an \norganization would bring a joint international \nperspective to determining the role and usage of \nhydrocarbons, nuclear power, new and renewable \nenergy sources, and would introduce innovative \nsolutions to reduce pollution and greenhouse gas \nemissions. Such a body could provide accurate \nassessments of global energy demand and supply and \nbring energy data under one roof. It would also provide \nany objective advice that might be required on an \noptimal energy mix that is both safe and \nenvironmentally sound. \n Having spoken of energy and climate change \nissues, I must now turn to the food security crisis, \nwhich is a result of high food prices and which in 2007 \nincreased the number of hungry people in the world by \nabout 50 million. We believe that the solution to that \ncrisis lies in working together to implement solutions, \nsuch as reducing biofuel production, changing \nconsumption habits and investing in sustainable \nagricultural methods. \n The shock that has recently affected the \ninternational financial system has almost resulted in a \nglobal economic catastrophe. That shock has revealed \nthe weaknesses and fragility of the current financial \nsystem and its propensity for rapid and widespread \ndislocation. We bear the historic responsibility to \nestablish transparent new regulations based on the \ninterests of all States Members of the United Nations \nand to prepare a framework that can contain any future \nfinancial crisis. \n The fact is that multilateral cooperation is \nfundamental to addressing these challenges, as no \ncountry alone can resolve such issues and crises or \nisolate itself from their consequences. As the \nSecretary-General said in his opening statement, \n(spoke in English) \n\u201cNations can no longer protect their interests or \nadvance the well-being of their peoples without \n A/63/PV.13\n \n27 08-53122 \n \nthe partnership of other nations.\u201d (A/63/PV.5, \np. 1). \n(spoke in Arabic) \n The Kingdom of Bahrain therefore supports \nefforts to reform, renew and reinvigorate the \ninternational Organization and its organs to be more \nresponsive to the needs of a new world. We agree with \nthe view of the Secretary-General, set out in his annual \nreport (A/63/1), that we need a stronger, more effective \nand more modern Organization. We look forward to the \nstructural reform of this international Organization to \nenable it respond more effectively to the challenges \nfaced by the international community and to increase \nits capacity to deal with such issues. \n We must make every effort to address such \nshortcomings as threats to the international security \nsystem emanating from a wide range of external sources, \nincluding extremists, terrorists, drug traffickers, money \nlaunderers and intellectual property pirates. We need to \ndevelop collective security arrangements that bring \ntogether our security efforts while ensuring respect for \nexisting borders between States and avoiding \nencroachment on their sovereignty.  \n On the issue of terrorism, we consider terrorism \nto have many faces \u2014 whether in the form of the \nheinous crime perpetrated in Islamabad a few days ago \nthat led to the deaths of scores of innocent people, or \nagitation and incitement from afar or a variety of other \nmanifestations. We should be clear and decisive in \nconfronting terrorism in a comprehensive manner so as \nto defeat it both in the field and ideologically. We \nbelieve that the struggle against terrorism is a battle \nthat we should wage, united, if we are to get rid of its \nevil. \n The Middle East faces many acute issues in \ndesperate need of settlement, the most pressing of \nwhich is the need for a just, comprehensive, lasting and \npeaceful settlement of the Palestinian question based \non ensuring security for all the peoples of the Middle \nEast region, including Israel. Such a settlement must \ntake place within the framework of international \nlegitimacy and the relevant terms of reference, where \nthe choice will be just peace, as called for in the Arab \nPeace Initiative.  \n In that regard, there is also an urgent need for a \npeaceful settlement on the Syrian track, including \nwithdrawal from the occupied Arab Syrian Golan and \nthe remaining Lebanese territories. It also requires a \nhalt to Israeli incursions into Lebanon, whose stability \nmust be supported. It is also important to have a \nresolution of the issue of the occupied islands of the \nUnited Arab Emirates, either through direct \nnegotiations or by referring the issue to the \nInternational Court of Justice. That would be a \nsignificant step towards strengthening trust between \nthe countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council and Iran.  \n The Gulf region, which is an integral part of the \nworld economy, has experienced destructive wars \nduring the past three decades. It will not be able to \nendure a new war, due to the severe consequences on \nthe world economy. The Kingdom of Bahrain therefore \nreiterates its call for a peaceful solution to the Iranian \nnuclear issue, in order to avoid the scourge of war in \nthe region and to enhance world peace and stability.  \n Moreover, there is an urgent need to rid the \nMiddle East and the Gulf region of weapons of mass \ndestruction, including nuclear weapons, while \nsafeguarding the rights of all countries to the peaceful \nuses of nuclear energy in accordance with the \ncomprehensive safeguards regime of the International \nAtomic Energy Agency. \n In order for the Middle East to enjoy stable and \nlasting peace, it is incumbent upon us to re-evaluate \nour outlook on the region and to consider the \npossibility of developing new regional frameworks to \naddress and overcome long-standing challenges. Now \nis the time, for example, to consider the establishment \nof an organization that would include all States of the \nMiddle East, without exception, to discuss long-\nstanding issues openly and frankly, in the hope of \nreaching a stable and durable understanding between \nall parties. As Arabs, we accept peace as a strategic \noption. We are committed to international legitimacy, \nending old conflicts and hostilities and beginning a \nnew chapter for a historic rapprochement between the \npeoples of the region that will lead towards a better \nfuture characterized by understanding, stability and \nprosperity. \n Developments in the Kingdom of Bahrain in \nrecent years have been characterized by dialogue and \nunderstanding, a process inaugurated by our leader, His \nMajesty King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa, as part of his \nextensive reform programme that aims at strengthening \ndemocracy, political reform and the promotion and \nprotection of human rights. At a time when we will \nA/63/PV.13  \n \n08-53122 28 \n \nsoon join the United Nations and the international \ncommunity in commemorating the sixtieth anniversary \nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which \nlaid down the principles and values of freedom and \nhuman justice for modern times, Bahrain\u2019s election to \nthe Human Rights Council and the adoption at Geneva \nin June of the report on our first universal periodic \nreview serve to clearly illustrate the international \ncommunity\u2019s recognition of Bahrain\u2019s efforts in the \narea of human rights. \n The Kingdom of Bahrain will continue to move \nforward in that and other fields, for example, by \nestablishing Bahrain\u2019s national human rights institution \nand continuing to make progress in the political, \neconomic and regulatory spheres. The Kingdom of \nBahrain will not hesitate to play its role in helping \nbrotherly and friendly States and in sharing its success \nstories, which have helped provide a better life for our \npeople. In that regard, His Highness Shaikh Khalifa bin \nSalman Al-Khalifa, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of \nBahrain, in cooperation with the United Nations \nHuman Settlements Programme, has sponsored an \naward called the Shaikh Khalifa bin Salman Al-Khalifa \nHabitat Award, which honours distinguished research \nthat contributes to alleviating poverty and safeguarding \nthe environment and recognizes the efforts of States to \nachieve desired economic development. His Highness \nis expected to present the award this year during the \nfourth session of the World Urban Forum, which is to \nbe held in Nanjing, in the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n A key pillar of Bahrain\u2019s approach to the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) continues to \nbe its investment in modern education that is practical, \nrelevant and of high quality and that instils critical \nthinking and creativity and encourages innovation and \nacceptance of the other. In that respect, I want to note \nthat Bahrain has been able to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals in the area of education \nsignificantly before the 2015 deadline. We have done \nso by providing children with free high-quality \neducation and by making basic education for all a \nfundamental human right. \n In conclusion, the Kingdom of Bahrain, the \u201cland \nof immortality\u201d and proud host of many civilizations, \nis a country where the concepts of tolerance and \ncoexistence among all segments of society are central. \nMosques stand alongside churches and temples of \nvarious denominations, and people enjoy freedom and \nreligious tolerance irrespective of their religion or \nethnicity. Fraternal values, moderation and the \nrejection of violence and terrorism are embedded in our \nculture, auguring a promising new era in the history of \nhumankind.  \n That is the Kingdom of Bahrain that is committed \nto participating fully, along with the rest of the \ninternational community, in achieving global peace, \nstability and prosperity and to confronting current and \nfuture challenges, for the benefit of our peoples and \nfuture generations. That is a task the international \ncommunity must undertake in a spirit of cooperation \nand good faith, for when future generations evaluate \nour actions and hold us to account, they will not \nforgive our mistakes and miscalculations.

        "file_text": "\u201cI am committed to \ntruth, not to what is established,\u201d said Gandhi. The \nMillennium Development Goals, which seek between \nnow and 2015 to eradicate extreme poverty, achieve \nuniversal primary education, promote gender equality, \nreduce infant mortality, fight the spread of such \ndiseases as HIV/AIDS and malaria, and guarantee \nenvironmental sustainability, are a challenge to us all, \nindividually and collectively. Each human being is \nunique and respect for others must be both universal \nand imperative. \n The world is paradoxical. We meet here during \nthese weeks to speak of the food crisis and famine in \nthe world, and we do so 63 years after having set in \nmotion actions and structures within the framework of \nthe United Nations to eradicate such phenomena. \n In 2008, well into the twenty-first century, of the \n2.5 billion poor people living in the countries of the \nSouth, 950 million live in conditions of extreme \npoverty. The forecasts of the International Fund for \nAgricultural Development indicate that, by 2025, the \nworld will have 2 billion more people living in \nconditions of extreme poverty. \n In one year, the world has been confronted, as it \nwas in the last century, by mass movements of \npopulations driven by hunger. The Governments of the \nwealthiest countries, international agencies and \nnon-governmental organizations (NGOs) stand helpless \nbefore the worsening malnutrition and social tensions \nthat have resulted. \n The Secretary-General declared in his 2007 report \non the Millennium Development Goals that the world \ndoes not want more promises. However, reality in its \ncrudest aspect has put us through disturbances in recent \nmonths caused by people who are suffering famine in \nvarious countries. On Tuesday, the President reminded \nus in his opening speech of the perils of our current \nsituation. We face a global financial crisis, a global \nenergy crisis, a global food crisis and climate change. \nFaced with this situation, it is inevitable that we ask \nourselves the questions: What did we do wrong? What \nis it that does not work? \n The prices of basic food products have risen by \n50 per cent in one year, and a group of United Nations \nexperts has determined that the price of goods around \nthe world has risen by 30 per cent since January 2008. \nIf we take into account that there are 1.4 billion people \nliving on less than $1.25 a day, there are far too many \npeople living in the world today in extremely \nprecarious conditions, with no access to schools, \npotable water or basic health care and hygiene. \n Some experts say that the food crisis is the result \nof the failure of development policies that were \nadopted to encourage economic and social progress in \ncountries classified as poor. Those countries often have \nsubstantial natural resources and could produce basic \nproducts, such as cereals, but reality is obstinate and \nthe fact is that two thirds of developing countries are \nnet importers of food products. \n Alfred Sauvy, the economist and sociologist, said \nthat the milestone of the economy is not labour but \nconsumption. That is the source of one of the principal \ncurrent problems. Consumer goods are scarce and \ndemand exceeds supply. The Director-General of the \nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United \nNations (FAO), Jacques Diouf, forecasts an increase of \n56 per cent in the cost of imports of cereals for the \nmore disadvantaged countries, but he also forecasts an \nincrease of 53 per cent for the European countries. \n The current crisis is closely related to the \ngeographical distribution of productivity. Perhaps \nproduction should be increased in the places where \npeople are suffering famine and less surplus sent from \ncountries with more resources, since it contributes to \nincreasing the dependency of the poor countries. In that \nrespect, we agree with the decision of the World Bank \nto double its loans for agriculture to Africa, with a \nprovision of $800 million for 2009. \n At the same time and in order to correct the \ndistortions that have been created in the markets, the \nliberalization of agricultural markets must be \naccompanied by measures of support for small local \nfarmers so as to avoid the temptation of giving up \nproduction in favour of importing foreign food \nproducts. In fact, liberalization would have to be \nreinvented. Rather than serving as a common pattern \nfor all countries, it would have to be applied according \nto the specific circumstances of each country, while the \npros and cons are analysed with caution. \n On the other hand, the subject of agricultural \nsubsidies has not been resolved definitively, nor has \ntrue freedom of trade, which would serve to help the \n \n \n41 08-51851 \n \ncountries that need it most, been established. \nLiberalization would also have to involve an increase \nin productivity and the development of human \nresources, basic infrastructures, access to technology \nand knowledge including respect for the environment. \nIn other words, it would have to contribute to \nsustainable development, as indicated in the Doha \nOutcome Document of July 2008. \n The current crisis shows the vulnerability of the \npresent system. In that regard, without ignoring hard \nrealities, Andorra fully shares the approaches agreed in \nRome in June during the High-Level Conference on \nWorld Food Security: the Challenges of Climate \nChange and Bioenergy. Since 2005, the Government of \nAndorra has worked on development cooperation with \nall of the major international bodies, vulnerable \ncountries at their request, NGOs and civil society. \n In the current context and in accordance with the \ncall from world leaders, major international actors and \ninternational specialized and regional organizations, \nwe have assisted the most affected countries through \nfinancial contributions to FAO and NGO initiatives. \nWe also cooperate on support for agricultural trade and \nproduction in Burkina Faso, Colombia and Morocco \nthrough NGOs active in the field. For that reason, we \nendorse the future options being used to maintain \nbiological diversity, sustainable forestry practices and \nthe adaptation of new technology that can help to \npromote ecological balance and slow the effects of \nclimate change. \n Demographic growth on a planet that already has \nmore than 6.7 billion inhabitants; chemical and \nindustrial pollution; ill-adapted land use; desertification \nand water; the interaction of animal, vegetable and \nhorticultural species; international trade and the \nmovements of peoples are all destabilizing factors that \nare now upon us and very real. We have to address \nthem with all the means available to us. Guaranteeing \nfood for everyone on our planet is basic, essential and \nvital. Sixty-three years ago we thought that today, in \nthe twenty-first century, this would be a fact, an \noutdated concept, a matter achieved, the success of our \ndreams. Sadly, we were wrong. Now, we need to be \nstrong. To keep going and face up to the most \npessimistic forecasts which warn us of the failure of \nthe Millennium Development Goals. \n We have made the diagnosis, we are aware that \nthe policies we have encouraged in recent decades have \nnot fulfilled our expectations. But we still have time to \nrectify this and for this reason I would like to \ncongratulate both the Secretary-General for his \ninitiatives and the rest of the international bodies and \ncivil society for the specific actions they are \nimplementing around the world. \n Speeches, reports and fine words are necessary \nbut we suffer from a serious inability to act. Let us not \nhide behind excuses. Let us take action based on the \nfacts. The dignity of every human being obliges us to \ndo so and humanity deserves it! "

        "file_text": "At the outset, on behalf of His Excellency El \nHadj Omar Bongo Ondimba, President of the Gabonese \nRepublic and head of State, whom I have the honour to \nrepresent here, I should like to sincerely congratulate \nyou, Sir, on your election as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-third session. You can be assured \nof our full and entire readiness to cooperate to ensure \nthe success of your weighty mission. It is also my \npleasure to pay a well-deserved tribute to your \npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Srgjan Kerim, for the \ntalent and dedication that he showed in guiding our \nwork throughout the sixty-second session. Finally, to \nHis Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of \nthe United Nations, I express my encouragement as he \ncarries out his lofty duties at the head of our \nOrganization. \n The food crisis that is currently raging is \ncharacterized by rising prices for foodstuffs. Its causes \nare both structural and immediate. Indeed, the \npredominance of biofuel crops over subsistence crops \nand the implementation of trade policies based on \nsubsidies and export restrictions have a disastrous \n \n \n35 08-51570 \n \nimpact on food security. The food riots of the second \nhalf of 2008, which have taken place throughout the \nworld \u2014 particularly in Africa \u2014 in response to \nsoaring food prices, reflect a major crisis and express \nthe increased difficulties faced by hundreds of millions \nof people in feeding themselves.  \n One hardly need repeat the words said by  \nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali when, in November 1999, \nhe addressed the thirtieth session of the Conference of \nthe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United \nNations (FAO): \u201cHunger is as unacceptable as war.\u201d It \nis therefore urgent that we make a lasting response to \nthe food crisis by taking collective action at the global \nlevel to halt it and ensure food security for our most \nvulnerable populations.  \n Here, I should like to commend the adoption, on \n5 June 2008, of the Declaration of the High-level \nConference on World Food Security by heads of State \nor Government meeting in Rome. Likewise, at the \nregional level, we welcome the conclusions of the \nregional meeting on the food crisis held on 29 July \n2008 in Kinshasa under the auspices of the Economic \nCommunity of Central African States. At the \ncontinental level, we call for the effective \nimplementation of the July 2003 Maputo Declaration, \nwhich sets out a framework for accelerating \nagricultural development and food security; the 2006 \nAbuja Declaration, which advocates a green revolution \nin Africa; and, more recently, the Sharm el-Sheikh \nDeclaration on the challenges of the increase in food \nprices and agricultural development.  \n It is in that contact that Gabon, like other \ncountries of the South hit by this crisis, has taken \nurgent fiscal and budgetary measures supported by a \nsix-month suspension of import duties and taxes on \nconsumer products and a suspension of the value-added \ntax on such products, causing a substantial loss in \nterms of the State budget.  \n In addition, from a medium- and long-term \nperspective, Gabon is working together with \ninternational partners, in particular FAO and the United \nNations Development Programme (UNDP), to \nimplement its national poverty reduction strategy and \nits special food security programme. The latter \nincorporates aspects related to water management, \nintensifying vegetable production and diversifying and \nincreasing agricultural production. We are prepared to \ngo even further, because we must banish the spectre of \nhunger and malnutrition once and for all. The \nachievement of Millennium Development Goal 1 \ndepends on that.  \n Furthermore, the food crisis poses the problem of \nthe role and place of agriculture in our economies. \nRather than making us overly concerned, it should lead \nus to rethink that sector in order to increase its \ncontribution to the development of our countries. \n The challenge of feeding a planet with a growing \npopulation is closely linked to the environmental issue \nand to climate change. Environmental degradation is \ncharacterized by the degradation of natural resources, \nincluding the growing water shortage, the increase in \narid lands, deforestation and the effects of global \nwarming. All these elements prevent an increase in \nagricultural production that could contribute to a lasting \nsolution to the food crisis. Thus, we must do our utmost \nto significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  \n That is why my country welcomes the road map \nadopted during the negotiations held in Bali, as the \noutcome of the thirteenth session of the Conference of \nthe Parties to the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change. The road map is an \nimportant step towards the formulation of a follow-up \nto the Kyoto Protocol, which is set to expire in 2012. \nHere I should like to commend the recent efforts made \nby the industrialized countries at the Group of Eight \n(G-8) summit held in Hokkaido, Japan, in July 2008, at \nwhich they once again reaffirmed their will to halve \ntheir greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. \n For its part, my country, Gabon, whose forests are \none of the components of the important Congo  \nBasin \u2014 the planet\u2019s second ecological lung, after the \nAmazon \u2014 has acceded without reservation to the \nconventions related to the fight against climate change \nand the preservation of biodiversity. Indeed, we have \ndecided to shoulder our share of the responsibility by \ndevoting 11 per cent of our territory to humankind \nthrough, inter alia, the establishment of 13 national \nparks. Naturally, those efforts require others, in \nparticular the admission of our forests into the carbon-\ntrading mechanisms and the granting of compensatory \nmeasures to African countries by industrialized \ncountries, which are the primary emitters of carbon \ndioxide.  \n Developing countries need the international \ncommunity\u2019s ongoing and substantial support to meet \nthe new challenges that they face. It is thus urgent that \n  \n \n08-51570 36 \n \nall development partners keep their promises, in \nparticular by doubling official development assistance, \nintroducing innovative development financing methods \nand cancelling debt, whose burden undermines our \ndevelopment efforts. \n This appeal also has to do with the varying \nconstraints that weigh on developing countries, \nparticularly HIV/AIDS pandemic, malaria and other \ninfectious diseases that impact their populations and \ntheir economies. In fact, with regard to HIV/AIDS, the \nefforts of African countries to provide universal access \nto prevention, care and treatment by 2010 do not appear \nto be sufficient to eradicate that modern-day scourge. \n The interdependence of the threats confronting \nthe international community highlights more than ever \nthe need to provide a new impetus to the efforts to \npromote solidarity and international peace and security. \nIn a number of regions around the world, tensions and \ndeep crises maintain instability and insecurity, thereby \ninhibiting any chance for development.  \n Specifically with regard to the Israeli-Palestinian \nconflict, we can never emphasize enough that only \nconcerted and thorough efforts based on the principle \nof two States \u2014 Israel and Palestine \u2014 living in peace \nand security within secure and internationally \nrecognized borders will make it possible to bring about \na lasting, just and equitable solution to that conflict. \n In Africa as well there are many hotspots of \ntension that continue to be concern. That is the case \nwith respect to Somalia, where the instability that has \nprevailed for more than 15 years undermines any \nfledgling development. Still, we should commend the \nrecent efforts to promote a political process that would \nbe open to all in that country, in particular reaching the \nagreement signed on 9 June 2008 in Djibouti between \nthe Federal Transition Government and the Alliance for \nthe Reliberation of Somalia under the auspices of the \nUnited Nations, with the support of the African Union. \nOne hopes that that event, which is a true opportunity \ntowards a lasting settlement of that conflict, will lead \nto the deployment of a United Nations peacekeeping \noperation that could help end the chaos that has \nprevailed in that country since 1990. \n The overall security situation in Darfur also \ncontinues to be a source of great concern for the \ninternational community. One should, however, \ncommend and encourage the tenacious efforts \nundertaken in the joint mediation of the African Union \nand the United Nations in carrying out an inclusive \nprocess that would lead to a settlement to the conflict \nin Darfur, which has lasted for a number of years. \n The situation between Chad and the Sudan has \nsparked genuine hope, due to the resumption of dialogue \nbetween those two States within the framework of the \nvarious agreements that they have signed, particularly \nthe Dakar Agreement of 13 March 2008. \n With respect to Central African Republic, we can \nonly commend the meaningful progress made within \nthe framework of the preparations for an inclusive \npolitical dialogue since the first meeting of the follow-\nup committee on peace talks. We encourage the United \nNations and international partners to commit further in \nrebuilding that fraternal country. \n Lastly, with respect to C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Gabon \nwelcomes the progress made in the implementation of \nthe Ouagadougou Agreement and its additional \nagreements. We appeal to the various partners of that \nfraternal country to support those efforts. \n The myriad challenges we have just addressed \ncan be dealt with only through collective actions at the \nglobal level. That is why the heads of State and \nGovernment recognized in the Millennium Declaration \nand reaffirmed in the Outcome Document of the 2005 \nWorld Summit the need to strengthen the United \nNations in order to make it a tool that would allow \nthem to better achieve their priority goals. That is why \nmy country welcomes the fact that since the 2005 \nWorld Summit, most of the major recommendations in \nthe Outcome Document have been implemented in the \nframework of the process of reform of the United \nNations. The establishment of two major bodies \u2014 the \nPeacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights \nCouncil, which have been operational since June \n2006 \u2014 is a perfect demonstration of this.  \n Bolstered by the major progress made, we need to \ncontinue our efforts over the coming sessions to \ncomplete the reform process. For example, we need to \ncomplete the revitalization of the General Assembly, \nthe Organization\u2019s most representative deliberative \nbody. Similarly, consistency in the actions of the \nUnited Nations bodies should be reinforced. From that \nstandpoint, I wish to commend the Delivering as One \ninitiative, which has had encouraging results in the \npilot countries. \n \n \n37 08-51570 \n \n Regarding reform in the Security Council, we \nneed to commend the tireless efforts of the different \nPresidents of the General Assembly, which have made \nit possible to complete the process of consultations that \nshould lead to the beginning of intergovernmental \nnegotiations by 31 January 2009, at the latest. The \nbuilding of a more just and secure world that would \nmeet the deep aspirations of our peoples depends on \nthat. "

        "file_text": "I would like first to \ncongratulate Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann on his \nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-third session, as well as to thank Mr. Srgjan \nKerim for the excellent work he did during his \npresidency of the General Assembly in the preceding \nyear. \n As we gather here once again to address the most \nsignificant issues on the global agenda, the General \nAssembly opening session reminds us of our shared \nvision of the United Nations as the embodiment of a \nfamily of nations.  \n It reminds us of the constant need for an effective \nmultilateral effort to address global challenges, and to \nmaintain and build peace in a range of conflict zones \nand post-conflict societies, searching for solutions \nwithin the rule-based international order, through the \npromotion of freedom, democracy, development and \nrespect for human rights. \n It also gives us the opportunity to take stock of \nour achievements, as well as to redouble our \ncommitment to world peace and progress. \n This is a commitment that Croatia and its people \naccepted even before our independence: a commitment \nto strengthen international cooperation through \neffective multilateral organizations for advancing \npeace and security, facilitating development and \ncombating poverty, protecting our environment, \neradicating diseases and promoting public health. \n As a renewal of that commitment, we celebrate \nthis year the 120th anniversary of the birth of the \nfamous Croat, Dr. Andrija \u0160tampar, a founding father \nof the World Health Organization (WHO) and the first \nPresident of the WHO Assembly. In his inaugural \nspeech in 1948, Dr. \u0160tampar clearly stated that the \n \n \n11 08-52265 \n \nOrganization should become a pioneer of world peace \nand promote understanding among nations. \n Dr. \u0160tampar\u2019s words are also true for the broader \nfamily of United Nations institutions. His words are a \ntestimony to the lasting commitment of Croatia and its \npeople to the promotion of peace through international \ncooperation. \n Since our independence, Croatia\u2019s leaders have \ncome every year before this Assembly to renew this \nsolemn commitment. Even in the most difficult of \ntimes, when our own existence was in peril and \ncollective security guarantees vanished, we still came \nto New York to express Croatia\u2019s adherence to the \nvalues enshrined in the Charter. \n Croatia has come a long way since those testing \ndays of struggle. Yet our determination in pursuing the \nCharter principles has remained intact. \n We have developed a stable democracy and a \ngrowing economy, but we have not forgotten those \nbrave men and women who struggled for and achieved \nour independence, as well as those men and women of \ngoodwill who, under the flag of the United Nations, \nassisted us in our time of need. \n With that conviction and determination, with that \nsincere sense of gratitude and a genuine vocation for \ncooperation, I come today before the Assembly to \nshare with it Croatia\u2019s views on the most pressing and \nrelevant issues for our international community. \n On this occasion, though, Croatia is for the first \ntime in a position to address these issues from a \ndifferent angle \u2014 that of an elected member of the \nSecurity Council. Membership of the Security Council \nis not only a great honour for Croatia, but also a great \nresponsibility we have been preparing for in recent \nyears. \n(spoke in French)  \n Over the past decade, Croatia has completed a \ntransformative journey that may without exaggeration \nbe described as impressive. Since the war-torn early \n1990s it has emerged as an anchor of stability, security \nand cooperation in South-East Europe.  \n Croatia is today at the doorstep of the European \nUnion. We are determined to conclude the accession \nnegotiations in 2009, thus completing a demanding \nprocess of profound political, economic and social \nreforms. \n Our European vocation has guided us in the \ntesting period of our transition, and it will continue to \nguide us once Croatia becomes a full member of the \nEuropean Union. \n(spoke in English) \n We attach equal importance to our membership of \nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and \nwe look forward to the celebration of our accession to \nthe alliance at the next summit in spring 2009, which \nwill also mark NATO\u2019s sixtieth anniversary. \n Through reforms, we have successfully turned \nour country from a consumer to a net contributor to \ninternational peace and security. Today, Croatian forces \nare engaged in 13 United Nations peacekeeping \noperations in four different continents. Our men and \nwomen in uniform also serve in the NATO-led \noperation in Afghanistan and the European Union \noperation in Chad, in accordance with the relevant \nSecurity Council resolutions. \n In all these conflict areas, our service men and \nwomen have proved their dedication and \nprofessionalism. However, probably their most \nvaluable contribution is their ability to share with the \nlocal population Croatia\u2019s own experience in \novercoming the consequences of war and taking the \nroad of reconciliation, cooperation and development. \n As a member of the Security Council, Croatia \nwill continue to work as a responsible and dedicated \npartner in the common effort to maintain and build \npeace through the promotion of human rights and \ndemocracy, the fight for the eradication of poverty and \ninjustice, and the advancement of effective \nmultilateralism. \n In this Croatia will be guided by a sense of \nresponsibility, solidarity and good faith. We hold that \neffective multilateral action, including with regional \norganizations, is our best guarantee in safeguarding \nthese values. \n While we see progress in advancing these values \nin some troubled areas of our world, such as \nAfghanistan, Iraq and the Middle East, we have also \nwitnessed other conflicts arising, such as in Georgia. \n In this respect, we welcome the six-point \nagreement brokered by the European Union presidency \nand President Sarkozy in August, as well as the \nimplementing agreement from September. \n  \n \n08-52265 12 \n \n We are also aware that the failure to address these \nissues in a multilateral context of cooperation could \nlead us into old paradigms of confrontation. At the \nsame time, the lack of audacity to confront them could \nendanger the democratic gains obtained with the end of \nthe cold war. These gains should be preserved, as they \nthemselves derive from the fundamental principles \nemanating from the Charter. \n We should not forget that the United Nations \nstands for the common fundamental values of freedom, \nequality, solidarity, tolerance and respect for human \nrights. In this regard, the suffering of the people of the \nSudan, particularly in Darfur, and the suffering of the \npeople in Somalia and Myanmar are also stark \nreminders of the gap between the goals this \nOrganization has set and the realities on the ground. \n My country welcomes joint international efforts \nto address the question of flagrant violations of \ninternational humanitarian law and human rights \nthrough established international mechanisms and \ninstitutions like the International Criminal Court (ICC). \nThe ICC provides a vital recourse to justice in \nsituations where national Governments cannot or will \nnot address these issues themselves. \n Human rights and the rule of law are essential \nbuilding blocks for a more peaceful, just and \nprosperous world. This year we are marking the \nsixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights. As a member of the Security Council, \nmy country is dedicated to advancing these rights to \nthose most vulnerable in conflict: civilians, notably \nwomen and children. \n We are pleased that this year the Council adopted \na strong and action-oriented resolution addressing the \ndisturbing practice of sexual violence as a method of \nwarfare.  \n We also continue to work on advancing the cause \nof preventing children becoming part of armed \nconflicts, believing that the realities on the ground \nrequire stronger Council involvement. For this and \nmany other reasons, Croatia has decided to present its \ncandidature for membership in the Human Rights \nCouncil for the period 2010-2013. \n We live in a world that has significantly redefined \nthe traditional notion of threats to international peace \nand security. In an increasingly interconnected world, \nglobal threats are taking many forms. \n Terrorism, poverty, disease, climate change, \nenvironmental degradation and rising food prices \ncommand that we work together, as only a common \nvision and collective action, implemented in the spirit \nof solidarity and responsibility, can counter these \nchallenges. \n Terrorism attempts to undermine the core values \nof the modern world and poses a serious challenge to \nour security, the basic principles of democratic \nsocieties and the rights and freedoms of our citizens. \nTerrorist acts are criminal in nature and cannot be \njustified under any circumstances. Croatia appreciates \nand fully supports all efforts in the global struggle \nagainst terrorism, within the United Nations system \nand beyond. \n Since the beginning of this year, my country has \nbeen chairing the Security Council Counter-Terrorism \nCommittee, which was established in the immediate \naftermath of the devastating terrorist attacks against the \nUnited States and the whole democratic world on \n11 September 2001. We have assumed this \nresponsibility with the utmost seriousness and are \nworking towards moving the Committee forward by \nfocusing on concrete results and achieving realistic \nobjectives. \n I would also like to reiterate the importance \nCroatia attaches to the Global Counter-Terrorism \nStrategy as one of the primary international documents \nin the global fight against terrorism. Croatia is also \nactive on the regional level, presiding over the \nCommittee of Experts on Terrorism (CODEXTER) \nwithin the Council of Europe. \n In overcoming global threats and challenges, \ninitiatives such as the Alliance of Civilizations can also \nact as a stimulus, augmenting mutual respect, \nunderstanding and cooperation among States and \npeoples across cultures and religions. As the Alliance\u2019s \nmain goal is to counter intolerance, religious \nfundamentalism and extremism, Croatia is pleased to \nbe a part of this ever-growing group. \n Our dialogue and cooperation should also be \ndirected with more emphasis at combating poverty and \nestablishing a global partnership for development. In \nthis regard, my country welcomes the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s leadership in calling for action to make \nprogress for the poorest of the poor, the so-called \nbottom billion. \n \n \n13 08-52265 \n \n We also believe that it is essential for \nGovernments to support the delivery of commitments \nmade, with the aim of getting the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals back on track. Specific \narrangements between donor and recipient countries on \nthe implementation of the Millennium Development \nGoals should be put into action through a human-\ncentred approach to the key themes of the Goals, or \nmore precisely health and education, the environment \nand the eradication of poverty. \n In this sense, we recognize the importance of \nmobilizing financial resources for development, as well \nas their effective use in developing countries. The \nMonterrey Consensus remains the foundation of the \nglobal partnership for development, and Croatia \nbelieves in a positive outcome of the review conference \nto take place in Doha later this year. In this context, \nCroatia will honour the obligations and figures \nestablished pursuant to its status as a candidate for \nmembership in the European Union. \n Through its transition process Croatia has \nemerged from being a recipient country to being a \ncountry whose own experience and resources have \nenabled it to become an international donor. As a \ncontributor to various United Nations funds and \nprogrammes, Croatia has confirmed its capability to \nsupport the activities of the United Nations in \nnumerous fields, and will continue to do so through \nsharing our experiences and assisting those in need. \n However, while Croatia increases its contribution \nto global progress and takes a more assertive role in the \ninternational arena, it also remains active in, and \ncommitted to, fostering stability in South-East Europe. \nOur membership in the Security Council and our \nadvanced phase of integration in the North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union \nhas not led us to turn our back on our neighbours. On \nthe contrary, it has enabled us to redouble our efforts in \npreserving stability and maximizing the benefits of \npeace. \n Through initiatives such as the establishment of \nthe Regional Cooperation Council (RCC), \nheadquartered in Sarajevo and with a top Croatian \ndiplomat, Mr. Hido Biscevic, as its first Secretary \nGeneral, we have actively contributed to regional \nstability. \n However, there is still unfinished business in our \nneighbouring region. Let me mention one example: \nBosnia and Herzegovina. The foundations for stability \nin that country reside in respect for equal rights for all \nthree constituent and sovereign people: Croats, \nBosniaks and Serbs. \n The Republic of Croatia stands ready, along with \nthe international community, to support and assist \nBosnia and Herzegovina, as well as all the other \ncountries in the region, through an active policy of \ncooperation. \n Such cooperation paves the way for long-standing \nsecurity and prosperity in South-East Europe. And in \nthat way Croatia will continue to back the Euro-\nAtlantic aspirations of all its neighbours. In that way \nmy country will renew its determination to foster \npeace, democracy and tolerance, thus honouring our \ncommitment to the Charter. \n Last April, in this very Hall, His Holiness Pope \nBenedict XVI reminded us that: \n \u201cThe founding principles of the Organization \u2014 \nthe desire for peace, the quest for justice, respect \nfor the dignity of the person, humanitarian \ncooperation and assistance \u2014 express the just \naspirations of the human spirit and constitute the \nideals which should underpin international \nrelations.\u201d (A/62/PV.95, p. 3) \n We should always remember these ideals as we \ncontinue to work together on exploiting the full \npotential of the United Nations in creating a more \npeaceful, prosperous and democratic world."

        "file_text": "The attachment \nthat Thailand has had to the ideals and principles that \ngave birth to the United Nations is long, enduring and \nnatural. From the very first day in this family of \nnations more than 60 years ago, Thailand, or Siam at \nthat time, made known to all that we stood for peace, \nfor freedom and for tolerance, because peace, freedom \nand tolerance are part of our national character \u2014 a \npart of who we are. Today, our commitment to peace, \nfreedom and tolerance anywhere and everywhere \nremains unwavering, and it will remain so. \n Therefore, I warmly congratulate Mr. Miguel \nd\u2019Escoto Brockmann, a man of peace, freedom and \ntolerance, on his election as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-third session. His cause is our \ncause, and he can rest assured that the Thai delegation \nwill give him its full support and cooperation. \n We are living in a world of enormous \nopportunities for progress. But we are also living in a \nworld that is in a state of flux, a world that is drifting \nfrom one crisis to another. The information technology \nrevolution and transportation advancements have \nbrought people from all corners of the world closer \ntogether than ever before. We are now living in a \nglobal village, but, sadly, this village is not united as \none. This village is deeply divided along political, \neconomic, social, racial, religious and cultural lines. \nThat is not sustainable; it is not healthy. It should not \nbe allowed to go on. All of us have a stake in this. We \nmust not take those divisions for granted or as a given, \nbecause they are not. \n We need to reclaim the ideal that brought us \ntogether in this place: the ideal of \u201cWe the peoples\u201d. \nWe need to cultivate and nurture a \u201cwe\u201d feeling among \nus. We must try our best to focus on what binds us \ntogether rather than on what keeps us apart. We must \nbe fully aware that to continue to see the world through \nthe glasses of \u201cus versus them\u201d can only lead to \nconfrontation. And confrontation helps no one, \nbecause, at the end of the day, in this interconnected \nglobalized world, no one wins everything, but \neveryone can lose everything. As Mahatma Gandhi \nonce admonished, \u201cAn eye for an eye, and soon the \nwhole world is blind\u201d. \n We have a choice between progress and self-\ndestruction, between cooperation and confrontation, \nand between amity and animosity. The choice is for all \nof us to make, and the choice is clear. There is no \nbetter alternative to progress, cooperation and amity \namong nations and peoples. \n The Thai people have made their choice. It is for \ndemocracy. The challenge now in Thailand, as in other \ncountries around the world, is to find the right balance \nbetween the political culture and the desire for \ndemocratic ideals. Nurturing a democratic culture in \nany country takes time and requires an appreciation of \nthe fact that it is an evolutionary process in which ups \n  \n \n08-53141 28 \n \nand downs are to be expected. Thailand\u2019s democratic \nevolution is no exception. \n What is unique about the present state of political \nevolution in Thailand is the consistent expression of \nour national character: we stand for peace, for freedom \nand for tolerance. Indeed, Thai political developments \nhave made a lot of headlines lately. But we trust that \ngood eyes and informed minds will not mistake recent \nevents for the trajectory of a nation. Thai people are \nresilient people. The Thai society is a resilient society. \nAnd Thai people and Thai society are determined to \nmove ahead along the democratic path. \n The world has made a choice with respect to \ndevelopment. That choice is embodied in the \nMillennium Declaration and the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). We are now midway \ntowards 2015, the target year for their realization. \nWhile there have been many remarkable and \nencouraging success stories of progress so far \u2014 in \nreducing poverty, hunger and disease, to name a few \u2014 \nthere are also unremarkable and discouraging stories of \nsetbacks. For far too many countries, the realization of \nthe MDGs by 2015 has become increasingly difficult to \nachieve. Thailand therefore is pleased to see the \ninternational community coming together as one in its \ndetermination to work harder to help people in each \nand every country enjoy the fruits of developmental \nprogress and well-being. \n To help one another to have a better life is a \nmoral imperative as well as a practical necessity. Can \nanyone afford to live happily and sleep soundly on an \nisland of opulence in the middle of a sea of poverty and \ndespair? Certainly, the answer is no. It is after all in the \nenlightened self-interest of every country to ensure that \nthe MDG targets are met \u2014 as many and as soon as \npossible. \n Our unity as \u201cWe the peoples\u201d is all the more \nimportant in the face of the perfect storm that is the \nglobal oil crisis, food crisis and financial crisis. These \nmultiple crises threaten to derail the achievements of \nthe MDGs or even to undo hard-won gains of the past \nin many countries. Developing countries need stability \nand security in the world energy market. Every dollar \nhike resulting from speculation on oil price futures \nbeing traded on futures market floors means \ndevelopment costs for the Governments of developing \ncountries and affects the livelihoods of ordinary people \naround the world. \n But in every crisis, there exists an opportunity. \nThe exponential rise in oil prices has made it necessary \nfor countries to adapt their patterns of consumption and \nto rethink their energy security strategies. The global \noil crisis has not spared Thailand: our people have been \nadversely affected by the skyrocketing oil prices in \nalmost every aspect of their lives. \n At the same time, Thailand has learned to adapt \nand adjust. Energy efficiency and the development of \nalternative energy sources, such as liquefied gas, \nbiofuels and gasohol, are now being pursued with \ngreater urgency. Because of the global oil crisis, more \nand more vehicles in Thailand today have been shifted \nto various sources of alternative energy. This market \nfor alternative energy is booming in Thailand and \nacross Asia. There is so much potential in this market, \nand Thailand stands ready to work together with our \nfriends from around the world in all endeavours \npertaining to research in and development of \nalternative energy. \n Developing countries need stability and security \nin the world food market. In addressing these \nchallenges, we should not forget that the current food \ncrisis has had multiple causes, such as the global oil \ncrisis, drought and flooding. To be effective, any \nattempt to address this world food crisis must be \ncomprehensive and concerted. It must look at the short-\nterm imperative of keeping the supply flowing in the \nworld market while working towards the longer-term \nimperative of stabilizing food prices and enhancing \nproductivity. \n As a rice bowl of the world, Thailand will \ncontinue to ensure a constant supply to the world rice \nmarket. We will continue to work with other countries \nto enhance productivity and ensure food security. In the \npast, we had an industrial revolution and an \ninformation technology revolution. Now, we believe, is \nthe time for the next revolution: a green revolution. We \nwill continue to work with countries around the world \nto ensure an open international food market and \nestablish agricultural trade rules that help the world\u2019s \npoor farmers and shore up food security in developing \ncountries. To that end, the Doha Development Round \nshould resume as soon as possible. \n Developing countries also need stability and \nsecurity in the world financial markets. The current \nturmoil in the world financial markets, if not \neffectively addressed soon, threatens to cause \n \n \n29 08-53141 \n \nwidespread economic downturns than could push \nmillions below the poverty line and severely affect the \nachievement of the MDGs. To have the world financial \ncrisis piling on top of the world energy and food crises \nis the last thing that people in the developing countries \nwant to see. That is particularly true for people in \nThailand and across Asia. Our painful experience has \ntaught us how phenomena such as those that started off \nas a financial crisis in 1997 can spiral into a \nmultifaceted crisis that drove millions of people into \nabject poverty and despair, strained the social fabric of \nsocieties and created social tensions that developed \ninto political ones. \n We who lived through those dark days do not \nwant to see a repeat of this type of crisis again. All \ncountries therefore have a high stake in the current \nfinancial turmoil. We must work together, and quickly, \nto arrest the downward spiralling effects before it is too \nlate. \n Besides the perfect storm of this year\u2019s world \nenergy, food and financial crises, South-East Asia has \nwitnessed a massive storm in the form of Cyclone \nNargis, which struck Myanmar in May. Nargis was the \nmost devastating cyclone ever to hit Myanmar. Many \nlives were lost and many livelihoods were severely \naffected. But Nargis was not an isolated case. In the \npast few years, we have witnessed a changing climate \npattern that has produced successive monster storms \nand severe weather in all corners of the world. Ice at \nthe North and South Poles is melting at a frightening \nspeed. Sea level is rising steadily and threatens to \nengulf low-lying areas around the world. Drought has \nincreased, and many areas, once arable, have turned \ninto desert. \n We can no longer turn our eyes away from the \ngathering threats posed by climate change. These \nthreats recognize no political boundaries. Large and \nsmall, powerful and weak, we are all bound together by \nour common vulnerability and a common destiny as \nresidents of planet Earth. We therefore have a \ncollective responsibility on this issue. \n The choice is clear and has been made. When the \nworld gathered to discuss climate change at the Bali \nConference in December last year, the world chose \ncollective responsibility over collective irresponsibility. \nThailand will spare no effort to work actively with all \nparties to ensure that the journey that started under the \nBali road map last year can be realized at the \nCopenhagen conference scheduled for next year. This \nis a critical time that requires critical action by all \nparties. Time is simply not on our side. \n There is a saying that, in every storm, every \ncloud has a silver lining. That is true for the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), of \nwhich Thailand is a member. Faced with the challenge \nof the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis, ASEAN had to \nmake a choice between doing nothing and losing its \ncredibility, or doing something and being seen as a \nforce to be reckoned with. ASEAN chose the latter. \nActing as a bridge between Myanmar and the \ninternational community, ASEAN has successfully \nforged a working tripartite partnership between \nASEAN, Myanmar and the United Nations. That \npartnership has continued to work effectively to this \nday and could serve as a model for future humanitarian \npartnerships in other parts of the world. Through that \nprocess, ASEAN has once again proven its \neffectiveness and resilience. \n ASEAN has also made another choice \u2014 an \nimportant and profound one. ASEAN is moving \ntowards being a rules-based and people-centred \norganization, with the signing of the ASEAN Charter \nthis past year. The upcoming fourteenth ASEAN \nSummit will take place in Bangkok under the theme \n\u201cASEAN Charter for ASEAN peoples\u201d to mark a new \nera for ASEAN, with people at the heart of our \ncooperation. As Chairman of ASEAN, Thailand has \nlaunched a \u201cthree Rs\u201d campaign. First, we want to \nrealize the purposes and vision of the Charter. That \nincludes the realization of an ASEAN human rights \nbody, one of the new organs envisaged in our Charter. \nSecondly, we will revitalize the people-centred nature \nof our community in order to enhance their \nparticipation in building an ASEAN community. \nThirdly, we will reinforce ASEAN cooperation to \nbetter contribute to the well-being of our peoples, \nespecially in the areas of human development and \nsecurity. \n Thailand will carry forward the work of the \nprevious ASEAN Chair, Singapore, to realize the \ndream of the ASEAN founding fathers of transforming \nSouth-East Asia from a community of good neighbours \ninto one ASEAN community, where the feeling of \u201cwe \nthe peoples of ASEAN\u201d takes root. The world will \nbenefit from having a more rules-based, effective, \npredictable and people-centred ASEAN as a partner. \nThrough greater integration with the regional countries \n  \n \n08-53141 30 \n \nin Asia, ASEAN can become a natural bridge that \nconnects China and India, the two emerging global \neconomic centres of the twenty-first century, with a \ncombined market size of billions of people. We believe \nthat it is not too much or too far-fetched to see a new, \nmodern silk road passing through ASEAN. \n Allow me to conclude the same way I started. We \nneed to reclaim the ideals of \u201cWe the peoples of the \nUnited Nations\u201d in order to work together, to resolve \nour common problems and to survive. It has never been \nmore imperative for the Members of this Organization \nto put aside for a moment our narrow self-interest and \ncome together to forge solutions that are in the interest \nof us all. The United Nations can only be what the \ncollective membership wishes it to be. \u201cWe the peoples \nof the United Nations\u201d have a choice to make. \n Let what one astronaut gazing at planet Earth \nfrom a space station once said serve to remind us all of \nour collective responsibility: \n \u201cFor those who have seen the Earth from \nspace, and for the hundreds and perhaps \nthousands more who will, the experience most \ncertainly changes your perspective. The things \nthat we share in our world are far more valuable \nthan those which divide us.\u201d "

        "file_text": "On \nbehalf of the nation of Paraguay, I wish to express to \nyou, Mr. President, my most sincere congratulations on \nyour election to preside over the General Assembly at \nits sixty-third session. I wish you every success. \n This is a place where every year the Powers of \nthe world write history that should transcend mere \nlofty political prose and be a tool for verse \u2014 the \npoetry of eliminating hunger, embracing equity among \nnations and building a better world for all. I believe \nthat, one day, these enormous buildings \u2014 which were \nbuilt with the aim of preventing war \u2014 will be \nincreasingly dedicated to providing bread, eradicating \nhunger and malnutrition throughout the world and \nsaving millions of lives from disease and violence of \nall kinds. \n After 61 years of single-party Government and \nfor the first time in my country\u2019s political history, a \nparty has come to power via the ballot \u2014 the \nappropriate means under the democratic code. \nParaguay is soaring on the winds of democratic change \nthat are blowing through the region. The new \nGovernment that I represent is an unequivocal response \nto the many needs that have arisen and opportunities \nthat have been lost in recent decades. This year, \ncitizens voted for greater social justice, to halt the \n \n \n7 08-51749 \n \nmassive destruction of the environment, and to combat \nthe corruption, shady dealings and favouritism of a \nweakened and opportunistic State that delayed the \nimplementation of a sustainable and inclusive \ndevelopment strategy for years. \n The new administration represents the end of our \n19-year transition to democracy and has embarked on \nreform of the State and the economy. It has encouraged \ncitizens to participate in the political decision-making \nprocess. We understand that political and economic \nstability is not more important than social stability. \nThat is why we are committed to applying social \npolicies to combat extreme poverty. We cannot hope \nfor sustainable development when the market and the \nState deny opportunities to the weakest, nor is it \npossible to sustain democracy when the vast majority \nare excluded from enjoying economic benefits. We \ntherefore believe in economic growth with social \nequity and in environmental responsibility as the very \nheart of our public policies.  \n Paraguay has opened a door of opportunity to the \nworld. Two weeks ago, before we had come to the end \nof our first month in power, my Government launched \na major assault on illicit Government management. The \nmafias that enjoyed shameful and excessive wealth \nthrough their influence on public power are enduring \nthe worst moment of their history in Paraguay. We do \nnot rule out the possibility of stripping the ill-gotten \ngains from those whom scandalous wealth made \nmillionaires overnight and are now digging in their \nheels and even hatching specific plots to foment \npolitical and economic instability. The political \nholdovers in Paraguay still cling to a fascistic style of \npatronage, to which my Government has responded \nfirmly but calmly. We will show zero tolerance for any \nanti-democratic activity and close our doors to all \nblackmail and any attempt to revive outdated models of \naccess to power.  \n The new Government, which came to power on \n15 August, has been proactive in a historic show of \nsolidarity with the democratic peoples of Latin \nAmerica and in its rapid response in defence of \ndemocratically elected Governments, such as in the \nsister Republic of Bolivia, in the context of the Union \nof South American Nations. We also thank those \nbrotherly countries that stood with us in the face of \npotential instability and have expressed their concern \nfor and solidarity with the Paraguayan process.  \n The only way to build economic relations has \nbeen through a market mechanism which sold Latin \nAmerica on the financial speculation of the 1980s that \nsunk our continent in debt, sidelined the role of the \nState and widened the gap between rich and poor. That \nmechanism, which was forced upon us, has proven to \nbe wrong-headed and very costly for our peoples on \nthe social level. \n Today, we are seeing a financial crisis in \ndeveloped economies as a result of immoral \nspeculation that also affects the well-being of peoples. \nThe sole motive behind such speculation is the desire \nfor greater wealth that privatizes benefits and \nsocializes the costs of unregulated market economies.  \n Paraguay is in favour of strengthening the \nGeneral Assembly and restoring its mandated attributes \nand functions under the United Nations Charter. As the \nmost representative body of the Organization, the \nAssembly must become a true world parliament in \nwhich the major issues affecting humankind can be \ndiscussed and are not relegated to other bodies whose \ndecision-making process is confined to a small number \nof countries that often fail to take the opinion of the \nmajority of the membership into account. \n Paraguay believes that the problems that have led \nto climate change call for short- and long-term world \nresponses in line with the most recent scientific \nadvances and applied in a fashion that is compatible \nwith the economic and social development of each \ncountry affected. Countries with economies in \ndevelopment suffer in particular from vulnerability and \nisolation as they attempt to enter the globalized market.  \n Ironically, it is the poorest \u2014 those who are the \nleast responsible for climate change \u2014 who suffer \nmost from its consequences. When it comes to major \nresponsibility, we often note the irony of conservation \nmeasures imposed on areas of the world that are \nalready suffering from poverty and exclusion. At the \nsame time, we note the sustained indifference and \nlimited capacities for self-criticism in the political \nrealms that manage the fate of the world. That is \nprecisely where the principal industrial and \nconsumption phenomena arise, creating societies that, \ndue to the irresponsibility of their leaders, persist in \ndepleting their own resources, their own lands, their \nown dreams and their own lives.  \n Paraguay therefore calls on countries to recognize \ntheir shared but differentiated responsibilities. We \n  \n \n08-51749 8 \n \nstress the need for all members of the international \ncommunity to act on their pledges. The same is true in \ndetermining political and economic responsibility for \nthe deterioration of the world \u2014 the irreplaceable \nhome of humankind.  \n At the same high level as our concern for the \nstructural and immediate causes of poverty is our \nconcern for the situation of indigenous peoples. Not \nonly are they poor and excluded, but in many regions \nof the continent they have not reached a level of civic \ninclusion that permits them to be involved in decision-\nmaking processes. In many cases, those who uphold a \ndiscourse of inclusion are intolerant when our \nindigenous brothers take on political leadership roles.  \n The indigenous nations of Latin America are not \nthe ancient creation of our continent, but the most vital \npotential for political action, which we must respect, \npromote and include. If we did not, that would be an \nintolerable attack against our own civilization. America \nmust wake up in the face of all of that.  \n We need to account for the old debt, which began \nto accrue in the filthy bowels of the slave ships and \ncontinued to grow with every gesture of disdain \ntowards any indigenous attempt to have their say, their \nvote, their dreams and their plans for the land that at \none time was theirs alone. Recognizing indigenous \npeoples as participants in the political and participatory \nprocesses of the State is still a pending issue, and it is a \nsad expression of intolerance in many regions.  \n In Paraguay, we have begun a process of \ntransparency that has no precedents. The media are \nplaying a fundamental role in this process. They were \nvery proactive in combating corruption in Paraguay, \nand today, because of their questioning of our \nmanagement, they are working at a high standard to \ngenerate ongoing self-criticism. As we guarantee the \nmost unconditional support for enlightened \nmanagement in journalism, self-expression and the \nright to access information, we seek to open up better \nhorizons for the communications and education media, \nwhich had always been persecuted or dismissed as of \nno importance in our country.  \n We must work to build a more just world through \nsocial engineering. It is time to go beyond statements \nthat are incapable of showing clear signs of progress in \nthe fight against poverty and exclusion. The world\u2019s \nforums for debate and reflection cause strain and risk \nlosing credibility if they do not lead to actions that can \ndraw a smile on the faces of unemployed youths who \nhave no future. It is sad to see migrants who wander in \nan incessant exodus of biblical proportions, or to see \nwomen who are relegated to a secondary position by a \nculture and a civilization unable to recover the original \ndignity that belongs to them, who give life, affection, \ncreativity and courage to change the world.  \n We need to highlight food security by ensuring \nnot only space and opportunities for self-managed \nproduction, but also its cultural, sovereign and national \nidentity dimensions. We are calling for greater, better \nand more timely international assistance for \nagricultural and fishing production in order to ensure \nincreasing food production without destroying the \nenvironment and avoiding the current rise in food \nprices. Those costs end up punishing primarily the \nmost vulnerable groups. On the global scale, we call \nupon nations that are heading huge agricultural projects \nto recognize the tribulations of small local producers, \nwho often are crushed by new models that are \narrogantly imposed on them.  \n The question of landlocked developing countries \nis a fundamental issue in Paraguay\u2019s foreign policy. \nThe disadvantages and asymmetries that that \ngeographic situation has generated and continues to \ngenerate can be remedied only through international \nrecognition and the granting of special, differentiated \ntreatment in the country\u2019s insertion into a globalized \nworld.  \n Paraguay believes that the upcoming midterm \nreview meeting of the Almaty Programme of Action is \nextremely important. It is an opportunity to consolidate \nachievements made so far and to ensure greater \ncommitment from international bodies and from more \ndeveloped countries. Working together in a coordinated \nmatter will help landlocked developing countries \novercome their limitations.  \n In Paraguay, large corporations \u2014 the Itaipu with \nBrazil and the Yasyreta with Argentina \u2014 offer \nabundant and available electric energy. Our \nGovernment is committed to prioritizing and using \nthese renewable resources for economic and social \ndevelopment of the country in such a manner as to \ncomplement our efforts to create better sources of \nwork, more production and a reduction of poverty. We \nare operating in a framework of increasingly fluid \ndialogue with our brotherly countries, with which we \nshare those power stations, so that the benefits can \n \n \n9 08-51749 \n \nrepair the social debts deserving our attention and \nbecome true factors for economic growth. \n Taking into account the upcoming review of the \nfinancing for development process, which will take \nplace in Doha at the end of the year, Paraguay calls for \nthe international community to mobilize its external \nresources to provide decisive support for the \ndevelopment of small economies. That is a priority \nboth for both international financial bodies and  \ndeveloped economies. We would like the call for just \ninternational trade to become a true impetus for \ndevelopment.  \n Many of our countries have communities in \nvarious places in the world. Just like Europeans who in \nthe past century came to America, today many friends \nand families from our regions seek better prospects in \nthe countries of Europe and in North America. We call \nupon the humanitarian, brotherly, hospitable sense \u2014 \nthe same that our continent showed in the past in \nsharing its scarce resources \u2014 in nations that today \ntake in our migrants, who are dreaming of having a job \nand the right to a dignified life, far from their \ncountries. The human dimension of that drama calls for \na frank dialogue with receiving countries to find a \nsolution to this new drama of globalization. \n The Republic of Paraguay believes that, although \nprogress has been made towards the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), we cannot deny the \nexistence of the inequalities that persist in the \ndeveloped world. Millions of people continue to live in \nextreme poverty, a situation that is worsened by the \nsudden increase in the cost of food and fuel and the \nconsequences of climate change. \n In order to achieve the MDGs by 2015, we are \ncalling for strengthening the combined efforts of \nGovernments, civil society organizations and the \nprivate sector in the context of a global alliance for \nstronger and more effective development, increasing \nofficial development assistance for the most vulnerable \neconomies in particular.  \n We must not forget the thousands of millions of \nhuman beings worldwide who live below the poverty \nline. In our Latin American subcontinent, poverty has \nrisen to 44 per cent of the population. In Paraguay, \n35.6 per cent of our citizens suffer from this scourge, \nand of those almost 20 per cent live below the line of \nextreme poverty. Malnutrition now affects four out of \nevery 100 Paraguayan children. This situation is \nunacceptable and demands a radical change in the \napproach taken to combat this state of affairs. The most \ndisadvantaged, those who remain in the sidelines of \ndevelopment are the ones we must listen to, and \nalleviating their suffering must be our priority.  \n Today more than ever, Paraguay requires \ninternational cooperation in achieving its socio-\neconomic priorities, in developing and strengthening \nits institutions and in providing preferential attention to \nthe most vulnerable sectors. We hope that the opening \nof developing countries will favour the most \ndisadvantaged and that the same restrictions demanded \nin the development of more developed economies will \nnot be applied.  \n We believe that this will be a vital tool for \nstrengthening developing countries. That is why \nParaguay signed the constitution of the Bank of the \nSouth and will continue to support the strengthening of \nthat institution so that it can meet its objectives of \nfinancing the balanced and stable economic and social \ndevelopment of its member States, promoting \nmacroeconomic stability and strengthening integration \nin order to set the foundation for regional and financial \nautonomy. However, that does not mean that we no \nlonger require the support, resources and cooperation \nof the most developed countries for the two modes of \ncooperation are complementary for development.  \n Paraguay believes that the international \ncommunity should ensure that the mobilization of \nexternal resources becomes a priority for international \nfinancial bodies and the developed economies. To that \nend, we must regain the level of expansion of official \ndevelopment assistance, which in recent years has been \nshrinking in a disturbing fashion. \n Terrorism must be eradicated from the face of the \nEarth. There is nothing more dangerous to the unity of \ncivilization than terrorism as a fact of daily life: the \nterrorism that kills children through hunger; the \nterrorism of weapons anywhere; the terrorism that \naffects children in my country who die because of toxic \nproduce; the terrorism that killed our brothers in the \nTwin Towers, which will continue to kill as long as war \nremains a business for a few and fanaticism continues \nto cloud our hearts. \n I know that love is a word not frequently used in \npolitical discourse, but there is no other way to rebuild \na world so disfigured by hate. We must not forget \nindividuals who, for various physical and mental \n  \n \n08-51749 10 \n \nreasons, have special capacities. Those are our dearest \nbrothers and sisters in a world that often excludes those \nwho cannot compete in terms of physical strength or \nthought. We must create conditions to enable them to \nshare in our everyday lives without suffering the \nburden of exclusion or indifference. Our efforts to \nsupport that sector of the population need not be \nextraordinary but should be carried out in daily actions, \nrich in sharing and informed by an awareness of \nbrotherhood and nature.  \n In this globalized world where things happen so \nquickly and communication is immediate, we see \nclearly its greatest technological advancements, its \npowerful financial architecture and its scientific plans \nto colonize the universe, but, we have to ask ourselves, \nwhere has the human being been left in all of this?  \n Men and women must always remain at the centre \nof that scenario. The only thing that will save us from \npost-modern savagery is if they recover their place \nfrom which no one should ever have been exiled. \nHumanity is the only value shared, without a single \ndifference, by a child dying of hunger in a developing \ncountry and a child who eats breakfast every day in a \ndeveloped country.  \n Paraguay is a small country in the world, but it \nbelieves in friendship. That is why we have set 30 July \nas the Day of Friendship. We hope that this initiative \nwill resonate in various regions of the world and that \nfriendship, with its values and its principles, sooner \nrather than later will replace the hostility which is so \npresent in our times."

        "file_text": "I am delighted, Sir, \nto congratulate you on your assumption of the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \nsession. Your election to that high office is indeed a \nclear reflection of the strong confidence and trust that \nthe international community has in you personally, and \nalso in your great country, Nicaragua. I am confident \nthat under your able guidance we will continue to build \non the achievements of the sixty-second session in our \nefforts to advance our common global agenda towards \na more just, secure and prosperous world. I assure you \nof the full support, cooperation and goodwill of the \ndelegation of the Republic of Botswana in the \ndischarge of your mandate. \n I wish also to pay tribute to your predecessor, His \nExcellency Mr. Srgjan Kerim, President of the \nAssembly at its sixth-second session. We sincerely \ncommend him for his sterling work and leadership, \nwhich enabled us to achieve critical milestones towards \nour common goals. \n This year marks the sixtieth anniversary of the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. This is an \nimportant event on our global human rights agenda. It \nis an occasion for Member States to reflect, \nindividually and collectively, on how much progress \nwe have made in our efforts to build a more just world \norder. The Universal Declaration embodies the \naspirations of humanity for liberty, freedom and \nequality. It is a reflection of the human spirit to strive \nfor a more perfect society in which individuals \nrecognize the reality that creating the space for the \nenjoyment of individual human rights expands the \nhorizons for society to realize its full potential. \n In pursuance of this noble objective we must \ncontinuously strive to improve our governance in order \nto ensure that it is responsive to the wishes of the \npeople. It should be borne in mind that, in the final \nanalysis, it is the people in whom the sovereignty of \nany nation is vested. In that respect, it is imperative \nthat the will of the people expressed in free and fair \nelections be respected by all political leaders. Heads of \nState or Government must avoid the temptation to \nchange constitutions in an effort to prolong their stay \nin power, which often results in instability. \n Botswana reaffirms its commitment to the ideals \nand purposes of the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights. We are determined to contribute to the \npromotion of respect for human rights at home and \nabroad. In doing so we are conscious of the need for \ninternational cooperation in the promotion of human \nrights. It is for this reason that Botswana is a State \nparty to a number of human rights instruments, \nincluding the Rome Statute on the establishment of the \nInternational Criminal Court.  \n We fully support the work of that Court. As a \ncountry that strongly believes in the rule of law, we are \nconvinced that there should be no political interference \nin the work of the Court. The International Criminal \nCourt was established with the support of African \nStates. We felt that it was necessary to address \nproblems that confronted our continent. The Court is \nmeant to serve a specific purpose and there should be \nno exceptions regarding what it can or cannot do. \n \n \n21 08-53135 \n \n Botswana is pleased that representatives of \npolitical parties in Zimbabwe finally signed an \nagreement in Harare on 15 September 2008. We \nwelcomed that development, as it augurs well for \nnational reconciliation, economic reconstruction and \ndevelopment in Zimbabwe. The effective \nimplementation of the agreement should have a \npositive impact not only on developments in Zimbabwe \nbut also on Southern Africa and the wider African \nregion. This is a good beginning, and we encourage the \nparties to do all they can to make the agreement work. \nNo party should attempt to obstruct the implementation \nof the agreement, as the political crisis that confronted \nthat country following the 29 June 2008 presidential \nrun-off election can be resolved only through the \nimplementation of the agreement. Such a development \nwould not be acceptable to Botswana. We call upon the \ninternational community to help the process to succeed \nby extending their goodwill and support to the \nGovernment and the people of Zimbabwe with much-\nneeded economic, financial and technical assistance. \n We must commend the former President of the \nRepublic of South Africa, His Excellency Mr. Thabo \nMbeki, for his hard work, commitment and \ndetermination in helping the Zimbabweans reach \nagreement. We also wish to pay tribute to former \nPresident Mbeki for his contribution to the attainment \nof freedom and democracy not only in South Africa but \nalso in the wider African continent. We are grateful to \nhim for his visionary leadership and his people-centred \ninitiatives, whose primary objective was to build an \nAfrican continent that is free, peaceful, democratic and \neconomically prosperous. \n As the international community, we have the \ncollective responsibility to equip and make optimal use \nof our multilateral body, the United Nations, to search \nfor fair and just solutions to global problems in order \nto contribute to the betterment of all humanity. Today, \nmore than ever before, the United Nations is required \nto respond effectively and swiftly to the complex \nchallenges of the twenty-first century. Conflicts, \npoverty, disease, natural and man-made disasters, \nclimate change, energy and terrorism are among the \nmyriad pressing problems that confront humanity and \nrequire an urgent global response. It is thus imperative \nthat we continue to make concerted efforts to address \nthose challenges in pursuit of a better tomorrow. Their \nmagnitude clearly requires multilateral strategies and \nsolutions. \n Botswana calls upon all Members to unite in the \nsearch for solutions to those problems. It is imperative \nthat in our policies, actions and pronouncements, we \nalways seek to build greater international \nunderstanding. In our approach to managing relations \nbetween States, leaders are called upon to set a higher \nstandard. The language that we employ in international \nforums should not be belligerent or provocative, nor \nshould it be calculated to shame or humiliate other \nleaders. Member States should not host military or \nrebel groups that operate from their territories against \ntheir neighbours. \n In our international discourse, we must aim to \nbuild and facilitate agreement on common goals. In \nthat respect, we must exercise restraint by avoiding the \noften frequent temptation to recall diplomats from each \nother\u2019s capitals, including purely for solidarity reasons. \nSuch action is unfortunate and outdated, as it only \nleads to a breakdown in communication. \n As we meet here, let us always remind ourselves \nof the solemn commitments that we, as the peoples of \nthe world, have undertaken to end war and human \nsuffering. Botswana calls upon all States, especially the \nmajor Powers, to set an example by refraining from the \nuse of weapons in resolving conflicts. Military \nconfrontation is, unfortunately, always a demonstration \nof the failure of the will to use diplomacy, of the urge \nto show off military superiority or of the inability to \nemploy resources and technological advances to \nimprove human lives. \n Sustainable economic growth, development and \nthe eradication of poverty are central to our \ndevelopment agenda as developing countries. Poverty \nis undoubtedly one of the most critical challenges \nfacing our people. Achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and combating poverty in its many \ndimensions are interrelated and mutually reinforcing \nobjectives. Thus, their attainment should be our \nprimary preoccupation. \n Botswana welcomes the initiatives introduced by \nsome development partners that seek to take a more \nfocused approach to Africa\u2019s economic and \ndevelopment problems. Those initiatives include the \nLom\u00e9 Conventions and the successor arrangements \nbetween the African, Caribbean and Pacific States, on \nthe one hand, and the European Union, on the other; \nthe African Growth and Opportunity Act of the United \nStates; the Tokyo International Conference on African \n  \n \n08-53135 22 \n \nDevelopment; the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation; \nand the Africa-India Framework for Cooperation. \n Botswana has always made effective use of the \nresources made available by our cooperating partners. \nIt is important that more be done to help developing \ncountries embark on the path of sustainable \ndevelopment. We are convinced that, as we receive \nmuch-needed assistance, we must envisage a day and \ntime when there will be no need for such assistance \nbecause we are all able to stand on our own. \n This year marks the midpoint towards the 2015 \ntarget for attaining the Millennium Development \nGoals. We thank the Secretary-General for his \nanalytical and informative reports regarding progress \nin the implementation of our common commitments \nand our shared future. We also welcome the work of \nthe high-level meetings held to take stock of progress \nmade. That will no doubt provide impetus for the \nexpeditious implementation of our commitments. \n The Secretary-General\u2019s reports indicate a mixed \nand uneven score. It is clearly evident that while we \nhave made real progress in some areas, much remains \nto be done over the next seven years if we are to \nachieve our goals. In other words, we are seriously \nbehind schedule on every target, among countries and \nwithin countries that need to eradicate poverty and \nreduce human suffering. \n In addition to revealing gaps, the process has \nhighlighted emerging challenges that hinder the \nattainment of targets across the spectrum of human \ndevelopment. It has also emphasized the serious need \nto fast-track the pace of implementation if we are to \nhave any notable impact. The achievement of those \ngoals is our shared responsibility. It is thus imperative \nthat all of us, individually and collectively, do our part \nto accelerate progress towards a better quality of life \nfor our people. \n Our people deserve a life free from fear and want, \nin an environment that offers equal opportunity for all. \nThat is not a privilege, but a fundamental human right \nthat each State has a duty to respect, protect and fulfil. \nFor our people, that should mean universal access to \neducation, health, shelter, clean water and \ninfrastructure, as well as living in a safe and secure \nenvironment. Fully honouring our commitments is the \nkey to realizing those expectations. \n The following facts should trouble our collective \nconscience. More than one quarter of the children \nyounger than 5 in the developing world are \nunderweight. That amounts to 143 million underweight \nchildren in developing countries. Children in \ndeveloping countries continue to die from preventable \ndiseases such as malaria. The approximately 4 billion \ncases of diarrhoea per annum cause 2.2 million deaths, \nmostly among children under 5. Approximately \n6 million people are blind as a result of trachoma, a \ndisease caused by lack of clean water combined with \npoor hygiene practices. In sub-Saharan Africa, a \nwoman\u2019s lifetime risk of maternal death is a staggering \n1 in 22, compared with 1 in 8,000 in industrialized \ncountries. Finally, HIV is spreading faster than we can \nprovide universal access to prevention, treatment, \nsupport and care. \n Clearly, closing those gaps will entail more than \nour reaffirmations; it urgently necessitates sustained \nand strong political commitment and leadership; sound \nand appropriate national policies, matched with \nincreased official development assistance and technical \nsupport from the international system; stepped-up \nparticipation and combined efforts by Governments, \ncivil society and the private sector; fairer, transparent \nand inclusive international trade regimes; more global \npartnerships to assist developing countries; full \nimplementation of debt-relief initiatives; greater access \nto markets; and other innovative international support \nmeasures to finance development. \n The search for global peace and security remains \na matter of vital interest to my delegation. While we \nmay have made significant strides in promoting peace \nthrough conflict prevention and resolution, through \npost-conflict recovery and through peacebuilding, \nconflicts continue to flare up, thus making the \nrestoration of peace a remote possibility for some in \nthe world. \n My own continent, Africa, plays host to a large \nnumber of conflicts. The scourge of war has claimed \nmany lives and caused untold human suffering. \nSubstantial time, energy and financial resources have \nbeen expended, with little or no success. The United \nNations Charter implores us, as the international \ncommunity, to save succeeding generations from the \nscourge of war by employing all diplomatic efforts and \ntools at our disposal. \n \n \n23 08-53135 \n \n I am pleased to note that commendable strides \nhave been made in placing some countries, such as \nLiberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau, on a firm \npath of national reconstruction, post-conflict recovery \nand peacebuilding. Regrettably, the peoples of Africa \ncontinue to face hunger and death in the Darfur region \nof the Sudan, Somalia and Chad, among other places.  \n My delegation is particularly concerned about the \never-worsening situation in the Darfur region of the \nSudan. It is disconcerting that armed hostilities \ncontinue, despite the efforts of the United Nations and \nthe African Union through the development of the \nAfrican Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in \nDarfur. We call on the parties to commit to political \ndialogue in the search for lasting peace and to fully \nutilize the good offices of His Excellency Mr. Djibril \nBassole, who has recently been appointed to facilitate \nthe peace process. \n With respect to Somalia, Botswana welcomes the \nsigning of the Djibouti Agreement on 9 June 2008 by \nthe Transitional Federal Government of Somalia and \nthe Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia. We call \nupon all Somali political forces to commit to an all-\ninclusive political process so that the long-suffering \npeople of Somali can also live in peace.  \n My delegation further calls on the international \ncommunity to continue assisting the people of Somali \nwith much-needed humanitarian aid. In the same vein, \nwe remind the political leaders of the Somali people to \nput the interests of the people of Somalia above their \nown, so that the focus can be on the search for a lasting \npolitical settlement to the problems facing their \ncountry. \n The success of the United Nations in delivering \non our expectations and common ideals must be \nmatched by adequate resources, appropriate mandates, \nstructures and policy guidance. Botswana strongly \nbelieves in the instrumentality of the United Nations. \nIn that regard, we are committed to paying our \nassessed contributions in full and on time. We therefore \ncall upon all Members to do the same, so that this \nmachinery, which is the motor that powers \nmultilateralism, does not run out of steam. \n There can be no doubt that any organization \u2014 \nand the United Nations in particular \u2014 must be \nconstantly reformed or renewed if it is to continue to \nbe relevant and responsive to the needs of its members. \nWe are pleased that there has been some measure of \nprogress in implementing the set of reforms mandated \nby the 2005 World Summit. \n Allow me to conclude my remarks by once again \ncalling on each and every one of us to live up to the \nhigh expectations of this Organization by honouring \nour commitments. Botswana reaffirms its abiding faith \nin this body, which unites the peoples of the world for \na higher purpose. It is our hope that as we meet here, \nwe will succeed in building greater international \nunderstanding across regions, cultures, language and \nfaiths, because we are all human and because of the \nhumanity of others.

        "file_text": "I am \nhonoured to be afforded the opportunity to address the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-third session. I also wish \nto extend my sincere congratulations to Mr. D\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann on his election to the presidency. I am \nconvinced that his wealth of experience, garnered over \nthe years in the different capacities in which he has \nserved and his strong conviction of the importance of \nmultilateralism and respect for international law, will \nbe brought to bear in a most positive and productive \nway on the proceedings of the session. Further, \nTrinidad and Tobago is gratified that Nicaragua and, by \nextension, Central America, has been graced with the \ndistinct honour of guiding the work of the sixty-third \nsession. \n At the same time, my delegation wishes to \nexpress our heartfelt appreciation and admiration for \nthe way in which His Excellency Srgjan Kerim of the \nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia conducted the \naffairs of the General Assembly during the last session. \n The Secretary-General must be commended, \nparticularly for his untiring efforts in ensuring that \nhumanitarian relief is brought to thousands of victims \nof natural disasters, including in the Caribbean. Given \nthe increasing frequency and ferocity of hurricanes and \nother similar climatic phenomena, there is dire need for \nthe provision of early warning systems and capacity-\nbuilding programmes in vulnerable regions like the \nCaribbean, aimed at enhancing planning and \npreparedness and at mitigating the effects of such \ndisasters. We applaud all efforts to bring relief to those \naffected. \n The President returned to the Chair. \n The recent disasters bring into sharp focus the \nimperative of purposeful action on the problems of \nclimate change at the national, regional and \ninternational levels. Trinidad and Tobago is committed \nto adopting concrete measures aimed at reducing its \nlevels of greenhouse gas emissions, while at the same \ntime promoting balanced industrialization and \nenvironmental sustainability. \n Notwithstanding its current healthy endowment \nof hydrocarbon resources, Trinidad and Tobago \nrecognizes the need to promote clean energy \nalternatives, the development of new and renewable \nenergy options and the proper protection and \nmanagement of the nation\u2019s forests. Indeed, the \nGovernment is putting into effect appropriate policies \nfor substantial results in that area. We hope to achieve \nmeaningful progress, in cooperation with development \npartners within the public and private sectors, both \nlocally and internationally, and with civil society. \n Cooperation at the international level is also \nindispensable to efforts aimed at addressing the current \nenergy crisis. Trinidad and Tobago is seeking to partner \nwith its African friends in order to, among other things, \nidentify ways of developing long-term strategies for \nthe sustainable development and utilization of their \nenergy resources. That is in keeping with the pledge \nmade by The Honourable Patrick Manning, Prime \nMinister of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, in \n2007, when he addressed the eighth Summit of the \nAfrican Union, in Ethiopia. Since then, discussions \nhave ensued with individual African States and with \nthe Economic Community of West African States \n(ECOWAS), to advance the initiative. The Government \nof Trinidad and Tobago is eager to work assiduously \ntowards the attainment of our common objectives. \n Trinidad and Tobago firmly believes that the \nUnited Nations must take the lead in the management \nof the global food crisis, in which we are confronted \nwith a situation of losing thousands to hunger on an \nalmost daily basis. We embrace the various multilateral \ninitiatives to address that grave challenge, including \nthe establishment by the Secretary-General of the \nHigh-Level Task Force on the Global Food Security \nCrisis in April 2008 and the adoption of its \nComprehensive Framework for Action. \n The eradication of extreme poverty and hunger is \none of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to \nbe achieved by 2015. We cannot allow the threat posed \nby the global food crisis to reverse the strides made so \nfar by many developing countries to achieve that Goal. \nWe must utilize all the resources at our disposal, \nincluding a recommitment to the Food and Agriculture \n \n \n27 08-53129 \n \nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO), which was \nestablished to help developing countries and countries \nin transition modernize and improve agriculture and \nfisheries practices and to ensure good nutrition for \ntheir citizens. We must work in concert to provide that \ninstitution with the resources necessary to discharge \neffectively its mandates. If we fail to win the war \nagainst that common enemy, we will be compromising \nthe right to food and by extension the right to life of \nmillions of people. \n The Government of Trinidad and Tobago has \nembraced a number of key policy initiatives that are \ndesigned to guarantee our citizens access to food of \nsufficient quality and quantity and to reduce the impact \nof the food crisis. Thousands of acres have been made \navailable for diversified agricultural production. In \naddition, capital is accessible to farmers through our \nnational Agricultural Development Bank. \n Trinidad and Tobago recognizes that food \nsecurity must also be pursued in the context of the \nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) Single Market and \nEconomy, which provides the opportunity for the \nintegration of production and cross-border investment \nin agricultural production in those countries which \nhave greater agricultural potential and resources. The \nGovernment of Trinidad and Tobago therefore hosted, \njointly with the CARICOM secretariat and the Food \nand Agriculture Organization, a regional agriculture \ndonor conference in June 2007. \n Similarly, like poverty and hunger, terrorism \nremains a major scourge on our societies and poses a \ndirect threat to democratic institutions. It undermines \nthe rule of law, infringes human rights and generally \naffects the well-being of its victims. Trinidad and \nTobago is convinced that members of the international \ncommunity must embrace multilateral solutions in the \nfight against terrorism. We remain committed to the \nUnited Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, \nwhich is complementary to our own efforts to combat \nterrorism. \n Trinidad and Tobago views the reform of the \nSecurity Council as indispensable to the transformation \nand further democratization of the United Nations. As a \nsmall island developing State, Trinidad and Tobago \nwishes to reiterate its position on Security Council \nreform, which emphasizes the need for, among other \nthings, equity of access for small States to the Security \nCouncil and the need for representation of all regions \nof the world in its permanent membership. Failure to \nreform the Security Council could serve to undermine \nthat organ\u2019s authority as the body with the primary \nresponsibility for the maintenance of international \npeace and security, as well as its ability to discharge its \nother obligations under Chapter VII of the Charter of \nthe United Nations. \n Trinidad and Tobago is convinced that the United \nNations remains the principal vehicle for meaningful \nexchanges between members of the international \ncommunity on matters of international concern. Such \ndeliberations, in our view, constitute the bedrock of the \ndemocratization of the United Nations system and are \nfor us a priority consideration. We recognize therefore \nthe great value of the informal consultations on \nsystem-wide coherence aimed at making the \nOrganization deliver as one. \n Further progress on that issue during the current \nsession is imperative for the United Nations \ndevelopment system to be able to provide Member \nStates, particularly developing countries, with the \nassistance required to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and the other internationally \nagreed development goals. \n The Government of Trinidad and Tobago has \ncharted a development policy to achieve the MDGs \nwithin the stipulated period, as well as to transform the \ncountry to developed status by the year 2020. The pace \nof economic growth over the past decade has \nfortunately enabled us to surpass MDG targets in \nachieving universal primary education, promoting \ngender equality, empowering women and significantly \nreducing the level of poverty. \n Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s development strategy \nexceeds the MDG targets in some respects. The \nGovernment of Trinidad and Tobago has been able to \nprovide free secondary and tertiary education to its \ncitizens. In addition, 30 per cent of our cabinet \nministers and members of parliament are women. \n Regrettably, for many developing States, the \nachievement of the MDGs within the stipulated period \nappears to be elusive. We therefore urge all \ndevelopment partners to honour their commitments and \npledges already agreed upon. \n Another important international process to which \nTrinidad and Tobago attaches great importance is the \nreview of the implementation of the Monterrey \n  \n \n08-53129 28 \n \nConsensus on Financing for Development, which will \nbe addressed at a follow-up international conference in \nDoha, Qatar, in November. The Monterrey Consensus, \nadopted by heads of State or Government in 2002, \ncalled for the mobilization of resources to assist \ndeveloping countries in meeting the MDGs and \nrecognized the importance of coherence and \nconsistency within and among the international \nmonetary, financial and trading systems in support of \noverall development. While there have been some \nadvances under the key pillars of financing for \ndevelopment, they have not been sufficiently \nfar-reaching. In the light of the current financial crisis, \nthe timing for the convening of the follow-up \nconference is most timely and presents an opportunity \nfor the forging of global partnerships in a spirit of \nsolidarity. A key component for success will be an \nongoing engagement between Governments and all \nstakeholders, including the private sector and civil \nsociety. \n Trinidad and Tobago is committed to the regional \nintegration movement of CARICOM and has continued \nto provide economic assistance to our CARICOM \npartners within the ambit of that multilateral \nframework and other bilateral arrangements. One such \narrangement is Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s Petroleum \nDevelopment Fund, a facility that only recently was \ndrawn upon to provide substantial assistance to some \nof our Caribbean neighbours in the aftermath of recent \nhurricanes. Another is the CARICOM Trade Support \nProgramme, a comprehensive loan facility of $16.5 \nmillion that is aimed at improving the trade capacity of \nCARICOM States by providing assistance in the \ndiversification of their economies and in improving \ntrade capacity. \n The Caribbean also falls prey to the nefarious \ntrade in narcotics, to which the illegal proliferation of \nsmall arms and light weapons is linked. In an effort to \nconfront these challenges, we have concluded with our \nneighbours the CARICOM Maritime and Air Space \nSecurity Cooperation Agreement to protect our borders \nfrom illegal activities. We recognize, however, the \nimportant role of the United Nations as the premier \nmultilateral forum in providing assistance in areas such \nas capacity-building to augment our own resources. For \nthe States of the Caribbean, a critical aspect of \ndisarmament is the eradication of the illegal trade in \nsmall arms. Trinidad and Tobago therefore calls for \nurgent action to complete the work on the elaboration \nof an arms trade treaty. \n In the context of our efforts to address the \nchallenge, we also wish to call again for consideration \nto be given to the inclusion of international drug \ntrafficking as one of the crimes within the jurisdiction \nof the International Criminal Court (ICC). \n It is of great significance to us that the very year \nwe celebrate the tenth anniversary of the adoption of \nthe Rome Statute of the ICC, we also commemorate the \nsixtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights. Since its establishment, \nthe ICC has been able to attract 100 States parties, \nissue arrest warrants and begin trials of persons \naccused of committing crimes of major concern to the \ninternational community. The perpetrators of genocide, \ncrimes against humanity and war crimes show flagrant \ndisregard for the human rights of their victims, as well \nas for human rights law and humanitarian law, none of \nwhich should go unpunished. \n The United Nations has played a seminal role in \nthe promotion and development of international law, \nwhich has contributed to the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security and friendly relations \namong States. As a small State, Trinidad and Tobago \nviews adherence to and respect for the rule of law as a \nbulwark against intrusions that could affect our \nterritorial integrity, independence and economic \ndevelopment and the general well-being of our \ncitizens. However, we are conscious of the need for \ninternational cooperation in the implementation of \ninternational legal obligations under various \nconventions that provide mutual benefits to Member \nStates. \n One area of which the United Nations can be \njustly proud is the conclusion of the United Nations \nConvention on the Law of the Sea. The Convention has \nworked well since its adoption and entry into force, \nand it has provided legal certainty to activities carried \nout by States in different maritime zones. In keeping \nwith our obligations under the Convention, Trinidad \nand Tobago is in the process of completing work on its \nsubmission to the Commission on the Limits of the \nContinental Shelf by May 2009 to extend its \ncontinental shelf jurisdiction beyond 200 nautical miles \nfrom the baselines from which the breadth of the \nterritorial sea is measured. We do so with full respect \n \n \n29 08-53129 \n \nfor the sovereign right of other coastal States to make \nsimilar submissions to the Commission. \n Our region is home to the International Seabed \nAuthority, which is located in Jamaica. The Authority\u2019s \nmandate is derived from the Convention, and it is \nentrusted with the responsibility to administer the \nresources of the International Seabed Area, which is \nthe common heritage of mankind. As in previous years, \nwe again call on all members of the Authority to make \nevery effort to attend its meetings. \n In conclusion, Trinidad and Tobago wishes to \nreaffirm its faith in and commitment to multilateralism \nat the regional, hemispheric and international levels. \nDialogue among States must always be the preferred \noption for solving the myriad problems that we face in \nan increasingly complex international environment. It \nis in recognition of this importance that Trinidad and \nTobago has taken the bold decision to host in 2009 \nboth the Summit of the Americas and the \nCommonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. \nDialogue in those two bodies, which are microcosms of \nthe United Nations, could also influence discussions at \nthe United Nations, an institution that we must \ncontinue to transform, guard and protect, in order to be \nable to bequeath it to future generations.

        "file_text": "My \ndelegation and I join in expressing our congratulations \nto you, Father Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, on your \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-third session, and we hope you have a very \nsuccessful and rewarding term at the helm of this body. \nWe express our gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Srgjan \nKerim for the excellent work done during his tenure as \nPresident of the Assembly at its sixty-second session.  \n Once again, we have come to this body to \nreaffirm the need for what we have always called for: \nthe implementation of all the promises and pledges that \nwe have made before. The focus of the sixty-third \nsession of the General Assembly is on the global food \ncrisis, climate change and reform of the United \nNations. The confluence of the food, fuel and financial \ncrises, as well as the effects of climate change, pose the \nreal threat that they will undermine the progress made \nby developing countries in the struggle against poverty \nand underdevelopment. \n During the Millennium Summit, held in 2000, our \nheads of State and Government adopted a Declaration \n(resolution 55/2) that communicated a message of hope \nand a vision of a better world. Included in the \nDeclaration was an important section on the special \nneeds of Africa. In paragraph 24 of the Declaration, the \nleaders stated that they would  \n\u201cspare no effort to promote democracy and \nstrengthen the rule of law, as well as respect for \nall internationally recognized human rights and \nfundamental freedoms, including the right to \ndevelopment\u201d.  \n African and many other, developing countries \nhave indeed taken responsibility for promoting \ndemocracy, good governance, peace and stability and \nhuman rights. They are also hard at work rolling back \nthe frontiers of poverty and underdevelopment. But, \ndespite those strides, it is clear that many in \nsub-Saharan Africa will not achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). Part of the reason is that \nthe global partnership for development on which the \nachievement of the MDGs was predicated has not been \nfully implemented. Despite the lofty ideas expressed at \nprevious sessions of the Assembly, we continue to fall \nshort in meeting our commitments to implement that \npartnership, in particular in the areas of trade, aid and \ndebt relief.  \n We express the fervent hope that the high-level \nmeetings organized by yourself, Mr. President, and the \nSecretary-General, on Africa\u2019s development needs and \non the MDGs, have served not only as important \nreminders of the challenges we face, but also as a \ncatalyst that will cause the world to feel a greater sense \nof urgency. \n The necessary resources exist in the world to \nachieve the MDGs. We need to summon the necessary \npolitical will and compassion. So we join the sister \ncountries of our continent in calling for massive \nresource transfers through development assistance, \ninvestment, trade, technology transfers and human \nresource development. These will ensure that African \nand other developing countries are able to successfully \nadapt to the devastating impact of climate change and \nachieve the MDGs. \n However, in order to accelerate the achievement \nof all the Millennium Development Goals, much more \nattention needs to be focused on Goal 3, regarding the \nempowerment of women. Women need to be at the \ncentre of development as agents of change, socially, \neconomically and politically.  \n  \n \n08-53141 12 \n \n Billions of the people of the world, whom we are \nprivileged to represent in the Assembly, have cast their \neyes on this gathering of leaders. They have done so \nbecause they have hope that this leadership will take \nthe required measures in order to address poverty and \nunderdevelopment. We dare not fail them. \n The food crisis has to be addressed in the short \nand medium terms. The Green Revolution that has \nbeen launched by the African Union needs partnerships \nin order to succeed. In addition, support for the New \nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development will be a major \ncontributor to the struggle against poverty and \nunderdevelopment. In that context, allow me, Mr. \nPresident, to quote from your own statement to the \nGeneral Assembly with regard to that socio-economic \nprogramme as well as the role of our immediate former \nPresident, Thabo Mbeki:  \n\u201cDuring his presidency of the rainbow nation, \nspanning nearly a decade, he, along [with] other \nAfrican leaders, championed the vision of \nNEPAD we still pursue today. When the affluent \nlisten to Africa and partner with it, that vision is \nwithin reach. To quote NEPAD\u2019s founding \ndocument: `In fulfilling its promise, this agenda \nmust give hope to the emaciated African child \nthat the twenty-first century is indeed Africa\u2019s \ncentury.\u2019\u201d (, p. 3)  \n The Doha Development Round has stalled despite \nseven years of negotiations. We are convinced that \ntrade and increased market access will make a major \ncontribution to the achievement of the MDGs. In that \nregard, it is our submission that the Doha Round of \ntrade negotiations should not be allowed to die, but \nmust remain focused on development, as originally \nenvisaged.  \n In recent years, we have all witnessed the \ndevastating effects of climate change, especially on \nisland States. Hurricanes have become more frequent \nand more vicious, together with droughts, floods and \nunpredictable extreme weather patterns in the rest of \nthe world. Of course, climate change requires an urgent \nresponse. Given the agreement in Bali last year on a \nroad map for negotiations, it is our hope that the \nnegotiations, to be completed in Copenhagen in 2009, \nwill necessarily set the stage for more concerted action \nby all countries to address climate change and all its \nmanifestations, with the developed countries taking the \nlead. South Africa commits itself to approaching the \npreparations for Copenhagen constructively and with a \nview to reaching an agreement that is ambitious, \nbalanced and inclusive. \n We join the many leaders of the world who have \nexpressed their support for fundamental reform of the \nsystem of global governance, including the United \nNations and the Bretton Woods institutions. It is \nimportant to understand that the critical issues facing \nthe world today \u2014 the current financial, food and \nenergy crises \u2014 cannot be addressed effectively when \nso many countries and regions of the world are left out \nof the key decision-making processes of important \ninstitutions of global governance. South Africa stands \nready to work with other members of the United \nNations to advance the goal of reform.  \n Equally, the reform of the Security Council need \nnot be re-emphasized. We reiterate our view that a \nreformed Security Council would have more legitimacy \nand that its decisions would have more credibility. We \nwelcome the recent decision (decision 62/557) to \nlaunch in the General Assembly inter-governmental \nnegotiations on Security Council reform, to discuss \nplans for expanding the Security Council in both the \nnon-permanent and permanent categories. It is of \ncourse a travesty of justice that Africa, which \nconstitutes a large portion of the work of the Council, \nis not represented in the permanent category. Unless \nthe ideals of freedom, justice and equality become the \ncharacter of the United Nations, including the Security \nCouncil, the dominant will continue to dictate to the \ndominated, while the dreams of the dominated will \nforever be deferred. \n In December this year, my country will complete \nits tenure as a non-permanent member of the Security \nCouncil. We have indeed been privileged to serve the \npeoples of Africa and the world in that capacity; it has \nbeen a historic first for us as a young democracy. In \nthat capacity, we were indeed honoured to contribute \nmeaningfully to global efforts to create peace and \nstability in all regions of the world. Accordingly, we \nexpress the humble gratitude of the people of our \ncountry to the general membership of the United \nNations for the trust placed in us in helping the world \ndischarge this mandate. \n During our tenure, the Security Council also \nfocused on the important question of enhancing the \nrelationship between the United Nations and regional \norganizations, in particular the African Union (AU). \n \n \n13 08-53141 \n \nWe were honoured to be able to contribute to that \nwork. We congratulate the Secretary-General on \nappointing an African Union-United Nations panel of \ndistinguished persons whose mandate is to explore \nfinancing modalities for AU-led peacekeeping \nmissions. \n Peace continues to evade the Middle East. South \nAfrica participated in the Annapolis Conference in \n2007 with great expectations and hopes that progress \nwould indeed be made to advance the goal of peace in \nthat region. We will continue to support all \ninternational efforts to help the peoples of Palestine \nand Israel in their endeavour to find a lasting and \npeaceful solution to their challenges, leading to the \nestablishment of a viable Palestinian State, coexisting \nside by side with the State of Israel, within secure \nborders. We understand full well the pain, suffering \nand agony that conflict brings to bear on the lives of \nordinary people, particularly women and children. \nThose ordinary souls continue to cry out to this \nAssembly of the world, as they have done in the past, \nto help bring an end to the conflict. \n South Africa will continue to work with the sister \npeoples of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \nBurundi and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire in their efforts to \nconsolidate peace and democracy in their respective \ncountries. With regard to Zimbabwe, the Assembly \nmust certainly be aware of the recent developments led \nby our former President Thabo Mbeki in his capacity as \nthe Southern African Development Community \n(SADC) facilitator, which culminated in the signing of \nan agreement between the main political protagonists \nin the country. We hope that the leadership of \nZimbabwe win soon finalize aspects of that agreement \nto make possible the formation of a new Government \nthat will help lay the groundwork to address the \npolitical and economic challenges facing their country. \nSADC, the African Union and the facilitator stand as \nguarantors of the agreement. We call on the \ninternational community to spare neither strength nor \neffort in lending a hand to the people of Zimbabwe as \nthey embark on the difficult path of reconciliation and \nreconstruction. \n Equally, the situations in Somalia and the Sudan, \nand especially in Darfur, remain matters of great \nconcern. South Africa will continue to do whatever it \ncan, both bilaterally and in the context of the African \nUnion and the United Nations, to help the peoples of \nSudan and Somalia find peace among themselves. \n We remain concerned about the impasse on the \nquestion of Western Sahara. South Africa is committed \nto seeking a just, mutually acceptable and lasting \nsolution to that problem.  \n This year also marks the sixtieth anniversary of \nthe adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights. During the past six decades, the Declaration \nhas remained the key standard for human rights, justice \nand dignity. We should therefore use this anniversary \nperiod to strengthen our resolve to defend human \nrights. South Africa has also had the honour to be \nreviewed under the Universal Periodic Review \nmechanism of the new Human Rights Council. We \nwere also honoured with the appointment of our own \nJustice Navi Pillai to lead that very important \ninternational institution. \nMr. Siles Alvarado (Bolivia), Vice-President, took \nthe Chair. \n We wish to reiterate our belief in the centrality of \nthe United Nations. In the Millennium Declaration, we \nreaffirmed that the United Nations \u201cis the \nindispensable common house of the entire human \nfamily, through which we will seek to realize our \nuniversal aspirations for peace, cooperation and \ndevelopment\u201d (resolution 55/2, para. 32). Leading \nSouth Africa\u2019s delegation to the Millennium Summit \nwas our former President, Thabo Mbeki, who reminded \nthe Assembly that  \n\u201cBillions among the living struggle to survive in \nconditions of poverty, deprivation and \nunderdevelopment ... as offensive to everything \nhumane as anything we decry about the second \nmillennium.\u201d (A/55/PV.5, p. 18) \n It is that understanding that has correctly \ninformed the engagement of successive leaders of our \ndemocratic State with this body over the years. In that \nregard, we are touched and humbled by the kind \ncomments made in the Assembly by the various heads \nof State or Government and heads of delegation, \ndirected at our immediate former President, Thabo \nMbeki. We most certainly shall, through our \nGovernment, convey those sentiments to that noble son \nof our people and our continent, and citizen of the \nworld. \n Accordingly, from this rostrum may I also \nexpress our sincere gratitude to the general \nmembership of the United Nations for the support that \n  \n \n08-53141 14 \n \nformer President Mbeki and our country received over \nthe past nine-and-a-half years of his stewardship of our \ncountry. As the leadership of our country is passed on, \nwe confirm that South Africa, under the guidance of \nPresident Kgalema Motlanthe, shall indeed continue to \nbe a trusted and dependable partner in the common \nendeavour to strengthen our institutions of \nmultilateralism, starting from the correct premise that \nmultilateralism remains the only hope in addressing the \nchallenges facing humanity today, whether they be \nterrorism, threats to human rights, peace and stability \nor, of course, the central struggle against poverty and \nunderdevelopment.

        "file_name": "USA_63_2008.txt",
        "file_text": "I am pleased to be here to \naddress the General Assembly. Sixty-three years ago, \nrepresentatives from around the world gathered in San \nFrancisco to complete the founding of the Charter of \nthe United Nations. They met in the shadow of a \ndevastating war, with grave new dangers on the \nhorizon. They agreed on a historic pledge to reaffirm \nfaith in fundamental human rights and unite their \nstrength to maintain international peace and security. \nThat noble pledge has endured trying hours in United \nNations history, and it still guides our work today.  \n \n \n9 08-51570 \n \n Yet the ideals of the Charter are now facing a \nchallenge as serious as any since the United Nations \nfounding: a global movement of violent extremists. By \ndeliberately murdering the innocent to advance their \naims, those extremists defy the fundamental principles \nof international order. They show contempt for all who \nrespect life and value human dignity. They reject the \nwords of the Bible, the Koran, the Torah or any \nstandard of conscience of morality. They imperil the \nvalues of justice and human rights that gave birth to the \nUnited Nations \u2014 values that have fuelled an \nunprecedented expansion of freedom across the world.  \n To uphold the words of the Charter in the face of \nthis challenge, every nation in this Hall has \nresponsibilities. As sovereign States, we have an \nobligation to govern responsibly and solve problems \nbefore they spill across borders. We have an obligation \nto prevent our territory from being used as a sanctuary \nfor terrorism, proliferation, human trafficking and \norganized crime. We have an obligation to respect the \nrights and respond to the needs of our people.  \n Multilateral organizations have responsibilities. \nFor eight years, the nations in this Assembly have \nworked together to confront the extremist threat. We \nhave witnessed successes and setbacks, and through it \nall a clear lesson has emerged. The United Nations and \nother multilateral organizations are needed more \nurgently than ever. To be successful, we must be \nfocused, resolute and effective.  \n Instead of only adopting resolutions decrying \nterrorist acts after they occur, we must cooperate more \nclosely to keep terrorist attacks from happening in the \nfirst place. Instead of treating all forms of Government \nas equally tolerable, we must actively challenge the \nconditions of tyranny and despair that allow terror and \nextremists to thrive. By acting together to meet the \nfundamental challenge of our time, we can lead \ntowards a world that is more secure, more prosperous \nand more hopeful.  \n In the decades ahead, the United Nations and \nother multilateral organizations must continually \nconfront terror. That mission requires clarity of vision. \nWe must see the terrorists for what they are: ruthless \nextremists who exploit the desperate, subvert the tenets \nof a great religion and seek to impose their will on as \nmany people as possible. Some suggest that those men \nwould pose less of a threat if we would only leave \nthem alone, yet their leaders make clear that no \nconcession could ever satisfy their ambitions. Bringing \nthe terrorists to justice does not create terrorism. It is \nthe best way to protect our people.  \n Multilateral organizations must respond by taking \nan unequivocal moral stand against terrorism. No cause \ncan justify the deliberate taking of innocent life, and \nthe international community is nearing universal \nagreement on this truth. The vast majority of nations in \nthis Assembly now agree that tactics like suicide \nbombing, hostage-taking and hijacking are never \nlegitimate. The Security Council has adopted \nresolutions declaring terror unlawful and requiring all \nnations to crack down on terrorist financing. Earlier \nthis month, the Secretary-General held a conference to \nhighlight victims of terror, where he stated that \nterrorism can never be justified. \n Other multilateral organizations have spoken \nclearly as well. The Group of 8 has declared that all \nterrorist acts are criminal and must be universally \ncondemned. The Secretary-General of the Organization \nof the Islamic Conference recently spoke out against \nsuicide bombing, which he said runs counter to the \nteachings of Islam.  \n The message behind those statements is \nresolutely clear. Like slavery and piracy, terrorism has \nno place in the modern world. Around the globe, \nnations are turning those words into action. Members \nof the United Nations are sharing intelligence with one \nanother, conducting joint operations and freezing \nterrorists\u2019 finances. While terrorists continue to carry \nout attacks like the terrible bombing in Islamabad last \nweek, our joint actions have spared our citizens from \nmany devastating blows.  \n The brutal nature of the extremists is increasingly \nclear and the coalition of nations confronting terrorists \nis growing stronger. Over the past seven years, \nAfghanistan and Iraq have been transformed from \nregimes that actively sponsor terror to democracies that \nfight terror. Libya has renounced its support for terror \nand its pursuit of nuclear weapons. Nations like Saudi \nArabia and Pakistan are actively pursuing the terrorists. \nA few nations, regimes like Syria and Iran, continue to \nsponsor terror, yet their numbers are growing fewer \nand they are growing more isolated from the world.  \n As the twenty-first century unfolds, some may be \ntempted to assume that the threat has receded. That \nwould be comforting. It would be wrong. The terrorists \nbelieve time is on their side, so they have made waiting \n  \n \n08-51570 10 \n \nout civilized nations part of their strategy. We must not \nallow them to succeed. The nations of this body must \nstand united in the fight against terror. We must \ncontinue working to deny the terrorists refuge \nanywhere in the world, including ungoverned spaces. \nWe must remain vigilant against proliferation by fully \nimplementing the terms of resolution 1540 (2004) and \nenforcing sanctions against North Korea and Iran. We \nmust not relent until our people are safe from this \nthreat to civilization. \n To uphold the Charter\u2019s promise of peace and \nsecurity in the twenty-first century, we must also \nconfront the ideology of the terrorists. At its core, the \nstruggle against extremists is a battle of ideas. \nTerrorists envision a world in which religious freedom \nis denied, women are oppressed and all dissent is \ncrushed. The nations represented in this Hall must \npresent a more hopeful alternative \u2014 a vision where \npeople can speak freely, worship as they choose and \npursue their dreams in liberty.  \n Advancing this vision of freedom serves our \nhighest ideals, as expressed in the United Nations \nCharter\u2019s commitment to the dignity and worth of the \nhuman person. Advancing this vision also serves our \nsecurity interests. History shows that when citizens \nhave a voice in choosing their own leaders, they are \nless likely to search for meaning in radical ideologies, \nand when Governments respect the rights of their \npeople, they are more likely to respect the rights of \ntheir neighbours. \n For all these reasons, the nations of this body \nmust challenge tyranny as vigorously as we challenge \nterror. Some question whether people in certain parts of \nthe world actually desire freedom. This self-serving \ncondescension has been disproved before our eyes. \nFrom the voting booths of Afghanistan, Iraq and \nLiberia to the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, the Rose \nRevolution in Georgia, the Cedar Revolution in \nLebanon and the Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan, we \nhave seen people consistently make the courageous \ndecision to demand their liberty. \n For all the suggestions to the contrary, the truth is \nthat, whenever and wherever people are given the \nchoice, they choose freedom. Nations represented in \nthis Hall have supported the efforts of dissidents, \nreformers and civil society advocates in newly free \nsocieties through the new United Nations Democracy \nFund, and we appreciate those efforts. As young \ndemocracies around the world continue to make brave \nstands for liberty, multilateral organizations like the \nUnited Nations must continue to stand with them. \n In Afghanistan, a determined people are working \nto overcome decades of tyranny and protect their newly \nfree society. They have strong support from all 26 \nnations of the NATO alliance. I appreciate the United \nNations decision this week to renew the mandate of the \nInternational Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. \nThe United Nations also has an active civilian presence \nin Afghanistan, where experts are doing important \nwork helping to improve education, facilitate \nhumanitarian aid and protect human rights. We must \ncontinue to help the Afghan people defend their young \ndemocracy so that the Taliban does not return to power \nand Afghanistan is never again a safe haven for terror. \n In Iraq, the fight has been difficult, yet daily life \nhas improved dramatically over the past 20 months \nthanks to the courage of the Iraqi people, a determined \ncoalition of nations and a surge of American troops. \nThe United Nations has provided the mandate for \nmultinational forces in Iraq through this December, and \nthe United Nations is carrying out an ambitious \nstrategy to strengthen Iraq\u2019s democracy, including \nhelping Iraqis prepare for their next round of free \nelections. Whatever disagreements our nations have \nhad on Iraq, we should all welcome this progress \ntowards stability and peace and we should stand united \nin helping Iraq\u2019s democracy succeed.  \n We must stand united in our support of other \nyoung democracies, from the people of Lebanon \nstruggling to maintain their hard-won independence to \nthe people of the Palestinian territories, who deserve a \nfree and peaceful State of their own. We must stand \nunited in our support of the people of Georgia. The \nUnited Nations Charter sets forth the equal rights of \nnations large and small; Russia\u2019s invasion of Georgia \nwas a violation of those rights. Young democracies \naround the world are watching to see how we respond \nto this test. The United States has worked with allies in \nsuch multilateral institutions as the European Union \nand NATO to uphold Georgia\u2019s territorial integrity and \nprovide humanitarian relief. Our nations will continue \nto support Georgia\u2019s democracy. \n In this Hall are representatives of Georgia, \nUkraine, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Liberia, Iraq and other \nbrave young democracies. We admire their courage, we \nhonour their sacrifices, and we thank them for their \n \n \n11 08-51570 \n \ninspiring example. We will continue to stand with all \nwho stand for freedom. This noble goal is worthy of \nthe United Nations and it should have the support of \nevery member of this Assembly.  \n Extending the reach of political freedom is \nessential to prevailing in the great struggle of our time, \nbut it is not enough. Many in this Hall have answered \nthe call to help their brothers and sisters in need by \nworking to alleviate hopelessness. Those efforts to \nimprove the human condition honour the highest ideals \nof this institution. They also advance our security \ninterests. The extremists find their most fertile \nrecruiting grounds in societies trapped in chaos and \ndespair \u2014 places where people see no prospect of a \nbetter life. In the shadows of hopelessness, radicalism \nthrives. Eventually, that radicalism can boil over into \nviolence, cross borders and take innocent lives across \nthe world.  \n Overcoming hopelessness requires addressing its \ncauses: poverty, disease and ignorance. Challenging \nthese conditions is in the interest of every nation in this \nHall, and democracies are particularly well positioned \nto carry out that work because we have experience \nresponding to the needs of our own people. We are \nnatural partners in helping other nations respond to the \nneeds of theirs. Together, we must commit our \nresources and efforts to advancing education, health \nand prosperity.  \n Over the years, many nations have made well-\nintentioned efforts to promote these goals, but the \nsuccess of these efforts must be measured by more than \nintentions. It must be measured by results. My nation is \nplacing insistence on results at the heart of our foreign \nassistance programmes. We launched a new initiative, \ncalled the Millennium Challenge Account, which \ndirects our help to countries that demonstrate their \nability to produce results by governing justly, fighting \ncorruption and pursuing market-based economic \npolicies, as well as investing in their people. Every \ncountry and institution that provides foreign assistance, \nincluding the United Nations, will be more effective by \nshowing faith in the people of the developing world \nand insisting on performance in return for aid.  \n Experience also shows that, to be effective, we \nmust adopt a model of partnership, not paternalism. \nThis approach is based on our conviction that people in \nthe developing world have the capacity to improve \ntheir own lives and will rise to meet high expectations \nif we set them. America sought to apply this model in \nour Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Every nation that \nreceives American support through this initiative \ndevelops its own plan for fighting HIV/AIDS and \nmeasures the results.  \n So far, these results are inspiring. Five years ago, \n50,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa were receiving \ntreatment for HIV/AIDS; today, that number is nearly \n1.7 million. We are taking a similar approach to \nfighting malaria, and so far we have supported local \nefforts to protect more than 25 million Africans. \nMultilateral organizations have made bold \ncommitments of their own to fight disease. The G-8 \nhas pledged to match America\u2019s efforts on malaria and \nHIV/AIDS. Through the Global Fund, many countries \nare working to fight HIV/AIDS, malaria and \ntuberculosis. Lives in the developing world depend on \nthese programmes, and all who have made pledges to \nfight disease have an obligation to follow through on \ntheir commitments.  \n One of the most powerful engines of development \nand prosperity are trade and investment, which create \nnew opportunities for entrepreneurs, help people rise \nout of poverty and reinforce such fundamental values \nas transparency and the rule of law. For all these \nreasons, many represented in this Hall have conducted \nfree-trade agreements at the bilateral and regional \nlevels.  \n The most effective step of all would be an \nagreement that tears down trade barriers at the global \nlevel. The recent impasse in the Doha round is \ndisappointing, but that does not have to be the final \nword. I urge every nation to seize this opportunity to \nlift up economies around the world and reach a \nsuccessful Doha agreement as soon as possible. \nBeyond Doha, our nations must renew our commitment \nto open economies and stand firm against economic \nisolationism. These objectives are being tested by \nturbulence in the global financial markets.  \n Our economies are more closely connected than \never before, and I know that many of you here are \nwatching how the United States Government will \naddress the problems in our financial system. In recent \nweeks we have taken bold steps to prevent a severe \ndisruption of the American economy, which would \nhave a devastating effect on other economies around \nthe world. We promote stability in the markets by \npreventing the disorderly failure of major companies. \n  \n \n08-51570 12 \n \nThe Federal Reserve has injected urgently needed \nliquidity into the system. Last week, I announced \ndecisive action by the federal Government to address \nthe root cause of much of the instability in our \nfinancial markets by purchasing illiquid assets that are \nweighing down balance sheets and restricting the flow \nof credit. I can assure the Assembly that my \nAdministration and our Congress are working together \nto quickly pass legislation approving this strategy. And \nI am confident that we will act in the urgent time frame \nrequired.  \n The objectives I have laid out for multilateral \ninstitutions confronting terror, opposing tyranny and \npromoting effective development are difficult, but they \nare necessary tasks. To have maximum impact, \nmultilateral institutions must take on challenging \nmissions, and like all of us in this Hall they must work \ntowards measurable goals, be accountable for their \nactions and hold true to their word.  \n In the twenty-first century, the world needs a \ncompetent and effective United Nations. This unique \ninstitution should build on its successes and improve \nits performance. Where there is inefficiency and \ncorruption, that must be corrected. Where there are \nbloated bureaucracies, they must be streamlined. \nWhere Members fail to uphold their obligations, there \nmust be strong action \u2014 for example, there should be \nan immediate review of the Human Rights Council, \nwhich has routinely protected violators of human \nrights. There should be a stronger effort to help the \npeople of Burma live free of the repression they have \nsuffered for too long. All nations, especially members \nof the Security Council, must act decisively to ensure \nthat the Government of the Sudan upholds its \ncommitment to address the violence in Darfur. \n The United Nations is an Organization of \nextraordinary potential. As it rebuilds its Headquarters, \nit must also open the door to a new age of \ntransparency, accountability and seriousness of \npurpose. With determination and clear purpose, the \nUnited Nations can be a powerful force for good as we \nhead into the twenty-first century. It can affirm the \ngreat promise of its founding.  \n In the final days of the San Francisco Conference, \nthe delegates negotiating the United Nations Charter \nreceived a visit from President Harry Truman. He \nacknowledged the enormous challenges they faced and \nsaid that success was possible only because of what he \ncalled an unshakable unity of determination. Today, the \nworld is engaged in another period of great challenge, \nand by continuing to work together, that unshakable \nunity of determination will be ours. Together we can \nconfront and defeat the evil of terrorism. Together we \ncan secure the Almighty\u2019s gift of liberty and justice to \nmillions who have not known it. Together we can build \na world that is freer, safer and better for the \ngenerations who follow. "

I wish you every success in your mission. \n I should like also to thank your predecessor, \nMr. Srgjan Kerim, for all of his efforts in the previous \nsession. I should further like to thank the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his efforts to promote \nand revitalize the role of the United Nations. \n I need not remind anyone in this Hall, which \nholds such a high-level assembly, that the primary goal \nof this Organization and the fundamental purpose of its \nCharter is to achieve and maintain world peace. \n The human experience replete with hopes and \nhorrors reminds us all that world peace can only be \nachieved by a conscious, positive act and not through \nmere wishful thinking. We have sought to achieve \npeace through war in which the powerful tried to \nimpose their will, as in the two notorious world wars of \nthe twentieth century. \n We have sought to find peace through entente \nbetween empires, as between Britain and France in \n1904. We sought peace through coexistence between \nthe United States and the Soviet Union in 1971. In all \nthose attempts, either by war or by entente between \nPowers, by agreement between empires or by \ncoexistence between blocs and doctrines, peace has \nremained elusive. \n We have all come to realize through those long \nand exhausting experiences that achieving peace is a \npositive act that means more than just eliminating the \nthreat of weapons. While it is true that humanity has \nnot suffered a global war in the past 60 years, it is also \ntrue that peace in those last six decades has remained \nelusive. It has been a peace beset by conflicts on all \ncontinents and in all territories. We have also come to \nthe conclusion that in a world where barriers of \ndistance and time have come to evaporate, achieving \npeace means establishing and promoting economic and \nsocial justice among peoples. That is what constitutes \npositive peace. \n If the purposes and principles of the Charter have \nestablished the political rights of nations on the basis \nof international law, the right of peoples to social \n \n \n17 08-51570 \n \njustice must be based on the idea of development. In \nthe past, the first generation of advocates and \nsupporters of national liberation movements demanded \nwhat they called \u201cpositive neutrality\u201d, believing that \nthey could thus distance themselves from the wars of \nthe major powers. However, the realities of today\u2019s \nworld require a different approach, for peace cannot be \nachieved through conflict between powers, agreement \nbetween empires, or coexistence among blocs, and not \neven through positive neutrality. \n The alternative to those three options is our new \nchoice, namely positive peace, an era of international \nlaw that ensures political rights and an era of \ndevelopment offering parallel and equal opportunities \nin one world, which cannot go into the future burdened \nby the injustices of politics or blinded by the darkness \nof underdevelopment. \n Qatar is getting ready to host the follow-up \nInternational Conference on Financing for \nDevelopment. My country looks forward to an \ninternational cooperation that offers the broadest base \npossible for political as well as social peace. We hope \nthat participation the conference will be at the highest \npossible level. The goal is ambitious and the purpose is \nvital for the safety and peace of the one human global \nvillage. "

        "file_text": "Mr. President, \nwe would like to join previous speakers in \ncongratulating you upon your election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \nsession. We are confident that under your wise and \ndiligent leadership, our deliberations will be \nsuccessful. We take this opportunity to assure you of \nour full collaboration and wish you success in the \ndischarge of your important responsibilities. \n We wish to express our gratitude to your \npredecessor, Srgjan Kerim of the former Yugoslav \nRepublic of Macedonia, for the pragmatism and \ndynamism of his endeavours in conducting the work of \nthe sixty-second session. We also reiterate our \nappreciation to the Secretary-General of the United \nNations, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his engagement in the \nquest for peace, justice and solutions to the various \nchallenges faced by humanity. \n We have witnessed an increasing number of new \nand complex challenges. Among them, the food crisis \nis one of my country\u2019s main concerns owing to its \ndirect, immediate impact on the lives of our peoples. \nThe origin of this crisis may be linked to factors such \nas climate change and the subsequent irregular rainfall \nthat affects agricultural productivity; desertification of \nvast areas and droughts around the world; increased \ndemand for cereals; higher oil prices and the \nconsequent impact on the price of transportation and \nother products such as agricultural raw materials; the \nimpact of trade liberalization and agricultural subsidies \nin developed countries, which have led to a gradual \ndecline in agricultural production in developing \ncountries; and finally, the distortion of cereal prices \nacross the globe. \n Once the causes of the crisis have been identified, \nit becomes the responsibility of the international \ncommunity to implement relevant and necessary \nsolutions in a consistent and vigorous manner. Through \nthat process, the crisis can be transformed into an \nopportunity to boost international partnerships and \ndevelop our countries. \n In that context it is important to emphasize that \ninternational cooperation stimulates the revival of the \nproductivity of farmers in developing countries, thus \ncontributing to a speedy transformation of their current \nsubsistence farming practices into commercial \nagriculture. Such cooperation includes improved access \nto improved seeds and to fertilizers and pesticides, \ninvestments in infrastructure for market accessibility \nand water management. Accordingly, we reiterate the \nneed to implement the pertinent recommendations set \nforth at the Conference of the Least Developed \nCountries on the rules of the World Trade Organization \nand the food crisis. \n Likewise, we call for support for regional efforts \nsuch as the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture \nDevelopment Programme in the framework of NEPAD, \nand the ongoing work by the Southern African \nDevelopment Community, with a view to finding a \ncollective response to mitigate the impact of the food \ncrisis and to re-establish agriculture as the means to \nensure food supply and better conditions and quality of \nlife for the peoples of Southern Africa. \n  \n \n08-51839 6 \n \n Mozambique is vulnerable to natural disasters \nand to the dynamics of the international prices of food \nand fuel products. Those factors represent a major \nthreat to the implementation of the Government\u2019s \nsocio-economic programmes. Despite the notable \nprogress that we have been registering for our \nproduction of cassava and maize, we still import large \nquantities of other food products. Therefore, any cereal \nprice fluctuation in the world immediately affects the \nday-to-day lives of our people. \n Mozambique is endowed with natural resources \nwhich are favourable to mixed farming. However, the \nshortage of financial resources and the weak banking \nnetwork in the rural zones, combined with the lack of \ninfrastructure and technology to secure the \ndevelopment of commercial agriculture, have not \nallowed us to scale up our production to the levels that \ncould meet the food needs of our population. The \nsituation is worsened by poor distribution and \nmarketing systems, making it difficult to distribute and \nmarket the products from certain surplus zones to the \nneedy ones. Moreover, the cyclic natural disasters that \nhave struck us have resulted in losses of significant \nplantation areas, causing the people of those areas to \nlive permanently in need. Those calamities have also \ncaused soil erosion and depletion and as a consequence \nfood insecurity and malnutrition affect our people. \nMr. Choquehuanca C\u00e9spedes (Bolivia), Vice-\nPresident, took the Chair. \n In order to address the food crisis, our \nGovernment approved last June, a Food Production \nAction Plan for the period 2008-2011. The programme \nwas designed as a mechanism to implement the Green \nRevolution which we launched in 2007 and is goal-\noriented. We are aware that implementing the Action \nPlan together with the Green Revolution will require \nadditional resources, and we are therefore appealing \nfor such additional resources for those programmes. \nWe acknowledge the positive effect of the Green \nRevolution on the implementation of the MDGs, since \nno one can think about tomorrow or about education or \nabout gender equality or the empowerment of women if \nthey are hungry. \n In February 2008, we launched the Presidential \nInitiative for women and children. At that time, several \nmeetings were held with health professionals, religious \nand traditional leaders, women and youth. During those \nmeetings, which are being replicated at the local level, \nit became clear that health issues permeate the MDGs. \nAlthough the advances that we have recorded are \nsignificant, they are not sufficient to have an impact on \nthe reduction of avoidable deaths in Mozambique.  \n Our assessments show that we could, for \ninstance, reduce maternal mortality by more than \n50 per cent. We could achieve a decrease of 17 per cent \nin child mortality. We could significantly facilitate \naccess to antiretroviral treatment and to treatment for \ntuberculosis and malaria. We could, by 2010 have more \nthan 95 per cent of mothers and children sleeping \nunder insecticide-treated mosquito nets. However, in \norder to achieve those dreams, we are dependent upon \nan additional funding of $4 per capita a year for the \nhealth sector, from now until 2010. Additionally, we \nneed $10 million more for mosquito nets. The $590 \nmillion needed to fill the deficit during the next seven \nyears could help us train and employ around 20,000 \nadditional health workers. That amount would raise the \nnumber of doctors by 119 per cent, the number of \nnurses and of mothers with access to health care would \nrise by 68 per cent. \n Our dream is to prevent more avoidable deaths. \nAs we have indicated, we cannot realize that dream by \nourselves. We need the predictable, substantial and \nlong-term support of our partners to meet the needs \nthat I have just identified. We need an efficient health-\ncare system and coordinated support from our \ninternational partners, which is a noble way to ensure \nthe achievement of MDG 8, which focuses on \ndeveloping a global partnership for development. \n We therefore wish to take this opportunity to \ncommend and encourage the perseverance of the \ninternational solidarity movement in helping Africa, \nand Mozambique in particular, in the context of \nwomen\u2019s and children\u2019s health with a view to fulfilling \nall the commitments made at the Millennium Summit. \nIn numerous parts of the world, funds have been \nsolicited and initiatives undertaken in support of our \nprogrammes. That interaction with our partners has led \nto the building of the necessary consensus on priorities \nand strategies to ensure sustainable development. \n The world is changing and, along with all those \nchanges, new global challenges have arisen. The \nUnited Nations is a universal institution with the \nlegitimacy and the mandate to debate strategies and \nfind solutions to such major challenges. Nevertheless, \nstructural reforms are needed in order to improve the \n \n \n7 08-51839 \n \nOrganization\u2019s ability to overcome the current \nchallenges. In that regard, the reform process should be \npursued so that the United Nations can achieve greater \nunity and improve its ability to provide appropriate \nresponses to the challenges ahead, which will require \nus to strengthen multilateralism and promote \npartnerships for peace, security and development \nacross the world. \n In conclusion, we reiterate the importance of \ninternational cooperation to secure the production of \nsufficient and affordable food for all and to build a \nviable consensus for United Nations reform."

        "file_text": "It is indeed \nmy pleasure, on behalf of the leadership, people and \nGovernment of the Sudan, to greet the General \nAssembly as it meets in its sixty-third session. We wish \nits deliberations every success and hope to witness \ntangible progress on all the issues and challenges that \nmust be given priority by this Organization. We refer, \nof course, to the maintenance of international peace \nand security; realizing the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs); containing the food crisis, poverty, \nhunger, climate change and water shortages; and \nreactivating the role of the United Nations in a \nchanging world.  \n We are indeed delighted to see Mr. Miguel \nd\u2019Escoto Brockmann chairing this session. We are \nconfident that, with his wisdom, experience and \nperspicacity, we may indeed be hopeful and optimistic \nthat the international community will realize its \nambitions for global development, reconstruction and \nprosperity. \n I also wish to strongly commend and thank \nAmbassador Srgjan Kerim for the competence with \nwhich he conducted the work of the sixty-second \nsession. We also thank the Secretary-General and his \nstaff for the efforts that they continue to deploy in the \nservice of the mandate of this Organization. \n This session of the General Assembly falls amid \nsome very important and particular developments in \nthe international and regional spheres. Millions are \nlooking forward to a world of peace, stability and \nprosperity that respects the common values and \nprinciples enshrined in the Charter of the United \nNations, notably respect for the sovereignty of States, \ntheir choices, the peaceful settlement of disputes and \njoint cooperation in all fields. \n Although we continue to hope for and work \ntowards a capable and efficient United Nations and a \ncomplete framework for multilateral cooperation that \ntakes into consideration the wealth and diversity of the \ninternational community, we in the developing \n  \n \n08-51851 20 \n \ncountries, especially in the African continent, remain \nprofoundly convinced of the need to maintain those \nobjectives and principles. We recall that our African \ncontinent has had a long and difficult journey as a \nresult of its backwardness since it broke the yoke of \ncolonialism and fought its post-independence wars, \nduring which the objectives and aspirations of Africans \nto lead a dignified life were forever thwarted by the \nso-called lost decades of development and the \nunfavourable economic and trade atmosphere. The \npolitical and security situation of the African continent \nhas made it vulnerable to foreign interventions and \nconspiracies that have undermined its stability and \nrendered peace a more distant prospect.  \n In addition to discussing the various and well-\nknown threats and dangers facing the African continent \nand all developing nations, I should like to draw \nattention to and warn about the danger of the abuse of \nwhat is called \u201cuniversal jurisdiction\u201d. That concept \nthat was condemned in July 2008 at the Sharm \nel-Sheikh summit, which called on the Security \nCouncil and the General Assembly to seriously \nexamine the issue and to cancel it. The politicization \nand abuse of the aforementioned principle clearly \nshows that disregard for and non-compliance with \npolitical and professional norms that are guided by the \nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and of \ninternational law, together with the application of \ndouble standards, pose grave dangers for the region \nand beyond, threatening the stability and prestige of \nthe institutions of the international order. \n Achieving peace and stability in the Sudan has \nbeen a firm priority objective of our Government, \nwhich has demonstrated its commitment to the option \nof peace, as reflected in the historic milestone achieved \nwhen we signed the Comprehensive Peace Agreement \non 9 January 2005 in Nairobi. The Agreement, which \nended the longest-running conflict on the African \ncontinent since the colonial era, was reinforced by the \nDarfur Peace Agreement, signed at Abuja, and the \nEastern Sudan Peace Agreement, signed at Asmara, \nEritrea. \n Our efforts to achieve peace have proceeded from \nour conviction that peace will create a favourable \nenvironment for the development of the Sudan\u2019s vast \nagricultural resources and wealth, which in turn will \nensure the sustainability of peace. Furthermore, peace \nin the Sudan is a strategic goal aimed at reinforcing \nstability in neighbouring countries, the region and the \ncontinent. Thus, we appeal to all members of the \ninternational community, through the Assembly, to \nsupport the efforts to achieve peace and stability in the \nSudan. By so doing, they will promote, enhance and \nguarantee peace and stability in the region and on the \nAfrican continent. We must avoid doing anything that \ncould negatively affect or jeopardize those efforts. \n While our country is firmly committed to \nimplementing the provisions of the Comprehensive \nPeace Agreement, in particular by holding general \nelections during the first half of next year and by \ncompleting our national programmes for disarmament, \ndemobilization and reintegration and de-mining, we \nhope that the international community will honour its \nfinancial commitments, including those pledges \nannounced in Oslo in 2005 and in Norway in May \n2008. \n Here, in view of the difficulties and obstacles that \nwe have encountered in implementing the Agreement, I \nshould like to recall a principle of Western thought \nregarding the difference between words and deeds. We \nin the Sudan believe that our desire for the cancellation \nof our foreign debt is in accordance with the spirit and \nrequirements of peace agreements, since that debt is \nhampering our reconstruction efforts. We also call for \nthe lifting of the unilateral sanctions imposed against \nour country, which defeat the true purpose of a \ncomprehensive peace. In that way, the citizens of the \nSudan could benefit from the dividends of peace. \n The problem of Darfur has been the chief concern \nof the people and the Government of the Sudan. No \none is more eager than our people to achieve peace and \nstability in Darfur, which, after all, is their problem and \ntheir responsibility. From this rostrum, we reaffirm our \nfull commitment to achieving a peaceful political \nsettlement of the crisis in Darfur, one that will enhance \nthe ongoing peace process through positive actions. \nThese include the implementation of the People of the \nSudan initiative, aimed at developing a national \nconsensus as to the best way to resolve the issue, as \nstated by the President of the Republic during his \nrecent important visit to Darfur; the appointment of \nMr. Jebreel Basoli, Joint Chief Negotiator, whom we \nfully support; the establishment of an Arab-African \ncommittee, co-chaired by the Prime Minister of Qatar, \nthe Chairperson of the Commission of the African \nUnion and the Secretary-General of the League of Arab \nStates, to mediate peace negotiations between the \nGovernment of the Sudan and the armed movements in \n \n \n21 08-51851 \n \nDarfur, in close cooperation and coordination with the \nrepresentatives of the African Union and the United \nNations; and the implementation of the initiative that \nwas supported and welcomed by the African Union, the \nLeague of Arab States and the Secretary-General of the \nUnited Nations. The Sudanese Government of National \nUnity sincerely hopes that those efforts will promptly \nlead to comprehensive peace and stability in Darfur. \n We had hoped that the signing of the Darfur \nPeace Agreement on 5 May 2006 as a result of the \ngenerous mediation of the African Union would \nencourage the movements that had not signed the \nComprehensive Peace Agreement to do so. In \nparticular, in order to ensure full implementation of the \nAgreement, power-sharing and the establishment of the \nTransitional Darfur Regional Authority, male and \nfemale citizens of Darfur have been appointed to \nexecutive and legislative positions and various \narrangements have been put in place to ensure wealth- \nand power-sharing and security. \n However, as members are all aware, the \nmovements that oppose peace have continued to \nboycott all the negotiations, undermining the efforts of \nMr. Jan Eliasson and Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim. The \nmovements have continued to reject the peace option \nand to choose the military option, not to serve the \ninterests of the people of Darfur but to pursue a policy \naimed at regime change in the Sudan, as demonstrated \nin the military aggression carried out on 10 May 2008 \nagainst the Sudanese capital itself. Those movements \nwould not have been able to do what they did had they \nnot been receiving mixed or wrong messages from \nsome circles, since they saw that the non-signatories \nwere not being pressured to join the organ of peace, \nwhile those who signed the treaty were. That increased \nthe intransigence of the non-signatories, threatening \nthe chances for peace and the humanitarian conditions. \n With regard to peacekeeping \u2014 and in \naccordance with the principles of positive cooperation \nwith the United Nations and the African Union under \nthe agreement reached at the high-level understandings \nin Addis Ababa on 16 November 2006, which led to the \nadoption of Security Council resolution 1769 (2007) \nestablishing the mandate of the joint African Union-\nUnited Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur \n(UNAMID) \u2014 the Government of the Sudan has \nfulfilled its commitments with regard to its role in the \npeace process in Darfur and indeed has fulfilled many \nother steps. The status of forces agreement has been \nconcluded. The mandate was transferred from the \nAfrican Union Mission in the Sudan to UNAMID on \n31 December of last year. The headquarters have been \nbuilt and operational capacities have been established \nin the three states of Darfur. Periodic coordination \nmeetings between the Government of the Sudan and \nthe command of the joint operation have been \ndeliberating on all the problems and resolving them.  \n On the humanitarian level, the Government of the \nSudan remains committed to executing the \nhumanitarian communiqu\u00e9 concluded with the United \nNations on 28 March 2007, which is being \nimplemented in an exemplary manner as a result of the \nmatchless follow-up mechanism to track the \nimplementation of the humanitarian communiqu\u00e9 and \nthe special efforts of the Government to open \nhumanitarian corridors in Darfur and to facilitate the \ndelivery of humanitarian aid. Once again we renew our \ncommitment to that effort. \n At a time when the Government of National \nUnity has taken giant strides to implement the peace \nagreement, with the full support of the President of the \nRepublic, the electoral law has been passed and \napproved by parliament to usher the Sudan to yet \nanother phase of democratic transformation and \npeaceful transfer of power through general elections to \nbe held in 2009.  \n The country is fully mobilized and engaged in \nturning over the page of violence and war in Darfur, \nand amid those developments came the request of the \nProsecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) to \nthe Pre-Trial Chamber to issue an arrest warrant. An \narrest warrant against whom? Against a man who \nended the longest war in Africa, a man who brought \npeace to eastern Sudan and laid the foundations for \npeace in Darfur. That request targeted the leadership of \nthe State, the symbol of its sovereignty and dignity, in \na failed attempt at political and moral assassination, as \nwell as causing delay or erosion of the peace process \nfor ulterior motives unrelated to justice or to the \nrealization of peace and stability in Darfur, and in a \nState that is not a signatory to the Rome Statute.  \n Moreover, the actions of the Prosecutor disregard \nthe road map agreed upon by the Sudan, the United \nNations and the African Union on the basis of the \nAddis Ababa understanding in November 2006 and the \ninternational conference on Darfur held alongside the \nlast session of the General Assembly. The road map \n  \n \n08-51851 22 \n \nwas further reiterated and endorsed by the Security \nCouncil in its resolution 1769 (2007). The road map \nwas based on four tracks: rehabilitation and \ndevelopment, the peace process as a priority, the \npeacekeeping operation and the humanitarian track. \nThus the Prosecutor is turning upside down the issue of \naccountability, which the Government of the Sudan \nsupports and which is already being handled by a \ncompetent and effective Sudanese judiciary, and giving \nit a completely different character by introducing it \ninto the International Criminal Court and destabilizing \njustice and peace in the Sudan and the region. It is an \nopen invitation to the rebel movements that oppose \npeace to stay away from the peace option. The actions \nof the Prosecutor seek to influence negatively the \nelections to be held in 2009, through which the \nGovernment will enter into a new phase of peace and \ndemocratic transformation. \n From this rostrum, in the name of the \nGovernment and the people of the Sudan, who were \nunanimous in rejecting that step, I thank and commend \nall the active forces of more than two thirds of the \ninternational community, which through their regional, \ngeographic and political institutions and organizations \nhave condemned the measures taken by the ICC \nProsecutor and called on the Security Council to rectify \nthe situation arising from that action. Here I \nspecifically mean the member States of the African \nUnion, the League of Arab States, the Non-Aligned \nMovement, the Organization of the Islamic \nConference, the member States of the African, \nCaribbean and Pacific Group of States and other \ncountries that have expressed their disapproval and \ntheir complete rejection of that step taken by the ICC \nProsecutor.  \n I would like to assure the Assembly that the \nGovernment of the Sudan is making progress in its \nresolute and principled goal of achieving lasting peace \nand removing the bitterness of war and its legacy in \naccordance with the values and principles of the people \nof the Sudan and their mores, customs and traditions, \nwhich are based on peaceful coexistence, reconciliation \nand tolerance. The establishment of peace in Darfur \nand in the Sudan and the steps taken by the Prosecutor \nof the International Criminal Court are two parallel \nlines that can never meet, hence such situations must \nbe rectified as soon as possible and there must be a \nreturn to the commitment to the political process. \n Since the issue of more democratic international \nrelations was one of the subjects proposed for the \ngeneral debate of this session, our country, like all \nother African countries, has been following the efforts \nto reform this Organization \u2014 especially the Security \nCouncil, which is charged with the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security and which has \nremained as it is since its inception while the entire \ninternational arena has been changing. That made \nreforming that Council an urgent priority, so that it can \nbe more responsive to the aspirations of the developing \nnations.  \n I am referring specifically to Africa, which has no \npermanent representation in the Security Council, \nwhose agenda is beset with African issues. Here I \nwould like to reiterate that the Sudan is in accord with \nthe African position included in the Ezulwini document \non the issue of reforming the modus operandi and rules \nof procedure of the United Nations so that it can be \nmore democratic, transparent, express equitable \ngeographic representation of the world\u2019s continents and \nreflect the developments that the world has seen since \n1945. \n Economic and trade developments compete with \neach other. The failure of economic structures in many \ndeveloping and least developed countries constitutes a \nproblem that raises obstacles for the movement to \nrealize the MDGs as soon as possible. The current \nstructure of the international economy, with its \nrestrictive, unfair trade practices and restrictions on the \nexports of developing nations, is a negative impact of \nglobalization, in addition to the heavy external debt \nburden that paralyzes the region\u2019s national economic \ndevelopment. Those obstacles are very serious and \nretard development, especially in the African continent.  \n The United Nations Millennium Summit \nemphasized the special position of Africa as a priority \nwith regard to international assistance and channels of \ncooperation and support through relevant initiatives \nlike the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development \n(NEPAD) and other regional, subregional and national \ninitiatives.  \n Here, let me mention that the Sudan has \nimplemented several quick-income projects and several \nshort-term projects to benefit vulnerable groups. \nRegarding the attainment of MDGs \u2014 especially the \nalleviation of poverty, the development and support of \neducation, health and the fight against diseases like \n \n \n23 08-51851 \n \nmalaria \u2014 the State is still directing its efforts to attain \nthose objectives and to realize sustainable \ndevelopment. We must take into consideration the \npotential of the country and its vast resources, which, \naccording to reports of relevant international \norganizations, make it capable of helping to solve the \nglobal food crisis by providing food for millions \naround the world. \n National efforts in the Sudan can currently be \nseen in the context of efforts to develop and revitalize \nthe agricultural sector and to realize a comprehensive \ngreen revolution. Here I must emphasize the serious \nnegative impact of phenomena like climate change and \nenvironmental deterioration, which have constituted \nreasons for war and conflict in Africa. The conflict in \nDarfur is one practical example of the impact of those \nphenomena and how they directly affect the daily lives \nand needs of individuals.  \n The Sudan, as a party to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) \nsince 1999, emphasizes the need to put more effort and \ncoordination into intensifying multilateral action to \nface those phenomena and to achieve a more efficient \nsystem for the post-2012 era. Developing nations must \nalso participate in dealing with the causes and effects \nof climate change. \n The Sudan is of the view that developed nations \nshould fulfil their commitments to capacity-building \nand should provide the financial and technical \nresources to support developing nations in facing those \nproblems. \n The Sudan emphasizes the fact that the \nmaintenance of international peace and security \nrequires, first and foremost, an urgent solution to the \nproblem in Palestine and that the situation be dealt \nwith in a decisive and serious manner, especially in \nview of the tragic situation that the Palestinian people \nin the occupied territories are facing. The international \ncommunity is called upon today more than any other \ntime to put pressure on the occupying authorities to \nabide by resolutions of international legitimacy so that \nthe Palestinian people may realize their full right to \nself-determination and the establishment of an \nindependent State with Jerusalem as its capital.  \n In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that for \nthe United Nations to continue playing its important \nrole imposes on us a collective responsibility to find \nthe solid will and determination to make the \nOrganization a truly collective framework for \nmultilateral, international efforts to deal effectively and \njustly with international issues and problems. The \nUnited Nations must establish clear and transparent \npartnerships according to the Charter with regional \norganizations in order to realize regional and \ninternational peace and security. The Sudan, as a \ncommitted and active member of this Organization, \nwill remain faithful to the objectives that constitute our \ncollective effort.  "

It is an honour for me to \nrepresent a people who have fought for their well-being \nand freedom for decades, specifically the past 54 years. \nMy Administration is an expression of precisely that \ndesire, because, after all those years, governmental \nactions are now being prioritized around the human \nperson, the concepts of solidarity and social cohesion \nand, especially, in the 254 days since I took office, \nattention to the poorest and most marginalized among \nour population, in particular the 23 indigenous peoples \nthat constitute our nation.  \n First, I should like to commend Mr. Miguel \nd\u2019Escoto Brockmann, whom we, with much Central \nAmerican pride, see presiding over the General \nAssembly at its present session, following in the \nfootsteps of a fellow Guatemalan, Mr. Emilio Arenales \nCatal\u00e1n. I know that Miguel\u2019s experience and life \nexample will ensure the success of this session.  \n I also wish to thank the United Nations for \nassisting Guatemala in its peace process and for \nfollowing up on it with the United Nations Verification \nMission in Guatemala (MINUGUA) and, most \nrecently, with the presence of the International \nCommission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), a \nunique mechanism that will help us combat \nimpunity \u2014 indeed, we are the only country to have \nsuch a mechanism.  \n Participating in the present session of the \nAssembly are world leaders who will be remembered \nin 10 or 20 years\u2019 time for having had the wisdom to \nemerge from the present crisis \u2014 a crisis regarding \nwhich, in certain areas and at certain times, there has \nbeen a marked absence of global solidarity. I join \nMiguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann in his appeal for \nsolidarity. I believe that the great remedy for this crisis \nis global solidarity. We have globalized trade and \ninformation, but we have not gained the wisdom to \nglobalize humanity or to globalize labour to ensure that \nmigrants are not treated as criminals and that \u2014 like \nproducts, trade and money \u2014 they have freedom of \nmovement across borders. Our migrants seek nothing \nmore than the opportunities offered by globalization \nand the opening of borders. It was that very opening \nthat worsened their poverty and encouraged them to \nabandon their communities.  \n That is why I am making a special appeal and \nproposal to the Secretary-General that we no longer try \nto resolve the problem of migration bilaterally; rather, \nwe must do so as a bloc. For example, I should like to \npropose that the United Nations create a forum \ncomposed of former Presidents of countries of origin \nand countries receiving great numbers of migrants, \nsuch as the brotherly countries of El Salvador, \nHonduras, Guatemala, Colombia, Ecuador and Mexico. \nTogether, in six months\u2019 time, we could formulate a \nspecific proposal to finally put an end to a situation \nthat is a scourge for so many families, so many \nGuatemalans and many other nations.  \n I should also like to discuss the scourges of drug \ntrafficking and organized crime, which greatly afflict \nour populations. Only 254 days after taking office, our \nGovernment has begun a comprehensive process of \nreforming the security forces. We have changed the \nhigh command of the army and the entire command of \nthe national police so that we can fight impunity \ntogether with CICIG and the United Nations system. \nThus, Guatemala can finally achieve the true, firm and \nlasting peace for which, with such hope, we signed an \nagreement here on 29 December 1996.  \n Everything that happens in the outside world \naffects us. Foreign manipulation and speculation \nrelated to oil and food affects us. As my good friend \nPresident Saca of El Salvador said earlier, our \ncountries are accomplishing their national tasks. In 254 \ndays, my Government has, through social cohesion, \nreturned to the people of Guatemala what belongs to \nthem under their Constitution: free education and \nhealth care \u2014 totally free, as stipulated in the \nConstitution. We have broken a paradigm. In \nGuatemala, it used to be forbidden to get sick after \n5 p.m., because the country\u2019s health clinics closed at \nthat time. Today, 52 municipalities out of a total of 333 \nalready have comprehensive health services. In \naddition, 300,000 children now have renovated schools \nwith teachers, desks and all the necessary equipment.  \n With determination, we can do what is required, \nbut we need solidarity among everyone. We need and \nparticipate in Central American solidarity, which \nenables us to tell the world that the free market works. \n \n \n29 08-51839 \n \nWe have had a common market for 50 years, and we \nknow that it works. But we also know that that \ncommon market requires social solidarity among \nourselves. \n I have always believed that solidarity is not \ngiving what one has left over, but rather giving what \nsomeone else needs; it is very easy to give what one \nhas left over. Giving what someone else needs requires \nwill and solidarity. We are aware of \u2014 and have heard \nour colleagues\u2019 statements about \u2014 this international \ncrisis, but there is a much deeper crisis. The crises that \nthe world\u2019s leaders must face are the crisis of hunger, \nthe crisis of discrimination and the crisis of poverty. It \nis the crisis of hunger that all the Governments present \nhere today are fighting against, but that is also a global \nissue. We in Guatemala are a people of maize, but a \nfew years ago they said it was bad business to plant \nmaize and destroyed the production systems. Today, \nGuatemala imports maize. \n I believe that now is the time for solidarity and \ntrue global security. Perhaps civil security is the easiest \nto achieve, despite the fact that my country is complex. \nSovereignty of food, sovereignty of health, sovereignty \nof knowledge \u2014 these are more difficult to achieve.  \n We have planned to achieve solidarity, \nproductivity, a regional spirit and governance. We have \nestablished a system of national dialogue that is \nenabling all the country\u2019s social sectors to come to the \nnegotiating table, to arrive at a true national \nunderstanding and to begin rebuilding a country that, \nfor 54 years, was afflicted by marginalization, the cold \nwar, hunger and bad Governments.  \n I am convinced that new times have come for \nLatin America. I am convinced that all our Latin \nAmerican summits and meetings herald new times. We \nhave our differences and individual characteristics, but \nLatin America has begun to look north, south and to \nthe centre, to the Caribbean, and we see a continent \nwith the possibility of stronger unity, of stronger \nhorizontal South-South cooperation and North-South \ncooperation. Our neighbours, our dear Central \nAmerica \u2014 we are peoples rooted in the region who \nwant a strong and united Central America. \n This Assembly could take a momentous turn for \nour future as a planet. Of course we are concerned by \nclimate change, but we have to maintain our Mayan \nbiosphere so that others can breathe while our \ncommunities are dying of hunger. That is solidarity. We \ngive oxygen, but we receive technology. We give \noxygen, but we receive solidarity. We give oxygen, and \nwe receive the understanding of countries that we \ndeserve a better fate on the basis of this international \nsolidarity.  \n We have also promoted tax reform. It is no secret \nfor many that tax reform in Guatemala meant problems \nand coups d\u2019\u00e9tat. But now we have tax reform, with a \ngood level of consensus. There is also commitment to \ntransparency and to the quality of expenditures. In only \n254 days 7 per cent of the national budget was directed \nto the poor, money that used to be and today would \nhave been spent entirely on other things and without \nreference to the poor. Seven towns have begun to lower \ntheir maternal mortality indicators. Health centres are \npacked, because they now provide services and they \nare open. There are significantly more children in \nschools in the 45 towns that are priorities. This can be \ndone, if there is the determination to do it. \n Our security is perhaps the greatest while El \nSalvador, Colombia and Mexico are more successful in \nfighting drug trafficking. Guatemala pays the bills. \nThat is why in this brief time I wish to thank my \nneighbours, Colombia, for the support that they have \ngiven us so that we can confront drug trafficking and \norganized crime on a regional scale. Our young people \nshould not have to pay for the weaknesses of others. \nOur unassuming people and our indigenous people \nshould not have to pay for the vices of others. I believe \nthat if we work regionally things will go better.  \n I should like to acknowledge and reiterate our \ngratitude to the United Nations system for the peace in \nGuatemala that was sought during the eight years of \nnegotiations, in which I had the honour to take part. Its \nfollow-up with the United Nations Mission for the \nVerification of Human Rights and of Compliance with \nthe Commitments of the Comprehensive Agreement on \nHuman Rights in Guatemala (MINUGUA) and now \nwith the presence of the International Commission \nagainst Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) makes it easier \nfor us to take the difficult road towards the integration \nand development of Guatemala and towards equity in \nGuatemala. \n I should like to share with members that the \nprogrammes for social cohesion that were learned and \ndeveloped in Guatemala, but also acquired in friendly \ncountries, are yielding results. The \u201cMy Family Makes \nProgress\u201d programme is now affecting 40,000 families, \n  \n \n08-51839 30 \n \nand the young people are going to school and to health \nfacilities. The \u201cShopping Bag Solidarity\u201d programme is \nyielding results in the urban areas, and \u201cOpen Schools\u201d \nis reducing delinquency in the areas of higher risk in \nGuatemala City. \n If we had the courage to globalize the economy \nwe would now have the challenge, and almost the \nobligation, to globalize all of mankind. Such \nglobalization would lead to comprehensive, global \nsolidarity; it could be the way to save our planet. It \ncould be that we save it by combining our successes \nand trying to avoid our errors. "

        "file_text": "Allow \nme to begin by warmly congratulating His Excellency \nMr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann upon his election to \nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\n \n \n17 08-52265 \n \nthird session. His election honours his long-lasting \npersonal commitment to the preservation of peace and \nsecurity and, particularly, his constant efforts to \nencourage reconciliation in Central America. I also \nwish to thank Mr. Srgjan Kerim for his excellent \nservice as President of the General Assembly at its \nprevious session.  \n I would also like to thank the Secretary-General, \nBan Ki-moon, for his generous and ongoing efforts to \nhelp reform our Organization, in particular those \naiming to improve its working methods and its \ninteraction with its Member States.  \n Twenty years ago, the fall of the Berlin Wall \nmarked the end of a cold war era that had been \ncharacterized by ideological divisions, arms races and \na weak multilateral system with inefficient \nmechanisms. With the end of that era came great hope \nand aspirations from the world\u2019s peoples, leading some \nto believe in the beginning of a new world order \u2014 a \nworld order that would not only be more fair and \nequitable, but also distinguished by a culture of \nforgiveness among its nations. That new order was also \nmeant to spread the values of democracy and human \nrights, giving priority to development and the better \nand more efficient utilization of technological \nadvancements. At the same time, some people \npredicted that that new world order would restore \nprestige to the United Nations, allowing it to achieve \nmore consensus on international issues.  \n Rather than fulfilling the expectations of a better \nworld after the cold war, today\u2019s reality has seen an \nincrease in regional and internal conflicts, especially \non the African continent. This situation is exacerbated \nby a race for energy resources and a frenzied \nexploitation of precious minerals.  \n At the economic and trade levels, the launch of \nthe World Trade Organization in 1994 in Marrakesh led \nto a substantial acceleration of world trade exchanges, \nbut it did not create a fair trade system that would \nrespond to the expectations of developing countries.  \n Indeed, in spite of the efforts deployed in \nnumerous United Nations conferences, official \ndevelopment assistance (ODA) has significantly \ndecreased over recent years. In fact, the assistance \nprovided by donor countries does not meet the \nexpectations of developing countries despite the \nformer\u2019s commitment to increase their global annual \nassistance to developing countries to $50 billion by \n2010.  \n Therefore, notwithstanding the progress achieved \nover previous years, Morocco, in addition to other \ncountries, expresses its concern regarding the delay in \nthe launching of development processes in many \nAfrican countries. That delay is partly due to the \ncomplexity of the current international situation \nparticularly marked by economic and financial crises, \nwhich have had an impact on food security and the \nenergy needs of these countries. Those circumstances \nundermine years of ongoing efforts towards the \ndevelopment of African countries. In order to improve \nthat situation, the Kingdom of Morocco urges the \nUnited Nations and relevant financial institutions to \nundertake all the arrangements necessary to stabilize \nthe food market, to maintain social stability in \ndeveloping countries and to open the market to \nagricultural products, taking into consideration the \ncircumstances of the least developed countries.  \n The weak role of the United Nations in \nmaintaining peace and security throughout the world \nduring the cold war period was followed by a new \nphase, during which the multilateral system was \ncharacterized by the convening of several meetings and \nconferences focused on various global issues, as well \nas by the deployment of numerous peacekeeping \noperations, especially in Africa. As a troop-\ncontributing country, Morocco has spared no efforts to \nincrease its involvement in United Nations \npeacekeeping forces. The Kingdom is also actively \npromoting the enhancement of South-South \ncooperation by giving priority to African countries.  \n To parallel the changes taking place in the \ninternational arena, United Nations Member States \nlaunched major reforms centred on improving the \nOrganization\u2019s actions, reinforcing its role and \nenhancing its mechanisms. Nevertheless, some \nweaknesses remain in coordination among the various \nUnited Nations bodies and between the Organization \nitself and regional organizations. That is particularly \nevident in the efforts to contain and prevent regional \nconflicts with potential spillover effects.  \n At this point, it is important to strengthen \nmultilateralism in order to meet new challenges and to \nput in place a new order based on justice and equality. \nThe pursuit of such an approach is not merely an \noption but is necessary, given the serious challenges \n  \n \n08-52265 18 \n \nfacing international peace and security and sustainable \neconomic and social development. \n The Middle East peace process, initiated at the \nMadrid Conference in 1991, was unfortunately \nunsuccessful in ending the conflict, which continues to \nsee heavy daily casualties and causes millions of \nPalestinians to live in inhumane and tragic conditions. \nIn this context Morocco closely follows the latest \ndevelopments regarding the situation in the Middle \nEast and encourages all initiatives aiming to bring \npeace to that region, with respect to international \nlegality and to the agreements previously reached, \nnamely the Road Map and the Arab Peace Initiative.  \n This last initiative undoubtedly represents a \nrealistic solution, reflecting the true commitment of \nArab countries to reach a just, comprehensive and \nlasting solution that would allow the Palestinian people \nto establish an independent State with Al-Quds as its \ncapital and force Israel to withdraw from all occupied \nArab land, a solution that would enable the people and \nthe countries of the Middle East to live in peace, \nstability and security.  \n The Kingdom of Morocco equally expresses the \nnecessity to respect the particular situation of \nJerusalem by avoiding degrading and humiliating \npractices and curtailing any attempts to undermine the \nspecificities of the Holy City in regard to culture, \nreligion and civilization. In this regard, His Majesty \nKing Mohammed VI, Chairman of the Al-Quds \nCommittee, spares no effort in encouraging world \nleaders to help put an end to the projects taking place \naround the Al-Aqsa Mosque and in other parts of \nJerusalem.  \n As far as Iraq is concerned, we closely follow \nprogress on the ground and encourage dialogue and \nnational reconciliation between the different ethnic, \npolitical and cultural factions in order to end the cycle \nof violence, to reach peace and stability, to preserve the \nterritorial integrity of that brotherly country and to \nallow it to rebuild its economy.  \n Morocco also launched a regional initiative in \nJune 2006 by convening an international ministerial \nconference on migration, development, environment \nand climate change. Morocco considers the celebration \nof the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration \nof Human Rights the right occasion to appoint a United \nNations special rapporteur on human rights issues. It \nwould aim to appropriately equip the United Nations to \nplay a leading role in ensuring that all citizens\u2019 rights \nare protected and that the laws and political and \neconomic mechanisms regarding respect for human \nrights are harmonized in order to promote those rights.  \n The United Nations is based on the principles of \ncooperation and neighbourly relations, with regional \nintegration and cooperation representing the best \nmeans to ensure stability, economic development and \nan improved collective future. Since its independence, \nthe Kingdom of Morocco has placed the project of an \nArab Maghreb Union at the top of its priorities and \nconsidered it a strategic option. Morocco is firmly \ncommitted to making the Arab Maghreb Union the \nherald of an era of peace and the fulfilment of the \ncommon destiny of the populations of this region.  \n The Kingdom of Morocco is strongly convinced \nabout and deeply committed to overcoming all \nobstacles and to moving forward with regional \nintegration into the Arab Maghreb Union. The \nMoroccan autonomy initiative regarding the Western \nSahara, which was described by the Security Council \nas serious and credible, is the result of in-depth \nnational consultations and widespread international \nconsultations. As a result, the Security Council \nsuccessfully and unanimously adopted three \nresolutions \u2014 1754 (2007), 1783 (2007) and 1813 \n(2008) \u2014 that call upon parties to enter into true \nnegotiations, taking into consideration the latest \ndevelopments and particularly the Moroccan initiative, \nwhich launched a new dynamic in favour of a lasting \nsolution to this conflict. \n Morocco remains strongly committed to \ncontinuing those negotiations with sincerity and \ngoodwill in order to find a final solution to that \nregional conflict, one that would respect the national \nsovereignty and territorial integrity of the Kingdom of \nMorocco and give the benefits of autonomy to the \nSahara and its population. It would be a lasting, \ncomprehensive and realistic solution to that regional \nconflict.  \n A strong, open, integrated and stable Arab \nMaghreb can play a key role in maintaining regional \npeace and security. Along the shores of the \nMediterranean, it can also contribute to enhancing \nAfrican integration and play an active role as an \nefficient and credible partner to achieve the noble goals \nfor which the United Nations was created.

        "file_text": "I am honoured to be here \ntoday on behalf of the Government of Canada to once \nagain reaffirm my country\u2019s commitment to a strong \nand effective United Nations. \n(spoke in French) \n For Canada, the United Nations remains \nindispensable for addressing the many global \nchallenges that confront us today, be it the search for \npeace and security, the promotion of human rights, \ndemocracy and international development, combating \nterrorism or the protection of the environment. \n(spoke in English) \n Those challenges require collective and \ncooperative strategies. They cannot be tackled by any \none country acting alone. That is why we must \nredouble our efforts to make the United Nations more \neffective and efficient so that it can deliver real results. \n Today, I would like to speak to the Assembly \nabout Canada\u2019s priority global engagements, and how \nthey are helping to achieve the fundamental objectives \nof this Organization. \n From the very founding of the United Nations, \nCanada has contributed ideas, action and resources to \nhelp to fulfil its mandate. We helped to develop the \nconcept of peacekeeping. We helped it to meet the \nchanging nature of security, when more robust action \nwas required to end conflict, to protect civilians caught \nin the crossfire or to build peace in its aftermath. We \nhave served in successive peacekeeping and \npeacemaking operations and today we are serving on \nthe Peacebuilding Commission. \n Today, Canada is contributing to peace and \nsecurity and making sacrifices in places as diverse as \nAfghanistan, Haiti and the Sudan. Each of those \nCanadian engagements flows from a United Nations \nmandate. \n Canada\u2019s largest and most important overseas \nengagement is in Afghanistan, where we have more \nthan 2,500 Canadians on the ground in support of the \nSecurity Council-mandated International Security \nAssistance Force. Canada continues to call for safe and \nunhindered humanitarian access to all those in need in \nAfghanistan. We condemn in the strongest possible \nterms the attack of 14 September against members of a \nUnited Nations convoy in Kandahar province who \nwere carrying out a polio vaccination campaign for \nAfghan children. \n Sadly, the Government of Afghanistan and the \ninternational community are all too familiar with such \nbrutal and cowardly tactics. We will not be swayed \nfrom our efforts to improve the lives of ordinary \nAfghans. To that end, at the International Conference \nin Support of Afghanistan in Paris, Canada announced \nthat it would make an additional contribution of $600 \nmillion for Afghanistan, bringing its overall total to \n$1.9 billion over the period from 2001 to 2011. \n Continued leadership by the United Nations is \nessential in Afghanistan. Canada stands behind the \nUnited Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. We \ncall on Member States to work with the United Nations \nto enhance the capacity of the Mission and to give it \nthe tools required to do its job. We remain ever mindful \n \n \n17 08-53141 \n \nof the challenges that Afghanistan continues to \nconfront \u2014 security, access to basic services and \nimpending food shortages. Collectively, we \u2014 the \nStates assembled here \u2014 must deliver on the promises \nmade to the Afghan people. \n(spoke in French) \n Canada also remains committed to the promotion \nof security, governance and development in Haiti, \nefforts that are important for building a more \ndemocratic, prosperous and secure hemisphere. We \nconsider the partnership with the United Nations in \nHaiti to be an integral part of those efforts. That is why \nwe are providing the United Nations Stabilization \nMission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) with civilian police \nofficers, military staff officers and corrections experts. \n Canada takes a comprehensive approach to \nreconstruction and development in Haiti. We are the \nsecond largest bilateral donor in Haiti, with a \n$555 million commitment over five years through 2011 \nin support of the country\u2019s long-term reconstruction \nand development. MINUSTAH is in Haiti at the \nrequest of the Haitian Government, the most important \npartner of all in a commitment we share with Member \nStates within the hemisphere and beyond. Sustained \nefforts, political stability and lasting progress on \nreforms will combine to build a better future for all \nHaitians. \n Canada has also been a long-standing partner of \nthe United Nations efforts in Africa. When the \nSecretary-General took office, he said that one of his \ntop priorities would be the Sudan\u2019s Darfur region. The \nUnited Nations presence in the Sudan is based on the \nvery principles underlying the United Nations Charter. \nThe engagement of the international community in the \nSudan remains vital. \n(spoke in English) \n With contributions of over $477 million since \n2006, Canada remains deeply committed to building \nsustainable peace in the Sudan and alleviating the \nsuffering of those affected by the conflict. Canada\u2019s \nsupport for peacekeeping operations in Sudan includes \nthe deployment of personnel, a loan of armoured \nvehicles and a large voluntary financial contribution. \nCanada underscores the importance of full \nimplementation of the Comprehensive Peace \nAgreement, and calls on Sudanese authorities and the \nrebel movements to end the violence in Darfur, \nfacilitate the deployment of the African Union-United \nNations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID), \ncooperate with the International Criminal Court and \nrespect human rights. \n We are acutely aware that UNAMID is a difficult \nand often dangerous mission. In that regard, allow me \nto express the sincere condolences of the Canadian \nGovernment for the deaths resulting from the \nhelicopter crash in the Sudan earlier today \u2014 a tragedy \nthat underscores the very real threats United Nations \npersonnel continue to confront in the field. \n The current crisis in Georgia also calls for a \nunified international response. Canada supports the \ndemocratic and legitimate Government of Georgia and \nGeorgia\u2019s territorial integrity and sovereignty. Canada \ncalls on Russia to fulfil its international obligations, \nreconsider its actions and cooperate fully with the \ninternational community to resolve the crisis in \nGeorgia in a peaceful manner. \n Canada has consistently sought to make the \nUnited Nations instruments for promoting peace and \nsecurity more effective. At the centre of those is, of \ncourse, the Security Council. Canada has long \nsupported proposals for greater accountability and \ntransparency of the Security Council to enable it better \nto shoulder the global peace and security \nresponsibilities entrusted to it by the 192 Member \nStates. Canada is committed to working with all \nMember States to promote a more unified and effective \nSecurity Council that can move past stalemate and take \ndecisive action against threats to security wherever \nthey may arise. \n We therefore welcome the recent decision of the \nGeneral Assembly to launch negotiations on Security \nCouncil reform at this session. It is important that we \nmake progress in those negotiations. For our part, \nCanada stands ready to support reform that ensures that \nnew realities are reflected in the Council while \npreserving accountability through the discipline of \nregular elections for Security Council membership. \n Canada is proud to be the seventh largest \ncontributor to the regular budget of the United Nations. \nWe are also a member of a wide range of United \nNations specialized agencies and a major contributor to \nUnited Nations funds and programmes. \nHumanitarianism and compassion are hallmarks of the \nCanadian identity. The United Nations is a key partner \nfor the delivery of Canadian humanitarian action, with \n  \n \n08-53141 18 \n \nCanadian commitments this year totalling over \n$315 million. Our humanitarian assistance is aimed at \nhelping the world\u2019s most vulnerable people, including \nchildren, refugees and victims of conflict and natural \ndisasters, and supports key United Nations programmes \nin those areas. \n Canada is on track to meet its international \nassistance commitments, and we are ensuring that our \naid is focused, effective and accountable. Canada will \ndeliver on its promise to double international \nassistance to $5 billion by 2010-2011. \n Canada is also serious about its commitment, \nundertaken in the Group of Eight, to double aid to \nAfrica, and I am pleased to say that we are on target to \nmeet that goal in 2009. Canada is also committed to \nworking in partnership with other stakeholders to \naccelerate development efforts to help achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals by 2015. \n In response to the global food crisis, Canada \nprovided an extra $50 million for food aid, bringing \nour total contribution this year to $230 million \u2014 one \nof the largest in the world. Canada was also pleased to \nanswer an emergency request from the World Food \nProgramme (WFP) earlier this month to provide \nsecurity for its food aid shipments to Somalia. A \nCanadian Navy frigate, HMCS Ville de Qu\u00e9bec, is \ncurrently escorting WFP ships carrying life-saving \nsupplies to Somalia. Canada recently extended the \nfrigate\u2019s WFP escort mission until 23 October 2008. \n Canada is taking further concrete measures to \nenhance the effectiveness of our aid. We recently \nuntied 100 per cent of our food aid to make sure it can \nbe provided in the most efficient and effective way \npossible to the people who need it most. Canada is also \nfully untying all of its development assistance \nprogrammes by 2012-2013, in fulfilment of our \ncommitment to ensuring greater effectiveness of our \ninternational assistance. \n The challenges of environmental protection and \nsustainable development are rightly at the top of the \nglobal agenda. The most pressing challenge is that of \nclimate change, and the United Nations must play a \ncentral role. Canada is committed to the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \nand the need to reach consensus on a post-Bali \nframework.  \n The response to all global challenges begins at \nhome. However, the sum of national actions must drive \na collective effort at the international level. One of the \nmost important components of the Bali Road Map is \nthat it recognizes that no country can effectively \naddress climate change on its own and that all \ncountries in a position to act must do so. As such, \nCanada is fully aware of the importance of having all \nmajor global emitters take on meaningful and binding \nemissions reduction commitments in any future \ninternational agreement. \n Canada is also acutely aware of the risks faced by \ncountries most vulnerable to the impact of climate \nchange, particularly small island States and the least \ndeveloped countries. Canada is pleased to be a sponsor \nof a draft resolution on climate change and security put \nforward by the Pacific Island States. Canada has also \nsupported global efforts to promote climate change \nadaptation and has contributed both expertise and \nfinances to various United Nations and other \ninternational initiatives. \n Sixty years ago, this body adopted the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights. Canada is proud to \nrecall the contribution of Canadian John Peters \nHumphrey in penning the initial draft of that landmark \ninstrument. Sixty years on, we have not yet met that \n\u201ccommon standard of achievement for all peoples and \nall nations\u201d (resolution 217 (III)). We have much work \nleft to do. \n As a member of the Human Rights Council, \nCanada is working hard to make that new institution \nlive up to the reform objectives that led to its creation \ntwo years ago. We have seen some progress and some \nsetbacks in ensuring that the Council\u2019s agenda and \nfocus are balanced and objective. \n We must continually challenge ourselves to \nimprove our own records. The creation this year of the \nUniversal Periodic Review, which Canada strongly \nsupported as an innovative improvement to the United \nNations human rights machinery, is an important tool \nto help States identify and address their continuing \nchallenges. \n As a community, we must stand up for the rule of \nlaw and for those whose rights are violated or \nundermined by the very institutions that should ensure \ntheir protection. That is why Canada will continue to \ntake strong stands against Governments that commit \nsystemic abuses against their populations. As \n \n \n19 08-53141 \n \nGovernments, we must remain committed to working \ntogether to hold each other to account on our human \nrights records and to support countries that are making \nsincere efforts to advance the human rights of their \npeople. We must continue to strive for fundamental \nfreedoms and human rights in order to fulfil the ideals \nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. \n(spoke in French) \n Canada supports an effective, soundly managed \nand results-driven United Nations. That is why it \nsupports broad reform. In that regard, we call for \nextensive reform in terms of management, especially in \nthe areas of oversight, accountability and human \nresource management. Those reforms are needed to \nbring the management of the United Nations in step \nwith the best practices of the twenty-first century and \nto equip it with the tools needed to deliver on the \nimportant mandates that we as Member States ask of it. \n(spoke in English) \n The values and ideals on which the United \nNations was founded \u2014 the promotion of peace and \nsecurity, of human rights and of greater prosperity for \nall through development cooperation \u2014 are also \nCanada\u2019s and we stand ready to work within the United \nNations to address new challenges, such as climate \nchange and combating terrorism. I wish to repeat \nCanada\u2019s willingness to work in partnership with all \nUnited Nations Member States towards the common \npurposes for which this Organization was created. "

        "file_text": "I am honoured and \nprivileged to be able to speak in this great Assembly on \nbehalf of the people of the Republic of the Marshall \nIslands. \n I sincerely congratulate Mr. D\u2019Escoto Brockmann \non his election. We have every confidence in his \nwisdom and able leadership to guide us through our \ndeliberations. I extend my sincere appreciation to the \nSecretary-General for his leadership and commitment \nto the work of the United Nations. \n As this body enters its sixty-third year, I am \nmoved to express my profound appreciation to those \nvisionaries who foresaw the importance of the United \nNations and took it upon themselves to establish the \nnecessary structures for the governance of our \ncollective affairs. It is not that the creation of this body \nhas led to the cessation of war; it has not. Rather, it is \nthat we now have an international forum in which \nnations can talk over and deliberate issues of mutual \nconcern. One could well imagine what the alternative \nto talking might be in certain circumstances. \n  \n \n08-51845 12 \n \n Like its sister island States in the Pacific region, \nthe Marshall Islands is struggling with the \nimplementation of its Millennium Development Goals. \nOur effort has been made difficult by unforeseen global \nforces capable of draining every ounce of our \nresources. The Marshall Islands is a small economy \nand inter-island distances are vast, making \ntransportation excessively expensive. Formulating \ndevelopment strategies that address the new conditions \nhas not been easy. \n An excellent example in this case may be found \nin the current energy crisis arising from the escalation \nin the cost of fossil fuel. Its adverse impact has been \nimmediate and severe. The transportation of essential \ngoods and the movement of people to and from far-\nflung islands have been sharply curtailed. The \ndistribution of essential services and food products has \nbeen acutely impaired, crippling our ability to sustain \nnormal public services and posing a particular threat to \nfood security and medical services. The rising cost of \nfossil fuels occurring in rapid succession has left the \nMarshall Islands with no choice but to declare a state \nof economic emergency.  \n I am sure, and the International Monetary Fund \nhas observed, that at the height of the crisis, when the \ncost of a barrel of oil was over $140, numerous other \ncountries were also at the tipping point. \n As a small island developing State and a member \nof the Pacific Islands Forum, we are now exploring the \nconcept of bulk purchasing of petroleum, as endorsed \nby Pacific Forum leaders in Niue last month. Given our \npainful experience, we request that the international \ncommunity give special consideration to the creation of \na comprehensive financial facility that can help small \nisland States to cope in times of crisis. In addition, \nsuch a facility should also help small island States \ntransition from fossil fuel-based energy to affordable \nand renewable energy sources. \n Our small island States in the Pacific region are \namong the lowest greenhouse gas emitters in the world, \nyet we bear the full brunt of climate change and its \nfrightful consequences. The Marshall Islands supports \ninternational initiatives aimed at stemming the tide of \nclimate change. In that context, we endorse the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \nthe European Union-Pacific declaration; Japan\u2019s Cool \nEarth 50 Programme \u2014 which provides funding for \nadaptation and mitigation \u2014 and the Niue Declaration \non Climate Change. \n In further pursuit of greater guarantees of our \nterritorial integrity, the Pacific island countries intend \nto introduce at this sixty-third session of the General \nAssembly a draft resolution calling for climate change \nto be addressed by the Security Council as nothing less \nthan a security concern of the utmost serious nature. \n The litmus test of the international community\u2019s \ncommitment to those agreements should be reflected in \nits ability to provide sustainable financing for \nimmediate and concrete adaptation programmes on the \nground in small island States. It is one thing to produce \nagreements or resolutions; it is another to give them \nreal meaning in concrete terms. Our commitments must \nshow themselves in deeds, not in words alone. \n On the scale that we have experienced over the \npast few months, the effect of rising fuel costs could \nbring everything to a standstill. Nevertheless, some \nin-country adjustments could be made, however painful \nand agonizing those might be. Insofar as climate \nchange is concerned, however, we have no option. We \ncan alter neither the size nor the height of our islands. \nThey are our natural givens and we are stuck with \nthem. Our own very survival is at stake. If sea levels \nrise by two metres, Tokelau, Tuvalu, Kiribati and the \nMarshall Islands will be completely submerged under \nsea. \n Thus, clearly the only alteration or adjustment \nthat is possible is in the mindset and the moral, \neconomic and political behaviour of the heaviest \nemitters of greenhouse gas. In summary, nothing is \nmore glaring now than the fact that not only are those \nissues interrelated, but that their cross-cutting global \ncharacter clearly demands an effective and immediate \nglobal response. \n If wars have been waged to protect the rights of \npeople to live in freedom and to safeguard their \nsecurity, why will they not be waged to protect our \nright to survive the onslaught of climate change? Is the \nformer more morally imperative than the latter? I urge \nthe United Nations to elevate this threat \u2014 this \nnightmare \u2014 as justification for total war against \nclimate change. \n Recent positive developments, evidenced by the \neasing of tension and the improvement of relations \nbetween the People\u2019s Republic of China and Taiwan \n \n \n13 08-51845 \n \nhave begun a new era of good will and hope for \nimproved economic possibilities and political stability. \nIn the context of those emerging dynamics now \nmaturing between China and Taiwan, we see evidence \nof a mutual desire for dialogue and engagement in a \nprocess that can forge better relations and \nunderstanding. It is a development worthy of our \nrespect, and it presents an excellent opportunity for the \ninternational community to encourage and strengthen \nthat process. \n In light of that, the Marshall Islands firmly \nbelieves that the time is now ripe for the 23 million \npeople of Taiwan to be accorded full participation in \nthe specialized agencies of the United Nations. This is \na starting benchmark that is consistent with the \nprinciple of true universality. \n As we continue to build a United Nations that \nbetter represents our global diversity, the Marshall \nIslands believes that membership in the Security \nCouncil should not be guarded as something that is \noverly sacred and untouchable. To do so would be to \nfail to keep in tandem with the principle of change. \nCouncil membership should instead be enlarged to \nreflect reality.  \n Japan\u2019s fitting aspirations to seek a permanent \nseat on the Security Council deserve favourable \nconsideration. Japan is a world economic and industrial \npower, and its leadership and contribution to the \nUnited Nations is admirable and self-evident. We are \nconfident that, as a permanent member of the Security \nCouncil, Japan will bring much that is good to the \nCouncil and to the United Nations as a whole. \n Earlier this month, the United Sates marked the \nseventh anniversary of the tragic loss of lives resulting \nfrom barbaric acts carried out against the American \npeople on 11 September 2001. That event threatened \nour collective security, prompting a response against \nacts of terrorism. \n It is a matter of personal gratification for me to \nsay that, over the past few decades, the special \nrelationship between the Marshalls and the United \nStates has continued to deepen with encouraging \noutcomes. I am proud to say that, in Afghanistan and \nIraq, Marshallese young men and women have been \nparticipating actively in coalition forces as part of the \nUnited States armed services personnel, demonstrating \nour commitment to shared democratic ideals. \n I take this opportunity to express our deep \ngratitude to the United States for its continuing \nconstructive role in our partnership under the Compact \nof Free Association, as well as for its leadership in \nadvancing the cause of freedom around the world. \n While the ideal of peace envisioned by the \nframers of the Charter of the United Nations 63 years \nago is yet to be fully achieved, this should not be a \ncause for despair. People of goodwill everywhere have \nexpressed their yearning for world peace. Today, we \nsee vast increases in movements and organizations \ndevoted to humanitarian work, empowerment of \nwomen and mobilization of youth. We see young and \nolder nations engaged in matters of mutual concern. \nThe United Nations has demonstrated our collective \ncapacity for united action in a wide range of social and \neconomic initiatives. It has affirmed our collective will \nto build a better future. \n I believe the time has come for the United \nNations to convoke an international convention where \nthe fundamental principles and tenets of permanent \nworld peace can be deliberated. Such a bold step will \ndraw our attention more sharply to our true nature, to \nexisting constructive forces and to the need for \nunifying social structures that can foster the \nestablishment of a truly new world order, a global \nsociety animated by principles of social justice. \n Today nothing is more urgent, more imperative \nand more important for this great institution than the \nestablishment of a world peace that is permanent and \nthat rests firmly on the bedrock of justice. And as we \njointly undertake to gradually build that edifice of \nlasting international peace, let us draw our strength and \ntake comfort in these words from the Gospel of \nMatthew: \u201cBlessed are the peacemakers: for they shall \nbe called the children of God\u201d.

        "file_text": "Let me \nbegin by extending my congratulations to you, Sir, on \nyour election to the important function of President of \nthe General Assembly. You will steer the deliberations \nof this key body of the United Nations through a \n  \n \n08-53129 32 \n \ndifficult period of growing challenges to our common \nsecurity and prosperity. Let me assure you of our full \nsupport in your endeavours. I also thank your \npredecessor, Mr. Kerim. \n My country is in full preparation for an enormous \ntask that has no precedent in our history. In January \n2009, the Czech Republic will assume the \nresponsibility of the presidency of the European Union. \nWe will do our utmost to uphold our shared \ncommitment to world peace and prosperity within that \norganization. \n The European Union stands at the forefront of the \nefforts to strengthen the United Nations capacity to \ndeliver effective international responses to global \nchallenges. The Czech Republic is committed to \nplaying its part and to further enhancing the European \nUnion\u2019s contribution by searching for common \nresponses. The motto of the upcoming Czech \npresidency, \u201cEurope without barriers\u201d, reflects our \ndesire to promote the removal of barriers not only \nwithin the European Union, but also between the Union \nand third countries. In our opinion, it is very much in \nline with the efforts to enhance cooperation and to \nstrengthen the principle of effective multilateralism. \n The agreements reached at the 2005 World \nSummit sparked some substantive reforms, but the \nprocess has reached a point at which it has become \nnecessary to give it a new impulse for further progress. \nAn important part of that progress is Security Council \nreform. A more representative and transparent Security \nCouncil will act with a greater international legitimacy \nand authority. The Czech Republic therefore welcomes \nthe recent decision to launch the intergovernmental \nnegotiations. However, the authority of the Security \nCouncil is being undermined by its inability to address \nsome acute international issues. I call on the Council to \nreassert its authority in the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security and to shoulder its \nobligations. \n The authority of the United Nations is being \ntested, and so are our political and moral \nresponsibilities. By signing onto the Charter of the \nUnited Nations, all of our countries have committed \nthemselves to living in peace and harmony and to \nrespecting the principles of peaceful resolution of \ndisputes and of refraining from the threat and use of \nforce, except in self-defence. Today, as security is \nbeing challenged in too many parts of the world, those \nbasic principles, and the system of international law in \ngeneral, need to be upheld as ever. \n And yet, we have recently witnessed systematic \nprovocations and, finally, a military aggression on the \npart of a powerful country, a permanent member of the \nSecurity Council, against its small neighbour with the \naim of carving that neighbour up. That action was \ndesigned to create two tiny entities, totally dependent \nin their administrative, economic and military \nstructures. Colonial Powers used to act in that way, and \nI would like to stress that alleged interests, privileged \nas they may be considered, cannot justify the violation \nof our highest common principles, enshrined in the \nCharter of the United Nation. Therefore, I fully \nsubscribe to the words pronounced by Sergey Lavrov \nhere earlier today:  \n \u201cWe cannot tolerate any attempts to resolve \nconflict situations by violating international \nagreements or by the unlawful use of force. If we \nallow that to occur once, then we run the risk of \nunleashing it in the future\u201d (). \n However, how can one think of redesigning new \nEuro-Atlantic security structures without renewing the \ntrust that has vanished over the past few months? \n After the Czech Republic sent substantial \nhumanitarian aid, it initiated an international support \nconference for Georgia, to be held next month in \nBrussels. We call upon the international community to \nhelp alleviate the suffering of the tens of thousands of \npeople displaced by the conflict, as well as to help the \ncountry with post-conflict reconstruction. We insist \nthat all internally displaced persons return home. The \nimmediate task is to ensure that all military forces are \nwithdrawn to pre-war positions. There is urgent need \nfor the deployment of an international and impartial \nmission in Georgia to oversee the military withdrawals \nand ceasefire implementation. Let me stress once \nagain, however, that a peaceful and lasting solution to \nthe conflict must be based on full respect for the \nprinciple of Georgia\u2019s independence, sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity. \n We need to step up efforts to combat international \nterrorism. The stakes remain high. With our deep \ncondolences to the peoples of India and Pakistan, we \nstrongly condemn the recent terrorist attacks in New \nDelhi and Islamabad. We must not be shaken, but must \nstand up to that scourge united, stronger and more \ndetermined. I was deeply moved by the condolences \n \n \n33 08-53129 \n \nexpressed by my Pakistani counterpart. It is touching to \nhear that from someone whose country has suffered \nimmensely from terrorism. \n Promoting and maintaining international security \nrequires concerted action. While there is a need for \nstrengthened United Nations peacekeeping capacity, \nother organizations can effectively complement the \nwork of the United Nations in areas where they have a \ncomparative advantage. \n We have all felt the pains of stabilizing a war-torn \ncountry like Afghanistan. Despite the persisting lack of \nsecurity, the international community continues to \nsupport development even in remote areas. By \nestablishing and running the provincial reconstruction \nteam in Logar province, my country has undertaken a \nlong-term commitment to contribute to the security and \ndevelopment of Afghanistan. Let me express our full \nsupport for the Special Representative of the Secretary-\nGeneral for Afghanistan, Ambassador Kai Eide, and \ninvite the United Nations to take a more active \napproach and enhance its involvement and assistance \nto Afghanistan. The Afghans need our support to turn \nPresident Karzai\u2019s words, \u201cwe must do what it takes to \nwin the battle of Afghanistan\u2019s economic development\u201d \n(), into reality. A concerted effort between the \nGovernment of Afghanistan, the United Nations and \nother key international players, including Pakistan, is a \nprerequisite to achieving that goal. \n The cooperation of the United Nations, the \nEuropean Union and NATO needs to continue to the \nbenefit of the Balkan region as a whole. Looking into \nthe future, let me assure Members that both democratic \nand prosperous Serbia and Kosovo do have a place in \nthe European family and that the Czech Republic is \nready to lend them a helping hand. We in the Czech \nRepublic have always had long-standing and \ntraditionally close and friendly relations with Serbia \nand are keen to develop them further. \n The recent arrest and transfer of Radovan \nKaradzic to the International Criminal Tribunal for the \nFormer Yugoslavia was a promising sign of \ncooperation of the new Serbian Government with the \ninternational community. I call on the Security Council \nto provide sufficient time to the Tribunal for the \ncompletion of its work. \n The Czech Republic considers international \ncriminal justice to be one of the pillars that uphold the \nbasic values of the United Nations. The ad hoc \ntribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, as \nwell as the Security Council decision of 2005 to refer \nthe situation in Darfur to the International Criminal \nCourt, must be supported in order to end impunity for \nthe most serious crimes. Let me recall the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s commitment at the opening of this general \ndebate: \u201cWe have the means to combat impunity and \nmust therefore do so\u201d (, p. 3). \n We need to undertake some bold steps in the area \nof weapons of mass destruction and non-proliferation. \nWe should reduce the risk of those weapons being \nmisused or falling into the hands of terrorists. The \nimmediate task is to ensure a successful outcome of the \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \nreview process and the entry into force of the \nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. \n In that context, I would like to express our \nconcern over the Iranian and North Korean nuclear \nprogrammes. We fully recognize the indispensable \nright of every country to exploit nuclear power for \ncivilian purposes, but we should act when it could be \ndiverted towards military purposes, in breach of \ninternational commitments. \n My country was among those that has vigorously \ncalled for a new universal norm to prevent risks \nstemming from the use of cluster munitions. The Czech \nRepublic will be among the first to sign the new \nConvention on Cluster Munitions this December. I am \nconvinced that the more countries that join the \nConvention, the more profound and positive the effect \nit will have on the lives of countless individuals and \ncommunities. \n Security goes hand in hand with development and \nhuman rights. In the sixtieth year of the existence of \nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, there is \nstill a long way to go from the merely formal \ncommitments of Governments to achieving a \nuniversally shared respect for the rights and liberties of \nevery human being. \n In recent years, the United Nations human rights \ninstitutions have undergone long-awaited reform. \nHowever, our goals have been only partially achieved. \nLet me express my deep regret that the Human Rights \nCouncil has been unable to tackle several serious \nhuman rights situations in a timely and proper manner. \nAlthough the Council is putting meritorious effort into \nthe newly established Universal Periodic Review \nmechanism, the political imbalance of its agenda and \n  \n \n08-53129 34 \n \nthe attempts to weaken the role of special procedures \nand non-governmental organizations further diminish \nthe expectations of reform. Moreover, flouting the \nappeals of the international community, as was done by \nthe Myanmar regime, has to be denounced.  \n The Czech Republic supports the principle of \nresponsibility to protect formulated at the 2005 World \nSummit. The international community has the \nresponsibility to protect peoples worldwide in cases \nwhere their Governments are unable or unwilling to do \nso. Just over the past few years, we have seen some \nquite tragic examples desperately requiring our \nattention. I therefore welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s \nefforts to advance that issue. A valuable contribution \ncan also be made through the non-governmental \ninitiatives of leaders such as V\u00e1clav Havel, Kjell \nMagne Bondevik and Elie Wiesel. Earlier this week, I \nhad the honour to host an event in New York aimed at \npresenting their thoughts and recommendations on the \ntragic human rights and humanitarian situation in \nNorth Korea. \n This week, I took part in high-level meetings on \nAfrica\u2019s development needs and on the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. We have already witnessed early \nsuccesses and setbacks, and we realize that some goals \nare more difficult to achieve than others. Now, at the \nhalfway point to the target date, we are well aware of \nhow much needs to be done in the remaining seven \nyears. Our commitment to development, and notably to \nAfrica, must not wane. \n At the end of this year, the Follow-up \nInternational Conference on Financing for \nDevelopment will present an opportunity to review the \nimplementation of the Monterrey Consensus of 2002. \nThe conclusion of the ongoing talks on the Doha \nDevelopment Agenda within the World Trade \nOrganization should also bring the tangible benefits of \nfurther trade liberalization for developing countries. To \nmake that happen, the European Union has already \nshown the necessary flexibility. Other key actors have \nto follow suit if the talks are to get back on track and \nbe concluded soon. In that context, let me recall once \nagain the Czech presidency\u2019s motto, \u201cEurope without \nbarriers\u201d. \n Let me assure the Assembly that the Czech \nRepublic fully supports the European Union (EU) \ncommitments to intensify EU development assistance. \nThe Czech presidency of the Union will be yet another \nincentive for us to step up our development assistance. \n Soaring food and commodity prices, as well as \nthe negative impact of climate change, hamper \ninternational development. All those issues require \nstrong political will. The new legal framework to \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions beyond 2012 is one \nof the most important issues. The Czech Republic is \nfully aware of the need to make significant progress \ntowards the adoption of a new post-Kyoto agreement. \nThe Czech presidency of the European Union will play \nan active role in that process, which will culminate in \nCopenhagen next year, where a new agreement should \nbe adopted. \n I have outlined just a few points that are awaiting \nour action. In many areas, time is running out. I would \nlike to encourage all Members of this universal \nOrganization to cooperate in our common efforts to \nmake this world secure and prosperous. The Czech \nRepublic is committed to doing its part. "

        "file_text": "Just one \nyear ago (see A/62/PV.6), I recalled before this \nAssembly that I was bringing the words of a people \nwho for 200 years have experienced extreme suffering \nas a result of all kinds of material privation and \ncomplete vulnerability in the face of natural risks and \ndisasters. \n At that time, I hardly thought that I would find \nmyself here again one year later against the backdrop \nof the image of hundreds of children, women and the \nelderly swept away by floodwaters, hundreds of \nthousands of citizens suddenly finding themselves \nwithout shelter, tens of thousands of tons of \nagricultural harvest destroyed in a few hours, not to \nmention the incalculable damage to basic infrastructure \nsuch as communication networks, art works, irrigation \nsystems, the electricity grid, the water system and other \nstructures.  \n I am pointing out that those catastrophic events \noccurred just four months after the first angry \ndemonstrations of the population against the explosion \nin food prices, reactions that would be repeated on an \nalmost global scale, as though to express a collective \ncry of the poor regarding what was happening beyond \njust a global food crisis, as the rejection of an order for \nwhich the poor had too long been the only ones to pay \nthe cost. \n The damage caused four consecutive hurricanes \nin less than two months has set Haiti back several \nyears. Those hurricanes sorely test our capacity to \nresist, particularly when it must be borne in mind that \nall those victims, and their families, and all those \nbusinesses, large or small, have to fend for themselves \nwhile they wait for the State, and the State alone, to \nhelp them to get back on their feet or return to \nbusiness. There are no adequate market insurance \nsystems to compensate for the losses arising from that \nenormous damage.  \n I cannot thank the Secretary-General enough for \nthe great outpouring of sympathy that the United \nNations system has shown towards the people of Haiti \nfollowing those disasters. I can hardly express \nsufficient thanks for the mobilization organized by the \nUnited Nations agencies on the ground to bring help to \nthe most vulnerable and assist the affected families to \ntackle the most urgent problems. \n How can I thank the many friendly countries that \nso quickly mobilized their own resources and logistics \n  \n \n08-52272 4 \n \nto come to the aid of the Haitians? How can we express \nour gratitude in the light of those expressions of \ncompassion and the numerous initiatives of solidarity \ncoming from civil society and the private sector in \nthose same friendly countries? \n Just as dark clouds have a silver lining, how \ncould I not recall that huge solidarity movement from \nwithin even our country, involving civil society and \nnon-governmental organizations, not to forget, of \ncourse, the millions of Haitians living abroad, in an \nunprecedented mobilization, all striving to work \ntogether in synergy with the local authorities and \nspecialized agencies of the central Government. \n Despite the suffering that the Haitian people are \nenduring today because of the cumulative effect of the \ndisasters that befell them, I cannot help turning my \nthoughts to our neighbours, countries such as Cuba, the \nDominican Republic, Mexico, our brother nations in \nthe Caribbean Community and even some States on the \nsouthern coast of the United States that have also \nsuffered considerable damage as a result of those first \nhurricanes of the season \u2014 and I stress, the first \nhurricanes of the season. How can we not remember \neither the sight of the disasters that have struck India, \nBangladesh and other regions of the Asian continent?  \n However, beyond those calamities that we could, \nquite easily, attribute to nature, how can we ignore \nother disasters for which we humans are directly \nresponsible through war and the destruction that we \nbring about with such determination in various areas of \nthe world? To all citizens of those countries affected by \nthe violence of men and by natural disasters, to their \nfamilies and their representatives here at this \nAssembly, on behalf of the Haitian people I address my \nbest wishes for courage in their reconstruction efforts \nand in their quest for peace and happiness. And I can \nassure them of our feeling of solidarity and fraternity \nin that effort. \n While I salute that huge wave of generosity \ntowards my country and am grateful for that solidarity, \nrecognizing it was necessary for the immediate needs \nof those affected, I cannot fail to draw attention to the \nconcerns that it raises for Haitians. I am worried \nbecause I know how deep-rooted our problems are. I \nam concerned because I am apprehensive about the \ntime when that solidarity, exhausted in the first wave of \nhumanitarian compassion, will leave us, as always, \nalone \u2014 really alone \u2014 in the face of new disasters, to \nsee as if in a ritual, the same mobilization exercises. \n I am concerned because the Haitians risk finding \nthemselves alone in ensuring the only real task that \nneeds undertaking today: that of rebuilding the country. \nWe must rebuild its production capacity and social \nfabric and give our young people a new dream, the \npoor new hope, and our citizens of all political leanings \nand all social strata new confidence. We need a \nreconstruction project thought out in a systematic \napproach and able to count on genuine solidarity to \nmobilize the necessary resources for its \nimplementation. \n That is why we are sceptical with regard to \nimported food aid and the traditional way in which it is \ncarried out. We have to break this paradigm of charity \nin our approach to international cooperation, for \ncharity has never helped any country to emerge from \nunderdevelopment. \n The Native Americans that lived in our country \nand the Africans that replaced them helped a large part \nof humanity to amass its current wealth. We are simple \nworkers who have been moulded by hard labour and \nblessed with a keen sense for commerce and creating \nbusinesses.  \n If the international community wants to do \nsomething useful with Haitians, that would be to help \nus use our potential. The liberalization of trade can be \nbeneficial to humanity, particularly to the poor, who \nhave the ability to produce for a greater market. But \nthis liberalization must be done without hypocrisy or \nduping anyone. It must be carried out on the basis of \nclear, transparent rules that are the same for everyone, \nand the powers that promote them must begin by \nrespecting those rules themselves. \n Setting up and maintaining genuine productive \ncapacities and trading under fair conditions are the \ninitial conditions that would enable poor people to \nescape from the chains of poverty. The day when \ndevelopment aid aligns itself with these criteria, the \nfight against poverty and hunger will really turn a \ncorner in this world of ours. \n We will then see that the poor are not as poor as \nall that. We will see that they have available to them \nassets that political parties, institutions and cooperation \nprogrammes are not sufficiently making use of. We all \nrealize that the lands and the unregistered houses the \n \n \n5 08-52272 \n \npoor possess and the informal businesses they are \ninvolved in are also capital that can legitimately \ncirculate in the economy and participate in the creation \nof new wealth. \n This system simply has to be formalized. And we \nhave to give property title to those who own those \nlands and those houses. We also have to formalize this \ntrade. I have begun discussions with some of our \npartners to move quickly to a thorough evaluation of \nnew needs created by the damage to our infrastructure \nwith a view to developing a comprehensive \nreconstruction plan, which will serve as the conductor \nfor cooperation efforts with our country.  \n Last Tuesday, on the occasion of the opening of \nthe general debate of the sixty-third session of the \nGeneral Assembly (5th meeting), I listened very \ncarefully to the opening statement of the President. The \ncreation of the United Nations was an important \nconquest in the history of mankind\u2019s struggle to find a \nremedy for poverty and to build a world of peace based \non equality and respect for everyone\u2019s rights. The \nOrganization remains the privileged place for debating \nthe problems of our world and for allowing the voices \nof the poor and of those left behind to be heard. We \ncannot allow its work to be hindered by its inability to \ntake into account the voice of the majority. We cannot \nallow its agencies to exist only for themselves, \nrelegating to second place their primary mission of \nservice. \n I agree with the President that our Organization \nneeds profound reform so that it becomes more \neffective, more transparent and genuinely democratic. \nIf it fails to accomplish this, the United Nations risks \nbeing resented by the small and derided by the big. We \ndo not need that in these difficult and uncertain days, \nwhen our planet is being put to a severe test by a \ncombination of crises of all kinds, multidimensional \ncrises whose solution will depend on our collective \ncapacity to deal with them effectively, equitably and \nwith solidarity. \n The announced high-level dialogue on the \ndemocratization of the United Nations, if approached \nwith courage and determination, will put us on the road \nto changing its structures and its way of functioning. \nSuch reforms can only be a source of inspiration and a \nmodel for small countries, stricken like us by long-\nstanding difficulties, for ending institutional fragility \nand arriving at political stability and a fully \nfunctioning rule of law.  \n This Assembly is among those to whom fate has \nentrusted the destiny of our planet. The world that is \nbeing remoulded around us is a world in which wealth \nand poverty can no longer be confined within closed \nspaces, separated by impassable borders. Climate \nchange has no borders. Viruses and diseases are elusive \nundocumented visitors. The hunger of the poor is a \nthreat and will continue to threaten the happiness of the \nrich. \n The question that we have to collectively ask \nourselves today is this: will we perish together because \nwe were not able to take up our mission together with \ncourage, or will we agree to mobilize for a new plan \nfor humanity under a new form of governance, one that \nis responsible and based on solidarity, in order to save \nour beautiful planet, and to give our children the \nopportunity to build a better world?

        "file_text": "It is with pleasure that I offer Mr. Miguel \nd\u2019Escoto Brockmann my warmest congratulations on \nhis election as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-third session. We have every confidence in his \nexceptional skill and future success in consolidating \nthe gains achieved and in enhancing international \npeace and security in a world system characterized by \nprosperity, stability and progress. I would also like to pay \ntribute to the valuable efforts made by his predecessor, \nMr. Srgjan Kerim, to strengthen the principles of dialogue \nand consultation as a means to reach effective solutions \nto international issues and disputes. I would further \nlike to express our thanks and gratitude to Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his continual efforts on \nimportant issues relevant to reforming the Organization \nand to enhancing international peace and security. \n The current session of the Assembly is convening \nat a time when our country, Mauritania, has undergone \na change of head of State. I would like to seize this \nopportunity to explain the reasons for that change. \n In August 2005, after two decades of political \ntyranny, bribery and increasing corruption, the armed \nforces and security forces intervened to put an end to \nthe grave abuses that threatened the structure and very \nexistence of the Mauritanian State. That move by the \nMilitary Council for Justice and Democracy led to a \ntransitional democratic phase, which successfully \nconcluded in April 2007. Mauritanians and \ninternational observers alive attested to the fairness and \ntransparency of that phase. The Mauritanian \nexperiment in democracy became an example worthy \nof emulation. The satisfaction of various national and \ninternational observers and the support of civil society \nadded to the success of the experiment. A series of \nelections were held, with the support of international \npartners, leading to the ratification by popular \nreferendum of the Constitution in June 2006. \n  \n \n08-53141 42 \n \n A Parliament with two chambers was elected in \nNovember of the same year; a new president of the \nRepublic was elected in March 2007; and a new law \nfor the organization of the press was enacted in \nOctober 2006, establishing a higher authority for the \npress, radio and television. With respect to good \ngovernance, a new general inspectorate of the State \nwas established; transparency initiative was \nimplemented in the field of extracting industries; \npublic officials were compelled to disclose their \nfinancial affairs and property; and public transactions \nare now undertaken in a transparent manner. Lastly, \nwomen were accorded a quota of 20 per cent of all \ncandidatures in our Islamic republic. As a result, \n18 women were elected to the current Parliament. \n Those splendid achievements, in addition to the \natmosphere of harmony and accord enjoyed by the \npeople of Mauritania, are the result of the work of the \nmilitary establishment, which pledged to complete the \nprocess within the announced time frame and indeed \nkept its promise. Once the former President assumed \noffice, anything was possible in the new Mauritania, \nwith all its new institutional gains, in terms of \nconsolidating and deepening the achievements of the \ntransitional period of 2005 to 2007. Regrettably, from \nthe outset the former President demonstrated his \nweakness and inability to lead the country and confront \nthe many challenges it faced. \n Conditions in the country continued to seriously \ndeteriorate over the following 15 months in the \npolitical, security, economic and social fields. The \ndeteriorating situation posed a real threat to the \ncountry\u2019s peace, security and stability. Indeed, it \nthreatened the very existence and foundations of the \nState. \n Thus our country has, over the past three months, \nundergone an institutional crisis that led to an \ninterruption in the work of parliamentary institutions \nand paralysed the affairs of the State, the stability of \nwhich was threatened by the intransigence of the \nexecutive authority, which prevented Parliament from \nexercising its constitutional powers. \n In order to secure the loyalty of some \nparliamentarians from the majority party who were \nunhappy with the difficult situation and concerned \nabout the future of the country, the former President \nresorted to certain illegal measures that would be \nunacceptable in any democratic system. He used public \nfunds to buy the allegiance of some parliamentarians. \nIn addition, he made some irregular appointments and \narbitrarily fired some high-ranking public officials in \norder to stem the people\u2019s desire for change. Moreover, \nhe continuously threatened to dissolve Parliament in \norder to prevent the formation of a parliamentary \ncommittee to investigate the sources of financing of a \nprivate business created by his family. \n The President returned to the Chair. \n In the field of security and as a result of his laxity \nand refusal to heed the advice of the security services, \na number of terrorist acts took place for the first time \nin the country\u2019s history, following the release of a \nnumber of terrorists who had been in custody until he \ntook office. \n Economically and socially, the situation was \nsimply disastrous. While the people suffered in \npoverty, hunger and disease, the former President \u2014 \nwho, in the aftermath of floods that hit the country, had \nvisited only one city inside Mauritania, the city of \nTintane \u2014 made 25 visits abroad, costing Mauritanian \ntaxpayers huge amounts of money, without achieving \nany tangible results in the field of cooperation between \nMauritania and its development partners. \n The former President continuously and \nintentionally obstructed the work of democratic \ninstitutions and thus paralysed the State. Faced with the \nfailure of his manoeuvres, he resorted to firing high-\nranking officials in the leadership of the army and the \nsecurity services at the same time. That almost led to a \nconfrontation between high-ranking officers and \ncreated a situation that could have brought the country \nto the brink of civil war. \n In view of the political impasse, the armed forces \nand security forces, conscious of the serious dangers to \nthe country, intervened to correct the abuses and to \nstrengthen national unity and other gains made in the \ncountry, as well as its prospects for development and \nprogress. That change enjoys the support of two thirds \nof the members of Parliament, approximately 90 per cent of \nmayors and two thirds of recognized political parties, in \naddition to civil society organizations, including \ncultural and professional societies. Support has also \nbeen come from unprecedented popular marches. \n The High Council of State declared its \ncommitment to protecting democracy and enhancing \ndemocratic processes in Mauritania; guaranteeing the \n \n \n43 08-53141 \n \ncontinued regular functioning of State institutions; \nallowing officially recognized political parties to carry \nout their activities; guaranteeing freedom of the press \nand the media; respecting the obligations, agreements \nand international treaties concluded in the name of the \nMauritanian State; and organizing free and transparent \nelections at the earliest possible date. \n Aware of the importance of and need for \nintegration among countries and peoples of the world, \nMauritania reaffirms its adherence to the Arab \nMaghreb Union as a strategic choice of the people of \nthe region, the League of Arab States, the African \nUnion and the purposes and principles of the United \nNations. \n In the same spirit, we reiterate our support for \nefforts to reform the United Nations and, in particular, \nthe Security Council. We believe that the African \ncontinent should be given permanent representation on \nthe Security Council; Africa has been the only \ncontinent without permanent representation in the \nCouncil since the creation of this Organization. We \nalso call for giving the Arab Group representation in \nthe Security Council in view of the fact that it \nrepresents more than 11 per cent of the peoples of the \nworld. We support granting permanent seats in the \nSecurity Council to Japan and Germany, since both \ncountries play a vital role in the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security. \n Allow me to pay special tribute to the great \nefforts made at the sixty-second session of the General \nAssembly in the field of development, especially with \nrespect to the steep rise in food prices and all other \ngoods, the financing of development projects and the \nproblem of greenhouse gases and their effect on the \nplanet. \n The sixty-third session of the General Assembly \nfalls at a very difficult time, when the world is \nconfronting sharp increases in food prices, that \nnegatively affect the economies of developing \ncountries and could even undermine the economic \nstructure of those countries if no urgent measures are \ntaken to address the problem. The food crisis facing the \nworld requires concerted international efforts and \nstrategies to overcome its negative effects. \n Today, we are halfway to the deadline for \nachieving the Millennium Development Goals. \nHowever, many developing countries are still far from \nachieving those Goals. That is why we call on rich \ncountries to keep their promises to finance \ndevelopment in the developing world. \n The Arab-Israeli conflict is a source of tension \nand a threat to international peace and security in a \nvital and sensitive region of the world. That is why my \ncountry supports the efforts to settle the conflict in a \nmanner that guarantees the Palestinian people the \nrestoration of their rights and the establishment of their \nown State, with Jerusalem as its capital, coexisting in \npeace and security with the State of Israel. \n As regards the question of the Sudan, we totally \nand categorically reject the most recent developments, \nin particular the request of the Prosecutor of the \nInternational Criminal Court to issue an arrest warrant \nfor the President of the Sudan. We believe that such a \nmove would jeopardize peace efforts in that brotherly \ncountry and increase tensions in that sensitive region of \nthe world. \n My country follows the question of the Western \nSahara with interest. While we welcome the latest steps \ntaken to return to the negotiating table, we also renew \nour support for the efforts of the Secretary-General to \nreach a final settlement acceptable to both parties. \n The dissemination of the culture of peace and the \nspirit and values of tolerance among peoples and \ncivilizations, the restoration of rights and the \nrealization of justice among peoples are, in our view, \nthe best way to maintain peace and security in the \nworld. The fact that certain questions that have gone \nunresolved for so long, the widening gap between the \npoor and the rich, the unfair structure of the global \neconomy and the absence of any attempt to spread \njustice, equality and fairness have all contributed to the \ncreation of conflicts and to the phenomena of \nextremism and terrorism. \n We in Mauritania condemn and reject terrorism in \nall its forms. We are equally committed to adhering to \nour tolerant Islamic values, which reject violence and \nextremism and call for tolerance and brotherhood. We \nbelieve that the international family should seriously \nconsider the causes of the phenomenon of terrorism \nand ways to confront and eradicate it fully from the \nworld. \n We affirm the importance accorded by developing \ncountries to development as we look forward with hope \nto the results of the Doha Follow-up International \nConference on Financing for Development scheduled \n  \n \n08-53141 44 \n \nfrom 29 November to 2 December 2008. We also \nwould like to express our concern at the deadlock of \nthe Doha Round of trade negotiations and call on \nindustrialized countries to show more flexibility and \nstronger political will in that respect. \n Development has economic, social and \nenvironmental dimensions. Any shortcomings in any \none of those dimensions negatively affects the others. \nThat is why we highlight the need to address the \nphenomenon of climate change. My country is one of \nthe 10 countries that would be the most vulnerable to \nthe effects of greenhouse gas emissions if they should \ncause a rise in sea levels. We call on industrial \ncountries to limit the emissions that lead to greenhouse \neffects. \n The commitments undertaken by the international \ncommunity at the time of the establishment of this \nOrganization will not be implemented unless all \ncountries and peoples of the world are able to benefit \nfrom global resources and unless development efforts \nin the developing countries are supported with a view \nto creating conditions conducive to decent living in \nfreedom and equality. Only then will we have honoured \nthe commitments we have always affirmed. "

        "file_text": "In a few weeks\u2019 time, it will be 60 years \nsince the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights. And here we find ourselves at the \nmidpoint in the application of our strategies for the \nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs). \n The Universal Declaration of Human Rights \nbears witness to the determination to leave us a better \nworld than the one known by our fathers\u2019 generation \u2014 \na generation that suffered, struggled, defeated \ntotalitarianism and condensed its aspirations for \nfreedom and prosperity in that text. The Millennium \nDevelopment Goals reflect the will, no less \ndetermined, of our generation to confront extreme \npoverty once and for all, so that we may leave to our \n  \n \n08-51851 24 \n \nchildren a world without millions of human beings \nsuffering from hunger and poverty on a daily basis. \n Together, the observance of human rights and the \nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals are \nperhaps the most noble aspirations ever envisioned by \nhumanity, and the most devoted to the dignity of \nindividuals. \n Just by that fact alone, we can say that, despite all \nof the suffering deliberately caused by human beings \nover the last decades, during that time we have learned \nand we have made progress. We can feel satisfied that \nwe have identified and broadened the horizons of \nhuman beings on our planet. We can feel satisfied by \nthat, but by no means should we be complacent. \n There is no room for complacency because if we \nlook at the horizon for the MDGs, as we have for \nhuman rights, the conclusion would be the same: the \nresults are still far from fulfilling our aspirations, \nprecisely because those aspirations retain all of their \nvalue, and even grow in value, with the passage of \ntime. \n Ten years ago, at the commemoration of the \nfiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights, President Nelson \nMandela recalled that poverty is an offence against the \nDeclaration and is the result not of any force of nature, \nbut rather of the action or non-action by human beings, \nin particular those in leadership positions in politics, \nthe economy and other areas of human activity. \n Aware of that responsibility, eight years ago \nMember States undertook the unique effort, in historic \nterms, to alleviate poverty for millions of people \nworldwide. I wish to make my opinion clear that we \nhave not progressed as we should have or as we \nplanned. However, the needs are the same or even \ngreater than they were when we agreed the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals eight years ago. \n Mr. Tanin (Afghanistan), Vice-President, took the \nChair. \n If we are to attain the Millennium Development \nGoals by 2015, we cannot just sit back. We cannot \nblame our failure to meet our obligations on the \neconomic situation. We cannot use any circumstance as \nan excuse to avoid honouring our commitments. It is a \nquestion not only of adhering to irreplaceable ethical \nstandards, but of making responsible efforts towards \nstability and international equality. \n We must also work urgently to establish a new \nworld financial order that would prevent the recurrence \nof situations like that we are currently experiencing. It \nis also urgent that we continue to fight with \ndetermination against the hunger and poverty that \ncause millions of people to suffer unacceptably and \ncontinue to be a source of conflict and migratory \npressures that are difficult to control. \n I am speaking on behalf of a country \u2014 Spain \u2014 \nthat is making great efforts of solidarity in its \ncooperation policies. Over the past four years, Spain \nhas been the State with the highest increase in its \nofficial development assistance; our goal is to reach \n0.7 per cent of our gross national income by 2012. \nSpanish society offers that commitment in response to \nthe current food crisis. \n My country believes that the best way to reaffirm \nthe full value of the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights and to keep 2015 firmly in view is to strengthen \nthe historical connotation of each. That connotation is \nnothing less than the exaltation of human dignity as \nboth an impregnable wall against arbitrariness and \ndespotism and as a curb against extreme poverty. \n A few weeks ago, on behalf of the Government of \nSpain, I made a proposal that I would like to reiterate \ntoday. The year 2015 should be designated as the year \nof a universal moratorium on the death penalty. That \nwould be a first step towards its abolition. I call upon \nrepresentatives of countries that still include capital \npunishment in their legal system to support the \nmeasure and to participate in a process of reflection on \nthe meaning of that punishment inflicted by States. It \nmight seen utopian to aspire to achieve the full \nenjoyment and universal recognition of human rights \nand the eradication of extreme poverty in the course of \na single generation, but those goals are not utopian and \nnever will be. Utopias are often simply premature \ntruths. We must not delay or dismiss them with \nresignation or blind selfishness. Moreover, it is only by \nsetting off down that road that we can work towards \nthe just, secure and cooperative international order that \nwe all wish to see. \n The effects of the international financial crisis \nthat began one year ago are spreading throughout most \ndeveloped and less developed economies, and could \naffect the achievement of the Millennium Development \nGoals. There is a risk that the poorest countries will \nend up suffering even more because of improper \n \n \n25 08-51851 \n \npractices in the richer countries. The financial crisis \nhas conclusively demonstrated the need to reconsider \neconomic environments that are immune to regulation \nand governmental supervision. We already know what \nspeculation in the crucible of deregulation can lead to. \nToday, it is more important than ever to stress the role \nof institutions and Government in rationalizing the \nmarkets and their instrumentality in serving the real \nneeds of families, the well-being of individuals and \ntheir education, health care and social cohesion.  \n At the national level, the State protects markets \nfrom their own excesses. The global market lacks \nsimilar institutions to develop control and supervision \nfunctions. We need to revise the rules and institutions \nof the world economy. We need a common vision for \nthe establishment of a new international financial legal \nsystem. We have to learn from our mistakes, and do so \nquickly and in a spirit of cooperation. \n My Government would like to contribute actively \nto forging that new international financial order. We \nwill promote and support an agreement that contains \ndefinite commitments to supervision, transparency and \nearly warning by national institutions; ensures the \nflexible capacity of those institutions to provide \nliquidity and countercyclical reserves of capital to the \nmarkets in moments of need; and strengthens the role \nof international financial bodies. \n Prosperity for our peoples is possible only if there \nis international peace and security. Peace and security \nwill be possible only through effective multilateralism \nbased on respect for and the safeguarding of \ninternational law. For my country, there is no other way \nto imagine international order. Four years ago in this \nvery same Hall, I proposed an alliance of civilizations \nwith the objective of building bridges between \ndifferent cultures and breaking down the walls of \nmisunderstanding. Today, I am satisfied to note that the \ninitiative promoted by Spain and Turkey has been fully \nendorsed by the United Nations, and enjoys the support \nof a Group of Friends made up of 90 States and \ninternational organizations. \n The world can hope for peace only when dialogue \nand understanding of basic values that respect diversity \nare elevated above intolerance and fundamentalism.  \n Spain will continue to assert this conviction in all \nforums where our contribution is or can be relevant \u2014 \nincluding, first and foremost, at the United Nations. We \nwill do so not only because it is the best way to stress \nthe key desires of Spanish society, but also because we \nwant to shoulder our responsibility for bringing about \nthe just, secure, caring international order in which we \nbelieve.  \n The capacity for human progress cannot be \nquestioned. The thirst for discovery and innovation, the \ndesire to go beyond ourselves, opens the door for \nmeeting human needs every day in all areas. It is a \nquestion of placing this immense creative force in the \nservice of those values on which human dignity is \nbased, eliminating arbitrariness, injustice and all forms \nof discrimination, starting with those that women have \nso unfairly endured throughout history. We cannot \nstop; we cannot give up.  \n In the United Nations, with a rational attitude, \nwith the hope engendered by our common values, we \ncan launch an era of world prosperity and unity. For \nthat, we need coordination, not unilateral action. \nDevelopment must be sustainable and not uncontrolled. \nWe need permanent political dialogue. We should not \ngive in to old temptations or new cold wars. We have \nto eradicate extreme poverty and denounce the \nselfishness of the richest. We need the United Nations. \nWe need all men and women to know that their dignity \nis dependent on the dignity of their peers.  \n Above all, hundreds of millions of people in \nAfrica, Latin America and Asia need us: that must be \nthe basic purpose of our endeavours. Spain is \ncommitted to those endeavours and will fulfil its \nhistoric duty to eradicate extreme poverty around the \nworld. This generation can do it; this generation must \ndo it. "

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me great pleasure\nto extend to Julian Hunte warm congratulations on his\nelection as President of the fifty-eighth session of the\nGeneral Assembly. I wish also to take this opportunity\nto commend his predecessor for his invaluable\ncontribution to the success of the fifty-seventh session\nof the Assembly. Allow me also to extend my sincere\nappreciation to our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\nfor the great effort he has been making to maintain the\nintegrity of the United Nations in this difficult period\nin the history of the Organization. I wish also to\ncommend the Secretary-General for his invaluable\ncontribution in enhancing humanitarian assistance,\nfostering development cooperation and strengthening\nour esteemed Organization.\nI wish to preface my brief statement with sincere\nappreciation for all those who have responded with\ngenerous support to assist the people of Ethiopia to\novercome the consequences of a devastating and\nextended drought, which put at risk more than a dozen\nmillion of our compatriots. The responses from the\nUnited Nations, the United States, the European Union\nand many others were indeed as timely, as they were\ngenerous. The people of Ethiopia are grateful for this\ndemonstration of solidarity.\nWe in Ethiopia are the first to realize that this\nstate of affairs in our country cannot continue. Our\npeople cannot be allowed to be vulnerable to famine\nevery other year because of drought. It is a must for us,\nand a matter of national survival and dignity, to ensure\nfood security for our people in the shortest time\npossible. But this can be done only when our people\nare given respite for peace and are able to fully\nconcentrate on economic development.\nWe have come to be convinced that, for our\nstrategy on economic development and good\ngovernance to succeed, we need to enhance our\ncapacity in human resources development and\ninstitution-building. It is imperative for us to focus on\ncapacity-building and to make it a priority.\nIt has also been found critical that we expand\nfurther our decentralization exercise, with a view to\nempowering our people at the grass-roots level.\nWe have embarked on a fundamental shift in the\ncountry\u2019s foreign and national security policy, focusing\non the internal needs of our country and on ensuring its\nviability, which can be realized only through rapid\neconomic development and the nurturing of democratic\ngovernance.\nLike many countries in our continent, and\nperhaps more than most, Ethiopia has suffered at length\nas the result of conflict and war and its consequences.\nThe internal causes of the absence of peace and\ntranquillity in our country were removed, once and for\nall, when the military dictatorship came to an end and\nwhen we embarked upon laying the foundations for a\ndemocratic and just society 12 years ago.\nUntil 1998, Ethiopia made great progress that, if\ncontinued, would certainly have made us far more\nprepared to withstand the consequences of the extended\ndrought last year and the year before. But the\nAssembly recalls what befell Ethiopia in 1998. The\nstrong momentum we had managed to create for rapid\neconomic development was pushed off track by the\naggression we suffered in May 1998, which took us\ntwo years to reverse. Having reversed the aggression,\nEthiopia showed its unflinching respect for the\nprinciples of international law by taking the lead in\n13\n\nensuring the signing of the Algiers Agreement. With\nlittle hesitation, Ethiopia withdrew from territory that it\nhad seized in a counteroffensive to expel the invading\narmy from its territory and to make room for the\nTemporary Security Zone, to which the United Nations\nMission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) was\nsubsequently deployed.\nWe have now come to the point at which the\nUnited Nations will have to take greater interest to\nensure that the hopes and promises engendered by the\nAlgiers Agreement are fulfilled. The Agreement was\ndesigned to lead to durable peace between Ethiopia and\nEritrea. It was not meant to punish the victim of\naggression. This is why Ethiopia has felt it necessary to\ncall on the Security Council to help us achieve the\nhopes implicit in the Algiers Agreement.\nEthiopia is committed always to being a peaceful\ncountry. We have always been second to none in our\ncommitment to the principles of international law. This\nwill remain one of our people\u2019s distinguishing features.\nThis is a tradition we will continue to maintain and\nfoster. This is also how we intend to tackle the present\ncomplications in the implementation of the Algiers\nAgreement.\nFew regions of the world have suffered as a result\nof conflict as much as the Horn of Africa. We in\nEthiopia are committed, along with others in our\nsubregion, to change this existing reality. With the\nprogress that continues to be made in the peace process\nto resolve the conflict in Somalia, we are today more\nhopeful than ever that the long saga of the Somali\npeople might be about to end.\nI wish to seize this opportunity to thank the\nEuropean Union, the United Nations and others for the\ninvaluable assistance that they have continued to give\nto ensure the success of the peace process in Somalia.\nLittle progress could have been made without that\nsupport. The frontline countries of the\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)\nwill need even greater support for the success of the\npeace process in Somalia, which is now entering into\nits most critical phase.\nWe are also deeply encouraged by the peace\nprocess aimed at resolving the conflict in the Sudan,\nwhich has also entered into a very delicate phase. The\nparties deserve to be commended for the great resolve\nthey are demonstrating in addressing the common\nchallenges they are facing. The Framework Agreement\non Security Arrangements for the Interim Period,\nsigned on 25 September between the two parties,\nrepresents a major breakthrough, which will no doubt\nhelp lay the foundation for more progress in other\nareas. We would like to thank all those, the United\nStates Government in particular, who have made\ncontributions to the progress that has been made in the\npeace process in the Sudan.\nThese developments show that the situation in the\nHorn of Africa is not hopeless. The challenges we are\nfacing are nonetheless formidable. We in Ethiopia are\ndetermined to contribute more than our share to assist\nin the regeneration of our subregion, which has also\nbeen the target of international terrorism. The\nachievement of peace and national reconciliation in\nSomalia is extremely critical in the fight against this\nscourge as well. That is why all those who are willing\nto join in the fight against international terrorism\nshould be automatically supportive of the peace effort\nby IGAD in Somalia.\nAs a country from a region that has lost much and\nhas stayed far behind in development because of the\nabsence of peace, Ethiopia feels solidarity with all the\npeoples of the Middle East who yearn for peace,\nsecurity and justice. As a people very close to the\nMiddle East, Ethiopia has close affinity with the people\nof Palestine and with the people of Israel. It is our hope\nthat the suffering of both will end soon and that the\nhope held up by the road map will be realized.\nThe hope we have for economic development and\nthe prospect we see for peace in our subregion can\nhardly be made a reality without international\nconditions that are conducive to countries such as\nEthiopia to make progress.\nIn this respect, the general situation is not very\npromising. Under the circumstances, without greater\ncommitment by the developed world to the rapid\neconomic development of Africa, countries such as\nEthiopia will hardly be in a position to meet the\nMillennium Development Goals.\nThere is, without any doubt, an urgent need for\nincreasing the quality and the level of assistance by the\ndeveloped world to Africa. There is a critical need for\naddressing the problems surrounding issues related to\nsubsidies and the access of products from African\ncountries to developed countries\u2019 markets.\nInternational solidarity and the promotion of our\n14\n\nmutual interests make it imperative that a lasting\nsolution is found to the debt burden.\nAfrica is passing through a very difficult and\ncritical period. The HIV/AIDS pandemic is wreaking\nhavoc in the continent. As is now widely\nacknowledged, this is not simply a health crisis. The\npandemic is also an economic, security and social\ncrisis with broad and potentially devastating\nimplications. Hence, this is a challenge not only for\nAfrica, but also for the entire world.\nBut Africa is not asking to be rescued by the\ninternational community without discharging its own\nresponsibilities. What Africa is asking is to be given a\nbreak, as many have been given in the past at some\npoint in their history. In fact, what is involved here are\nmutual obligations. This is the overriding principle\nupon which the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s\nDevelopment (NEPAD) is based. It is Ethiopia\u2019s hope\nthat NEPAD will be taken more seriously as a\nframework for expanding the cooperation between\nAfrica and the developed countries in the interest of\nensuring success in Africa\u2019s fight for prosperity and\ndevelopment, and for a safe, peaceful and truly\nglobalized world.\nThe United Nations is facing today one of the\nmost difficult periods in its close to 60 years of history.\nIts legitimacy and credibility is being increasingly\nquestioned. Many have also questioned its\neffectiveness. Not a few have also wondered on many\noccasions whether they have always been assisted by\nthe Organization in nurturing and fostering peace. My\nown country has also been disappointed in the past. But\nwe have never abandoned hope in the United Nations\nor in multilateralism, because we know, at the end of\nthe day, that the United Nations is indispensable. That\nis why Ethiopia will always be committed to the United\nNations and its ideals.\nIt is our hope that all Member States, big and\nsmall, will be fully committed to the United Nations\nand its ideals and carry out the long overdue reform of\nthe Organization with a view to making it more\neffective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe international community is\ncurrently going through a period of reflection and self-\ndefinition. The great transformations that humanity\nexperienced during the course of the previous decade,\nas well as current challenges, demand greater\nresponsibility on the part of our nations in playing an\nactive role in the search for urgent solutions to the\nproblems that are affecting us. This new session of the\nGeneral Assembly presents us with an excellent\nopportunity to achieve that goal.\nToday, the Dominican Republic reaffirms its\ncommitment to peace, the defence of human rights,\nsecurity, sustainable development and the\nstrengthening of democracy \u2014 pillars of indisputable\nimportance in safeguarding international peace and\nstability.\nThe issue of the reform of the United Nations has\nbeen on our agenda for a long time. Events of recent\nyears make it clear that this task must be undertaken as\na matter of priority. The reform the Security Council is\nparticularly urgent. Ever since the approval of\nresolution 47/62 of 11 December 1992, we have been\nengaged in an ongoing debate on the various reform\nproposals. Now, however, it is time to act to restructure\nthe Council so as to make it more representative and\nequitable, as well as more transparent in its decision-\nmaking, thereby strengthening its legitimacy as the\nguarantor of international peace and security.\nTerrorism has emerged as an ongoing threat to\nhumanity. Uncertainty and pain have characterized the\nbeginning of the twenty-first century. Our nations have\nthe challenge of fighting together, at a global level,\nagainst the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction and in favour of equitable development and\nfree societies. Security problems call for decisive\naction against international terrorism, organized crime\nand the illegal trade in arms and drugs.\nThe Millennium Summit established as one of its\nmain goals the reduction of poverty by 50 per cent by\n2015. Notwithstanding some progress in the\nachievement of those goals, poverty remains a terrible\nscourge. The Dominican Government, which considers\nthat issue to be one of great importance, has created a\nSocial Cabinet to act as a coordinating mechanism for\nall governmental institutions for social welfare, and is\nhelping to ensure that both national and international\nresources are distributed equitably and allocated to\nregions that require social investment.\nAll countries must join efforts, accepting\nresponsibilities, both shared and separate, to guarantee\nthat growth and poverty do not go together and that, in\nmeeting the needs of the present generation, we do not\ncause the destruction of future generations\u2019 capacity to\nmeet their own needs.\nThe positive outcome of the Fourth Ministerial\nConference of the World Trade Organization, held in\nDoha, Qatar, in November 2001, and of the\nInternational Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment held in Monterrey, Mexico, in March\n2002, was a key element for achieving millennium\ndevelopment goals. The Doha Development Agenda\nand the Monterrey Consensus provided a framework to\nfacilitate market access, improve multilateral\nregulations for channelling globalization and increase\nfinancial aid for development.\nHowever, we must mention what happened at the\nFifth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO) recently held in Canc\u00fan, Mexico.\nAlthough agreement was not reached because of\nfundamental differences in the positions regarding\nessential world trade issues, we are convinced that this\nwill not affect the multilateral system of negotiations.\nOn the contrary, some member states maintain that this\nimpasse may even be necessary to shape more\nequitable international agreements at the heart of the\nWTO. What is an important issue is not to lose the\ndevelopment perspective within the work programme\nof the WTO, as set in the Doha Development Agenda,\nbecause that agenda includes the aspirations of millions\nof people around the world, whose hope for progress\nlies in the opportunities of the global economy.\nThe position of the Dominican Government with\nregard to the Middle East conflict is based primarily on\nunconditional adherence to the norms and principles of\ninternational law, particularly those related to the\npeaceful solution of disputes; condemning the use of\nforce and terrorism in all its forms; complying in good\nfaith with international treaties; and on strict\nobservance of resolutions of the United Nations and its\ndeliberative bodies.\nDevoted to these principles, the Dominican\nRepublic has, in response to the humanitarian appeals\n17\n\nof the Security Council, participated in the efforts to\nrebuild Iraq, in order to contribute to the development\nof a secure and stable environment in which the\nsovereignty of the Iraqi people may be restored.\nSimilarly, our country supports the peace process\noutlined in the road map submitted by the United States\nof America and endorsed by the Russian Federation,\nthe United Nations and the European Union. We\nunderstand that a cessation of violence cannot be\npostponed, along with the historic pledges of all parties\nto make sacrifices to promote a lasting solution to the\nconflict and peaceful coexistence.\nDrawing up sustainable development policies\ncalls for dealing with problems before they emerge.\nThis implies making headway in achieving the\nmillennium development goals, particularly on crucial\nissues such as energy and protection of the\nenvironment. In this respect, our nation reiterates its\nrejection of the international maritime transport of\nradioactive and toxic waste, a position which has been\nexpressed in other international forums. This issue is\nlinked to international security.\nThe importance of guaranteeing women equal\nrights and equity, and promoting their increased\npolitical participation, has been a continuous concern\nof the heads of State in various international forums.\nThe International Research and Training Institute for\nthe Advancement of Women (INSTRAW), the only\ninstitution within the United Nations system dedicated\nexclusively to that end, has its headquarters in Santo\nDomingo, capital of the Dominican Republic. The\nDominican Government calls upon Member States to\ncontinue supporting the work of INSTRAW in the\nDominican Republic by providing contributions, to the\nextent that they can.\nOur country commends the culture of peace, and\nis making efforts to ensure that at the primary level\nchildren are taught about promoting mutual\nunderstanding and learn about civics and human rights.\nSimilarly, we believe that a solid and permanent\ndemocracy is an achievable goal. The challenges here\nare clear: growing democracy, more respect for civic\nrights, freedom of the press; freedom of expression of\npolitical parties and public opinion; dignity and\ntransparency of all leaders and the moral legitimacy of\nall.\nDeeply concerned about the spread of HIV/AIDS\nin our nation, the Government has made great efforts to\ncomply with the commitments entered into in the\nDeclaration on fighting this terrible disease. We call for\nincreased international cooperation and efforts to\nguarantee the availability of drugs at affordable prices,\nbased on the Doha Declaration on intellectual property\nand the right to health.\nThe Dominican Republic salutes with optimism\nthe role played by the United Nations and the\nOrganization of American States (OAS) in efforts to\ndevelop humanitarian aid programmes for the Haitian\npeople. It is imperative to stress here the need for\ngreater support from the international community for\nour neighbouring republic of Haiti and its neglected\npopulation.\nAlthough we are aware that this issue has been\nexcluded from the agenda of the current session , we\nwish to state our support for the aspirations of the\nRepublic of China, Taiwan, to rejoin this Organization,\nof which it was a Member for many years. Our position\nis in line with the universal principles contained in the\nCharter, the basis of the rules of international law and\nthe historical tradition of friendly relations with\nTaiwan.\nOn behalf of the Dominican Government, Sir,\nmay I congratulate you on your election as President,\nconfident that your conduct of this session will be\nsuccessful, beneficial for the international community\nand a source of pride to your country, Saint Lucia, and\nthus to our Caribbean community.\nI also wish to express the Dominican\nGovernment\u2019s rejection of the barbaric act perpetrated\nagainst the United Nations Mission in Baghdad on 19\nAugust, and to reiterate to the families of Mr. Sergio\nVieira de Mello and of the other deceased colleagues\nour most heartfelt condolences.\nWe are all aware of the great challenges\nconfronting humanity. Our future depends on the\nactions we take now. We have the opportunity to meet\nthe expectations of the nations of the world. Let us take\nup this challenge with all due responsibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet my first\nwords before this world parliament be of confidence in\nthe human capacity to overcome challenges and to\nmove towards higher forms of partnership, both within\nand among nations. On behalf of the Brazilian people, I\nreaffirm our belief in the United Nations. Its role in\npromoting peace and social justice remains\nirreplaceable.\nI pay tribute to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for\nthe leadership that he has shown in defence of a world\nunited through respect for international law and\nsolidarity among nations.\nThe Assembly convenes under the impact of the\nbrutal attack on the United Nations Mission in\nBaghdad, which took the life of its head officer, the\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights, our compatriot\nSergio Vieira de Mello. Sergio's renowned competence\nwas nurtured by the only weapons in which he\nbelieved: dialogue, persuasion and, above all, concern\nfor those who are most vulnerable. On behalf of the\nUnited Nations, he showed a tolerant, peace-loving and\ncourageous humanism that mirrors Brazil's libertarian\nsoul. Sergio's sacrifice, and that of his colleagues, must\nnot be in vain. We can best honour his memory by\nredoubling our efforts to protect human dignity\nwherever it is threatened.\nI warmly greet Mr. Julian Hunte, who was elected\nPresident of the Assembly at a particularly grave\nmoment in the history of the United Nations. The\ninternational community faces enormous political,\neconomic and social challenges requiring an\naccelerated pace of reform. Only thus will our\ncollective decisions and actions be truly respected and\neffective.\nIn my nine months as President of Brazil, I have\nconferred with leaders of all continents, and I have\nsensed in them a deep concern to defend and strengthen\nmultilateral institutions. The improvement of the\nmultilateral system is a necessary counterpart to\ndemocratic practice within nations. Every nation that\npractices democracy must strive to ensure that in\ninternational affairs, decision-making is equally open,\ntransparent, legitimate and representative. The\ntragedies that have befallen Iraq and the Middle East\ncan be overcome only within a multilateral\nframework   one in which the United Nations is given\na central role.\nIn Iraq, the prevailing climate of insecurity and\ngrowing tension makes national reconstruction an even\nmore complex task. That impasse can be overcome\nonly under the leadership of the United Nations  \nleadership not only in re-establishing acceptable\nsecurity conditions, but also in guiding the political\nprocess towards the restoration of Iraqi sovereignty as\nsoon as possible. We must not shy away from our\ncollective responsibilities. A war can perhaps be won\nsingle-handedly, but peace   lasting peace   cannot\nbe secured without the support of all.\nTwo years later, the images of the barbaric attack\non 11 September still haunt us. There is a\ncommendable willingness today to adopt more\neffective measures to deal with terrorism, with\nweapons of mass destruction and with organized crime.\nUnfortunately, there are also worrisome signs of an\nattempt to discredit the Organization and even to divest\nthe United Nations of its political authority. Let there\nbe no ambiguity on this subject: no matter how\ninvaluable its humanitarian work, the United Nations\n6\n\nwas conceived to do more than simply to clear away\nthe rubble of conflicts that it was unable to prevent.\nOur central task is to preserve people from the scourge\nof war, to negotiate settlements inspired by the\nprinciples and objectives of the San Francisco Charter.\nLet us not place greater trust on military might than on\nthe institutions we created with the light of reason and\nthe vision of history.\nReform of the United Nations has become an\nurgent task, given the present risks to the international\npolitical order.\nThe Security Council must be fully empowered to\ndeal with crises and threats to peace. It must therefore\nbe equipped with the tools for effective action. Above\nall, its decisions must seen as legitimate by the\ncommunity of nations as a whole. Its composition, in\nparticular as concerns permanent membership, cannot\nremain unaltered almost 60 years later. It can no longer\nignore the changing world. More specifically, it must\ntake into account the emergence on the international\nscene of developing countries. They have become\nimportant actors that often exercise a critical role in\nensuring the pacific settlement of disputes.\nBrazil believes that it has a useful contribution to\nmake. It seeks not to advance an exclusive conception\nof international security, but rather to give expression\nto the perceptions and aspirations of a region that today\nis a hallmark of peaceful coexistence among its\nmembers and that is a force for international stability.\nGiven the support we received in South America and\nbeyond, Brazil is encouraged to continue advocating\nfor a Security Council that better reflects contemporary\nreality.\nWe also favour an Economic and Social Council\ncapable of bringing about a fair and just economic\norder. It is crucial that the Economic and Social\nCouncil regain the role bestowed upon it by the\nfounding fathers of the Organization. We wish to see\nthe Economic and Social Council cooperate actively\nwith the Security Council in preventing conflicts and in\nnation building.\nThe General Assembly, in turn, must be\nstrengthened politically so as to focus on priority issues\nand avoid duplication of effort. The General Assembly\nhas fulfilled a historically important role by convening\nmajor conferences and other meetings on human rights,\nthe environment, population, women's rights, racial\ndiscrimination, AIDS and social development.\nHowever, the General Assembly should not hesitate to\nassume its responsibilities for maintaining international\npeace and security. Our Organization has shown that\nthere are legal and political alternatives to a veto-\ninduced paralysis and to actions lacking multilateral\nendorsement.\nPeace, security, development and social justice\nare indivisible. Brazil has endeavoured to practice with\nutmost consistency the principles for which it stands.\nThe new relationship we are forging with our South\nAmerican neighbours is founded on mutual respect,\nfriendship and cooperation.\nWe are moving beyond our shared history and\ngeography to create a unique sense of kinship and\npartnership. In this context, our relationship with\nArgentina remains crucial.\nSouth America and Latin America are\nincreasingly seen as a region of peace, democracy and\ndevelopment that aspires to become a new outpost for\ngrowth in a stagnating world economy.\nWe are deepening the already significant ties with\ntraditional partners in North America and Europe,\nbut we also seek to widen and diversify our\ninternational presence. Our relations with China and\nthe Russian Federation have revealed unexpected\ncomplementarities.\nWe are proud to be the country with the second\nlargest population of African descent in the world. In\nNovember, I will be travelling to five countries in\nSouthern Africa to foster economic, political, social\nand cultural cooperation. With the same goal in mind,\nwe will also host a summit meeting between South\nAmerican countries and the member States of the\nLeague of Arab States. With India and South Africa we\nhave established a trilateral forum for political\nconsultations and joint projects.\nThe protectionism practised by rich countries\nunfairly penalizes efficient producers in developing\ncountries. Today this is the greatest obstacle to\nlaunching a new era of economic and social progress.\nBrazil and its partners in the G-22 maintained during\nthe World Trade Organization summit meeting at\nCancun that the crucial goal of effectively opening\nmarkets is achievable through pragmatic and mutually\nreinforcing negotiations that bring about an effective\nopening of markets. I reaffirm our willingness to travel\nalong a path that converges towards solutions that\n7\n\nbenefit all countries, taking into account the interests\nof developing countries.\nWe are entirely in favour of free trade as long as\nwe can all compete on a level playing field.\nLiberalization should not require countries to abandon\nthe prerogative of formulating industrial, technological,\nsocial and environmental policy. In Brazil we are\nengaged in setting up a new framework that balances\neconomic stability and social inclusion. From that\nstandpoint, trade negotiations are not an end in\nthemselves, but rather a means to foster development\nand overcome poverty. International trade should be a\ntool not only for creating wealth, but also for its\ndistribution.\nI reaffirm before this truly universal Assembly\nthe appeal I launched at the Davos and Porto Alegre\nforums and at the Enlarged Summit of the G-8 at\nEvian. We must wage   both politically and\nmaterially   the only war from which we will all\nemerge victorious: the war against hunger and extreme\npoverty.\nThe eradication of hunger in the world is a moral\nand political imperative. And we all know that it is\npossible. What is truly required is political will.\nI do not wish to dwell on indications of\nbarbarism. I would rather acknowledge ethical and\nsocial progress, no matter how modest. Yet we cannot\ndismiss the statistics that expose the terrible scourge of\nextreme poverty and hunger in the world. Hunger today\ntouches a fourth of the world's population, including\n300 million children. Daily, 24,000 people fall victim\nto malnutrition-related diseases.\nNothing is more absurd or intolerable than the\npervasiveness of hunger in the twenty-first century, this\ngolden age of science and technology.\nWith each passing day, human intelligence\nenlarges the horizons of the possible and achieves\nprodigious feats. Yet, hunger persists and, what is\nworse, it is spreading throughout various regions of the\nplanet.\nThe more we seem to approach the divine through\nour creative abilities, the more humanity betrays its\naspirations through our inability to respect and protect\nour fellow creatures. The more we celebrate God by\ngenerating riches, the more we hurt our ideals by not\nminimally sharing them.\nWhat is the use of all our science and technology,\nof all the abundance and luxury that it has generated, if\nwe do not put it to use, guaranteeing the most sacred of\nrights: the right to life?\nI recall the penetrating warning, made by Pope\nPaul VI 36 years ago, but which is still surprisingly\nrelevant: The starving people of the world\ndramatically address their plea to the wealthy'.\nHunger is an emergency, and it should be dealt\nwith as such. The eradication of hunger is a\ncivilizational challenge that requires that we seek a\nshortcut to the future. Will we act to eliminate hunger\nor will we forsake our credibility through omission?\nWe no longer have the right to allege that we were not\nhome when they knocked at our door asking for\nsolidarity. We have no right to say to the famished who\nhave waited for so long: come back next century. The\ntrue path to peace is to fight hunger and extreme\npoverty to the end, in a campaign of solidarity that\nunites the planet rather than deepening the divisions\nand the hatred that inflame people and sow terror.\nDespite the failure of systems that favour the\ngeneration of wealth without reducing extreme poverty,\nmany people still persist in their short-sightedness and\ngreed.\nSince my inauguration as President of Brazil on 1\nJanuary, significant progress has been made on the\neconomic front. Stability is back and the groundwork\nfor a renewed cycle of sustained growth has been laid.\nWe will continue to work hard to balance public\naccounts and to reduce external vulnerability. We will\nspare no effort to increase exports, raise the savings\nrate, attract foreign investment and start growing again.\nYet at the same time we must strive to cope with\nthe need for food, jobs, education and health services\nfor millions of Brazilians living below the poverty line.\nWe are committed to bringing about major social\nreform in the country.\nHunger is the most dramatic and urgent\nexpression of a structural imbalance requiring\ncorrection through integrated policies that foster full\ncitizenship. That is why I launched the zero hunger'\nprogramme in Brazil. It seeks to eradicate hunger and\nits root causes in the shortest possible time by\npromoting major solidarity and wide-ranging\nprogrammes bringing together Government, civil\nsociety and the private sector. The results of those\n8\n\nemergency and structural measures are already\nbenefiting 4 million individuals who were previously\ndenied the right to a daily meal. The goal of this\nprogramme is to guarantee that no Brazilians will go\nhungry.\nThe United Nations adopted the highly acclaimed\nMillennium Development Goals. The Food and\nAgriculture Organization has at its disposal outstanding\ntechnical and social expertise. But we need to make a\nqualitative leap in the global endeavour to fight hunger.\nThat is why I proposed setting up a global fund to fight\nhunger and suggested means to make it operational.\nOther proposals have been put forward as well, some\nalready integrated into existing United Nations\nprogrammes.\nWhat has been lacking until now is the\nindispensable political will of us all, especially of those\ncountries in a position to contribute most. Creating new\nfunds is of no use if no resources are committed to\nthem. The Millennium Development Goals are very\nworthy, but if we remain passive, if our collective\nbehaviour remains unchanged, those Goals may never\nmaterialize, and the ensuing frustration will be\nimmense.\nNow more than ever, good intentions must give\nrise to concrete gestures. We must put commitments\ninto practice. We must practice what we preach   with\naudacity, good sense and our feet firmly on the ground,\nyet boldly, and with new methods, solutions and\nintense social participation.\nFor this reason, I am submitting a proposal for\nconsideration by the General Assembly to establish a\nworld committee within the United Nations itself to\nfight hunger. It would be made up of heads of State or\nGovernment from all continents with the purpose of\nunifying and operationalizing proposals. We hope to\nattract donations from developed and developing\ncountries according to their capacities, as well as from\nlarge private enterprises and non-governmental\norganizations.\nMy life experience and political history have\ntaught me to believe above all in the power of\ndialogue. I will never forget Gandhi's invaluable lesson\nthat when out of violence something good appears to\nresult, this good is at best short-lived, while the evil\nthat it produces is enduring. Democratic dialogue is the\nmost efficient of all tools for change. With the same\ndetermination that goes into my endeavours and those\nof my partners to make Brazilian society more just and\nhumane, I will invest in the establishment of\ninternational partnerships that foster equitable\ndevelopment and a more peace-loving, tolerant and\nunified world.\nThis century, so full of technological and material\npromise, must not be allowed to slide into political and\nspiritual decline. It is our obligation to mould, under\nthe reinvigorated leadership of the United Nations, an\ninternational climate of peace and conciliation. True\npeace will bloom from democracy, from respect for\ninternational law, from the dismantling of deadly\nweapons arsenals and, above all, from the final\neradication of hunger in the world.\nWe cannot afford to frustrate such high hopes.\nThe greatest and noblest challenge facing humanity is\nprecisely that of becoming more humane. It is time to\ncall peace by its true name: social justice. I am\nconvinced that together we shall be able to grasp this\nhistoric opportunity to bring about justice.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI bring to the\nAssembly greetings and good wishes from the\nPresident of the Republic of Palau, Tommy E.\nRemengesau, Jr., and from the people and the\nGovernment of the Republic of Palau.\nNearly 60 years ago, in his final inaugural\naddress, United States President Franklin Delano\nRoosevelt reflected on the lessons of the first half of\nthe twentieth century. He said:\n\u201cWe have learned that we cannot live alone,\nat peace; that our own well-being is dependent on\nthe well-being of other nations far away. ... We\nhave learned to be citizens of the world, members\nof the human community.\u201d\nThose words have more resonance today than ever\nbefore as Palau and the rest of the world enter into the\ntwenty-first century. The Republic of Palau is enjoying\nrapid development, which came with its independence\non 1 October nine years ago. However, at a time of\nrapid globalization, when events halfway around the\nworld \u2014 and most recently in our own backyard \u2014 can\nprofoundly affect our safety and prosperity, Palau\nrealizes that it must join the international community in\nthis new challenge to protect our people at home and\nour way of life.\nTo that end, the Republic of Palau reaffirms its\nunwavering support for the war led by the United\nStates against terrorism. We all benefit when nations\n12\n\ncome together to deter aggression and terrorism, to\nresolve conflicts, to prevent the spread of diseases and\nthe spread of dangerous weapons, to promote\ndemocracy and human rights, to open markets and to\ncreate economic and financial stability, to raise living\nstandards and to protect the environment \u2014 to face\nthose myriad challenges that no nation can meet alone.\nGlobalization, however, also brings about risks.\nOutlaw States and ethnic conflicts threaten regional\nstability and progress in many important areas of the\nworld. Weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, drug\ntrafficking and other international crimes are global\nconcerns that transcend national borders. Other\nproblems originating overseas \u2014 such as the depletion\nof resources, rapid population growth, environmental\ndamage, new infectious diseases such as severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome (SARS), pervasive corruption\nand uncontrolled refugee migration \u2014 have\nincreasingly significant implications for every nation\u2019s\nsecurity. National economies will suffer if the global\neconomy is unstable or if markets collapse, and the\nhighest environmental standards \u2014 such as those set\nout in the Kyoto Protocol \u2014 will not protect small,\nstruggling island countries like Palau if other countries\ndo not join the global effort to bring about peace and\nstability.\nProtection of the environment is a major concern\nto us. Decisions made today regarding the environment\nand natural resources can affect every nation\u2019s security\nfor generations. Environmental threats do not respect\nnational borders, but they can pose long-term dangers\nfor every nation\u2019s security and well-being. Scarcity and\ndepletion of natural resources can trigger and\nexacerbate conflict. Environmental threats \u2014 such as\nclimate change, the depletion of stratospheric ozone,\nthe introduction of nuisance plant and animal species,\nthe overharvesting of fish and of other living natural\nresources, and the transnational movement of\nhazardous chemicals and waste \u2014 directly threaten the\nhealth and economic well-being of every people of the\nworld. For Palau, the immediate danger is the rise in\nsea level.\nAnother issue that we wish to address is that of\nthe cloning of human beings. We believe that any\nglobal and comprehensive ban on human cloning must\ninclude a ban on the cloning of human embryos for\nresearch purposes. While the goal of finding cures to\nchronic illnesses is laudable, progress and economic\ngain achieved by creating and destroying human life\ncome at too high a price. We believe that adult-stem-\ncell research is a promising field of study that can\nprovide an ethical source of stem cells for scientific\ninvestigation. The international community must not\nallow human life to be devalued in any way, and we\nencourage all States to adopt such measures as may be\nnecessary to prohibit techniques of genetic engineering\nthat may have adverse consequences on respect for\nhuman dignity.\nIn public health, we note that many peoples\naround the world are suffering and dying each day\nfrom the scourges of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria,\ncancer, polio and similar diseases. Combined\ninternational support for public health beyond the\nclinic walls must be advocated and put into practice if\nwe are to eliminate some of those challenges to quality\nhuman life.\nSuch international support and collaborative\nefforts were recently manifested during the spread of\nsevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). I also urge\nall members of this body to support and ratify the\nFramework Convention on Tobacco Control adopted by\nthe World Health Assembly this year. More\nimportantly, we should combine our efforts to\nimplement the mission of the Convention to control\ntobacco use, which contributes to diseases and death\nthroughout the world.\nThe United Nations is to truly represent all\npeoples, with discrimination and exclusion eliminated\nfrom its operational practice. To be effective at\nensuring international peace and security, all nations,\nlarge and small, must be represented in the United\nNations. The Republic of China on Taiwan can no\nlonger be kept on the sidelines of the most important\ninternational Organization and the leading forum for\ninternational dialogue. Over the past half-century, the\nhard-working people of Taiwan have transformed their\ncountry into the world\u2019 s seventeenth largest economy\nand a vibrant democracy. In 1996, Taiwan had its first\ndirect presidential election and, in 2000, accomplished\nits first peaceful transfer of executive powers. Since\nthen Taiwan\u2019s popularly-elected Government has acted\nin accordance with United Nations resolutions to\ncombat international terrorism and to support\nhumanitarian relief in countries throughout the world,\nand yet it is still excluded from the process. Our\nexperience with SARS has shown us that exclusion can\nbring no benefits to anyone. The 23 million Taiwanese\npeople have an equal right to a voice in the United\n13\n\nNations and should be welcomed by all members of\nthis body.\nThe central purpose of the United Nations is the\npreservation and advancement of world peace. It\naccomplishes its peacemaking and humanitarian\nassistance efforts through international cooperation. Its\n191 Member States, large and small, rich and poor, and\nwith different political views, strive collectively to\naddress global challenges and advance world peace.\nTogether, they consider and decide on the world\u2019s most\npressing problems. Thus, in this regard I ask the world\nhere today, at the fifty-eighth session of the General\nAssembly, to study and discuss the roots of terrorism\nand possible solutions, including inter-religious\nintervention; to promote conservation standards to\nprotect our Earth\u2019s environment; to promote world\npublic health; to protect the human dignity by banning\nthe cloning of human embryos; and to continue our\nquest for peace and security for all peoples of the\nworld.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like to take this\nopportunity to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your\nelection. My Government is deeply gratified by the\nrecognition of your accomplishments, especially given\nthat you are a fellow islander. We are confident you\nwill lead the work of this body with the same high\ncompetence as your distinguished predecessor, His\nExcellency Jan Kavan of the Czech Republic.\nBefore going further I must pause in respectful\nremembrance of the second anniversary of the terrorist\nattacks of 11 September 2001. We honour the memory\nof all who were lost. I must also express our sincere\ncondolences over the great loss of life recently at the\nUnited Nations headquarters in Baghdad.\nI am grateful for the privilege of appearing before\nthis body for the first time, as President of the\nFederated States of Micronesia. We feel a deep sense of\nresponsibility in joining with nations present here to\nwork toward a better world for all peoples.\nFor the past several years, much of the discussion\nhere and elsewhere has focused on political challenges\naround the world. After 11 September, it is not at all\nsurprising that these challenges have commanded the\nlion's share of everyone's attention. We in the\nFederated States of Micronesia remain committed to\nthe eradication of terrorism in all its forms, and will\ncontinue to play the role open to us as the world strives\nto reach this goal.\nHowever, the challenges of the environment and\nof sustainable development that occupied so much of\nour attention during the 1990s have not gone away.\nDespite the immediacy of so many pressing demands\ntoday, those remain challenges that the international\ncommunity cannot afford to put on hold. We cannot put\nthem on hold because they are part and parcel of the\nworldwide security challenge, especially over the\nlonger term.\nNo part of our world is immune to the wide range\nof fundamental security threats. War and terrorism are\nonly consequences of their deeper root causes: poverty,\nhuman injustice and, more recently, environmental\ndegradation. These are most often discussed in the\ncontext of the more populous regions of the world, but\nI ask the Assembly not to overlook the fact that they\nalso present themselves to the small island developing\nStates.\nThe unique vulnerability of our island States to\nall those scourges is widely recognized. Even so,\nglobal threat assessments most often are not followed\nup by a realistic allocation of resources to the more\nremote   yet also more vulnerable   places, where\nthreats to global security often find their origin or seek\nrefuge. I submit to the Assembly that the region of the\nPacific islands has for too long been overlooked in that\nway.\nWe welcomed the initiative of the international\ncommunity to address those and related development\nproblems during the World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment. But we returned home, and we still find\nourselves struggling just as much as ever with\nfundamental needs. As memories of Johannesburg are\npushed into the background by seemingly more urgent\ncrises, our people are beginning to ask questions about\nthis process. They are asking whether repetitious\ndiscussion of traditional development strategies at a\nlengthening string of summit venues offers the most\nproductive avenue for achieving real development\n18\n\ngoals. We must consider these things with a broader\nconsciousness. The challenges are enormous, and they\nare immediate. I say to the Assembly respectfully that\nbusiness-as-usual multilateralism is not getting the job\ndone.\nBefore proceeding, I should say that today's\nMicronesians do enjoy a much-improved standard of\nliving in comparison with the conditions that existed\nwhen we were introduced to the world economy less\nthan 50 years ago. However, we still have very far to\ngo before we can reach the levels of even the\nmoderately successful developing countries, let alone\nof the industrialized world.\nIn saying what I do here about my own country's\ndifficulties, I must add that we are by no means alone.\nTherefore, we stand with developing countries\neverywhere, and we fully support the positions to be\nexpressed here by His Majesty the King of Morocco on\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China, and by His\nExcellency the Prime Minister of Mauritius on behalf\nof the Alliance of Small Island States.\nWe must all do more. For our part, the small\nisland developing States need to ensure that we meet\nour obligations and fulfil our undertakings to the global\ncommunity. We are not just supplicants; we have roles\nto play. My country has made commitments to\nenvironmental responsibility in line with our capacity.\nWe have pledged increased accountability and\noversight of development assistance. We have resolved\nto build our capacity to govern more effectively and to\nincrease regional interaction.\nI believe that all developing countries should\nexplore how we can mobilize our limited resources,\nindividually and collectively, even as we seek\nassistance. In that regard, I commend to the\nAssembly's attention the communiqu\u00c8 of the Pacific\nIslands Forum issued this year at Auckland, New\nZealand. It is illustrative of the kind of regional\ncollaboration I encourage here. For example, we in the\nForum agreed this year to an important and\ncomprehensive statement of principles fundamental to\ngood governmental leadership and recognized by all. I\nthink that it deserves close study by the Assembly.\nSerious attention was also given by the Forum leaders\nto the challenges presented by international criminal\nelements attracted to our region. They are attracted in\npart by our out-of-sight, out-of-mind' status. It was\nrecognized at the Forum that, given our limitations\nindividually, we can confront those challenges only\nthrough regional, collective action.\nWe are also now seeing, more than ever before,\nentire regions of the world marginalized in the global\neconomy, as witness the sad breakdown of the World\nTrade Organization (WTO) meetings recently. Some\ncountries have been virtually ignored until social and\npolitical conditions have severely deteriorated.\nWe are hearing more frequently the term failed\nState'. It has no clear definition, but it has been used\non occasion to justify outside intervention. That may\nbe necessary under certain circumstances, but it is in\nthe interests of all that such conditions should not\ndevelop in the first place. I submit that the causes of\nany such so-called failure can be traced far beyond the\nborders of the unfortunate country that is so labelled.\nThe time is ripe for a new way of looking at\ninternational peace and security. No longer can\neconomic, social and environmental issues exist in a\nparallel universe, divorced from geopolitical\nconsiderations. The linkages are becoming all too clear,\nas the alarming findings of this year's United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) report on\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals\nconfirm.\nDespite our best efforts, we still face the full\nrange of threats to our natural environment. Those\nthreats are not diminishing. In fact, on a global scale,\nprogress by the world community has been glacial in\nthe face of ever more pressing demands for action. We\nmay say to ourselves that any disastrous outcomes lie\nwell in the future, but we can act only in the present.\nWe are literally making   or failing to make   life\ndecisions for the yet-unborn.\nOne of the most clear and present emergencies\nhas figured prominently in our statements in the\ngeneral debate every year since our country became a\nUnited Nations Member; I refer to the need for\nimmediate international action to combat climate\nchange. Regrettably, I cannot speak with any less\nconcern this year. If anything, our appeals must\nbecome more urgent. At a time when we speak of many\nwars, there is also the war against climate change   a\nwar that mankind cannot afford to lose.\nI know you can appreciate better than most,\nMr. President, that, for my family and me, the issue of\nclimate change is a present reality. My island, Woleai,\n19\n\nin Yap State, is an atoll with no point higher than two\nmeters above sea level. The frequency and the intensity\nof storms in our region have been increasing for some\ntime.\nDuring the last year we experienced three major\ntyphoons, as well as other destructive storms. One of\nthem triggered massive mudslides on the state of\nChuuk's higher islands, and 50 people died. In Yap\nstate, a recent storm washed away a large and very old\ncemetery. These and similar recent events in our other\nstates are unprecedented. Everything we are, and hope\nto achieve as a people, is under grave threat because of\nglobal climate change.\nHaving confirmed that the climate change crisis\nis real, the entire world also now possesses\nindisputable evidence that its steady progression can be\nlaid at the doorstep of human activity. Yet some of the\nworst polluters among the industrialized countries see\nit as their top priority to protect vested interests. They\nare purposely delaying the immediate action that is\nrequired to begin to turn the tide of destructive climate\nalteration.\nIn the Framework Convention, it was agreed by\nall that those bearing the responsibility for causing this\nproblem must take the lead in resolving it. Yet, I must\nask today, where is that leadership?\nIt is very sad that the Kyoto Protocol, which is a\npositive achievement, has been converted by some\nGovernments into a political target   a rallying cry for\nthe worst polluters. In fact, it represents nothing more\nthan a small first step that must be followed up by\nstrong subsequent actions if the war against climate\nchange is to be at all effective. The scornful attitude\ntoward the Protocol shown by some countries will\ndoom the entire Framework Convention to utter failure\nif the current situation remains unchanged. The Kyoto\nProtocol must be brought into effect without further\ndelay. The industrial Powers cannot continue to make\nthe plea of Saint Augustine, Lord, make me thy\nservant, but not yet awhile.'\nSince our people live in such close harmony with\nthe natural environment, we also face a host of other\npressing environmental issues. Our coral reefs are\ngetting a great deal of international attention partly\nbecause of their potential for commercial exploitation.\nWe appreciate those possibilities and are determined to\npreserve our legal rights in any exploitation that takes\nplace.\nBut we also appreciate the reefs as our natural\nbuffers against the sea and the hosts for marine\nresources far beyond the regular bounty of present-day\nfishing. This is more than a resource; it is a lifeline for\nmany island countries. The serious decline in the health\nof coral reefs all over the world must be reversed.\nStocks of our only substantial economic\nresource   tuna   have seen a marked decline in\nrecent years. Other species and key elements of the\nocean ecosystem are also now imperilled as never\nbefore. The Federated States of Micronesia will be\nlobbying for an aggressive oceans resource protection\npolicy in both the regional and international arenas.\nWater itself, and access to it, is very much a\nthreatened resource in our country, where we are\nsurrounded by the ocean but have limited fresh water.\nWe rely upon rainwater and its collection in the lenses\nthat lies beneath our atolls. Every drop is precious. We\nsay that a vulnerable life, such as that of a child, is like\nmorning dew on a taro leaf, to be handled with care so\nthat it does not slip away.\nMembers may be surprised to learn that islands in\nthe Pacific Ocean, so often pictured in everyone's\ndream of paradise, are more concerned about drought\nthan any other natural threat, including typhoons. Not\nonly do we experience the salt-water corruption of our\nfresh water and our food crops, as a result of increased\nstorm activity and sea-level rise, we also now must try\nto cope with droughts brought on by increasingly\nunpredictable El Ni\u00d2o activity linked to climate\nchange.\nFortunately, the world in general seems to be\nwaking up to the universal human requirement for\naccess to adequate, clean water. The special exposure\nof island countries received welcome attention at the\nrecent Third World Water Forum in Kyoto. In addition,\nI wish to point to a very important, first-ever\ninterregional collaboration on this vital subject, in the\nform of a Memorandum of Understanding recently\nconcluded between our South Pacific Applied\nGeoscience Commission and the Caribbean\nEnvironmental Health Institute.\nI have spoken much about my country's concerns\nbut, of course, we are not alone in these concerns. The\nworld's small island developing States face largely the\nsame set of issues in different degrees.\n20\n\nFor that reason, we were grateful for the\ninternational attention generated by the first United\nNations Global Conference on the Sustainable\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, held\nin Barbados in 1994. The Barbados Programme of\nAction, which was the product of that Conference, has\nbeen a limited success. The Conference succeeded in\nfocusing attention on the unique set of problems our\nsmall island nations face. However, it seems that the\ninternational community has to some extent been\ncontent to raise awareness of the issues, while showing\na waning interest in implementing specific measures\nduring the years following the Conference itself.\nWe applaud the decision to hold a follow-up\nconference in Mauritius in 2004, and we look forward\nto a frank evaluation of the progress, or lack thereof, in\nimplementing the Barbados Plan of Action during the\npast 10 years. It is my hope that the Mauritius\nconference will afford an opportunity to regain lost\nmomentum.\nThis is a landmark year for my nation. We have\ncompleted 17 years in a post-trusteeship political\nrelationship with the United States. By all accounts,\nthis has been a success. Never before has free\nassociation been attempted on this scale.\nI am pleased that both my country and our\ndevelopment partner, the United States, have seen fit to\ncontinue this relationship into the future by amending\nthe treaty between us known as the Compact of Free\nAssociation. As we celebrate the success that this\nrenewal represents, it is proper to recall the long and\neffective stewardship of our region by the United\nNations Trusteeship Council.\nWe are grateful for the lasting contribution of the\nUnited Nations system to the history of Micronesia,\nand we look forward to continuing to work in this body\nand others in the United Nations system to reach our\ncollective goals.\nIn closing, I would like to refer to the words of\nthe American President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who\nonce said,\nIf I were asked to state the great objective which\nchurch and state are both demanding for the sake\nof every man and woman and child in this\ncountry, I would say that the great objective is a\nmore abundant life.'\nI believe that the President was speaking of true\nabundance, not only in a material sense, but also in the\nsense of the security of mind and body that comes with\nfreedom, opportunity and human fulfilment.\nWe must ask ourselves whether what we are\nstriving for here at the United Nations is faithful to that\nlofty ideal. This Organization is the greatest forum ever\ncreated on this planet. It cannot afford to allow its\nimportant role in conflict management to push aside\nthe even greater task of managing the conditions that\nproduce those conflicts. We bring together here, under\nthe guidance of the Charter, for the first time in human\nhistory, all kinds of resources necessary to lead\nmankind to a more abundant life. Let it not be said of\nus later that we failed in that task.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like to start by\nextending our warmest congratulations to you, Mr.\nPresident, on your election as President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-eighth session, as well as our full\nsupport. I also wish to pay tribute to Mr. Jan Kavan,\nthe President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\nseventh session.\nThe memory of the many innocent people who\nlost their lives during the horrors of 11 September, and\nthat of many other victims of terror all over the world,\nincluding in my country, are still very fresh in our\nminds today. We also mourn the painful loss of our\nUnited Nations colleagues. They were working in the\nservice of the international community to secure peace\nand to uphold human dignity in Baghdad. The loss of\nSergio Vieira de Mello was particularly tragic for us, as\nhis visit to Ankara two weeks before his tragic death\nunfortunately turned out to be his last. Terrorism is a\ncrime against humanity. We are duty-bound to\neradicate that evil from the face of the Earth, and soon.\nWe must also not forget that there are other major\nchallenges that remain to be addressed, namely,\npoverty, illiteracy, organized crime, the problem of\nnarcotics, ecological disasters, epidemics such as\nAIDS, the issue of refugees, the illegal trade in human\nbeings, gender inequality, corruption, racism and\nxenophobia, among others.\nIn the new global security environment, there is a\nclear and pressing need to strengthen international\norganizations and institutions. The United Nations is at\nthe top of that list. The many challenges facing the\nworld today underline the central role of the United\nNations, as has been highlighted so eloquently by the\nSecretary-General. The efforts to adapt this unique\nOrganization to the realities of today\u2019s international life\nshould be resolutely pursued. The world needs a more\nrepresentative, effective and efficient United Nations.\nIn close cooperation with the United Nations,\nTurkey has accumulated vast experience over the years\nin the areas of regional cooperation, peacekeeping and\nconflict prevention. We have also shown a strong will\nto solve our bilateral foreign policy problems. Today\nwe have very good relations with some neighbouring\ncountries with which we experienced difficulties in the\nrecent past. We are also doing our best to contribute to\nthe solution of problems in the Middle East, the\nBalkans and the Caucasus.\nIn order to promote harmony among civilizations,\nwe convened a meeting last year in Istanbul between\nthe European Union and the countries of the\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC). Next\nyear, both the NATO summit and the OIC\u2019s ministerial\nmeeting will be held in that city.\nMy Government\u2019s reforms at home reflect a\nsustained effort to promote democracy, human rights,\n5\n\nthe rule of law, civil society, good governance,\naccountability and gender equality to the highest\nstandards set by the United Nations and the European\nUnion. The results show that national and spiritual\nvalues can be in perfect harmony with contemporary\nliving standards. Integration with the world is not\npossible without bringing our values and traditions into\nharmony with modernity.\nIt is on the strength of that increasingly relevant\nTurkish experience and on the strength of the richness\nof our ties with the international community that\nTurkey has decided to present its candidature for a seat\nin the Security Council for the years 2009-2010.\nThe situation in the Middle East will remain of\ncrucial significance for the evolution of the\ninternational environment for some time to come. We\ndo not believe that the Middle East is condemned to\neternal strife and suffering. This is one cradle of\ncivilization that had enjoyed peace and prosperity for\ncenturies. That is why we believe that it is feasible\ntoday to transform the Middle East into a region of\nsecurity, cooperation and prosperity. There is an urgent\nneed today for a fresh start in the region. The situation\nin Iraq and the Arab-Israeli conflict are at the core of\nefforts to bring stability to the region.\nThe events of this year have brought Iraq to the\nbeginning of a new era. All of us need to help the Iraqi\nnation in its formidable task of building a united, free,\ndemocratic and prosperous future. It is therefore highly\nimportant for the Security Council to agree on a\nmandate responsive to the needs of stabilization and\nreconstruction. Iraq is our close neighbour. That\ncountry\u2019s future and the future of the region\u2019s stability\nare inter-linked.\nIn the Middle East we are again witnessing a\ncycle of terror and violence that is taking hostage all\nefforts towards peace. We view the restoration of the\nchannels of communication and dialogue between\nPalestinians and Israelis as the most urgent task at\nhand. We believe that sending the elected President of\nthe Palestinian National Authority into exile cannot\nserve any good purpose. We call upon the Israeli\nGovernment to review its position. At the same time,\nwe urge the Palestinian side to make every effort to\nprevent further terrorist attacks. Turkey has close ties\nwith both Israelis and Palestinians. We remain ready to\ncontribute to the implementation of the road map, to\nwhich we believe there is no alternative. We are also\nwilling to contribute to the improvement of the security\nenvironment as needed, and to the alleviation of the\nharsh living conditions of Palestinians.\nIn order to achieve progress, resources have to be\nutilized rationally and to the benefit of the people, as\nthe Iraqi case has shown. The need for reform is not a\nnovelty in the Middle East. What may be new is the\ngrowing recognition that progress is dependent on\npolitical and social factors, as well as on economic\nones. Gradual steps towards more representative and\naccountable structures are being taken by a number of\ncountries in the Middle East. They deserve the\nencouragement of the international community.\nThe world needs the elimination of weapons of\nmass destruction. It does not need them to proliferate.\nThe inherent logic of that argument has been\nrecognized by the community of nations that have\nadhered to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons. We strongly support the efforts\naimed at increasing membership in non-proliferation\nagreements and regimes.\nMy country\u2019s regional policies are shaped by our\ndesire to achieve durable peace and greater cooperation\nin our neighbourhood. I have already outlined our\napproach with regard to the Middle East.\nThe Balkans, which is to our west, was in turmoil\nuntil recently. That region has come to enjoy relative\npeace and stability in the past two years. International\norganizations, notably NATO, the European Union, the\nUnited Nations and the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe, played a major role in that\nturnaround. However, the situation in certain parts of the\nregion should continue to be monitored on an ongoing\nbasis, as it is a potential source of destabilization.\nWe are determined to further enhance our\nrelations with Greece within the current process of\nconstructive dialogue. We are pleased with the progress\nachieved so far, as highlighted by my Greek colleague,\nMr. Papandreou, in the statement he made this\nmorning. We have already covered considerable\nground. We are convinced that the ongoing dialogue\nand the resulting atmosphere of mutual confidence will\nserve the interests of both Turkey and Greece.\nTurkey sincerely desires a lasting political\nsettlement establishing a new partnership in Cyprus.\nThis issue has been with us since 1963. Attempts to\ndistort the facts in the island will not help efforts aimed\n6\n\nat a comprehensive settlement. We continue to support\nthe good offices mission of the Secretary-General. A\nnew partnership in Cyprus should be based on a\ncompromise between Turkish and Greek Cypriots and\non equal status. Furthermore, a settlement should\npreserve the bizonal character of the island and ensure\nthe security of the Turkish Cypriot people.\nAt the present stage of the situation in Cyprus it\nis necessary to create a basis for substantive\nnegotiations. The opportunity created by President\nDenktas\u2019 latest proposals, which are designed to\novercome the lack of confidence between the two\nsides, should be seized. Indeed, the Greek Cypriot side,\ninstead of trying to take advantage of the prospect of\nits unilateral accession to the European Union, should\nact in a spirit of goodwill and contribute to the\nnegotiating process. All embargoes and restrictions\nimposed upon the Turkish Republic of Northern\nCyprus should be lifted as a matter of priority.\nThe Caucasus is another strategically important\narea of great interest to Turkey. The long-standing\nconflicts there must end, and good-neighbourly\nrelations and regional cooperation should be given a\nreal chance to flourish. The problems of Nagorny\nKarabakh and Abkhazia still endanger peace and\nstability in the entire region. Turkey expects Armenia\nto fully comply with the relevant United Nations\nresolutions in order to find a prompt and just solution\nto the Nagorny Karabakh conflict. The peaceful\nsettlement of this conflict will contribute to the\nnormalization of Turkish-Armenian relations and to\nregional cooperation. As regards the Abkhazian\nconflict, Turkey believes that a peaceful settlement\nshould be reached within the context of the territorial\nintegrity, sovereignty and political unity of Georgia.\nClose historical and cultural bonds with Central\nAsia constitute one of the pillars of our Eurasian vision.\nWe have developed mutually beneficial bilateral relations\nwith the Central Asian States since their independence.\nWe should make substantial efforts to improve regional\nstability and security and continue to support those\nStates with a view to their further integration into the\ninternational community. We all know that the security\nof Central Asia is inseparable from global security.\nTraditionally a close friend of Afghanistan, Turkey\nhas contributed for many years to the rehabilitation of that\ncountry. We are pleased that the Bonn process has so far\nbeen implemented successfully, despite numerous\ndifficulties. We commend the performance of the\nTransitional Administration in this respect. The success\nof the Bonn process will depend to a large extent on\ngreater support from the international community.\nWe firmly believe that it will not be possible to\nestablish global stability unless peace, security,\ndemocracy and sustainable development are promoted\nin Africa. Recent trends in the management of crises in\nAfrica, as well as the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s\nDevelopment, give us fresh hope in this regard.\nIn conclusion, I should like to stress that Turkey\nis determined to remain a major contributor to peace,\nsecurity and stability in our region and beyond. Turkey\npursues a multidimensional foreign policy that is active\nin various regions. We believe in the vital role of the\nUnited Nations and its increased relevance in the present\ninternational environment, and we are committed to\npromoting the effectiveness of our Organization.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFor the United Nations and\nthe system of collective security that it represents, the\npast year has been a traumatic one.\nOur Organization could ill afford the loss of the\ndedicated and experienced members of staff who were\nkilled by an act of terrorism in Baghdad on the 19\nAugust. I do not diminish the contribution of each and\nevery one of those who lost their lives in the cause of\nhumanity if I give individual mention to Sergio Vieira\nde Mello. I would like to pay particular tribute to his\nwork in bringing to birth the new State of Timor Leste,\nwhich has become the latest Member of the United\nNations.\nWe are living in a period of great insecurity. We\nare stalked by fear \u2014 fear of war, terrorism, weapons\nof mass destruction, famine, disease, ethnic and\nreligious hatred, and organized crime. Governments are\nacting, individually and in groups, to shield their\npeople from these threats. However, the nature of the\nchallenge requires coordinated global action.\nFortunately, we have the United Nations\nOrganization, which brings together the nations of the\nworld in the service of international peace and security.\nIf we did not already have such an organization, we\nwould surely have to invent it. The tragedy for\nmankind is that we do not make the most effective use\nof it. We are frequently told by commentators that the\nUnited Nations has failed. All too often, it is difficult\nto disagree.\nSo, who is to blame? To answer that question we\nhave to ask: what is the United Nations? The answer is\nto be found in the Charter. This Organization was\nestablished in the name of the peoples of the United\nNations. When the United Nations fails, it is because\nwe, the Governments that represent the peoples of the\nUnited Nations, have failed, individually or\ncollectively, to meet our obligations.\nOur most common failing, I would submit, is that\nwe frequently overlook the fact that this Organization\nwas created to serve not just our own nation, but all\nmankind. Too often, Members seek to use this\n20\n \nOrganization to pursue their national interests by\nseeking to have it adopt resolutions that are partial or\nbiased; by ignoring its resolutions when these do not\nsuit them; and by encouraging action on certain issues\nand conflicts while blocking action on or even\nconsideration of, others. All too many of us have been\nguilty of such an approach.\nWe simply cannot afford to continue with this\nattitude. The world is fast changing. Every day brings a\nnew awareness of just how interdependent we all are.\nThe option of shutting ourselves safely away behind\nprotective walls no longer exists. We have to learn to\nlive together, to share the resources of this planet and\nto look after each other. We can retain our national,\ncultural and religious identities, but we need to\nrecognize that we are, first and foremost, all members\nof the human race, and we must act accordingly.\nWe need a viable system of global governance\nthat can ensure international peace and security. To be\nviable, such a system must possess two essential\nqualities: effectiveness and legitimacy. To be effective,\nit requires the unambiguous support of the entire\ncommunity of nation States. Its decisions must be\nrespected and, where necessary, we must be ready and\nable to act to secure such respect. To retain legitimacy,\nthe system must be seen to work in the interests of the\nentire international community.\nI appeal, therefore, to the Governments\nrepresented at this session of the General Assembly for\na change in our attitude to the United Nations. Let us\ncease treating it as a tool useful only to the extent that\nit can deliver on our national agenda. Instead, let us use\nthe United Nations to harness our collective resources\nin the interests of each and every member of mankind.\nTo adapt the words of President John F. Kennedy, let us\nask not what the United Nations can do for us, but what\nwe can do for the United Nations.\nThe United Nations needs reform. We all accept\nthat. Our institutions are not sufficiently effective and,\nin some instances, are not adequately representative of\ntoday\u2019s membership. We have discussed these issues at\ngreat length, but we have balked at taking the hard\ndecisions. The time has come to put the interests of the\nwider international community before narrow national\nconcerns.\nWe are fortunate, at this moment, to have as\nSecretary-General a man of the stature of Kofi Annan;\na man who is held in universal regard and who is seen\nto stand for the interests of the entire international\ncommunity. He has not shrunk from grasping the nettle\nof reform, and in his address to this Assembly he called\non the Members of this Organization to grasp it with\nhim. We must find the courage and generosity to take\nup this challenge.\nThe past two years have been a particularly sober\nperiod in the history of mankind. There has been so\nmuch death and destruction across the globe. How\nmuch of this might have been avoided if the United\nNations had been better able to fulfil the noble\npurposes set out in the Charter?\nI do not claim that it is possible to eradicate\nman\u2019s capacity for evil or to totally eliminate the\ntendency to seek to resolve disputes through violence.\nBut I do submit that a stronger, more resolute, more\nrespected and more active United Nations might have\nprevented some of the suffering of the past two years.\nThe world today is very different from that which\nexisted when the Charter was drawn up. It is smaller,\nmore crowded, more combustible. Isolated pockets of\nhuman habitation have been brought together by a\npopulation explosion, migration, faster and cheaper air\ntravel, television, the Internet, the growth of free trade\nand the development of weapons of mass destruction.\nWhat happens in one part of the world can increasingly\nhave an instant and dramatic effect in another part.\nThis evolution has raised questions concerning\nthe interpretation of two important provisions of the\nCharter. The first is paragraph 7 of Article 2, which in\neffect excludes the United Nations from intervening in\nmatters that are essentially within the domestic\njurisdiction of any State. Yet the problem arises\nincreasingly in our global society as to whether and\nwhen a matter can be considered as falling entirely\nwithin the domestic jurisdiction of a State. Some\nsituations are clearer than others.\nIn my view, when events within a country\nthreaten international peace and security, they become\nthe legitimate interest of the international community.\nSimilarly, I cannot accept that the international\ncommunity should stand by and accept the large-scale,\nflagrant and persistent violation of human rights. We\nhave received sharp lessons in the past. The trigger for\nintervening to prevent an attempted genocide should\nnot be the moment that refugees begin to flood across\nthe border.\n21\n \nAt the same time, international intervention raises\nserious questions. It can also pose serious risks to the\ninternational regime. Clearly, intervention is\nobjectively called for in some extreme cases. But there\nis a need to work carefully through this concept with a\nview to forging an international consensus around it.\nAnother issue that has recently come to the fore\nand was highlighted by the Secretary-General is that of\nArticle 51 of the Charter and the conditions under\nwhich Member States have the right to act in self-\ndefence. The development of weapons of mass\ndestruction in the period since the signing of the\nCharter, and the appearance of non-State actors with\nthe capacity for mass destruction, raise serious\nquestions as to the point at which a State might\nconsider it necessary to act in self-defence. This is also\nan issue that requires serious reflection.\nMy Government would be deeply concerned at\nthe widespread acceptance of a doctrine of pre-emptive\nstrike. Given the ever more lethal nature of modern\nweapons, the risk of large-scale death, destruction and\nescalation are enormous.\nMore effective than striking pre-emptively, of\ncourse, is to pre-empt the risk of conflict through a\nwide range of steps in the diplomatic, economic,\nhumanitarian and other areas.\nWe should devote more attention to dealing with\nthe root causes of conflict. We must seek to identify\npotential conflicts as early as possible and deal with\nthem before they get out of hand. Where conflict\nnevertheless becomes a possibility, we should act more\nassertively to head it off. We simply cannot afford to\naccept the existence of so-called forgotten or ignored\nconflicts. Any conflict that threatens international peace\nand security is the United Nations legitimate business and\nshould be on the agenda of the Security Council.\nI would now like to touch briefly on a number of\nspecific issues that are of concern to my Government.\nThe conflict between Israel and the Palestinian\npeople continues to pose a serious threat to world\npeace. My own country\u2019s difficult national experience\nshows that there is no such thing as a straight line to\npeace. Our experience in Ireland clearly demonstrates\nthat farsighted leaders cannot allow their efforts to be\nheld hostage by terrorists and extremists. They must\nhave the wisdom to look beyond the politics of the last\natrocity.\nWhat is more, leaders must be prepared to deal\nwith each other. As the Nobel Laureate John Hume\nonce said, \u201cyou make peace with your enemies, not\nyour friends\u201d. President Arafat has a responsibility to\nlead his people away from violence and back to the\nnegotiating table. It is a responsibility that he must\nassume. Threats to expel or assassinate him are deeply\nmisguided and dangerous and can only further delay\nefforts to achieve a settlement.\nLasting peace can only be achieved through\nnegotiation. Palestinians must realize that violence has\nfailed. Terrorism is wrong and has brought nothing but\nmisery to both Israel and Palestine. It has made\ncompromise more difficult than ever.\nIsrael must see that repression and attempts at\nphysical separation will not deliver long-term security.\nThe most effective means for Israel to secure a\npeaceful future would be to accept the Palestinian\npeople\u2019s right to a viable State of their own on the basis\nof the 1967 borders. Israel should immediately reverse\nits policy of building settlements, settler-only roads\nand a security wall on Palestinian territory.\nIt is imperative that the parties re-engage in the\ntask of implementing the road map, leading to a two-\nState solution based on the vision enshrined in Security\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 1397\n(2002). They need the support of the Quartet. But such\nmediation will not succeed if it is, or is perceived to be,\none-sided. We must be careful to ensure that our\ndemands are balanced and that we hold both sides\nequally to account.\nThe people of Iraq are suffering from events that\nin most cases are not of their making. We want to see\nthis suffering brought to an end as soon as possible.\nThe Iraqi people can only play a part in that by\nrejecting those who engage in violence and industrial\nsabotage. The occupying Powers must be scrupulous in\nmeeting their obligations under international law.\nThe Iraqi people need and deserve the support of\na united international community in the political and\neconomic reconstruction of their country. The United\nNations, with its unique experience and legitimacy, is\nessential to efforts to help the Iraqi people recover their\nsovereignty as soon as possible and to forge a new Iraq,\nat peace with itself and with its neighbours. We look to\nthe members of the Security Council at this crucial\nmoment to assume their responsibilities and to reach an\nagreement on a new resolution that reflects the interests\n22\n \nof the people of Iraq and that can enjoy the necessary\nsupport of the region and of the broad international\ncommunity.\nThe proliferation of nuclear, chemical and\nbiological weapons poses a serious threat to international\npeace and security. We must recommit ourselves to\ncontrolling the spread of such weapons, and working\ntowards their complete elimination. This can only be\nachieved through a comprehensive and rigorous system\nof international treaties and obligations that are\nverifiable and universal.\nIreland, with its partners in the New Agenda\nCoalition, will continue its efforts in respect of nuclear\ndisarmament during this year\u2019s General Assembly.\nIreland calls on all States who are concerned about the\nissue of weapons of mass destruction to become\nconstructively engaged in the multilateral disarmament\nand non-proliferation process. There can be no room\nfor double standards.\nWe must also remain resolute in our\ndetermination to counter the threat of terrorism. We\nowe it to the victims of 11 September, and to the\nvictims of terrorist atrocities before and since then. The\nmeasures put in place by the Security Council have\nmade it more difficult for international terrorist\nnetworks to organize and to finance their activities.\nThese organizations, however, do not stand still. We\nmust remain vigilant and redouble our efforts to make\nit impossible for the agents of international terror to\noperate.\nIn doing so, however, we must be clear that the need\nto act against terrorism offers no license for action\ncontrary to the United Nations Charter, or against the\nbody of international human rights and humanitarian\nlaw that we have so painstakingly constructed.\nWe must also seek to deal with the causes of\nterrorism. Terrorism is not some kind of original sin.\nNo child is born a terrorist. At some point in their\nlives, some people become terrorists. We have to\nidentify how and why.\nAnd if we find that young people are being\nindoctrinated into terrorism, we have to deal with those\nwho seek to incite hatred and terror. If we find that\nthey act, however wrongly, in reaction to real or\nperceived injustice, we have to confront that fact and,\nas far as it is possible, seek to eliminate the reality or\nperception of that injustice. To seek to understand the\ncauses of terrorism should not be misunderstood as\nbeing soft on terrorism. On the contrary, it is an\nessential step in its elimination. I can speak from\nexperience of developments in my own country for\nmany decades.\nThe Government and people of Afghanistan face\nimportant challenges in the coming year, in particular\nthe adoption of a constitution and the holding of\nnational elections. Severe difficulties stand in the way,\nespecially the precarious security situation. The\nsustained and wholehearted support of the international\ncommunity is required if Afghanistan is to recover\nfrom its long ordeal. For Ireland\u2019s part, it has delivered\non its pledges to the reconstruction of Afghanistan.\nIn Africa, encouraging progress has been made in\nthe past year towards the resolution of some long-\nstanding and intractable conflicts. We urge the parties to\nthe conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to\nimplement the commitments that they have entered into.\nNeighbouring States must abide by their commitments\nand their obligation not to interfere in the area.\nSierra Leone remains on track, with the help of\nthe United Nations, towards a future and peaceful\ndevelopment. And progress has been achieved in\nLiberia. I want to pay tribute to the efforts of those\nMember States that have contributed to this positive\ndevelopment. Their continued engagement, along with\nthe United Nations, will be indispensable in helping the\npeople of Liberia to consolidate what has been\nachieved and to build peace in their country. I am\npleased to inform the Assembly that my Government in\nthe next few days will recommend to our Parliament\nthat Ireland\u2019s Defence Forces participate with a\nsizeable contingent in the forthcoming United\npeacekeeping operation in Liberia.\nRespect for human rights is an essential foundation\nfor peace and security. Lack of respect for human rights is\nat the root of many conflicts, internal and international.\nThe promotion of human rights is rightly the concern\nof the international community as a whole. It must\nremain a central task of the United Nations and must be\nintegrated into all United Nations activities.\nThere is no room for complacency. We must all\nrecognize that no country, including our own, is\nperfect. We can all do better.\nI pay tribute to the many brave individuals around\nthe world \u2014 defenders of human rights \u2014 who risk\n23\n \ndiscrimination, imprisonment or worse to ensure that\nGovernments live up to their human rights obligations.\nThe establishment of the International Criminal\nCourt was a clear signal of the determination of the\ninternational community to bring to justice those who\nare involved in genocide, crimes against humanity and\nwar crimes. Ireland, together with its partners in the\nEuropean Union, will continue to offer firm support to\nthe International Criminal Court, as its work gets under\nway. I urge those who have not signed or ratified the\nRome Statute to do so, and I urge all States to adhere\nfirmly to the principles on which it is based.\nThe peace process in Northern Ireland remains a\nmajor priority for the Irish Government. Regrettably,\ndue to diminishing trust between the political parties,\nthe devolved political institutions in Northern Ireland\nwere suspended nearly one year ago. Since then, we have\nbeen working to re-establish the trust and confidence\nnecessary to restore and sustain these institutions.\nThis involves both ensuring that all vestiges of\nparamilitary activity are consigned to the past and that\nall parties commit themselves to the full and stable\noperation of the democratic institutions of the Good\nFriday Agreement. Following intensive negotiations,\nwe came tantalizingly close in April to making the\nrequired breakthrough but unfortunately did not get\nmatters fully resolved at that time.\nAfter one of the most peaceful summers on the\nstreets of Northern Ireland, the process is now entering\nanother decisive phase of challenge and opportunity.\nDevelopments over the next few weeks will have a\ncrucial bearing on whether elections \u2014 which I believe\nshould take place before the end of the year \u2014 will be\nheld in an atmosphere that is conducive to forming a\nworking administration on the other side of the polling\nday.\nFor this to happen, all of the pro-Agreement\nparties must show leadership and courage, face up to\ntheir responsibilities and take the decisions they know\nare right, and encourage their constituencies to reach\nout to others. As partners in this process, Prime\nMinister Blair and I \u2014 and our two Governments \u2014\nare working closely together to support and encourage\nall those political and community leaders who are\ntaking risks for peace.\nFrom other areas around the world struggling to\nescape from a legacy of violence, we in Ireland know\nall too well that a process of conflict resolution cannot\nrest still. Either it continues to move forward or it loses\nmomentum and direction and falters. To complacently\nassume that current opportunities for progress can be\ndeferred until a more politically convenient moment is\nboth wrong and dangerous. In the case of Northern\nIreland, the moment of opportunity is now and it is my\nhope that in the weeks and months ahead all of the\nparties who subscribed to the Good Friday Agreement\nwill collectively rise to that challenge.\nPoverty and insecurity go hand in hand. The\nefforts of the United Nations to promote international\npeace and security must be closely aligned with its\nwork in tackling the root causes of poverty.\nWhen I launched the United Nations Human\nDevelopment Report in Dublin last July, I noted how\npowerful a reminder it was that the world is becoming\na more unequal place. According to the report, 54\ncountries \u2014 the great majority of them in Africa \u2014 are\npoorer now than they were in 1990. A world where\nmore than 1.2 billion people continue to live on less\nthan a dollar a day, where 14 million children are\norphaned because of HIV/AIDS and where women in\nthe poorest countries are 175 times more likely to die\nin childbirth than women in rich countries is inherently\nunjust and hence insecure.\nAt the United Nations special session on\nHIV/AIDS in 2001, I said Ireland would increase its\ncontribution to the fight against HIV/AIDS by an\nadditional $30 million per year. Last year, our spending\non HIV/AIDS programmes exceeded $40 million \u2014 a\nten-fold increase over the past three years.\nThe Millennium Declaration called for a global\npartnership for development, and as in any partnership,\nthere are responsibilities on all sides. Undertakings on\nofficial development assistance, debt relief, and\ngovernance must be achieved. We must be rigorous in\nassessing our progress in 2005, as we committed\nourselves to doing.\nAt the Millennium Summit, I committed Ireland\nto reaching the United Nations target for official\ndevelopment assistance of 0.7 per cent of gross\nnational product by 2007. Since then, Ireland has\nincreased its official development assistance to 0.41\nper cent and remains committed to reaching the target\nby 2007.\n24\n \nFair and open international trade is essential for\nglobal peace and prosperity. It is an integral part of the\nmultilateral system that we are pledged to protect. I\nregret that it did not prove possible to reach agreement\nat the recent World Trade Organization talks in\nCancun. I understand the frustration of those who\nconsider themselves unfairly treated in global markets.\nBut if we turn our back on the multilateral trading\nsystem and allow trade and investment to be diverted\nand distorted by bilateral and regional arrangements,\nwe will damage \u2014 perhaps irreparably \u2014 the best tool\navailable to us to make serious inroads into poverty\nand to raise standards of living on a global basis. Let us\nredouble our efforts to achieve an agreement that offers\nfair market access and at the same time allows all of us\nto preserve the essence of our unique cultures and\nenvironments.\nThe past year might have been a difficult one for\nthe United Nations, but events have demonstrated that\nfor the people of the world it is the indispensable\nOrganization at the centre of our system of collective\nsecurity. We have invested it with unique legitimacy\nand authority. People around the world look to it in\nhope and expectation. Let us work together to make\nsure that the United Nations is an organization worthy\nof the ideals enshrined in its Charter, worthy of the\ntrust of those who rely on it for help and protection,\nworthy of the idealism and dedication of those who\nwork for it and worthy of the sacrifice of those who\nhave given their lives in its service.\nAs the Secretary-General made clear when he\naddressed this session of General Assembly: we are at\na fork in the road. Let us be sure to take the right road.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffNiger is\ngratified by your election, Sir, to preside over this\nsession and through me assures you of its full support\nas you carry out the important mission that has been\nentrusted to you. We wish you every success.\nI also wish to address to your predecessor, Mr.\nJan Kavan of the Czech Republic, my sincere\ncongratulations on the skill, dedication and foresight\nwith which he guided the work of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-seventh session.\nI should further like to reiterate Niger\u2019s great\nappreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for the\nwisdom and efficiency with which he has guided our\nOrganization in a particularly difficult international\ncontext.\nOn 19 August, sadly, international terrorism\nstruck yet another symbol: United Nations headquarters\nin Baghdad. The attack claimed many lives, including\nthat of the Special Representative of the Secretary-\nGeneral, Sergio Vieira de Mello. Niger reiterates its\nunequivocal condemnation of that barbaric act and\nreviles all terrorist acts committed anywhere in the\nworld.\nThe Government of Niger welcomes our\nOrganization\u2019s determination to provide all necessary\nassistance to the Iraqi people, despite all the\nintimidation to which it has been subject. Such\ndetermination, however, can achieve results only if the\nUnited Nations is given a key role in managing the\nprocess of rebuilding a free and democratic Iraq that is\nthe master of its own destiny.\nThe maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity must remain a priority objective of the United\nNations. In this respect, in addition to our ongoing war\nagainst international terrorism, we must pursue our\nefforts to free the world from the specter of weapons of\nmass destruction and the proliferation of small arms\nand light weapons. In that connection, the First\nBiennial Meeting of States to Consider the\nImplementation of the United Nations Programme of\nAction to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit\nTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All its\nAspects at the National, Regional and Global Levels\nnoted that, despite progress made since the adoption of\nthe Programme of Action, control of firearms and their\nuse remains limited. That is why Niger firmly supports\nthe elaboration of binding legal instruments on the\nmarking, tracking and sale of such weapons.\nFor Niger, the regional approach must be given\npride of place in the settlement of conflicts, since it is\n2\n\nincreasingly recognized that most conflicts in Africa\nhave a subregional dimension. That is the case in\nparticular in West Africa, where stability in the Mano\nRiver region is linked to the situation in Liberia. It is\nalso the case in Central Africa, where stability in the\nGreat Lakes region is linked to the situations in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and in Burundi.\nThat is why the Government of Niger feels that the\nstrengthening of regional peacekeeping and security\ncapacities, the cornerstone of the collective security\nsystem, must be based on enhanced cooperation\nbetween the United Nations and regional and\nsubregional organizations.\nWith regard to the Jammu and Kashmir conflict,\nNiger believes that, despite the recent incidents, the\nimproved relations between India and Pakistan, which\nopened diplomatic relations in August, provide an\nunprecedented opportunity that must be seized to\nachieve a political settlement through the organization\nof a referendum on the self-determination of the\nKashmiri people, in accordance with the relevant\nresolutions of the Security Council.\nIn the Middle East, the vision of a sovereign and\nviable Palestinian State, peacefully coexisting with\nIsrael, must become a reality. In this regard, it is more\nurgent than ever before for the two parties to the\nconflict to agree to a ceasefire, comprehensive\nadherence to which would help relaunch the road map,\nwhich is showing signs of withering. Moreover, the\neventful history of the Israeli-Palestinian peace\nprocess \u2014 a history marked by recurrent setbacks and\ndashed hope \u2014 requires us to acknowledge that only\nthe presence of an international interposition force can\nguarantee an end to the bloody violence and create\nconditions for the effective implementation of\nagreements. Thus, Niger makes a heartfelt appeal to the\nUnited Nations, the Security Council in particular, to\nensure that this question be reconsidered with all due\nattention and in full responsibility in the interest of\nworld peace.\nNiger is deeply dedicated to the noble ideals of\nthe Charter and therefore strives for regional and global\npeace and is actively participating in efforts to achieve\ngeneral and complete disarmament. In that context, my\ncountry has always subscribed to the standards of the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in order\nto achieve full transparency in the production, sale and\ndelivery of uranium. That position is reflected in our\ndecade-long cooperation with all actors in the uranium\nsector. We allow for no ambiguity. Niger continues to\nbe ready, as it has always been, to submit to the\nauthority of the IAEA for any verification related to the\nproduction and sale of its uranium.\nI wish to recall that, in this sphere, my country, in\naccordance with article III of the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, has accepted, in\nagreement with the IAEA, the monitoring and\nguarantee system which, when implemented in good\nfaith as it is in Niger, offers absolutely no opportunity\nfor the kind of clandestine transactions of which my\ncountry was so unjustly accused.\nThe Development Goals defined in the historic\nMillennium Declaration must remain an ongoing\nconcern of the international community and guide\nglobal action aimed at the establishment of a stable and\njust socio-economic order involving greater sharing\nand solidarity. We cannot overemphasize the fact that\nthe achievement of these Goals requires reflection in\nspecific action of all commitments undertaken at the\nmajor international conferences and summits.\nWhat in fact have we been seeing? The\ninternational scene continues to offer the paradoxical\nand somewhat ignominious image of a world of\nenormous wealth in which the overwhelming majority\nof inhabitants still lives in total destitution. Despite the\ncommitments made and the consensus reached by\nGovernments of the entire world on this issue, we are\nobliged to note that the terrible vise of poverty,\nignorance and disease has only been tightened around\nthe poor peoples of the third world in general and of\nAfrica in particular. When we know, for example, that,\nsix years after the World Food Summit, 815 million\npeople throughout the world continue to suffer from\nhunger and 150 million children suffer from\nmalnutrition deficiencies, we can readily gauge the\nfeeble support of donors for anti-poverty strategies,\ndespite the lofty statements of intention that are\noccasionally mouthed.\nToday more than ever, the situation should pull at\nthe conscience of the international community and\ninspire us to greater solidarity and determination to\nfulfil our commitments. It is time to understand once\nand for all that the reduction of poverty is more than a\nmoral imperative; it is in fact a secure investment in\nthe promotion of a world of peace, prosperity and\nsocial progress.\n3\n\nIt is encouraging to note that, in recent years,\nAfrica has been at the core of major international\nconferences. From the Brussels Conference on the\nLeast Developed Countries to the Johannesburg\nSummit, as well as the Monterrey International\nConference on Financing for Development, the World\nEconomic Forum, the Evian G-8 summit and the World\nTrade Organization (WTO) Conference in Canc\u00fan, to\nname but a few, Africa has been at the heart of the\ndebates.\nIt should be noted that, while these meetings had\nthe merit of having been convened, unfortunately they\ndid not respond to the urgent and enormous\nexpectations of the continent. In this regard, there is a\nneed to ensure consistency in global economic\ngovernance through the strengthening of cooperation\namong the international organizations and of the\ncompatibility of their decisions. It is only thus that the\nexcessive marginalization of Africa can be alleviated,\nbecause this is the appropriate way to bring the\npromises of increased official development assistance\nto fruition. Similarly, it is important to increase the\nflow of direct foreign investment into Africa.\nFurthermore, given the limited results achieved\nby current debt-alleviation programmes \u2014 the Heavily\nIndebted Poor Countries Initiative in particular \u2014 we\nmust now recognize that the ultimate solution lies in\nthe outright cancellation of the debt, the servicing of\nwhich is consuming the greater part of the budgets of\nAfrican countries and fuelling capital flight. There is\nalso a need for Africa\u2019s trade partners fully to comply\nwith their commitments, in particular by improving the\naccess of African products to their markets and by\neliminating agricultural subsidies that create distortions\nin world trade.\nThe failure of the WTO Conference in Canc\u00fan is\na good illustration of the obstinate reluctance of the\nrich countries to take into account the legitimate\naspirations of the poor countries regarding the\nestablishment of just and equitable standards to govern\nworld trade. And yet, solving the critical problem of\nagricultural subsidies and of access to markets would\nhave made it possible both to enhance the badly\ntarnished credibility of the WTO and to provide a\nmeasure of consistency to the declarations of intention\nmade by the countries of the North. Above all and\nunquestionably, it would have contributed to raising\nmillions of people out of poverty. This lack of\nagreement means that the cotton workers of West\nAfrica, among others, can no longer live from their\nlabour and may be excluded from international trade, to\nthe benefit of more competitive producers who are\nbeing subsidized.\nCanc\u00fan was a failed rendezvous of the Doha\nRound. WTO will certainly have to adopt a new\napproach and prioritize the settlement of agricultural\nproblems, which most agree are more important than\nthe interests of the multinationals.\nThe countries of Africa are fully aware of the\nneed to develop their relationship with their\ndevelopment partners within the context of\ninterdependence, cooperation and mutual\nresponsibility. In that regard, they acknowledge the\nimportance of judicious national policies and good\ngovernance, which they consider to be indispensable to\naccelerated development and, above all, to achieving\nthe 7 per cent growth rate required to achieve the\nMillennium Development Goals.\nThe New Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development\n(NEPAD) is inspired by this consensual approach,\nbased on a new relationship of cooperation between\nAfrica and the developed world. NEPAD, a symbol of\nAfrica\u2019s resolve to take its own destiny in hand, is the\nfoundation on which the African Union will rely to\npromote the growth and sustainable development of\nAfrican countries, individually and collectively.\nWhile we call for a massive flow of investments\nand the growth of official development assistance to\ncontribute to our development efforts, we, too, must\ncomply with our commitments in terms of mutual\nresponsibility. That is why my country, Niger, firmly\nsupports the implementation of the NEPAD Peer\nReview Mechanism. The Mechanism will play a key\nrole in the continent\u2019s prospects as an instrument for\nbuilding strong States dedicated to good governance\nand sustainable development.\nIn drawing up through a participatory approach a\nnational strategy for poverty reduction, the\nGovernment of Niger intends to become deeply\ninvolved in the dynamic process of establishing strong,\nstable and competitive economies in accordance with\nthe objectives of the NEPAD Programme of Action.\nThe strategy document serves simultaneously as a\nreference framework for poverty reduction policies and\nprogrammes and as an instrument to mobilize financial\nresources. We are convinced that the implementation of\nthe poverty-reduction strategy will contribute to\n4\n\nimproving the dialogue of policies, to further\nstrengthening donor coordination and intervention, and\nto developing a multidimensional strategic partnership\nto translate into action the deepest hopes of the people\nof Niger.\nFrom this rostrum, I solemnly reaffirm the deep\ngratitude of the Government of Niger to those\ninternational partners which, at the poverty-reduction\nforum held last June in Niamey, proved their full\nadherence to the strategy and their commitment to\nsupporting its implementation.\nIn recent years, the world has undergone rapid\nand profound changes. These require us to adapt our\nOrganization\u2019s functions to today\u2019s reality in order to\nbetter to take into account the new challenges and\nlegitimate aspirations of the peoples of the planet and\nnot the specific interests of a tiny group of countries,\nno matter how powerful. That is why Niger firmly\nsupports the courageous reforms proposed by the\nSecretary-General to strengthen and improve the\nfunctioning of the Organization and to allow it\neffectively to cope with the challenges of our times.\nThe long-awaited democratization of the Security\nCouncil must be accompanied by a strengthening of the\nrole of the General Assembly, the highest\nrepresentative body, and of the Economic and Social\nCouncil, the guarantor of the advent of a new economic\nand social order.\nThe United Nations is at a decisive juncture and\nmust urgently regain the confidence of States and of\nworld public opinion, which has been sorely tested by\nrecent events. It is up to all of us to strive resolutely to\nthat end, because, as the Secretary-General has said,\nwe are the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me first\nextend to you, Sir, on behalf of my delegation and in\nmy own name, our sincere congratulations on your\nelection as President of the General Assembly at this\nsession. Indeed, it is a matter of pride for all small\nisland States, and Mauritius in particular, to see you\npresiding over the Assembly. My delegation wishes to\nassure you of its full support and cooperation during\nyour tenure of office.\nLet me also express my Government's deepest\nappreciation to your predecessor, His Excellency Mr.\nJan Kavan of the Czech Republic, for the remarkable\nmanner in which he presided over the General\nAssembly at its fifty-seventh session and to the\nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, for\nhis dedicated leadership of our Organization. I wish to\nassure him of our full support in his appeal for radical\nreforms of our Organization and the setting up of a\nhigh-level panel to address the issues of peace and\nsecurity, and institutional reform.\nSince we were here last autumn, many events of\nglobal importance have occurred. The war against Iraq\nwas waged and hostilities were declared at an end, but\npeace and stability in Iraq have yet to be restored.\nTerrorism has continued relentlessly on its path of\nghastly attacks and indiscriminate killing of innocent\ncivilians. The geographical shift, however, in the\nterrorist attacks is becoming increasingly a disturbing\ndevelopment.\nMultilateralism, which was almost condemned to\na premature burial, is being re-energized.\nUnfortunately, the recurring problems of HIV/AIDS,\nmalaria, poverty, lack of development, conflicts and the\nready supply of small arms and light weapons have\ncontinued to inflict death and suffering on an\nunprecedented scale, particularly in Africa.\nThe attack against the United Nations compound\nin Baghdad contains countless messages. The most\nsignificant of them is that our Organization is in urgent\nneed of major overhaul and reform, as rightly stated by\nthe Secretary-General.\nThe premature deaths of the Special Envoy of the\nSecretary-General to Iraq, the late Sergio Vieira de\nMello, and other dedicated staff members of the United\nNations, whom we deeply mourn, should make us\nreflect on the dangers behind foreign policy initiatives\nthat undermine or ignore the United Nations.\nThe international community is deeply attached\nto the legitimacy the United Nations confers on its\nactions. It is our collective duty to refrain from taking\nany measures likely to weaken it.\nThese horrendous terrorist acts have\ndemonstrated anew the crucial need for the\ninternational community to tackle the root causes of\nterrorism.\nAs all small islands, we in Mauritius remain\nhighly vulnerable in respect of our security and\nterrorist threats. With limited means at our disposal,\ncoupled with the multiple demands on our scanty\nresources, we find that it is only through international\nefforts and cooperation that we can win the war against\nterrorism. We are particularly anxious that there should\nbe concerted and sustained action and a commitment to\ncooperation at the international level with a view to\neradicating the scourge of terrorism. All countries must\ncooperate to stem the flow of cross-border infiltration.\nThe financing of terrorism and the proceeds of\ntransnational organized crime need to be closely\nmonitored.\nNot winning the war against terrorism as well as\nthat against transnational organized crime is not an\noption for the world today. Mauritius views with\nconcern that, despite the stated commitment of the\ninternational community to the cause of disarmament,\nthe actions of many countries do not match their\nrhetoric.\nThe new challenges to security and disarmament\nshould compel us to look anew at the potential threat\nposed by nuclear weapons and weapons of mass\ndestruction and to pursue more vigorously efforts\ntowards their total elimination.\nWe reiterate our appeal to the nuclear Powers for\nthe early convening of a conference on nuclear\ndisarmament as a first step towards complete\ndisarmament, keeping in mind that such a regime must\nbe comprehensive and non-discriminatory.\n25\n\nOver the last year the international community's\nability to tackle political conflicts and find lasting\nsolutions has been dismal.\nThe situation in the Middle East continues to\npreoccupy us. Despite the various initiatives, including\nthe latest Road Map, violence remains unabated and we\nfear that recent developments in the region will unleash\nfurther killings and destruction.\nNo solution will be possible there unless all the\nprotagonists are taken on board. Exclusion as a policy\nis destined to fail. We continue to believe that President\nArafat is an essential part of the solution, and any\nattempt to sideline him will be detrimental to any peace\ninitiative.\nWe call on both Israel and the Palestinian\nAuthority to exercise utmost restraint and to pursue\ntheir efforts for the implementation of the Road Map\nwith a view to putting an end to the occupation and the\nsucceeding generations of Palestinians in refugee\ncamps. The establishment of a Palestinian State at the\nearliest should be the priority of the international\ncommunity.\nThe situation in Iraq is disquieting. It is important\nthat the Iraqis regain as soon as possible total\nsovereignty and assume control over their own destiny\nthrough a democratic process. The United Nations has,\nin the view of my delegation, a leading role to play in\nthis process and must be empowered to do so.\nThe African continent has been plagued for too\nlong by conflicts and wars, which have led to the loss\nof thousands of innocent lives and the squandering of\nenormous wealth and resources. Small arms and light\nweapons have in fact become the weapons of mass\ndestruction on the African continent. These weapons\ndrain African resources and we appeal to those\ncountries that manufacture and market those weapons\nof destruction to ensure that Africa does not continue\nto be their killing field.\nNonetheless, during the past two years, the\nAfrican continent has demonstrated an unprecedented\nmomentum in its efforts to seriously address these\nconflicts and to search for lasting solutions. There is,\nhowever, some good news out of Africa and everything\nis not gloomy.\nThe transformation of the Organization of African\nUnity into the African Union, the coming into\noperation of the various commissions of the Union and\nthe election of commissioners on a gender-equal basis\nat the Maputo Summit in July last are clear indications\nthat Africa has chosen a new path and is confident that\nit will be able to meet the challenges ahead.\nIt is a matter of great satisfaction that peace is\nnow slowly returning to the troubled areas on the\ncontinent. The conflicts in Sierra Leone and Angola\nhave ended. A government of national unity is in office\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Efforts under\nthe auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority on\nDevelopment (IGAD) for a comprehensive and lasting\nresolution to the conflict in Somalia have been\ncrowned with success. We do recognize that years of\nconflict will not be easily forgotten, but what is\nreassuring is that African leaders are maintaining a\nhands-on approach to these situations.\nThe recent developments in Liberia and the\nrestoration of the constitutional order in Sao Tome and\nPrincipe confirm the ability of African leaders to\neffectively address issues affecting their continent.\nThere is fresh confidence in the African leaders'\nability to deal with flashpoints. The implementation of\nthe Peace and Security Council of the African Union\nwill go a long way towards preventive action being\ntaken. We recognize that we will have to bear primary\nresponsibility for the peace and security of our\ncontinent.\nThe New Partnership for Africa's Development\n(NEPAD) is our basic instrument of empowerment.\nHaving decided to take our destiny in our own hands,\nwe are not going to engage in the blame game, but we\nwill take action to reverse poverty and to promote good\ngovernance. We will do whatever is necessary to attract\ninvestment. The establishment of the African Peer\nReview Mechanism within NEPAD will ensure that\neconomic development takes place in the spirit of good\ngovernance, democracy, transparency and\naccountability.\nIt is comforting, therefore, that this homegrown\nAfrican initiative has received global recognition. The\nassistance of the Group of Eight and countries like\nIndia in the implementation of the objectives of\nNEPAD is much appreciated.\nWe noted with regret that the rate of official\ndevelopment assistance to developing countries is\ndecreasing, contrary to the commitment made in\nMonterrey.\n26\n\nWe therefore call on the developed countries and\nother key specialized institutions in the monetary,\nfinancial and development fields to deliver on their\nimplementation plans for the Monterrey Consensus\nduring the October high-level dialogue.\nMonday's high-level segment on HIV/AIDS, in\nwhich more than a hundred delegations took part,\ndemonstrates the extent of the concern of the United\nNations membership to the pandemic of HIV/AIDS.\nWe welcome the initiative of the General Assembly to\nmaintain global awareness of the problem and to ensure\nthat effective action is taken urgently to stop the spread\nof the pandemic.\nI mentioned earlier the need for reform of our\nOrganization. It is imperative that the necessary\nreforms of the United Nations be undertaken to reflect\nin a more realistic manner the political realities in the\nworld today.\nThe United Nations Charter must be amended to\nprovide for a Security Council that is more democratic\nand more representative of today's world. Should\npermanent membership of the Security Council with\nveto power be retained, we consider that India should\nbe admitted with such a membership at the earliest.\nLikewise we believe that the African continent should\nbe adequately represented at the same level.\nWe would also urge a review of the veto power,\nwhich has been used in the past and continues to be\nused for purposes outside the letter and spirit of the\nCharter.\nMay I welcome the decision of the Security\nCouncil to lift the sanctions on the Libyan Arab\nJamahiriya.\nThe situation of small island developing States\n(SIDS) will be the focus of attention in September\n2004, when Mauritius hosts an international meeting\nfor the 10-year review of the Barbados Programme of\nAction. This Barbados +10 meeting will allow us to\nmake a full assessment of the Programme of Action\nand evaluate its success and shortcomings.\nWe need to constantly remind the international\ncommunity about the fragility and vulnerability of\nSIDS where ecology and geography combine to inflict\nirreparable damage.\nMauritius and all other small island developing\nStates attach great importance to this international\nmeeting and hope that it will harness more efforts on\nthe part of the international community to provide the\nrequired assistance to the small island developing\nStates. I call on this Assembly to lend the necessary\nsupport to make this international meeting a success.\nIn this regard, let me express my appreciation to\nthe Commonwealth and La Francophonie for their\nactive interest in supporting the cause of small island\nStates.\nAs the current Chairman of the Alliance of Small\nIsland States (AOSIS), may I inform the Assembly that\nthe 44 Alliance Member States and Observers consider\nthe International Meeting to be a very important\noccasion for reaffirming the partnership for sustainable\ndevelopment that grew out of the Rio Conference. In\nMauritius next year we expect to establish an\nappropriate framework for partnership and cooperation.\nThe time has come to enshrine the special case of\nSmall Island Developing States as an important\ncomponent of focus and attention on the part of the\ninternational community.\nWe appeal to the international community to\nsupport this process and ensure the full and effective\nparticipation of all SIDS at the meeting and to ensure,\nas well, its own participation in it.\nAccess to information and communication\ntechnologies remains a fundamental concern in Africa.\nWhile such technologies are often promoted as an\ninstrument that will allow countries to leapfrog stages\nin development, there is a real fear that the digital\ndivide could very well prove to be yet another handicap\nthat adds to Africa's marginalization.\nWe therefore urge that particular attention be paid\nto issues of access and infrastructure. My delegation\nwishes to underscore that Mauritius, like many other\nsmall island States, has high hopes that the Plan of\nAction of the World Summit on the Information\nSociety will provide concrete action in favour of small\nisland developing States, whose geographical isolation,\nremoteness and other inherent constraints warrant\nspecial attention.\nThe failure of the World Trade Organization\n(WTO) Ministerial Conference at Cancun has dealt a\nblow to the multilateral trading system. That is very\nunfortunate, as there are no winners but only losers.\nFor small developing countries in particular, a strong\nrules-based global trading system provides protection\n27\n\nagainst the unilateralism of powerful trading countries\nor blocs. The serious imbalances in the WTO system,\ncoupled with the lack of effective and operational rules\nand disciplines to address their development concerns,\nresulted the failure of Cancun. We should pick up the\npieces from Cancun and try to construct a trading\nsystem that guarantees equity and fairness for\ndeveloping countries. Only such an approach will\nprovide the legitimacy that the WTO system so badly\nneeds to deliver on the Doha Development Agenda.\nIn order to successfully respond to the\nmultifaceted challenges we are facing in the world\ntoday, we are convinced that the international\ncommunity should rededicate itself to the values of\nsolidarity, tolerance, mutual respect and cooperation.\nThe belief that countries can be immune from\nwhat other countries do is no longer tenable. The need\nfor international cooperation, rather than confrontation,\nis critical. A new international order is essential if we\nare to avoid a collision of cultures and religious beliefs.\nThis is the last occasion on which I will address\nthe General Assembly in my capacity as Prime\nMinister. In six days' time, I will relinquish my current\npost and accede to the presidency, while my Deputy\nPrime Minister will be sworn in as Prime Minister. I\nam confident that he will be accorded the same\ncollaboration and friendship that I have enjoyed during\nmy tenure in office.\nBefore I conclude, however, I renew my appeal to\nthe United Kingdom to take all measures to complete\nthe process of the decolonization of Mauritius. For\nyears, Mauritius has consistently reaffirmed its\nsovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago, including\nDiego Garcia, here and in all international forums. I\nsincerely regret that this issue has not been resolved. I\ntherefore reiterate our appeal to the United Kingdom,\nas a country known for its fair play and for\nchampioning human rights, and to our friends in the\nUnited States, to engage in a serious dialogue with\nMauritius over the issue of the Chagos Archipelago so\nthat an early solution may be found.\nThe removal of the Chagossians under false\npretences resulted in gross violations of human rights.\nHopefully this aspect of the matter will be resolved\nthrough the British courts shortly.\n\nI also appeal to the French Republic, with which\nwe have excellent relations, to resume the dialogue\nwith a view to returning Tromelin island to Mauritian\nsovereignty.\n\nWith those words, I bid the Assembly goodbye.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst, Sir,\nplease accept my warm congratulations and my fervent\nhopes for your successful achievement of the mission\nentrusted to you. Your election to the presidency of the\nfifty-eighth session of the General Assembly is a fitting\ntribute by the international community to the people of\nSaint Lucia. I am convinced that with your experience\n22\n \nand your distinguished intellectual and ethical\nqualities, you will successfully lead our work to be\ncarried out in the best spirit.\nSir, I wish to convey to your predecessor, Mr. Jan\nKavan, the congratulations of the delegation of Mali\nfor the skill, dedication and spirit of initiative and the\nauthority with which he directed the work of the fifty-\nseventh session of the General Assembly. I also take\nthis solemn occasion to pay well-deserved tribute to\nSecretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan for his dedication to\nthe ideals of the United Nations.\nThe present session is opening in a context where\nthe United Nations is still confronting challenges to its\nvery existence; those challenges moved humanity 58\nyears ago to equip itself with an instrument of hope\ncapable of meeting them. Let us recall that the United\nNations were conceived to save ourselves from the\ndemons of war and insecurity. The idea was to secure a\nstate of grace   one of man reconciled with himself  \nand to create the conditions for reducing material want,\nuncertainty and poverty.\nFlashpoints of tension   fire and smoke   exist\nand are developing in many places. Poverty and\ndistress are the daily lot of many inhabitants of our\nplanet, particularly in Africa.\nThe arrival of the new millennium brought\nenormous hopes. We have barely turned to the third\npage of this millennium and new challenges are\nassailing humankind. Upon us are other questions for\nwhich we must uncover the appropriate solutions so\nthat our Organization will remain true to itself and\npursue its goals without succumbing to a hijacking of\nits mandate.\nThe Government of Mali believes that the United\nNations remains an instrument of great value. Defining\nthe rules of the game is one thing; applying them under\nthe watchful eye of an impartial arbiter who has the\nnecessary authority and the corresponding means to act\nis another. We need to work to make the United\nNations that authority and arbiter.\nFor its part, under the distinguished leadership of\nMr. Amadou Toumani Tour\u00c8, President of the Republic\nof Mali, our country is steadfastly committed to\nsupporting the United Nations in attaining its objective:\nthe full development of humankind.\nAt the national level, our President is firmly\ncommitted to strengthening the institutions of the\nRepublic and of communities, to promote democracy\nand human rights and to give a boost to good governance,\neconomic growth and sustainable development.\nPeace and security are among the principal values\nheld and venerated by the peoples of the entire world\nas they are essential for their social and economic\ndevelopment.\nMali has been fully committed to the twin\nchallenges of conflict prevention and conflict\nmanagement. At the subregional level, Mali has sent\ntroops to Liberia, and our President has been\npersonally committed to solidarity with the\nGovernment and people of C\u00d9te d'Ivoire in their search\nfor coordinated political solutions to the crisis faced by\nthat brotherly country. That testifies to the importance\nwe attach to peace and stability.\nAt the continental level, our country will\nunstintingly continue its tireless efforts within the\nAfrican Union, which have deployed continuously\nsince the establishment of the African Union to achieve\nstability, the guarantor for all economic social and\ncultural development. Therefore, Mali calls on all\nStates to adopt a multilateral approach, subregional and\nregional cooperation and international solidarity, with\nrigorous respect for the sovereignty of States.\nThe overall situation prevailing in the Middle\nEast, in particular the conflict in Iraq, remains a\nburning issue of the day and a major concern for the\ninternational community. We should point out to the\nprotagonists of these conflicts that war is never\nanything other than a political failure and that the\nvictories of peace are no less renowned than those of\nwar. Peace between Palestinians and Israelis will\ngarner more fame than all wars combined. The parties\nto the conflict should be mindful of that.\nIn addition, we invite the international\ncommunity to provide aid and assistance to the\nPalestinian people and the Palestinian Authority\nbecause the destruction of Palestinian infrastructure\nand the restrictions imposed as a result of occupation\nhave caused a clear deterioration of the socio-economic\nfabric of Palestinian society. It is therefore to be feared\nthat the strategy of destruction will henceforth become\na constant in how conflicts unfold in general.\nTerrorism is one of the gravest threats to human\nsecurity. Combating that scourge requires strengthening\nnational and regional capacities. It should be recalled\n23\n \nthat Mali has ratified all international legal instruments\nconcerning terrorism and transnational organized\ncrime, as well as the additional protocol.\nIt is encouraging to note that the international\ncommunity, in particular the United Nations, has made\nthe campaign against the proliferation of small arms\nand light weapons a major focus of concern. That is\nparticularly reassuring because, for the last ten years,\nsmall arms and light weapons have weighed on the\nfuture and destiny of the peoples of Africa. Their\nadverse affects have been a great blow to human\ndignity, freedom and security.\nMali, which since 10 May 2003 has held the\npresidency of the Human Security Network, calls on all\nStates to unite for the success of the initiative of the\nframework convention on international transfers of\narms, currently being drafted, which is expected to be\nlaunched in Bamako next October; it will be an\nimportant step towards the establishment of the\nmandate of the heads of State and Government of the\nEconomic Community of West African States to\ntransform the moratorium on small arms and light\nweapons into an international convention.\nIn addition, Mali continues to be deeply\nconcerned by the phenomenon of child soldiers and\ncalls for vigorous action to put an end to that practice,\nif we wish to save future generations from the scourge\nof war.\nFor many reasons, the level of security for the\nworld's population has considerably deteriorated in\nrecent years. Even today, in many African countries,\npeople are often caught in the grip of conflicts\ninvolving guerrillas, rebel groups, civil war, ethnic war,\nclan war and clashes between militias, warlords and\nregular army forces. Designing a political strategy\nbased on the idea of human security has now become a\nvery urgent priority.\nFor its mandate at the head of the Human\nSecurity Network, Mali has made its priority the issues\nof education in human rights, children in armed\nconflict, the campaign against the proliferation of small\narms and light weapons, gender in peacekeeping\noperations and food security.\nIn the field of economics, the Government of\nMali is adopting stimulative fiscal measures in order to\nattract national and international investment, in\nparticular in the productive areas of cotton, mines and\nraising livestock. But those efforts are being hampered\nby the effects of globalization. In fact, in agriculture in\nparticular, it is not so much poverty that offends as the\nconditions that engender that poverty.\nTo give but one example, Mali   like other\nAfrican, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries   is\nsuffering from the cotton competition with developed\ncountries, which each year provide five times more\nfunds in subsidies to their farmers than they do to\ndevelopment assistance. Those subsidies have a direct\nimpact on world cotton prices, which are lower than\nthey have been for 25 years. That policy of cotton\nproduction and export subsidies by certain developed\ncountries must be abandoned, because they are contrary\nto the rules and principles of the multilateral trade\nsystem. They are ruining African economies, depriving\nour farmers of their share of the world market, and\nexacerbating the poverty that we undertook to\neliminate at the Millennium Summit.\nOn another topic, Mali welcomes the adoption of\nthe Almaty Programme of Action, whose aim is forge\npartnerships that will better meet the special needs of\nthe landlocked developing countries. We believe that\nthat Programme makes it incumbent on the\ninternational community to devise a new framework of\ncooperation with respect to transportation and transit\n  a policy that will help developing landlocked\ncountries to integrate into the world economy and to\nspeed up their socio-economic development. To do so,\nit is essential that this Programme of Action be\nimplemented with diligence at all levels, with the\nactive assistance of the technical and financial partners\nof the landlocked developing countries.\nGiven the major changes that the world is going\nthrough today and the many challenges that it faces,\nAfrica decided to crystallize its willingness to act\nthrough two initiatives: the creation of the African\nUnion and the launching of the New Partnership for\nAfrica's Development. These two initiatives represent a\nclear and courageous vision of the way Africa intends\nto shoulder its responsibilities with respect to its own\ndevelopment and its full integration into the world\neconomy.\nWe deeply appreciate the commitment made by\nthe international community here at United Nations\nHeadquarters to support the tremendous task of\ndevelopment in Africa, and we welcome the actions of\nthe Group of Eight aimed at establishing programmes\n24\n \nthat will help translate into reality the commitments\nmade in the African action plan. We hope that this\nexample will be followed by the international\ncommunity, because the implementation of NEPAD\nwill require substantial and effective support.\nWith respect to information and communication\ntechnologies, my delegation welcomes the upcoming\nholding, in December 2003 in Geneva, of the first\nphase of the World Summit on the Information Society,\nwhich will offer the international community, and\nAfrican States in particular, the opportunity to discuss\nthe role of those technologies and their impact on\nsocio-economic development. The second phase will be\nheld in Tunis, Africa, and we hope that the Summit will\nadopt specific measures to promote the development of\nthe least advanced people in these areas.\nThe world is in crisis, and the worldwide crisis at\npresent is largely due to humankind's inability to\ncomprehend and to take on the responsibilities required\nby the new role that is required in the world. In the\ncontext of this crisis, realities have changed also for the\nUnited Nations. Today we have to deal with those who\nhad previously been overlooked.\nFor Mali, the United Nations remains the living\nincarnation of this hope for peace and security. It is an\nunequalled instrument. But, like any other instrument,\nit can worn out if it is overused, and from time to time\nit needs to be reinvigorated in order to be more\neffective, efficient and modern and to perform better.\nOur Organization is at a crossroads. To quote a\ncontemporary author,\nIf we keep looking towards the past to prolong\nit, we are doomed. If we look towards a new\nhorizon, then our strength, our creativity and the\npower of our intellect will do the rest.'\nThe past of our Organization has shown its limits.\nWe must now implement reforms that will allow us to\nrealize our hopes for the future. Global governance\nrequires the democratization of the decision-making\nstructures that will implement it. The current\nmembership of the Security Council, for example, no\nlonger meets the needs of our planet. Its composition\nmust reflect its universal nature. Therefore, we are in\nfavour of opening it up and expanding it to include\nother Member States in order better to meet the\ncomplex challenges of the day.\nMali has taken note of the commitments made\nalong these lines by the Secretary-General in his most\nrecent report and reaffirms the central role of the\nUnited Nations in the implementation of international\ncommitments and the fact that this can be done only if\nthere is a dynamic and innovative partnership between\ndeveloped and developing countries.\nThe creation of the International Criminal Court,\nwhose elected judges and Prosecutor were sworn in this\nyear, is certainly a success for the international\ncommunity, which has fought against impunity and\nmade it a subject of international concern. In fact, for\ntwo decades, the fight against impunity and respect for\nhuman dignity has mobilized all people of goodwill.\nAlthough recent developments seem to indicate\nthat prospects for the advent of an independent\ninternational judicial forum do not appear promising, I\nwould recall that the path to follow involves not only\nresolving conflicts and establishing peace, but also\nrequires our determination to work together. We are\nconvinced of this, and therefore Mali would plead for a\nstrong ICC   a universal ICC, acting as an instrument\nwhich cannot be deterred and which will help\ncontribute to the maintenance of international peace\nand security.\nIn conclusion, I should like to recall that democracy,\njustice, freedom, peace, security, development and\nrespect for commitments are common values that are\nour foundation for, and give us a sense of, our\nhumanity.\nAll people must be given their freedom and their\ndignity. We therefore call on all States to look to the\nfuture to imagine and to promote the lifestyle that\ncorresponds to the aspirations of our people. To do so,\nwe are determined to reject any sense of fatalism of\nwhatever kind   political, economic, social or cultural.\nIndeed, today there are men and women who are\ncapable, through their work and through their will, of\nrealizing the aspirations of our peoples for well-being,\npeace, security, prosperity and sustainable\ndevelopment. Now we can hope to build a new world\n  a world that is rich in its diversity   within the\nframework of the United Nations and on new bases, a\nglorious world in which we can work together in a\nspirit of solidarity.\nSome of those men and women, on behalf of the\npeoples of the world, paid with their lives for their\n25\n \ndedication to the lofty ideals of the United Nations. Let\nthem always be in our thoughts and prayers.\nLet us all work together. Let us all continue to\nbelieve in the intrinsic nature of human beings   in\ntheir basic dignity and kind-heartedness.\n\n\n\n"

Sadly, those hopes were\ndashed \u2014 by ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, and then in\nKosovo; by the failure to end the occupation of\nPalestine, leading to the revived intifada against Israeli\noccupation; by the brutal suppression of the Kashmiri\u2019s\ndemand for self-determination and freedom from\nIndian occupation; by the unending war in Afghanistan\nand the international neglect which created a climate in\nwhich extremism and terrorism could breed; and by the\nseries of international financial crises and the rise of\npoverty as a consequence of unequal economic\nglobalization.\nThe terrible terrorist atrocity of 11 September\n2001 jolted the foundations of the international system.\nThe response has weakened al Qaeda, but it has not\neliminated its associates. Terrorists have struck\nrepeatedly around the world \u2014 in Indonesia, Tunisia,\nMorocco, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Kenya and my country,\nPakistan.\n18\n\nThe tragedy of 11 September 2001 transformed\nsecurity policies and changed geopolitical calculations.\nPakistan took a strategic decision, based on our\nprinciples of humanity and national interest, to support\nthe war on terrorism. There should be no doubt\nwhatsoever about intentions. Our actions speak louder\nthan words. Our capabilities were limited, but they\nhave been progressively improved. We are acting\nagainst al Qaeda and its associates very effectively. We\nhave also acted against other organizations or groups\ninvolved in any form of terrorism. Pakistan will remain\nat the forefront of the war on terrorism.\nThe war against terrorism must be fought\ncomprehensively, on a global front, with vision and\nunderstanding. It should not erode the moral values of\nour societies. It must not be hijacked by those who\nseek to use it as an excuse to suppress other peoples.\nIt must not be allowed to engender a clash of\ncivilizations \u2014 a clash between Islam and the West.\nIt is unfortunate that great religions \u2014 which\nshould be a source of hope, tolerance and peace \u2014 are\nseen as being pitted against each other. Many Muslims\nbelieve their eternal faith is being demonized. They see\nMuslim peoples being cruelly suppressed for\ndemanding freedom and equality, or targeted for\ndiscrimination and worse. On the other hand, the West\nperceives the Islamic world as volatile and hostile, bent\nupon striking at Western values. Muslims are often\nseen as fanatics, extremists and terrorists.\nAgainst the background of this volatile milieu,\nthe recent war in Iraq evoked negative reactions in\nmost Arab and Islamic countries.\nThis moment in history calls for reflection,\nintrospection and action. The thesis of a clash of\ncivilizations is a travesty. We must bridge the gulf of\nmisunderstanding between Islam and the West. We\nmust be the catalysts of change, not the prophets of\ndoom.\nIslam is a faith of peace, harmony and justice.\nIslam is democracy in action. It upholds human rights,\nsocial equality, non-discrimination and freedom of\nspeech. The protection of minorities is an article of\nfaith in Islam. It does not discriminate on the basis of\ncolour, caste, creed or religion. Our faith is dynamic,\npromoting constant renewal and adaptation, through\nthe process of ijtihad \u2014 interpretation through\nconsultation. Islam\u2019s vision is not trapped in any one\nperiod of history; it is modern and futuristic. Islam\nmust not be confused with the narrow vision of a few\nextremists.\nI believe the way forward is to adopt a two-\npronged \u2014 or double-pincer \u2014 strategy to build\nharmony, promote moderation, oppose extremism and\nensure justice. I call this the strategy of enlightened\nmoderation.\nOn the one hand, Muslim nations must assume\ntheir responsibility for internal reform and renewal.\nThey are at the crossroads. They must eschew\nextremism and confrontation. They must embrace the\nmarch of human civilization. They must address the\ndeficits in their social and economic development.\nThey must seek science and technology, higher\neducation and human resource development.\nThe international community \u2014 especially the\nadvanced countries of the West \u2014 must deliver the\nother pincer in this strategy of enlightened moderation.\nThey can do so by helping to resolve political disputes\nand situations in which Muslim peoples are being\nsuppressed, such as in Palestine and Kashmir; by\nrejecting attempts to equate terrorism with Islam; and\nby assisting the Muslim world in poverty alleviation\nand in socio-economic development. The United\nNations itself has a crucial role to play in the\nconception and execution of the strategy of enlightened\nmoderation.\nIn that context, it is clear that a consensus must\nbe quickly developed at the United Nations on ways to\nrestore Iraq\u2019s stability, security and sovereignty. Iraq\ncannot be allowed to remain an open wound. That\nwould have an impact on the region and could inject a\nnew dimension into the campaign against terrorism and\nextremism. The consensus that is developed must\nenable the Iraqi people, through an inclusive political\nprocess, to determine the sequence of steps leading to a\nfully representative Iraqi Government and to an end to\noccupation. The Iraqi people should assume control of\ntheir resources and of their political destiny as soon as\npossible. They must receive the full support of the\ninternational community, including Iraq\u2019s neighbours\nand the Arab and the Islamic countries, in building\nsecurity and in reconstructing their country. Pakistan\nwould be prepared to help in a collective United-\nNations-sanctioned Arab and Islamic effort to help the\nIraqi people, if they themselves wish us to do so.\nEndeavours to stabilize Iraq will be enhanced by\nprogress in promoting peace with justice in the Middle\n19\n\nEast. Hopes for a just and comprehensive peace were\naroused earlier this year by the Quartet\u2019s road map;\nthose hopes have been progressively dimmed. But\nfailure is not an option at all. The fate of the\nPalestinian people is the principal factor in determining\npublic and political perceptions in the entire Islamic\nworld. It is only progress towards a just peace that can\nmarginalize the extremists. Therefore, we must revive\nfaithful implementation of the road map and must\nrealize the vision of two States, Palestine and Israel,\nliving side by side in peace within recognized\nboundaries.\nWe must ensure successful implementation of the\nBonn process in Afghanistan. The international\nstabilization force should be expanded and enlarged to\nensure security and control over all parts of\nAfghanistan by President Karzai\u2019s Government.\nPakistan will continue to contribute to interdicting and\narresting al Qaeda and associated terrorists. We will\nfurther intensify our economic cooperation with\nAfghanistan. It is essential that Afghanistan\u2019s territory\nnot be used by third countries for interference or for\nterrorism against Afghanistan\u2019s neighbours.\nJammu and Kashmir has been rightly described as\nthe most dangerous dispute in the world. A just\nsolution of that dispute holds the key to peace and\nsecurity in South Asia. I am glad that India has stepped\nback from its dangerous and failed experiment in\ncoercive diplomacy last year. Despite some\nimprovement in the political atmosphere, India\ncontinues to suppress the legitimate struggle of the\nKashmiri people to exercise their right of self-\ndetermination, in accordance with Security Council\nresolutions. It refuses Pakistan\u2019s offers of dialogue to\naddress and resolve the Kashmir dispute once and for\nall.\nIndia cites cross-border terrorism in order to\nreject dialogue. It knows full well that the Kashmiri\nstruggle is indigenous. India seeks to exploit the\ninternational anti-terrorist sentiment after 11 September\nto delegitimize the Kashmiri freedom struggle. On the\ncontrary, it is India which violates international law by\nrefusing to implement Security Council resolutions and\nby perpetrating gross and consistent violations of\nhuman rights in Kashmir.\nOnce again, from this rostrum, I invite India to\njoin Pakistan in a sustained dialogue to resolve the\nKashmir dispute. I am convinced that, with goodwill,\nwe can find a just solution which is acceptable to India,\nto Pakistan and, above all, to the people of Kashmir. I\nalso invite India, jointly with Pakistan, to observe a\ncomplete ceasefire along the Line of Control in\nKashmir.\nPakistan would also be prepared to encourage a\ngeneral cessation of violence within Kashmir involving\nreciprocal obligations and restraints on Indian forces\nand on the Kashmir freedom movement. And, may I\nadd, if India is genuinely concerned about infiltration\nacross the Line of Control, we ask that it agree to a\nviable mechanism to monitor such infiltration on both\nsides of the Line. The United Nations Military\nObserver Group in India and Pakistan could be\nenlarged for that very purpose.\nApart from addressing Kashmir, sustainable\nsecurity in South Asia requires India and Pakistan to\ninstitute measures to ensure mutual nuclear restraint\nand a conventional-arms balance. Unfortunately, India\nhas embarked on a massive build-up of its conventional\nand non-conventional military capabilities \u2014 advanced\noffensive aircraft, ballistic and cruise missiles, anti-\nballistic-missile systems, nuclear submarines and an\naircraft carrier. That will destabilize South Asia and\nerode strategic deterrence. Those Powers which desire\npeace, stability and security in South Asia, and oppose\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, must\nreview their decisions to offer such major strategic-\nweapons systems to India. They must contribute to\nmaintaining arms restraint and a military balance in\nSouth Asia.\nThe crises and conflicts of the past decade have\nenhanced, not diminished, the relevance of the United\nNations. The United Nations remains the central forum\nfor dialogue and diplomacy, and it must be\nstrengthened. The Security Council must be made more\nrepresentative by increasing the number of non-\npermanent members. New permanent members will\nonly expand inequality. States which occupy and\nsuppress other peoples, and defy the resolutions of the\nCouncil, have absolutely no credentials to aspire to\npermanent Security Council membership.\nWe are on the cusp of a new millennium. It is a\ndecisive moment in history. We must decide whether to\nflow with the currents that threaten confrontation and\nthe collapse of civilizations, or to muster the collective\nwill to chart the course of history towards a peaceful\nand cooperative global society. The leaders assembled\n20\n\nhere bear an enormous responsibility to rescue our\nworld from war and violence, poverty and pestilence;\nto redress inequity and impoverishment, which breed\ndespair and destruction; and finally, to collectively\nconstruct a new global architecture of peace and\nprosperity for all peoples and all nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffSergio\nVieira de Mello was the pride of the United Nations.\nMurdered on 19 August along with his colleagues, he\nwill remain in our memories. Let us dedicate this\nsession to that great servant of the world and of peace.\nThe United Nations has just emerged from one of\nthe most serious challenges in its history. Respect for\nthe Charter and the use of force were at the heart of the\ndebate. The war, which was launched without the\nSecurity Council's authorization, has undermined the\nmultilateral system.\nHaving come to terms with that crisis, our\nOrganization can now continue to move forward; for it\nis above all in this forum   the melting pot of the\ninternational order   that we must exercise our\nresponsibilities to the world of today as well as to\nfuture generations.\nIn an open world no one can live in isolation, no\none can act alone in the name of all and no one can\naccept the anarchy of a society without rules. There is\nno alternative to the United Nations. But in order to\nmeet today's challenges, this fundamental choice,\nexpressed by the Charter, requires a far-reaching\nreform of our Organization.\nMultilateralism is crucial, because it ensures the\nparticipation of all in the management of world affairs.\nIt is a guarantee of legitimacy and democracy,\nespecially when decisions must be made with respect to\nthe use of force or to the laying down of universal\nnorms.\n15\n\nMultilateralism is effective. In Monterrey and\nJohannesburg, it allowed us to transcend North-South\nconfrontation and to open the way to promising\npartnerships, in particular with the African continent.\nMultilateralism is modern, because it alone makes\nit possible to comprehend contemporary problems\nglobally and in all of their complexity.\nFirst, let me touch on the settlement of conflicts\nthat threaten international peace and security.\nIn Iraq, the transfer of sovereignty to the Iraqis,\nwho must have sole responsibility for their destiny, is\nessential for stability and reconstruction. It is up to the\nUnited Nations to lend its legitimacy to that process. It\nis also up to the United Nations to assist with the\ngradual transfer of administrative and economic\nresponsibilities to the Iraqi institutions, according to a\nrealistic timetable, and to help the Iraqis draft a\nconstitution and hold general elections.\nFinally, it is up to the United Nations to entrust a\nmandate to a multinational force, commanded,\nnaturally, by the main troop contributor   that is, the\nUnited States   in order to ensure the security of Iraq\nand of all those helping to rebuild the country.\nThus the international community and the Iraqi\npeople, united around a common project, will together\nput an end to the tragic decades of that great country's\nhistory.\nIn the Middle East, ravaged by despair and\nhatred, only strong political will on both sides to\nimplement the law as stipulated by the United Nations\ncan pave the way for a just and lasting solution.\nThe international community must restore a\ndynamic for peace. It must involve itself in the\nimplementation of the road map. That should be the\nobjective of the upcoming meeting of the Quartet, to be\nheld at the ministerial level. France believes that the\nidea of a monitoring mechanism is as relevant as ever,\nand that the convening of an international conference is\na goal to be attained as quickly as possible.\nGiven the present tense situation, France calls on\nthe parties not to succumb to the temptation of a test of\nstrength and of a futile radicalization.\nAnother major challenge is the fight against\ninternational terrorism. This fight is well under way,\nunder the auspices of the Security Council and within\nthe context of our treaties. The horror of 11 September\ncemented our common resolve. This threat strikes at\nthe very heart of our democracies and our societies. We\nare using force to combat terrorism, but that is not\nenough. It will re-emerge again and again if we allow\nextremism and fanaticism to flourish   if we fail to\nrealize that it seeks justification in the world's\nunresolved conflicts and economic and social\nimbalances.\nGiven the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction, we reject the policy of fait accompli. We\nmust stand united to guarantee the universality of\ntreaties and the effectiveness of non-proliferation\nregimes. In order to ensure compliance, we must also\ndevelop our means of action. France has proposed the\ncreation of a permanent corps of inspectors under the\nauthority of the Security Council. Let us give fresh\nimpetus to this policy. Let us convene a summit\nmeeting of the Security Council to outline a true plan\nof action of the United Nations against proliferation.\nAt this time, let us demand that North Korea\ncompletely, verifiably and irreversibly dismantle its\nmilitary programme. Let us demand that Iran sign and\nimplement, unconditionally and without delay, a\nstrengthened nuclear safeguards agreement with the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency.\nSustainable development poses yet another\nchallenge, because half of humankind is living in\nconditions of insecurity or extreme poverty. Will we be\nable to globalize solidarity, as our peoples demand, in\nresponse to the inevitable globalization of the\neconomy?\nWe agree on the objectives. We are bound by the\nMillennium Goals. But, in order to attain those goals,\nstrong political impetus remains necessary. I propose\nthat heads of State and Government meet in New York\nin 2005 for a preliminary progress review. I hope that\nthis session of the General Assembly will confirm the\ndetermination of States to overcome the failure of\nCancun and to ensure the success of the Doha\nDevelopment Round.\nIn order to carry out the missions entrusted to it\nand to remedy its blatant shortcomings, the United\nNations must evolve. Three watchwords, I believe,\nmust guide us: democracy, authority, effectiveness.\nThanks to the Secretary-General, progress has been\nmade, and new avenues are opening up. It is now up to\nStates to move forward without further ado and to put\n16\n\nan end to the adverse consequences of the stalemate\nover reforms.\nThe United Nations is suffering from the current\nweakness of the General Assembly. And yet, it is here\nthat a debate should be organized and a consensus\ncrafted regarding solutions to major problems. A\nculture of confrontation must give way to a culture of\naction aimed at achieving our common goals, which we\nshould determine together.\nThe primary responsibility for the maintenance of\npeace and security rests with the Security Council. It is\ntherefore essential to its legitimacy that its composition\nreflect the state of the world. It must be expanded to\ninclude new permanent members, because the presence\nof major countries is necessary. France, naturally, is\nthinking of Germany and of Japan, but also of some\nleading countries of Asia, Africa and America. We also\nneed new elected members, to make the Council even\nmore representative. With the decisive impetus of the\nfive permanent members, we all need to resume\ndiscussions, mindful of the general interest.\nSuch reform should be accompanied by a\nstrengthening of the Council's authority. It is the\nCouncil that should set the bounds with respect to the\nuse of force. No one can claim the right to use force\nunilaterally and preventively. Conversely, in the face of\nmounting threats, States must be assured that the\nCouncil has at its disposal the appropriate means of\nevaluation and of collective action, and that it has the\nwill to act.\nWe all are very committed to the sovereignty of\nStates. But its scope can and should be limited in the\ncase of serious violations of human rights and of\nhumanitarian law. The Security Council is taking steps\nin that direction, and France supports this development.\nMeanwhile, crimes against humanity are being\nsuppressed more effectively with the establishment of\nthe International Criminal Court, whose jurisdiction is\nuniversal. This historic step forward must be\naccompanied by a strengthening of the Office of the\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights, under a\ncommission equipped to discharge its duties and its\nmission.\nWe now realize that globalization demands\nstronger economic, social and environmental\ngovernance. To that end, France proposes the creation\nof a new political forum representative of the present\neconomic state of today's world in all its diversity.\nThat council would be responsible for providing the\nnecessary impetus to international institutions, for\nimproving their coordination and for anticipating and\ntackling global problems more effectively.\nEffectiveness also depends on increased financial\nresources. France calls for two changes.\nFirst, the trend towards increasing voluntary\ncontributions at the expense of mandatory\ncontributions must be reversed. Failing that, we will\nend up with a pick-and-choose United Nations, which\nis an outdated vision and a harmful one.\nSecondly, we need to make progress in\nmobilizing funds for development and development\nassistance. France wants to meet the official\ndevelopment assistance target of 0.7 per cent by the\nyear 2012. But this effort, together with that of the\nEuropean Union, will obviously not suffice to release\nthe necessary funds needed to finance the Millennium\nGoals each year. France therefore supports the\ninnovative concept of an international financial facility.\nI would also like us to give pragmatic, speedy\nconsideration to international solidarity levies, a kind\nof tax on the wealth generated by globalization and\ngiven over to development.\nTo advance on these issues, I completely approve\nof the Secretary-General's intention to gather around\nhim a committee of independent wise men and women\nresponsible for submitting proposals.\nAgainst the risk of a world without order\ndelivered up to violence, let us work to establish the\nrule of international law. Against the injustice and\nsuffering of a world of widening inequalities   even\nthough it has never been so rich   let us choose\nsolidarity. Against the chaos of a world shaken by\necological disasters, let us call for a sharing of\nresponsibility around a United Nations environmental\norganization. Against the barbarity of a world in which\nfundamental rights are all too often held up to ridicule,\nwhere the integrity of mankind is under threat, where\nindigenous peoples   the heirs to an irreplaceable\nheritage   vanish amid silence and indifference, let us\nuphold the demands of ethics. Against the peril of a\nclash of civilizations, finally, let us insist on the equal\ndignity of cultures, respect for diversity and the value\nof dialogue.\n17\n\nWith the Charter adopted in the name of the\nPeoples of the United Nations, the founders proclaimed\ntheir faith in these ideals. Let us seek to be worthy of\nthem. Let us establish the United Nations at the heart\nof this planetary democracy that is so vital in our day\nand age.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow\nme at the outset, on behalf of my delegation and in my\npersonal capacity, to extend my warmest\ncongratulations to Mr. Julian Robert Hunte on his\nelection to preside over our work. My country's\ndelegation and I wish him every success and assure\nhim of our full cooperation in bringing his noble\nmission to fruition.\nI should also like to pay a tribute to his\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, for the skill and\ncompetence with which he guided the work of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-seventh session.\nI take this opportunity to congratulate Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan on the skill and dynamism with\nwhich he has led our Organization and on his\nunflagging attention to the people of Burundi in\nhelping them to emerge from the serious crisis they\nhave experienced for the past 10 years.\nI should also like to voice our profound gratitude\nto the Security Council for its ongoing readiness and\nmanifest determination to assist the Government and\npeople of Burundi in the quest for a lasting solution\nleading to peace and national reconciliation. The\nregular visits of the Security Council to my country\nhave encouraged the inter-Burundian peace process and\nsent a message of hope to a people severely battered by\nwar.\nSince the signing of the Arusha Peace and\nReconciliation Agreement for Burundi on 28 August\n2000, the peace process under way in my country has\nmade significant progress. Since 1 November 2001, we\nhave had transitional institutions uniting all the\npolitical factions of the country. Since then, effective\nadministrative reforms have been undertaken and\nreforms planned for the judiciary are gradually being\nmade as funding becomes available.\nFurthermore, the people of Burundi and the\ninternational community were gratified by the transfer\nof power at the highest level of State, which proceeded\nsmoothly on 30 April 2003, guaranteeing the\n2\n\ninstitutional framework of the Arusha Agreement. The\nTransitional Government of Burundi is now involved in\nnegotiations with the armed groups in order to achieve\na permanent ceasefire agreement and to ensure its\neffective implementation.\nThus, on 7 October 2002, we signed a ceasefire\nagreement with the factions of the Forces nationales de\nlib\u00c8ration-Parti Lib\u00c8ration du Peuple Hutu (FNL-\nPALIPEHUTU) and the Conseil national pour la\nd\u00c8fense de la d\u00c8mocratie-Front pour la d\u00c8fense de la\nd\u00c8mocratie (CNDD-FDD), led respectively by Alain\nMugabarabona and Jean Bosco Ndayikengurukiye. On\n2 December 2002, we signed a similar agreement with\nthe principal armed movement of CNDD-FDD led by\nPierre Nkurunziza. Today, the Transitional Government\nis pursuing negotiations with the latter with a view to\nintegrating that group into the Republic's transitional\ninstitutions, including the Defence and Security Corps,\nthe National Assembly, the Senate, the Government\nand the Administration. The most recent negotiations\nwere those organized in Dar es Salaam on\n15 September.\nDar es Salaam served as the context and\nopportunity for the presentation and consideration of\nthe strong and effective positions of all concerned.\nAbove all, it provided an opportunity to exchange\nviews and to understand and reaffirm the importance of\nthe central focus of the Arusha Peace and\nReconciliation Agreement for Burundi and for taking\ninto consideration the national realities that will ensure\nthe maintenance of stability. We refer in particular to\nrespect for the allocations agreed in Arusha; the\ngranting of visibility to CNDD-FDD in the institutions,\nwhile avoiding a raising of the stakes and the exclusion\nof others; the equitable sharing of power; respect for\nthe rights of citizens; and so on.\nA summit of heads of State was then planned on\nvery short notice to arrive at the conclusions and\ncompromises necessary to the signing of the protocol\nfor the implementation of the ceasefire agreement of\n2 December 2002 and for the entry of CNDD-FDD into\nthe transitional institutions. We take this opportunity\nwarmly to thank the heads of State of the region and\ndelegations at that summit for their work leading to the\nsteps already undertaken.\nThese fairly positive results should not blind us to\na number of difficulties facing Burundi today. Indeed,\nthe continuation of war is a major obstacle to\nimplementing planned reform, even though the\nGovernment is sparing no efforts to meet this great\nchallenge, and its commitment to implement the\nArusha Agreement and ceasefire agreement for peace\nand reconciliation in Burundi speaks for itself.\nTherefore, we continue to urge leaders of the\nregional initiative for Burundi, mediators and the\ninternational community to step up their pressure on\nPierre Nkurunziza's FDD for a ceasefire and\nintegration in institutions, and on Agathon Rwasa's\nParti pour la lib\u00c8ration du peuple Hutu\n(PALIPEHUTU) to rejoin without further delay the\ntransitional Government of Burundi at the negotiating\ntable, the only appropriate forum to voice its claims.\nWe also urge the international community to\nmake a substantial financial contribution to the African\nMission in Burundi, which is crucial to the monitoring\nof the ceasefire.\nFinally, the Government of Burundi is impatiently\nawaiting the establishment of an international judicial\ncommission of inquiry in Burundi, whose work will\nclearly contribute to helping Burundi to objectively\nconfront the crucial issue of the campaign against\nimpunity.\nAnother major challenge confronting us is\neconomic growth and efforts to combat poverty among\nour people. Indeed, the people of Burundi are now\nliving in unspeakable poverty. Ten years have so\nseverely devastated the national economy that we no\nlonger have the bare minimum required to sustain\nsocial harmony. More than 68 per cent of the\npopulation of Burundi is living beneath the poverty\nlevel.\nOf course, we approve of efforts already made by\nthe international community to ensure the survival of\nmy country. But we also ask it to make further efforts\nto quickly fulfil the promises made in Paris and\nGeneva.\nI am pleased to say that the peace process in my\ncountry is now developing in a propitious subregional\nenvironment recently characterized by significant\nprogress in the peace process in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo and a democratic breakthrough\nin Rwanda.\nThat positive change should lead to the definitive\nend to conflicts and also make possible the\ninternational conference on the Great Lakes region,\n3\n\nwhich the Government of Burundi so ardently hopes\nwill take place.\nWe wish to see the peace that we seek for\nBurundi and its neighbours spread to the entire world.\nDuring the Millennium Assembly in September 2000,\nheads of State and Government agreed, inter alia, to\nspare no effort to save our peoples from the scourge of\nwar, whether it be civil war or war between States. A\ndecision was also made to increase the effectiveness of\nthe United Nations in the maintenance of peace and\nsecurity and to take concerted steps to combat\ninternational terrorism.\nOn the one hand, we can justly welcome the\ncommitment made by the leaders of the entire world to\nwork for a better planet, and we commend the\nsomewhat positive results in restoring international\npeace and security. On the other hand, our collective\nconscience places obligations on us all and requires\nsustained vigilance and efforts in the face of persistent\nand serious setbacks endured here and there on the path\nto international peace and security. Indeed, the world of\nthe twenty-first century has not been spared from the\ndangers of war, poverty, terrorism, disease and natural\ndisasters.\nThe efforts to combat terrorism that were stepped\nup by Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) have\nhad mixed results thus far, in view of the frequency and\nviciousness of terrorist acts throughout the world, from\nwhich even our outstanding Organization is not spared.\nThese terrorist attacks have done much to contribute to\nmaintaining a general trend towards over-reliance on\nthe military and the strengthening of doctrines based on\npreventive attacks, a concept that continues to fuel\npolitical and diplomatic debate.\nDespite the ever-increasing commitment of the\nUnited Nations and regional and subregional\norganizations, hotbeds of tension among or within\nStates have not yet been extinguished and calls for war\nare enduring and threatening, like the sword of\nDamocles. Mercenaries are increasingly being used as\ntools to destabilize sovereign and independent States.\nThe threat of nuclear war continues to loom over us\nand poison international relations.\nTrafficking in human beings, a true form of\nslavery in the twenty-first century, particularly with\nrespect to the child labour market, child prostitution,\nthe use of children as cannon fodder in conflicts and\nillegal migration continue to be a reality to this day.\nAll these abuses have as a common denominator\nan attack on human rights and international\nhumanitarian law that the Member States of the United\nNations are duty-bound to champion side by side\nwithin the framework of multilateralism, one of the\nmost cherished principles of our Organization.\nIn light of the impression that we are\nexperiencing a genuine crisis in the architecture of\npeace-building and international security, intelligent\nreform of institutions entrusted with the maintenance\nof international peace and security is urgently needed\nto better enable them to meet the security needs of our\ntime.\nAbove all, the revitalization of the General\nAssembly, the most representative organ of the United\nNations, must be tirelessly pursued. Careful\nconsideration should make the General Assembly much\nmore operational and streamlined with respect to its\nworking methods and, in particular, to impartial\nfollow-up and implementation of its resolutions and\ndecisions.\nReform of the Security Council in all its aspects\nalso continues to be a top priority for us, as the\nMillennium Declaration stressed, to meet the concerns\nabout the regional balance of its membership. The\ncredibility of the Council and our Organization are at\nstake here.\nMoreover, multilateralism must remain a common\npillar for us all, as one of the fundamental values that\nshould underpin international relations in the\nframework of active solidarity and shared\nresponsibilities, under the aegis of our Organization.\nWe also appeal for regular voluntary financing of\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations and support\nfor mechanisms of regional and subregional conflict-\nprevention and promotion of political stability, with\nparticular attention given to Africa.\nThere is no need to recall that our world is\nincreasingly characterized by growing\ninterdependence, conflicts, pandemics and natural\ndisasters that have repercussions that know no borders\nbetween States. Economic and social imbalances that\nresult from the unfair and non-inclusive international\nfinancial structure prevent us from efficiently tackling\ntoday's very complex challenges. The needs and\ninterests of developing countries have not been\nsufficiently taken into account. The gulf between rich\n4\n\nand poor is widening. We therefore have a common\nduty to establish an environment that will benefit all\npoor peoples.\nWith respect to cooperation for development, the\nfight against poverty remains a priority. Attaining the\ngoals set at the international level during major\nconferences and summits involves the elimination of\npoverty and hunger, in particular in rural areas.\nThis implies, among other things, significant\ninvestment in the agricultural and rural sectors geared\ntowards increasing production and protecting the\nenvironment. We are all aware that, in order to be\nsuccessful, the development efforts of poor countries\nrequire multifaceted international support. To that end,\nthe commitments undertaken at the Monterrey\nconference regarding aid to development are\nencouraging, but we must promptly move from good\nintentions to specific deeds.\nThe least developed countries have weak and\nmarginalized economies within the international\nfinancial system. They therefore require particular\nattention in terms of official development assistance,\ndirect foreign investment, debt relief, the strengthening\nof capacities and access to international markets. We\nalso urge the international community to advance the\nintegral implementation of the Almaty plan of action as\na response to the specific difficulties linked to the\ndistance to the sea and to high costs of transportation\nthat seriously handicap the economic development of\nlandlocked countries.\nAfrica is the continent where the ills of\ndestitution have attained an alarming level. In a shared\nimpetus, Africans have created the New Partnership for\nAfrica's Development (NEPAD). The warm welcome\nthe international community gave to NEPAD must be\nbacked by concrete gestures of solidarity. Thus, the\nspirit of partnership, which also entails the active\nparticipation of local authorities and associations of\ncivil society, can, in fact, become a reality and allow\nour continent to benefit from its immense riches down\nto a grassroots level.\nThe rules of the World Trade Organization need\nto be made more flexible to allow developing countries\nto benefit from the liberalization of world trade. The\ninitiatives already undertaken along these lines in Doha\ndeserve to be further intensified. There is a need to end\nall forms of subsidies for products exported from rich\ncountries, which lead to distorted exchange rates, as\nwell as various non-tariff obstacles. The international\ncommunity must also work to remedy the instability of\nthe prices of commodities, which are the major source\nof revenue for poor countries.\nAnother major challenge is overcoming the\nHIV/AIDS pandemic and halting malaria and\ntuberculosis in tropical countries. AIDS is a threat to\nmankind. It is devastating entire populations, making\nmillions of children defenceless orphans and\nswallowing up all development efforts. Faced with this\ncommon danger, urgent action is necessary. We herald\nthe establishment in January 2002 of the Global Fund\nto combat these three scourges, and we urge those\ncountries that have the financial and scientific means to\ndo so to step up their efforts to limit and ultimately\nstamp out those disasters.\nI would not like to end without emphasizing\nagain the critical role that the United Nations Charter\nbestows on our Organization in its sacred mission of\nhumanizing international relations each day and\ncontributing to building a better world. The obstacles\nin the path of the United Nations are not inevitable;\nrather, they are an opportunity to meet new challenges\nand adapt the Organization to achieve the objectives of\nthe Charter and those of the Millennium Declaration.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of\nthe delegation of Viet Nam, I wish to warmly\ncongratulate Julian Hunte on his assumption of the\npresidency of the fifty-eighth session of the General\nAssembly. I believe that under his able guidance this\nsession will come to a fruitful conclusion. I also take\nthis opportunity to express our great appreciation for\nthe significant contributions made by Mr. Jan Kavan\nduring the previous session of the General Assembly.\nEarlier last month, we were all shocked and\nshared in the boundless grief over the tragic demise of\nour dear Sergio Vieira de Mello, United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights and Special\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for Iraq, and\nhis colleagues in the barbarous bombing of the United\nNations offices in Baghdad. We will not be discouraged\nby that loss. Instead, we should pursue even further the\nefforts of the United Nations to help the Iraqi people to\nrestore stability and reconstruct their country.\nWe are living in a world full of events with\nprofound implications for the various aspects of\ninternational life. They include the war in Iraq, the\nbombing of the United Nations offices in Baghdad, the\noutbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\n(SARS), increased violence in the Middle East, as well\nas continuing terrorist attacks in various parts of the\nworld. Coupled with poverty, disease, floods, droughts\nand conflicts, they continue to take many innocent\nlives. This breaks our hearts and should not be\ncondoned, especially when mankind has entered the\nthird millennium of human civilization. We must make\nfull use of the great achievements registered in the\nareas of science and technology and economy and\ntrade, uphold the values of civilization, and serve the\ncommon development and prosperity of all nations.\nStrengthening international peace and security\nand enhancing development remain our primary task.\nOnly in an environment of peace and stability can\nnations concentrate their energy to meet the challenges\nof development and to achieve poverty eradication.\nHealthy, equitable international relations can be built\nonly on the principles of the United Nations Charter\n23\n\nand international law, in particular the principle of\nrespect for national independence, sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity and the principle of non-\ninterference in the internal affairs of States.\nDevelopment cooperation and international\neconomic and trade relations can be built only when all\nparticipate on an equal footing, on the basis of mutual\nbenefit and with favourable assistance to developing\ncountries. However, there continue to be certain egoistic\ntendencies that are contrary to that good. Protectionist\nmeasures, including anti-dumping measures, have been\nimposed to prevent developing countries\u2019 products from\nentering developed countries\u2019 markets. That runs\ncounter not only to World Trade Organization (WTO)\nagreements but also to normal trade practices.\nA typical case was that of the recent unfair\nlawsuit against the sale of Viet Nam\u2019s catfish in the\nUnited States market. The same story recurs in the case\nof cotton-growers in Burkina Faso and again in the\ncase of indigenous cultivators of medicinal herbs in\nBrazil. These examples should serve as a further lesson\nthat developing countries will always be at a\ndisadvantage in the current international trade system,\nas the Secretary-General himself recently observed. By\nthe same token, the failure to reach agreement at the\nfifth WTO Ministerial Conference in Canc\u00fan is truly\nregrettable. We must enhance efforts to restructure the\nworld trade and financial systems to make them more\ndemocratic and open, giving developing countries a\nbetter chance.\nDespite the considerable efforts by the United\nNations to achieve the goals set out in the Millennium\nDeclaration, there is still a long way to go to meet\ncommon needs and expectations. Today, global\nproblems increasingly affect human security and\nsurvival. The SARS outbreak and AIDS were examples\nof how devastating such problems can be.\nWe must be resolute in solving global problems,\nespecially those related to development, poverty\neradication and disease prevention. Priority should be\ngiven to building cooperative frameworks based on\nreliable partnerships, mutual respect, shared responsibility\nand the serious undertaking of commitments. Practical\nand effective measures must be taken to pursue the United\nNations Millennium Development Goals and the\ncommitments made at various international\nconferences. In that regard, we welcome the efforts of\nthe Secretary-General to elaborate a road map for the\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals.\nWe also call upon developed countries to better fulfil\nthe commitment of allocating 0.7 per cent of gross\nnational product to official development assistance.\nMultilateralism is crucial to resolving global\nissues. The United Nations, the universal Organization,\ncontinues to play an important role in the fields of\npeace and development and in building healthy\ninternational relations; to meet the confidence and\nexpectations of nations, it must do so more effectively\nand practically. That requires a stronger and more\ndemocratic United Nations and Security Council,\nensuring the better representation of the developing\ncountries and those able to make a positive\ncontribution to common objectives. I wish to reaffirm\nViet Nam\u2019s support for Japan, Germany, India and\nother capable members from various continents being\namong the future permanent members of a reformed\nSecurity Council.\nFollowing the events of 11 September 2001, the\nworld has made great efforts to combat terrorism. The\nmessage is very clear: terrorism must be condemned\nand eliminated from human civilization. As this\ncommon fight may be long and arduous, we need to\ncooperate on the basis of the principles of the United\nNations Charter, as well as to join in an endeavour to\nsolve, inter alia, the problems of poverty, injustice and\noppression, which give rise to terrorism.\nViet Nam supports international efforts aimed at\ndisarmament and at the peaceful resolution of conflicts\non the basis of respect for the sovereignty and\nlegitimate interests of the parties concerned. We call\nfor an end to embargoes and sanctions imposed against\nother countries, especially the unilateral embargo\nagainst Cuba that for many decades has caused its\npeople to endure untold suffering.\nPeace, security and reconstruction are now the\nmost urgent tasks in Iraq. Viet Nam reaffirms its\nsupport for Iraq\u2019s independence and sovereignty. We\nhope that stability will soon be restored and that a\nGovernment chosen by the Iraqi people will be\nestablished at an early date so that they can focus on\nnational reconstruction and development in keeping\nwith their self-determination. The United Nations\nshould continue its worthy, active role in resolving the\nIraqi issue and in reconstructing the country. In that\nregard, Viet Nam has decided to contribute\nhumanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people.\n24\n\nViet Nam reaffirms its consistent support for the\njust cause and inalienable rights of the Palestinian\npeople. We call upon the parties concerned to exercise\nrestraint, to persevere in negotiation and to accelerate\ntheir pace on the road to a just and durable peace in the\nMiddle East that takes due account of the legitimate\ninterests of the parties. Any unilateral action can only\nworsen the already volatile situation in the region.\nViet Nam supports peaceful efforts aimed at\ndenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. We hope that\nthe negotiations initiated through the six-party talks in\nBeijing last August will lead to a satisfactory\nconclusion for the sake of peace, stability and\ndevelopment on the Peninsula, in the region and in the\nrest of the world.\nIn our region, faced with complex and rapid\ndevelopments and challenges in the international and\nregional landscape, the Association of South-East\nAsian Nations (ASEAN) has produced new initiatives\nand concrete steps to strengthen its solidarity,\nresilience and equitable development while further\nintensifying its relations with friends and partners\nabroad. At its forthcoming Summit, to be held early\nnext month in Bali, Indonesia, ASEAN will redouble\nits efforts to realize ASEAN Vision 2020, the Hanoi\nPlan of Action and the Hanoi Declaration on narrowing\nthe development gap for closer ASEAN integration.\nAs an outward-looking association, ASEAN\ncontinues to attach great importance to broadening and\ndeepening its relations with other countries. China,\nRussia and India will accede to the ASEAN Treaty of\nAmity and Cooperation in South-East Asia, thus\nmaking the Treaty the code of conduct in inter-State\nrelations. Having adopted the Declaration on the\nConduct of Parties in the South China Sea, ASEAN\nand China are embarking on a search for concrete ways\nto implement the Declaration, thus contributing to\nconfidence and cooperation in that important part of\nthe world. In the economic field, ASEAN has been\ndiscussing closer economic partnership, including a\npossible free trade agreement, with its dialogue\npartners \u2014 the United States, the European Union,\nRussia and India, to name only a few.\nViet Nam consistently pursues a foreign policy of\nnational independence, self-reliance, openness,\ndiversification and multilateralization of international\nrelations, and being a friend and reliable partner in the\ninternational community. Along those lines, Viet Nam\nhas increasingly enhanced friendly and cooperative\nrelations with other countries as well as with regional\nand international organizations. At present, we are\nactively preparing for Viet Nam\u2019s early admission to\nthe World Trade Organization. With an annual\neconomic growth rate of approximately 7 per cent, a\nfavourable and secure investment environment,\nhospitable people, beautiful landscapes and other\nrewarding discoveries, Viet Nam continues to be a\nmost attractive country for investors and tourists. Later\nthis year, we will host the South-East Asian Games, the\nlargest sports event in the region. Next will be the\nAsia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) Summit in 2004,\nfollowed by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation\n(APEC) Summit in 2006. We are confident that we will\nlive up to expectations.\nToday\u2019s challenges, both old and new, are\nbecoming global; they require measures of a more\nglobal and multilateral nature. The United Nations\ntherefore plays an important role in coordinating\ninternational efforts to effectively respond to those\nchallenges and to work for peace and development. In that\nregard, the principles of the United Nations Charter must\nbe upheld, and their actual implementation must be\nensured. For its part, Viet Nam, as a responsible Member\nState and reliable partner, will continue to contribute\nactively to that common endeavour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMay I extend\nmy heartfelt congratulations to the President for his\nunanimous election as President of the fifty-eighth\nsession of the United Nations General Assembly and\nexpress my confidence that under his able stewardship\nthis session will successfully accomplish its mission.\nFor the 58-year-old United Nations, which has\nbeen working throughout to maintain international\npeace and security, the promotion of human rights and\nfundamental freedoms and to foster development and\nprogress, the passing year has proved to be a\nchallenging period. Moreover, we feel deeply\nconcerned that the United Nations and its staff\nmembers, who dedicate their lives to helping peoples\nand countries affected by wars and armed conflicts\nhave turned into targets of terrorist acts. But it is our\nearnest belief that the noble mission of the late Special\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Sergio\nVieira de Mello, and other United Nations staff\nmembers who lost their precious lives while helping\nand assisting the people of Iraq, will not be in vain.\nAt the Millennium Summit, held at the turn of a\nnew century, world leaders reaffirmed their\ncommitment to the purposes and principles of the\nUnited Nations Charter and proclaimed their firm\nresolve to work together towards a more efficient and\nrevitalized United Nations.\nHowever, the emergence of a complex\ninternational situation and its subsequent developments\ncast into doubt the ability of the United Nations to\ndevelop a fast and adequate response to international\ncrises, to maintain international peace and security, to\nprevent armed conflicts, to resolve pressing issues in\nwar-torn countries and effectively assist them in\nbuilding national reconciliation and reconstruction.\nEven more important, the relevance of the United\nNations itself has been put into question.\nIt is therefore incumbent upon us to reaffirm\nanew, at the highest level, our shared commitment to\nimplement the Millennium Development Goals\nunanimously adopted at the Summit and to reiterate the\nimportance of enhancing the role of the United Nations\nand multilateralism in addressing the formidable\nchallenges of the twenty-first century.\nMongolia has consistently supported the United\nNations as the singular world Organization to serve the\ninterests of its Member States and as a principal\ninstrument of multilateral cooperation, given its\nunderlying purposes and principles as well as its\nuniversal representation. Mongolia stands for a\nreformed and revitalized United Nations, adapted to the\nevolving international realities, for its enhanced role\nand greater involvement in all areas pertaining to the\nmaintenance of international peace and security,\nresolution of pressing economic and social issues and\npromotion of sustainable development.\nAs its practical contribution to United Nations\npeacekeeping operations, Mongolia endeavours to\nprovide the relevant personnel to its various missions\nand supports the efforts to make peace-building\nmissions more effective with an increased emphasis on\npreventive diplomacy. While emphasizing the\nincreasing importance of ensuring the safety and\nsecurity of United Nations personnel engaged in\npeacekeeping and humanitarian missions, my\ndelegation fully endorses the additional measures\nrecently adopted by the Security Council to this effect.\nMongolia has signed the Convention on the Safety of\nUnited Nations and Associated Personnel and intends\nto ratify it in the near future.\nMy delegation shares the concern over the slow\npace of the reform process of the United Nations\ninitiated by the Secretary-General a few years ago.\nHence, we believe that there is an urgent need to speed\nup the reform through identifying innovative\napproaches so that the United Nations and its Security\nCouncil are able to effectively address the challenges\nahead.\nMongolia reiterates its support for a just and\nequitable enlargement of the Security Council by\nincreasing the number of permanent and non-\npermanent seats and ensuring representation of both\ndeveloping and developed countries, reviewing the\nveto power and democratizing working methods of the\nSecurity Council through enhancing the openness and\ntransparency of its work. We support the proposal of\nthe Secretary-General to establish a high-level panel of\neminent personalities entrusted with a mandate to\nconduct a comprehensive analysis of evolving\nchallenges and ways of strengthening the United\nNations.\nSome are portraying the contours of today's\nworld as unipolar. Others are challenging this, arguing\nfor a multi-polar world. It seems unreasonable to seek\nto command humankind and the patterns of its\n6\n\nexistence under any particular roof or leadership, or to\ntry to tear it apart into different directions.\nIn today's world, characterized by globalization\nand interdependence, it has become increasingly\nevident that, despite divergent views, we all live in one\nglobal village, breathe the same air and share a\ncommon future. Mutual understanding and cooperation\nare becoming the order of the day, rather than division,\nfragmentation, marginalization or discrimination.\nIndeed, contemporary human philosophy teaches us not\nto alienate or estrange, but, rather, to interact and align\nwith one another.\nIn addition to the traditional threats emanating\nfrom the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,\nthe spread of missile technology and inter- and- intra-\nState conflicts, non-traditional threats, including\nterrorism, organized crime, illegal drug trafficking,\nscarce drinking water, environmental pollution and\nglobal climate change, are having adverse effects on\nregional and international security.\nAs a State party to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), conventions\nbanning chemical and biological weapons and the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, Mongolia\ndeems it important to ensure their universality; to\naddress disarmament issues in a comprehensive\nmanner; to further reduce all types of weapons; to help\nthe Conference on Disarmament to break through its\nongoing impasse; and to strengthen monitoring\nmechanisms for the relevant multilateral treaties and\nagreements.\nAs a nuclear-weapon-free country, Mongolia\nactively supports the establishment of nuclear-weapon-\nfree zones in other parts of the world. Mongolia\nbelieves that the nuclear-weapon States should provide\nsecurity guarantees to non-nuclear-weapon States and\nStates parties to the NPT, and supports the conclusion\nof a multilateral treaty to that effect.\nMongolia is in favour of a nuclear-free Korean\npeninsula and of a peaceful resolution of the\nDemocratic People's Republic of Korea's nuclear\nprogramme issue. In this regard, we are in favour of\ncontinuing the relevant multilateral talks.\nMongolia fully supports the efforts being\nundertaken by the international community to revive\nthe Middle East peace process and to implement the\nroad map, and supports the establishment of a just and\ndurable peace in the region, on the basis of ensuring\nthe legitimate interests of the parties concerned.\nMongolia shares the concern of other nations over\nthe precarious situation and continued loss of life in\nIraq despite the termination of major combat\noperations. Mongolia is in favour of an increased role\nand involvement of the United Nations in restoring\npeace and stability in Iraq and in providing\nhumanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people.\nWith the rapid advance of globalization and\ntechnological breakthroughs, we deem it important to\ncreate an enabling environment for all countries  \nespecially weak, small or vulnerable economies  \nequally to benefit from globalization, and for the\ninternational community to offer support and assistance\nto those countries in their social and economic\ndevelopment and to enhance global partnerships for\ndevelopment.\nRecent years have been marked by an increased\nemphasis on social and development issues, resulting\nin a host of international conferences on sustainable\ndevelopment, financing for development and food\nsecurity, all organized under the auspices of the United\nNations. The speedy implementation, at the national,\nregional and international levels, of the decisions taken\nat the social summits, as well as efforts to achieve the\ngoals agreed by the Millennium Summit and at\nMonterrey, Johannesburg and Rome, have become the\ntop priority of the world community. The recent\nCancun Ministerial Conference of the World Trade\nOrganization has revealed the complexity of the\nprocess, leading to a new round of talks on the Doha\nDevelopment Agenda.\nGrowing development disparities between haves\nand have-nots; increasing poverty and unemployment\nin the developing world, in particular the least\ndeveloped countries; the spread of HIV/AIDS; the debt\nburden and trade inequalities, and the further\naggravation of such pressing issues remain our\nimmediate cause of concern. We cannot ignore the fact\nthat underdevelopment, poverty and social inequality\ncould serve as a breeding ground for confrontations\nand armed conflicts. Hence, it has become imperative\nfor the international community to display genuine\nsolidarity and shared responsibility for our common\ngood.\nInternational cooperation is crucial in effectively\naddressing environmental challenges, including natural\n7\n\ndisasters, global climate change, air and water\npollution, and desertification. In this respect, small and\npoor nations warrant greater attention and support.\nMongolia commends the outcome of the first\nInternational Ministerial Conference of Landlocked\nand Transit Developing Countries and Donor Countries\nand International Financial and Development\nInstitutions on Transit Transport Cooperation, held in\nAlmaty, Kazakhstan, in August this year, under the\nauspices of the United Nations. We consider that the\ntimely and expeditious implementation of the Almaty\nPlan of Action will help landlocked developing\ncountries to become actively engaged in global\neconomic integration.\nFifty-five years have elapsed since the adoption\nby the Assembly of the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights. The relevance of this fundamental\ndocument has stood the test of time, as its underlying\nideals have been enshrined in both international treaties\nand conventions and in national legislation, thus\nbecoming the universal norms of humankind. The ideas\ncontained in the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights have been carefully integrated into Mongolia's\n1992 Constitution, and my country is firmly pursuing\npolicies to consolidate democracy and to protect and\npromote human rights and fundamental freedoms.\nThirteen years ago, Mongolia irreversibly\nembarked on the road to democracy and has\nendeavoured to make its own contribution to the cause\nof promoting democratic ideals. Earlier this month\nMongolia hosted the Fifth International Conference of\nNew or Restored Democracies, which resulted in the\nadoption of the Ulaanbaatar Declaration and Plan of\nAction. More than 600 representatives from 119\ncountries and a host of international and non-\ngovernmental organizations participated in the\nConference, thoroughly discussing and sharing their\nexperiences on a wide range of issues under the main\ntheme of Democracy, Good Governance and Civil\nSociety'. It is gratifying to note that the Conference\nsuccessfully completed its ambitious agenda. My\ndelegation will actively collaborate with others in\nensuring effective follow-up to the implementation of\nthe Ulaanbaatar Declaration and the Plan of Action at\nthe national, regional and international levels.\nThe State and Government of Mongolia are\npursuing an open and multifaceted foreign policy and\nundertaking specific measures to consolidate the\ndemocratic reforms with a view to ensuring human-\ncentred development and human security, promoting\nand protecting human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms, fostering political and economic stability\nand achieving sustained economic growth.\nIn conclusion, may I express my confidence that\ndeliberations on the pressing issues before the\ninternational community during this session of the\nGeneral Assembly will be productive and result in\nsound decisions that contribute to the strengthening of\ninternational peace and security and the advancement\nof social progress and development. In this context,\nyou may rest assured, Sir, of the continued support and\nfull cooperation of my delegation.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow\nme, Sir, on behalf of the Sultanate of Oman, to\ncongratulate you on your election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at this session. We assure you of our\nreadiness to work with you and to contribute sincerely\nand successfully to the achievement of the noble goals\nwe all seek to accomplish in the service of humanity,\nand to the safety and security of the international\ncommunity. I also take this opportunity to express our\nheartfelt thanks to your predecessor, His Excellency\nMr. Jan Kavan, who presided over the previous session,\nfor his efforts to guarantee the success of the regular\nsession and the special sessions held during the past\nyear.\nLet me also acknowledge the tireless and serious\nefforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, to\npromote the leading role of the United Nations in the\nfield of international peace and security.\n6\n\nOnce again, we stress the Sultanate of Oman\u2019s\nsupport for the Organization in its endeavours to\nachieve the purposes and principles of the Charter.\nAt the outset, I should like to shed some light on\nthe measures taken by my country to develop its\nimportant institutions, particularly the judiciary. It is\nour strong belief that a fair and just judiciary forms the\nbasis for social and economic development. In our\ncontemporary history, the Sultanate of Oman has\nenabled the judiciary to become the most important\nmeans of establishing justice, issuing fair rulings and\nremoving injustices in society, without interference by\nthe Executive branch or by any other branch of\nGovernment. That development was endorsed in the\nconstitutional State system enacted by His Majesty\nSultan Qaboos Bin Said through decree 101/96, issued\non 6 November 1996.\nHis Majesty also issued decree 90/99, which\nenacted the law granting full independence to the\njudiciary, on 21 November 1999. That law regulates the\njurisdiction and the functions of courts of various\ncircuits and at various levels. Moreover, the Supreme\nCourt was established at the top of the judicial\npyramid, with competence to standardize legal\nprinciples and to address faulty rulings. That was\nfollowed by a series of laws organizing various judicial\norgans, including a law establishing the higher judicial\nsystem. Additionally, a draft law on civil and trade\nprocedures has been elaborated.\nAll of the aforementioned demonstrates His\nMajesty\u2019s interest in guaranteeing the well-being of the\nOmani citizen and in ensuring that all citizens are\nfamiliar with their rights and obligations, which are\nguaranteed through the right to due process.\nIn the spirit of continued development and\nbroadened participation by the Omani people in our\nsocial and economic development programmes, my\ncountry \u2014 since the dawn of the blessed renaissance\nthat began in 1970 at the initiative of His Majesty\nSultan Qaboos Bin Said and that has continued\nthroughout the past 33 years \u2014 has adopted an\napproach utilizing the experience and expertise of\nOmani citizens in the Majlis al-Shura, or Consultative\nCouncil, which includes positive aspects of our cultural\nheritage in the modern development of the Sultanate.\nOur Consultative Council process has witnessed a\nqualitative shift and an important transformation in our\nmodern history. His Majesty Sultan Qaboos Bin Said\nissued royal instructions in October 2002 expanding\nthe base of popular participation in elections for the\nOmani Consultative Council by granting every citizen,\nmale or female, over the age of 21, the right to vote and\nto participate in the next election \u2014 scheduled for\n4 October \u2014 to select the 83 members of the\nConsultative Council for its fifth session, from 2004 to\n2006. That step complements previous steps aimed at\ndeveloping the Consultative Council. Those important\ndevelopments in the Sultanate of Oman will create a\nstrong foundation for more development and\nadvancement programmes to benefit the Omani people.\nWe have followed recent developments in\nPalestine with grave concern. The Palestinian National\nAuthority responded positively to the international\ncommunity\u2019s demands by accepting the road map \u2014\nconsidered the most important document in the history\nof the Arab-Israeli conflict \u2014 which embodies the\ninternational commitment to establishing an\nindependent, sovereign Palestinian State alongside the\nState of Israel. Nevertheless, the cycle of violence\nbetween the Palestinians and the Israeli Government\ncontinues unabated, which may doom the entire peace\nprocess, plunging it into a dark abyss from which it\ncould be very difficult to rescue it. Therefore, the\nQuartet \u2014 sponsor of the road map \u2014 must shoulder\nits international responsibilities in that regard.\nOne might well wonder how peace can be\nachieved between the Palestinian and Israeli peoples\nwhen the Israeli Government has decided in principle\nto expel President Yasser Arafat, Chairman of the\nPalestinian Authority and elected leader of the\nPalestinian people. One might also ask whether the\nGovernment of Israel, a Member State of the United\nNations, is honouring its commitments under the\nCharter. The United Nations must intervene to put an\nend to that Israeli policy. Israel must respond to the\ninternational community\u2019s demands and must comply\nwith international resolutions. It must respond\npositively to international efforts aimed at\nimplementation of the road map, which provides both\nparties with international guarantees aimed at\nachieving peace based on the establishment of an\nindependent, sovereign Palestinian State on all\nPalestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967.\nSuch a solution would give the States in the region a\nhistoric opportunity to build a new Middle East. In that\nconnection, we must warn that failure to commit to the\nestablishment of a Palestinian State in conformity with\n7\n\nthe road map would create a crisis with catastrophic\nresults.\nMy country shares with many other Member\nStates the view that peace in the Middle East region\nwill not be true and lasting unless our approach is just\nand comprehensive. In that connection, the Sultanate of\nOman reaffirms its support for Lebanon\u2019s right to\nrestore the remaining Sheba\u2019a farms and the Syrian\nArab Republic\u2019s right to recover the Syrian Golan,\noccupied on 4 June 1967.\nThe war against Iraq in the first half of this year\nwas only one link in the chain of wars that have been\nendured by the Middle East region. That war created a\nnew reality, characterized mainly by the collapse of the\nformer regime, the creation of a huge political and\nsecurity vacuum and deterioration in basic services for\nIraqi society. The continued lack of security in Iraq and\nthe resulting loss of lives \u2014 in addition to the\ndestruction of the United Nations Office and the\nescalation in assassinations \u2014 certainly do not help\nIraq in this phase of re-establishing the Government\nand rebuilding the country.\nPrompted by our concern about the situation in\nIraq, we believe that efforts are needed to enable the\nIraqis to assume full responsibility for managing their\ncountry. Iraq has an abundance of national experts in\nevery field. These qualified Iraqi cadres are capable of\nleading the process of restoring security and of\nrebuilding and fully developing their country. Iraq also\npossesses enormous economic and human resources\nthat could help it to regain its strength and to play its\nregional and international roles. Undoubtedly, an active\nrole for the United Nations and its specialized agencies\nwill help us to attain our common objective: unity and\nterritorial integrity for Iraq and prosperity and security\nfor all its people.\nCommitted to Iraq\u2019s sovereignty, territorial\nintegrity and unity, we welcomed the formation of the\ntransitional Governing Council. We believe it essential\nto deal with that political institution so that we begin to\nbuild the right foundations for post-war Iraq \u2014\nincluding the provision of basic services and the\ncreation of a political climate conducive to the\nestablishment of a stable political system that will\nrespond to the Iraqi people\u2019s wishes \u2014 as a prelude to\nbeginning the reconstruction phase.\nStability and the consolidation of security are\nrequirements of all peoples throughout the world. We\nin the Sultanate of Oman \u2014 like all other countries in\nthe Middle East \u2014 have been following with interest\nand optimism the official contacts taking place in\nvarious conflict areas. We hope that the contacts and\ndiscussions between the United Arab Emirates and the\nIslamic Republic of Iran concerning the islands\nbelonging to the United Arab Emirates will enable the\ntwo countries to arrive at an effective mechanism to\nsettle their dispute. In addition, we appreciate the\ninitiatives by India and Pakistan aimed at starting a\ndialogue between them. Moreover, my country hopes\nthat the two Koreas and other concerned parties will be\nable to reach an agreement that addresses the various\noutstanding issues through constructive dialogue and\nadherence to international conventions and resolutions.\nWe hope that that part of the world will ultimately\nachieve peace and coexistence.\nWe also pay tribute to the peaceful efforts to\nsolve the conflicts in Africa, and call on the\ninternational community to assist in developing a fair\nsystem to improve economic conditions and a\nmechanism to relieve the onerous burden of debt on\nAfrican countries.\nInternational policies have in recent years led to\nthe emergence of various types of terrorist acts. All of\nus must pause and deeply focus on this phenomenon,\nwhich targets people\u2019s security and safety. We believe\nthat it has become essential to study in a\ncomprehensive and cooperative manner the root causes\nunderlying this phenomenon. Although we fully\nsupport international efforts to combat terrorism by all\navailable means, we must allocate part of the massive\nfinancial resources devoted to combating terrorism to\nhelp the least developed countries that may be fertile\nground for terrorist activities.\nThere is no doubt that United Nations efforts in\nthe field of disarmament are leading nowhere. They\nwill remain an exercise in futility so long as Member\nStates cannot count on an effective system of collective\nsecurity safeguards. Without such a system,\nresponsibility for assessments of the level and quality\nof weapons needed will be subjective and fall solely to\nindividual Governments. This would open the door\nwide to further arms races, and hinder progress towards\ndisarmament or the reduction of armaments.\nWhile supporting the efforts to limit armaments,\nthe Sultanate of Oman affirms the need to take\npractical measures in accordance with the International\n8\n\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) regime of mutual\nguarantees. My country signed a safeguards agreement\nwith the IAEA on 28 June 2001 at the headquarters of\nthe Agency in Vienna.\nMy country also believes that it is essential to\npromote cooperation between States to reduce the\nillegal trafficking of small arms and light weapons,\nwhich are the reason for most of the conflicts in the\nworld. My country notes the efforts made by the United\nNations to achieve the elimination of all lethal weapons\nfrom every corner of the earth and from outer space.\nMy country supports all these efforts and underlines\nthe responsibility of the international Organization for\nestablishing a world order that is more capable of\nguaranteeing security for all States in a manner that\nreflects the reality of life in the third millennium. It\nshould be consistent with partnership and with\nresponsibilities, which are essential for the success of\nall efforts.\nThis session is being convened at a time of\ncontinuous and intertwined development at the world\neconomic, financial and trade levels. Many economies\nstill suffer from economic stagnation and recession.\nThe Sultanate of Oman appreciates the continued\nefforts of the International Bank, the International\nMonetary Fund and the World Trade Organization\n(WTO) to achieve complementarity in their work so\nthat they may confront the challenges that the countries\nof the world are now facing. These challenges include\neconomic growth, sustainable development, poverty\nreduction and financial stability and balance.\nSince its accession to the World Trade\nOrganization in October 2000, the Sultanate of Oman\nhas taken great strides towards implementing its\ncommitments to the Organization. The Sultanate has\nintroduced many amendments and improvements to its\nsystems, organizations and laws, and has enacted new\nlegislation in conformity with the requirements of the\nWorld Trade Organization.\nMy country has also been following with great\ninterest the ongoing negotiations in the framework of\nthe World Trade Organization with a view to\novercoming the obstacles and difficulties impeding its\nwork. Here, we must point an important difference\nbetween developing countries and developed countries,\nin that the latter control the World Intellectual Property\nOrganization agreements and other conventions. Such\nagreements should not be misused by multinational\ncorporations in a manner that adds to the burdens of the\nleast developed countries in the fields of\npharmaceuticals, foodstuffs and technology transfer,\nwhich would only exacerbate the obstacles to trade\nliberalization that the World Trade Organization is\ntrying to overcome. Although the WTO Council of\nMinisters issued a separate statement on safeguards for\npatented drugs, aimed at helping developing countries\nto combat serious and contagious diseases, such a step\nmay not sufficiently protect least developed countries\nfrom being forced to bear excessive costs.\nThe Sultanate of Oman has worked hard at the\nregional level with its brothers and friends and through\nregional economic groupings, to enhance the climate\nfor the liberalization of trade and the economy. In the\nframework of the Gulf Cooperation Council, the\nSultanate participated in the establishment of the Gulf\nCustoms Union at the beginning of this year. In the\nframework of the Arab League, we have also pushed\nforward the deadline for the establishment of a free-\ntrade zone among the Arab States parties to the trade\nzone agreement to the beginning of January 2005 when\nfull liberalization is expected to occur, opening the\ndoor to the free trade of Arab products and paving the\nway to an Arab common market.\nAt the local level, my country has continued its\nefforts to enhance the role of the private sector in the\nnational economy, based on the market economy and\nfree competition and a favourable economic and trade\nclimate that aims at the achievement of a true\ninvestment and trade partnership with all countries of\nthe world, in the hope that conditions will be conducive\nto linking the economy of Oman to the world economy.\nRecognizing that the protection of the\nenvironment and its resources is a collective\nresponsibility, my country\u2019s Government has been\nactive in stimulating the role of Omani society and its\neffective contribution to this cause. Here, we to\nreaffirm our commitment to the basic principles\nadopted at the two earth summits, in Rio de Janeiro, in\n1992, and in South Africa, in 2002. We believe that\nthese principles constitute a scientific framework that\nwill guarantee our world partnership and help us to\nshoulder our collective responsibility for the protection\nof the environment and its natural resources in the\nservice of sustainable development.\n9\n\nWe would like to express our gratitude and\nappreciation for the efforts and endeavours of the\nSecretary-General as reflected in his annual report, in\nwhich he details the achievements of the United\nNations, as well as and the obstacles it faces, and sets\nout the strategies for the future for this Organization,\nwhich embodies the conscience and aspirations of the\nworld. We support the proposals in the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s report on developing and restructuring the\norgans of the United Nations to enable the\nOrganization to reflect current political reality.\nThe United Nations should remain a true\ncornerstone of world policy and the main source of\ninternational legitimacy, so that countries may appeal\nto it for the prevention of wars and conflict. This is\nonly possible through the effective pursuit of\npreventive diplomacy, the peaceful settlement of\ndisputes and the maintenance of peace, enhancing\nworld cooperation and dialogue among civilizations.\nThis involves working towards resolving the problems\nof poverty and disease, protecting the environment,\ncombating terrorism and bridging the gap between the\nrich countries of the North and the poor countries of\nthe South.\nRelations between the United Nations and\nregional organizations in the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security should be strengthened\nthrough the enhancement of weak regional structures to\nenable them to archive collective security in a world\ngoverned by technology and great population increases.\nWe believe that the United Nations represents\ninternational legitimacy. It is the crucible in which all\nregional and international efforts meld to realize the\nhopes and aspirations of our peoples and to confront\nthe real challenges to peace, security and development\nin all their aspects. This can enhance relations and\nstability and spread a culture of peace and constructive\ndialogue among present and future generations to\ncounter the logic of the threat of force or apprehensions\nabout the future.\nWe hope that this session will be a success so that\nit may chart a vision for the future that points to ways\nto serve humanity and renew the Member States\u2019 trust\nin the Organization, total commitment to the\nimplementation of its resolutions and respect for the\nprovisions of the Charter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffTo\nbegin, I would sincerely like to congratulate you on\nyour election to this very important and difficult\nposition as President of the Assembly and I wish you\nevery success.\nThis year, the United Nations has come close to\nthe most dangerous brink in its more than a half-\ncentury of history. This is not only and not so much the\nIraqi crisis per se. That crisis has become but a\nmanifestation of what has really threatened the entire\nsystem of world order created after World War II. The\nbasis of this world order is the unconditional primacy\nof international law over the aspirations of individual\nStates.\nTake that away, and the world will again, as in\ncenturies past, become hostage to the power of the\nmighty. This will not merely throw us backward. The\nbeginning of the twenty-first century differs from past\ndecades and centuries in that the existence of a single\nglobal super-Power will make the rule of the mighty\nglobal in both scale and consequence.\n\u201cWe all have to recognize \u2014 no matter how\ngreat our strength \u2014 that we must deny ourselves\nthe license to do always as we please. ... Unless\nwe are all willing to pay that price, no\norganization for world peace can accomplish its\npurpose\u201d.\nThese words, spoken by United States President Harry\nTruman, are as urgent today as they were back in 1945.\nWe call upon everyone to be guided by them today as\nthey were when our Organization was being set up.\nBelarus\u2019 contribution to the creation of the United\nNations and a new system of international security was\none-third of our population, who gave their lives for\nthe victory of peace over war and the victory of the\ncoalition of the future over the coalition of the past.\nThat is exactly why we in Belarus today sense with\nspecial urgency the danger of the erosion of a just and\nstable world order.\nLet us preserve the coalition of the entire world\nfor global peace. Let us not allow the Security Council,\nas the main body for maintaining peace and security, to\nbe replaced by \u201ccoalitions of the willing\u201d that use force\nwithout Council authorization. Let us not forget that\nonly a just peace can prove to be a stable peace.\nBelarus welcomes the emerging effort to return to\nthe United Nations its legitimate role in settling the\nIraq issue. This reflects the recognition that a military\nforce or an occupying force cannot solve the problem\nof nation-building. We hope that this will also become\nrecognition of the fact that a preventive war makes a\npoor foundation for security.\nWe hope that a new Security Council resolution\non Iraq being worked out now will strengthen the\ncentral role of the United Nations in the earliest and\nurgent return to the people of Iraq of its sovereignty, its\nright to independently determine its political future and\nits right to natural resources, so that constitutional\nprocesses and later election processes can be\nimplemented by Iraqis in the interest of Iraqis.\nAt the same time, Belarus is worried by the\npattern that is dangerous both for the future of the\nUnited Nations and for international peace and is\ntaking shape on the most urgent issues: the Security\nCouncil and the United Nations are ignored when\n9\n\nunauthorized military action is taken, and are then\ninvited back only in the aftermath, when their\nauthority, experience and resources are seen as\nessential for rebuilding a peaceful life. That is what\nhappened in Kosovo and what is happening in Iraq\ntoday.\nBelarus believes in the United Nations. We\nbelieve that it has a central role to play in the most\nurgent issues of today and that it cannot be replaced.\nWe believe in the constant values and justice of the\nsupremacy of international law and the fundamental\nprinciples of its Charter. New global challenges and\nthreats merely reaffirm that these values are\nindispensable.\nAs a founding Member of the United Nations,\nBelarus sees the need to modernize and adapt the\nUnited Nations mechanisms and structures to the\nrealities of this new century.\nOf special importance is the reform of the United\nNations Security Council. As has been correctly noted\nby the Secretary-General, it is not only a question of\nenlarging the Council\u2019s membership. Life itself has put\non the agenda of the reform process many other\naspects, including the Council\u2019s capacity to react to\nthreats to peace and security.\nIt is essential to achieve a reasonable balance in\nthe interrelationship between the main United Nations\nbodies, inherent in its Charter. A stronger role of the\nGeneral Assembly is an important direction for\nincreasing the Organization\u2019s efficiency.\nThe potential of the presidency of the General\nAssembly is underused. As an officer elected by the\nentire United Nations, the President of the General\nAssembly can and should be called upon to serve as a\ncatalyst and organizer in searching for solutions to the\nproblems the world and the Organization are facing.\nIt is necessary to reform and improve the\nactivities of the Economic and Social Council as the\ncoordinator of United Nations efforts in economic,\nsocial and related areas. Having accumulated\nconsiderable experience working in the Bureau of the\nCouncil, the Republic of Belarus is ready to make a\nconstructive contribution to these efforts. Those were\nexactly the considerations that guided Belarus when it\nproposed its candidature to Council membership for\n2004-2006.\nThe United Nations should pay priority attention\nto developing international law: new realities in\ninternational politics as well as new universal world\nproblems have to be taken into consideration. Belarus\nis a party to all key multilateral treaties regulating\nvarious spheres of international life. This year we have\nacceded to a further number of such treaties, including\nthe United Nations Convention against Transnational\nOrganized Crime and its protocols.\nThe international fight against terrorism that\nunfolded after the tragic events of 11 September 2001\nrightly placed the United Nations in the centre of\nantiterrorist efforts. The work of the Security Council\u2019s\nCounter-Terrorism Committee has helped in the\nforming of a global coalition under the aegis of the\nUnited Nations to counter terrorism in all its forms and\nmanifestations.\nWe must, however, be realistic: force alone can\nnever eradicate the abominable phenomenon of\nterrorism, at least, not forever. Injustice, inequality and\nindifference will bring it forth again and again, just like\nthe accumulation of electricity in the atmosphere\nproduces a lightning bolt. The Secretary-General is\nright when he states that in order to maintain a\ngenuinely global coalition for fighting terrorism the\nworld must also see progress on other fronts of the\nstruggle for a humane and just world order. Herein lies\nan important challenge for the United Nations, for\npermanent members of the Security Council and for all\nMembers of the Organization.\nThe principal contribution of Belarus to the non-\nproliferation of nuclear weapons and to conventional\ndisarmament has been universally recognized. Our\nconcern is therefore all the greater with regard to the\ngradual erosion of multilateral norms in disarmament\nand the stagnation of the international bodies, above all\nthe negotiation mechanisms, in charge of international\nsecurity and disarmament.\nFrom this rostrum, we join in the appeal not to\nallow the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\nThis is a most important task. It should be noted, that\nfor many years, Belarus has initiated efforts to prevent\nthe development of new types of such weapons.\nHowever, has everything possible been done in recent\nyears, including by the most militarily powerful States,\nto strengthen the multilateral non-proliferation regime\nin all its most important aspects? Is everything being\ndone to that end today? An appropriate answer to that\n10\n\nquestion would be the ratification by all permanent\nmembers of the Security Council of the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\nThe activities of multilateral bodies in the area of\ndisarmament should be adapted to new realities. We\nproceed from the assumption that the United Nations\nshould draw up a clear-cut list of priority directions in\nensuring international security and generate\nprogrammes to overcome real threats to mankind. The\nresolutions we adopt should contain clear directives to\nexisting forums and structures in the areas of\ninternational security, arms control, non-proliferation\nand disarmament. Only with this approach will we be\nable to stop the devaluation of such notions as peace,\nsecurity and stability.\nI wish to inform delegations that Belarus has\nrecently taken another responsible step to strengthen\nthese values. While possessing the world\u2019s seventh\nlargest arsenal of anti-personnel landmines, the\nRepublic of Belarus has joined the Ottawa Convention\non their prohibition. We count on international\nassistance in their elimination.\nThe norms of international law play a principled\nrole in shaping a just international economic order. The\nobjective of providing equal access to world markets\nand to the benefits of the process of globalization for\nall States, particularly developing countries and\ncountries with economies in transition, has\nunfortunately not been achieved. That is why we urge\nMember States to pay unabated attention to the process\nof developing the norms and rules of international trade\nand commercial activities in the interests of common\nwell-being.\nAfter the recent failure of the Ministerial\nConference of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in\nCanc\u00fan, the leading economic Powers should\nunderstand the risks of delaying the negotiations within\nthe WTO both on the issue of new rules as well as on\nthe problem of new membership. One should not forget\nthat providing an opportunity to all States to use the\nbenefits of the multilateral trading system is in the\nlong-term interests of peace, security and stability.\nI wish to inform the General Assembly that, as its\ncontribution to ensuring access for developing\ncountries and least developed countries to the world\nmarket, Belarus has made a decision to extend\nunilateral trade preferences to a large number of such\nStates. Our country\u2019s National Centre of Technology\nTransfer has a high potential for innovation and is\nready for extensive cooperation with all interested\nStates. Its institutional capacities are intended to meet\nnot only our requirements, but the interests of\ndeveloping countries as well.\nLet me touch upon the problem of the\nconsequences of the largest technogenic catastrophe of\nthe twentieth century, the disaster at the Chernobyl\nnuclear power plant. We are grateful to the leadership\nof the Secretariat for its ongoing activities to mobilize\ninternational support in that direction. This year has\nbeen marked by the establishment of the International\nChernobyl Research and Information Network and of\nthe international Chernobyl Forum by the International\nAtomic Energy Agency.\nJointly with the delegations of other affected\nStates, we have prepared for this session a draft\nresolution on strengthening international cooperation\nand coordination of efforts in studying, mitigating and\nminimizing the consequences of the Chernobyl\ndisaster. The document seeks to ensure the\nimplementation of a new United Nations strategy on\nChernobyl. We hope that it will be supported by all\ndelegations.\nThe Republic of Belarus also proposes an\ninitiative to hold in Minsk in 2006 an international\nconference timed to coincide with the twentieth\nanniversary of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear\npower plant. The main objectives of the conference\nwill be the search for ways to provide normal living\nconditions to people living in affected areas and an\nexchange of experiences in solving the problems of\nsustainable development in those regions. We invite all\ninterested Member States and international\norganizations to take part in preparing and holding this\nevent.\nIn the area of counteracting international crime,\nthe fight against human trafficking and illegal drug\ntrafficking should become one of the United Nations\npriorities. Our country has been actively participating\nin international efforts to stop the modern slave and\ndrug trades. Located at the crossroads of the most\nimportant transportation corridors between Asia and\nEurope, Belarus offers efficient interaction in solving\nthese problems with all our neighbours and, especially,\nwith the European Union. Common efforts are needed\nto fight common problems; that way, everybody wins.\n\n\nThe global scope of problems demands a global\nscale of interaction involving all States without\nexception. Mankind made itself the master of the world\nafter having become homo sapiens \u2014 sentient man. In\norder to become the master of its destiny, and not a\nhostage to challenges and threats, humanity should\nbecome humanitas sapiens \u2014 sentient humanity."

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe past two years have been\nyears of near apocalyptic ordeal for the world and this\ngreat Organization. In rapid succession, the world and\nthis Organization have been caught in what can only be\ndescribed as a crossfire of terrorism, violence and wars.\nThe uncertainties resulting from these situations are yet\nto be dispelled. Much of the world is still in the dark,\ngroping for a glimpse of what the future direction of\ninternational relations and this Organization will be.\nThe recent unwarranted attacks against the United\nNations headquarters and personnel in Baghdad, Iraq,\nshould be roundly condemned. They should not break\nthe will of this Organization to continue to provide\nhumanitarian assistance and relief to the people of Iraq.\nWe in Ghana still believe in the United Nations as\nthe global repository of humankind\u2019s aspiration. We\nbelieve that the problems of the twenty-first century\ncannot be addressed without universal commitment to\nmultilateralism spearheaded by the United Nations. We\nrecommend, however, that fairness, firmness, humanity\nand a sense of balance must characterize United\nNations responses to all events of a similar nature,\nirrespective of where such events occur, if this\nOrganization is to enhance its credibility and ensure its\nrelevance in a sustained manner.\nLiving in the West African subregion, which has\nexperienced more than its fair share of conflicts, my\ncountrymen are familiar with the negative effects of\nconflicts, and the pain of insecurity. They also know\nthe importance of multilateral efforts in conflict\nmanagement. Hence, for more than 40 years, Ghana\nhas demonstrated commitment to international conflict\nprevention and resolution and peacekeeping missions\naround the world, under the auspices of the United\nNations, and now the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States (ECOWAS). The latest is the country\u2019s\nparticipation in the ECOWAS Peace Force\n(ECOFORCE), in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Liberia.\nAfrica accepts its responsibility for resolving the\ncontinent\u2019s internal conflicts. Today, there is no doubt\nthat the nations of Africa are rising to this challenge.\nBut there is also no doubt that the continent suffers\nmassive shortcomings in financing and technological\nresources. This is why the international community,\nespecially the United Nations, under its Charter\nobligations, must continue to support Africa in its\nefforts to maintain peace. It is therefore hoped that\nSecurity Council consideration of Africa\u2019s conflicts\nwill yield adequate, practical and timely support to\nresolve them.\nIn my current capacity as Chairman of ECOWAS,\nI wish to acknowledge the valuable support of the\nvarious Governments as well as international\norganizations, which have contributed to the efforts of\nthe Community to achieve peace and stabilize the\nsubregion. With this help, the Community is\nsucceeding in resolving conflicts that have engulfed\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone and other nations.\nAll of them are now, thankfully, on the way to stability\nand normality. I therefore seize this opportunity to\nexpress the appreciation of the Community and myself\nto France, the United Kingdom and the United States of\nAmerica, as well as the European Union and the United\nNations, under the leadership of the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, to name just a few of those who have\nprovided substantial assistance.\nWhile ECOWAS fully appreciates the support of\nour friends, it must nevertheless appeal for some more\nresources from this Organization and the international\ncommunity to enable it to consolidate the peace and\nnormalization process. It might be necessary to stress\nthat, in some instances within the subregion, post-\nconflict peace-building efforts have failed, mainly\nbecause the problems involved were not addressed in a\nsystematic, sustained and holistic manner. In the main,\nsuch problems include the disarmament,\ndemobilization and reintegration of combatants into\nregular society. ECOWAS therefore appeals for the\nassistance needed for their effective management.\nYet another serious continuing menace is the\nprevalent illicit trade in small arms and light weapons\nin the subregion. In this regard, we note the\ncommendable progress made by the international\ncommunity in addressing this menace through the\nUnited Nations Programme of Action to Prevent,\nCombat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms\nand Light Weapons. The truth, however, is that more\nvigorous and resourceful effort is needed to succeed.\nThe Human Development Report 2003 exposes\nthe tragedy that besets sub-Saharan Africa, and this is\nthe most suitable platform to highlight it. The report\nstates that the rest of the world has left sub-Saharan\nAfrica behind, and that it will take 150 years for our\nregion to achieve the Millennium Development Goals\nthat Member States of this Organization had hoped to\nachieve by 2015. The report indicates that: \u201cUnless\n\n\nthings improve, it would take sub-Saharan Africa until\n2129 to achieve universal primary education, until\n2147\u201d \u2014 more than a century later than hoped \u2014 \u201cto\nhalve extreme poverty, and until 2165 to cut child\nmortality by two thirds. For hunger, no date can be set\nbecause the region\u2019s situation continues to worsen.\u201d\nThis is the century of the global village. How can\nsub-Saharan Africa, with more than 400 million\npeople, be condemned to such a fate? Clearly, this must\nnot be acceptable for the globalization process. This is\nwhy the international community, particularly the\nindustrialized nations, should appreciate the urgency of\nthe situation and offer commensurate partnership and\nassistance to the African Union and its initiative, the\nNew Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD),\nto relaunch the continent\u2019s development.\nThe current leadership of the continent has\nresolved to nurture Africa back to prosperity within the\nframework of the NEPAD. Good governance \u2014\ncharacterized by democratic constitutional rule; the\nrule of law; respect for human rights and property\nrights; accountable government and its recognition and\nintercourse with civil organizations; freedom of\nexpression; private-sector promotion; religious\ntolerance; eradication of illiteracy; and promotion of\ngender balance and children\u2019s rights \u2014 is fast\nbecoming the order of the day throughout Africa.\nIndeed, good governance is an article of faith of the\nAfrican Union today.\nEconomically, the African Union is calling for\npartnerships, both within and outside the continent, to\npool capital, technological and managerial ideas, and\nalso markets, to promote and fast track the\ndevelopment of Africa into the mainstream of the\nglobal market.\nAt this stage, may I be permitted to express some\nreservations on the topical issue of world trade? It must\nbe recognized that even as globalization is engulfing all\nthe corners of the world, in such a manner that no part\ncan opt out, free trade and competition, which are the\nhallmarks of the global market, can prove inimical and\ndisastrous to most nations, particularly the developing\nand least developed countries. This will be so unless\nthe process of globalization is properly and sensitively\nmanaged.\nThe reality of the situation is that most of the\nleast developed countries are in Africa, especially sub-\nSaharan Africa. At the current stage of development,\nmost of Africa is limited to exporting raw minerals and\nagricultural commodities. This means that unless the\ndeveloped parts of the world remove subsidies for their\nagricultural and mineral sectors, Africa cannot be\ncompetitive. Indeed, Africa\u2019s equivalent sectors may be\ndestroyed with dumping from the advanced parts of the\nworld. It is also being seriously suggested that, even as\nthe World Trade Organization (WTO) recognizes that\nAfrica must be accorded a status of transition, or a\nspecial status for a carefully calculated period, the\nWTO does not seem to be propagating this necessity\nenough to give practical effect to it. The failure of\nCanc\u00fan bears witness to this. The World Trade\nOrganization must, therefore, do its homework well to\ncarry the poor nations with it. A combination of trade\nand aid must be used to assist the African Union and its\ncomponent nations and to nurture their economies into\ncompetitive resourcefulness. This is the way to\nempower Africa and get it into the mainstream of the\nworld market, without adding to the hardships of the\nalready marginalized people of the continent.\nThis being a session devoted to the consideration\nof the biennial budget for 2004-2005, we hope that all\nMember States will work together positively to ensure\nthat adequate funding is provided for all prioritized\nmandates for implementation, including those for the\ndevelopment and stability of Africa. In this regard, we\nwelcome the recent establishment of the Office of the\nSpecial Adviser on Africa to the Secretary-General,\nand look forward to the positive contribution which the\nOffice will make to meet the numerous challenges on\nthe continent.\nMy delegation is happy with the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s renewed efforts to reform aspects of this\nOrganization\u2019s operations and appreciates his challenge\nto Member States to make a bold effort towards this\nend. In this regard, we assure him of our full support\nduring this session for the adoption and implementation\nof his renewed vision, and we endorse his report\nentitled \u201cStrengthening the United Nations: an agenda\nfor further change\u201d (A/57/387 and Corr.1).\nWe also wish to reiterate the imperative need for\nthe Security Council to be reformed, in order to ensure\nthat it carries out its Charter obligations more\neffectively in the full confidence of Member States. In\nthis regard, we subscribe wholly to the Non-Aligned\nMovement\u2019s position on the question of an increase in\nthe membership of the Security Council. We also\n12\n\nendorse Africa\u2019s claim to have at least two permanent\nseats.\nWe sincerely hope that the Organization will be\nempowered to assume a central role in the current\nefforts to normalize the situation in the Middle East,\nespecially in Iraq and Palestine. The strengthening of\nthe Organization to provide this leadership will\nreinvigorate it to survive this century and promote the\ncause of peace and security in the world.\nLet me conclude by thanking your predecessor\nfor having ably guided the deliberations of the General\nAssembly through what was by all accounts a\nparticularly difficult year. We are also happy to see you\nin the Presidency. We are confident that the General\nAssembly could not be in more competent hands and\nwe wish you well.\nI thank you and may God bless us all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Let me also pay tribute\nto President Jan Kavan of the Czech Republic for his\neffective guidance during the fifty-seventh session.\nUnprecedented events since we met last year have\ntested the very foundation of our Organization. There is\ntherefore great urgency for our membership to declare\nanew our faith in the purposes and principles of the\nUnited Nations. We need to assert, both in commitment\nand in action, our support for fundamental human\nrights and the peaceful coexistence of nations.\nThe range of challenges that now confront the\ninternational community in our globalized and\ninterdependent world require that nations be united in\ncommon endeavour. Only through cooperation and\nmultilateral joint effort can we hope effectively to\nguarantee human rights and achieve peace and security,\nand social and economic justice, for all. Samoa\ntherefore believes that the United Nations remains\nuniquely suited to the pursuit and coordination of\nglobal initiatives to attain these objectives.\nTo this end, Samoa firmly supports ongoing\nefforts to reform and modernize the United Nations.\nSubstantive changes are required with regard to both\nthe General Assembly and Security Council, as well as\nto other bodies of the United Nations system. We\ncertainly support the expansion of the permanent\nmembership of the Security Council to include nations\nsuch as Germany and Japan.\nSamoa adds its voice to the condemnation of the\natrocious terrorist attack on United Nations offices in\nBaghdad last month, which took the lives of many\nUnited Nations personnel, including the esteemed High\nCommissioner for Human Rights, Mr. Sergio Vieira de\nMello. On behalf of my Government and of the people\nof Samoa, I reiterate our very sincere condolences to\nthe Secretary-General and the families of those who\nlost their lives or were injured in that terrible event.\nTerrorism is an offence to humanity and goes\nagainst the core values of the United Nations. Terrorist\nactivities around the world demand a continued and\nconcerted international response. States must be\ndetermined in their national and collective efforts to\ncombat terrorism in all its forms. I reaffirm the strong\nsupport of Samoa for the relevant Security Council\nresolutions against terrorism. Those resolutions provide\na clear signal of our determination to suppress terrorist\nactivities, including those related to training, international\nmovement and financing. In this area, Samoa continues\nto align its domestic policies and legislation with the\nwork of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, as well as\nto participate actively in the regional security measures\nundertaken in the Pacific region.\nWe commend Secretary-General Kofi Annan for\nhis determination and efforts for the reconstruction of\nIraq. We recognize the enormous complexities and\nobstacles of this task. But substantive commitment and\nwork must continue in providing humanitarian\nassistance, as well as in restoring law and order. We\nalso firmly believe that continued engagement in Iraq\nmust take place with the full endorsement of the\nSecurity Council. We pray for peace and security for\nIraq and hope that sovereignty will be restored to its\npeople as soon as possible.\nSamoa is most seriously concerned about the\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction   chemical,\nbiological and nuclear weapons. The determination of\nsome countries to try to bring such weapons into\nexistence   particularly nuclear weapons   is cause for\nalarm and constitutes a serious threat to international\npeace and security. The internationally agreed instruments\nto control the manufacturing, transportation and\ndeployment of weapons of mass destruction must be\nstrengthened and implemented. Above all, States parties\nmust adhere and honour their obligations to these treaties.\nSamoa joins the call for the effective disarmament and\ntotal elimination of weapons of mass destruction.\nWe are appalled at the continuing suffering of\nfamilies and communities in all parts of the world,\nespecially in the Middle East and Africa. We can only\nhope that the work to bring about stability in these\nareas will succeed and that communities will finally be\nable to live in peace.\n16\n\nAs part of its support for United Nations efforts\nto ensure peace and security, Samoa is contributing to\nthe United Nations peacekeeping mission in Timor-\nLeste. Together with members of the Pacific Islands\nForum, and under the leadership of Australia and New\nZealand, Samoa is also contributing to the Regional\nAssistance Mission to Solomon Islands, which is\nhelping that country to restore law and order and\nassisting in its economic recovery. That regional\ninitiative was endorsed at the Forum leaders' meeting\nlast month. Its implementation conforms to regional\nresponsibilities under the Charter, and recognizes the\nsovereignty of the Solomon Islands.\nSamoa warmly welcomes the full\ninstitutionalization of the International Criminal Court\nand the election of its judges and officers. The Court is\na major achievement in upholding international\nhumanitarian standards and the protection of human\nrights. In order to ensure that it fully achieves its\npurpose, however, every effort must be made to ensure\nits impartiality in bringing to justice those who commit\ngenocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The\nCourt therefore deserves to be fully supported so as to\nendow it with the strength of universality and the rule\nof law. We look forward to its service to humanity.\nSamoa reaffirms its commitment to achieving the\nMillennium Development Goals and targets pledged\nthree years ago in this very Hall. While much has been\ndone, it is clear from the Secretary-General's report\nthat more work remains to be carried out. The goals of\nhalving poverty, halting the spread of HIV/AIDS,\nproviding universal primary education and reducing\nenvironmental degradation   all by 2015   can still\nbe achieved in the 12 years that remain. In order for\nthat to happen, States must improve on the political\nmomentum of the past three years and make good on\ntheir promises.\nSamoa recently hosted the Pacific regional\nmeeting as part of the preparatory work for the\nInternational Meeting that will be held next year in\nMauritius to review the implementation of the\nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development\nof Small Island Developing States. This ongoing\npreparatory work in small island States is critical to a\ncomprehensive review.\nThe International Meeting next year will be a\nunique opportunity for the international community to\nassess progress to date and to focus attention on areas\nwhere the expected results did not materialize. More\nimportantly, it should identify remedial strategies and\nthe required resources to assist small island developing\nStates achieve sustainable development.\nWhile we accept the primary responsibility for\nachieving the goals of the Programme of Action, the\nreality is that the support of the international\ncommunity is indispensable to success. We therefore\nurge the fullest support by development partners in the\nreview process and the implementation of the outcomes\nof the Mauritius International Meeting.\nLooking to 2004 and the work of the Commission\non Sustainable Development, we believe that the\nagenda for the twelfth session is extremely important.\nThe Commission's work will incorporate preparations\nfor the International Meeting, but   very importantly\n  it will also focus on the key issues of water and\nsanitation. The significance of these issues for basic needs\nand healthy communities cannot be overemphasized.\nWe note with concern the collapse of negotiations\nat the recent World Trade Organization (WTO)\nministerial conference in Cancun earlier this month.\nCertainly from the perspective of a small island\ndeveloping country like my own, trade is both a vital and\nunavoidable component of sustainable development. We\ntherefore continue to urge that the vulnerabilities of\nsmall States be taken fully into account in the\nnegotiations, particularly with regard to special and\ndifferential treatment, implementation issues, services,\nagriculture and non-agricultural market access.\nI would like to express our appreciation to the\nSecretary-General for his steadfast and astute\nleadership, particularly during the dramatic events that\nhave tested the Organization in recent years.\nFinally, the fifty-eighth session of the General\nAssembly has a heavy and difficult agenda, and the\nPresident has the full support of Samoa in the discharge\nof his important duties.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffWe thank Jan Kavan\nfor his work, and we welcome Mr. Julian Hunte in the\ndifficult year that awaits him.\nAt the beginning of this millennium, a summit of\nthe world's leaders produced a set of development\ngoals aimed at protecting life and promoting dignity for\nall peoples. This seemed an appropriate way to begin\nthe third millennium of our modern era.\nEach year since then, however, we have been\nreminded that this millennium started very differently\nand has forced us to address profound challenges to our\nassumptions, our relationships and our way of life.\nBeginning with 11 September and continuing with the\nviolence and political crises around the world, each of\nour societies, nations and regions has been transformed\nby the intensity of these threats to our way of life and\nto our security.\nThese crises are forcing a transformation of this\nOrganization as well. Today, reform has become\nessential not just in the way we decide, act and operate,\nbut in the way we think. Reforms cannot be delayed if\nthis General Assembly and this Organization are to be\ntruly relevant as facilitators of world peace. If the\nUnited Nations is for the peaceful, prosperous and\ndemocratic development of today's world, then it must\nundergo its own democratization, so that it will have\nthe increased moral authority to direct others through\nreform and democratic transition.\nAn organization that espouses dialogue and\nnegotiation as alternatives to violence and conflict\nought to find ways through dialogue and negotiation to\narrive at a consensus on how to resolve the critical,\nuniversal issues facing us today.\nThis General Assembly has the chance to go\ndown in history, not as an undermined, inadequate but\nwell-meaning giant, but as a viable instrument of world\npeace. The Secretary-General's goals, from United\nNations budget and financing reform to reconstituting\nand enlarging the Security Council, are the building\nblocks of the relevant, responsive, comprehending,\nworld forum for international cooperation that the\nUnited Nations can be. We applaud his decision to\nempower a commission to give concrete form to the\nwishes of many.\nEach year we speak of the need for a\ncomprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East,\nnever believing that next year, the region can become\neven more volatile and explosive. We believe the\nUnited Nations and all Member States must continue to\nsupport the renewal of the full-scale peace process. In\nIsrael and Palestine, Armenia hails the Quartet's\nefforts, recognizing that the endangered road map\nremains the only viable option for peace in a long-\nsuffering region.\nThe situation in Iraq makes the debate about the\nhows and whys of this conflict irrelevant. The world's\nsmall countries are accustomed to making political\ncompromises to join the international flow. In Iraq, the\nprincipal Powers, too, must compromise so that a more\nengaged and empowered United Nations can rally a\nbroad range of countries from the immediate region, as\nwell as the rest of the world, to take on responsibility\nin bringing democracy and stability to a critical part of\nthe Middle East.\nIt is ironic and in many ways lamentable that the\nevil of terrorism is what has caused us to rally together.\nWe are fully aware that no single Government can\neffectively fight this danger alone. Unfortunately, the\nnecessity for coherent measures and cooperation at\nnational, regional and international levels is often\nstalled, as for example in our region, where a common\nthreat that knows no borders is not only being\naddressed individually and in isolation, but also\nexploited for political reasons.\nIn our region, there is much political exploitation.\nThe new Prime Minister of Azerbaijan made plain from\nthis podium yesterday that in his Government's\nelection year, they are willing, at their peril, to ignore\nthe realities which are self-evident. Nearly a decade of\nnegotiations brought us, two years ago, to Key West,\nFlorida, where, hosted by the United States\n31\n \nGovernment and under the watchful eyes of the Minsk\nGroup Co-Chairmen, the President of Armenia and  \nwhether the Prime Minister of Azerbaijan likes it or not\n  the President of Azerbaijan did in fact reach an\nunderstanding which reflected those realities.\nThere are two myths in Azerbaijan today   both\nof them faulty, miscalculated and risky. Since 1992,\nAzerbaijan has convinced itself that if they just hold\nout long enough, Armenia's economy will capitulate,\nand leave Nagorny Karabakh unprotected and\ndefenceless. Their calculations that a blockade of\nArmenia would mean that our economic and social\nconditions will plummet while their oil-based economy\ngrows have proven misguided and misinformed. Not\nonly has Armenia's economy not succumbed to\npolitical pressures, but our rate of growth is greater\nthan Azerbaijan's   and not only Azerbaijan's.\nNevertheless, they continue to cling to a second\nand related myth. Dreaming of future oil sales whose\nrevenues will be used to buy armaments, Azerbaijan is\nanticipating the day when it will again have the\nresources to pursue a military solution. This is self-\ndeception, as well. Azerbaijan has forgotten that\nsimilar fantasies led them to respond militarily to the\npeaceful demands of Nagorny Karabakh's population\nfor self-determination in 1992. The military balance\nwas hugely in their favour then, in proportions far\ngreater than what they might hope for in the future.\nStill, the moral, historical, legal and psychological\nbalance favoured the people of Nagorny Karabakh,\nwho were fighting for their homes, their families, their\nsecurity, their lives and their futures. The armaments of\nAzerbaijan did not then   and cannot ever   break\nthe will of the people of Nagorny Karabakh to live\nfreely on their own land.\nIndeed, Azerbaijanis are victims, but of their own\naggression. They started the war, one-sidedly. They began\nmassacring Armenians, citizens of the Azerbaijani cities\nof Sumgait, Baku and Ganja   the most irresponsible\nreaction that a Government can undertake, using the\nmost inhuman methods associated with pogroms.\nThe war that followed changed the world for two\ngenerations of Armenians, who have never lived under\nAzerbaijani rule. Azerbaijan's leadership, old and new,\nrather than remaining prisoners to the Soviet era   which\nthey themselves rejected as historically illegitimate   can\nlook to a future of compromise, peace, regional\ncooperation and prosperous, stable development.\nArmenia intends to go forward. Indeed, we\nalready have. The year 2003 has been a very good year\nfor Armenia. On the economic front, our steady,\ndouble-digit growth rate is the fastest in the\nCommonwealth of Independent States and in Europe.\nThis has led some to call Armenia the Caucasian tiger.\nWe are pleased with the name and the challenge. We\nknow that with economic growth comes an even\ngreater responsibility: to confront the social gaps which\ncan lead to social inequality and domestic instability.\nThe shortest path to the eradication of transitional ills\nsuch as the polarization of society, the urban-rural gap\nand uneven access to higher education is to sustain that\nhigh level of economic growth.\nThat is why, with the help of the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme, we embarked on the\nsustainable economic development programme. That is\nwhy the Government has approved and launched a\npoverty reduction strategy. It is also why achieving the\nMillennium Development Goals for poverty eradication,\nthe awareness and prevention of HIV/AIDS and the\nempowerment of women is an important part of\nArmenia's development strategy.\nIn Armenia, the United Nations plays a key role\nin promoting synergies directed at expanding the\ndevelopment impact of information and\ncommunications technologies. As we prepare for the\nWorld Summit on the Information Society in December\nin Geneva, Armenia is living a hopeful paradox. On the\none hand, less than half of our more than one thousand\nschools are connected to the Internet; on the other\nhand, information and communications technologies\n(ICTs) comprise a significant proportion of Armenia's\nexports today. Still, too many in our country   just\nlike the majority of the world population   still remain\nuntouched by the ICT revolution and its potential.\nWe recognize, of course, that ICTs can be central\nin economies like ours, especially given the continuing\nblockade. Our economic growth has continued despite\nthe blockade, which goes against the spirit and the\nconclusions of the recent United Nations sponsored\nInternational Ministerial Conference on Transit\nTransport Cooperation, which reaffirmed the right of\naccess by landlocked countries to and from the sea and\ntheir freedom of transit through the territory of their\nneighbours by all means of transport, in accordance\nwith the applicable rules of international law. For us,\nthat means a condemnation of the practice of unilateral\n32\n \ncoercive economic measures intended as political\npressure.\nThis was also a good year for our legislative\nreform process. The Armenian parliament has ratified\nthe Sixth Protocol of the European Convention for the\nProtection of Human Rights and Fundamental\nFreedoms, thus unconditionally abolishing the death\npenalty. We also adopted the draft law on the\nombudsman, thus empowering our citizens and\ninvesting them with the faith necessary to govern with\njustice and to be governed with dignity.\nAnother matter that is important for us and for all\nhumanity: Armenia continues to engage countries and\nGovernments around the world to recognize and\ncondemn the first genocide of the twentieth century.\nThe survivors of the genocide and their descendants are\nhelping to build a democratic Armenia, committed to\nthe future without forgetting the past.\nWhen Sergio Vieira de Mello visited Armenia\nseveral years ago, he came looking for ways to\nminimize the pain and suffering of Armenian refugees\nforced to flee their homes in Baku and Sumgait in\nAzerbaijan. This year, as he worked to minimize the\npain and suffering of the people of Iraq, to help them\nrebuild their country and their Government, he and too\nmany of his colleagues lost their lives. His death and\nthat of Anna Lindh of Sweden remind us that ideas,\nmore than people, scare and threaten. Those two brutal\nmurders also suggest to us louder than any\ndemonstration that the leadership of the world still has\nmuch to do in engaging the rejectionists, the extremists\nand the cynical. Our positive, forward-looking,\ndetermined steps here in the General Assembly will go\na long way towards convincing them.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would\nlike at the outset to extend my sincerest congratulations\nto you, Sir, on your accession to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly. It comes at a particularly difficult\ntime, which I might even describe as painful, in the\nhistory of our Organization.\nIndeed, the past year has gravely challenged the\ncapacities of the United Nations to manage the crisis in\nIraq to its conclusion, a country to which it was\naccountable. It saw the pre-eminent role for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security of this\ninstitution, symbol of multilateralism and stability,\ncalled into question.\nYet, it is not our institution\u2019s intrinsic capacity\nthat is the cause of its powerlessness. It is essentially\nits Members\u2019 lack of political determination. We\ncannot elude this vital debate for a peaceful, more\nharmonious and more just future indefinitely. Sooner or\nlater, we must answer the essential question: How can\nwe ensure that all Member States of the United Nations\nwill be prepared to accept the binding nature of\nSecurity Council endorsements of military action prior\nto engaging in it?\nTo make myself perfectly clear, and to avoid any\nmisunderstanding, the question that I ask is as follows:\nWhat reforms need to be made to the Organization\u2019s\noperations to placate the often-understandable\napprehension or reticence of those who, because they\nassume specific political responsibilities, refuse to\nsubmit their geostrategic options to the rules of our\nOrganization? As long as we remain unable to answer\nthat question, we will continue to live in doubt and\nuncertainty, if not in helplessness. It is not a question\nof advocating an institutional shake-up of the\nOrganization; rather debate should enable us to\novercome the all-too-many misunderstandings that\nundermine the credibility of our shared instrument, and\nfrom which we can draw conclusions that will help us\nto make the Organization\u2019s mechanisms more credible\nand up to date. The Security Council was founded on\nthe recognition of the particular responsibility and role\nof some of our Members, and I fully subscribe to it.\nBut should we not integrate new perspectives into this\nstate of affairs, such as the regional dimension, present\ngeopolitical facts and also new threats?\nThis is in no way meant to contest the specific\ninfluence of some of those involved in international\npeace and security management. Rather, our concerted\nsupport could help accompany, legitimize and\nstrengthen their approach and their effectiveness,\nthanks to the indisputably added value of multilateral\ndynamics. In many cases, this would avoid taking\nunnecessary risks and misunderstandings. In that\nregard, I think that, given its role as a global actor, the\nEuropean Union greatly deserves a permanent seat on\nthe Security Council on its own behalf.\nIt is this conviction that has inspired my country\u2019s\nposition on the Iraq crisis. But now is not the time to\ndetermine who was right or who was wrong. All sides\nclearly had their reasons. One can only respect them\nfor it.\nBut it is now necessary to contribute to the re-\nestablishment of stability and ensure Iraq\u2019s\nreconstruction. That is the responsibility of us all, for it\nconcerns a region neighbouring Europe, and we cannot\ntolerate, if only for the sake of our own security,\nincreased instability or the persistence of an\nuncontrolled spiral of violence that feeds resentment\ntowards the international community, which, as history\nhas taught us, constitutes the principal breeding ground\nfor terrorism.\nIt is thus necessary to stop the violence as quickly\nas possible. To this end, I share the opinion of the\nSecretary-General and of many among us. It is\nnecessary to restore as quickly as possible\nresponsibility for governing Iraq to the people of Iraq.\nThe return to sovereignty, under the watchful eye of the\nUnited Nations and of the international community as a\nwhole, is capable of providing the salutary shock\nneeded to reverse the current trend. We must convince\nthe Iraqi people that national union, the\nre-establishment of State authority and economic\nrecovery are accessible and at hand. This of course\ndoes not imply that the international community should\ndemobilize. A strong military force in Iraq will still be\nnecessary for some time to guarantee stability. It is of\ncourse up to the United States to assume its\nmanagement. But from now on this presence must not\nbe regarded as designed to occupy the country, but\nrather as a way to assist in the reconstruction process\n34\n\nfor the sake of the Iraqi people. The Security Council\nresolution that is currently under discussion must\ncreate this prospect so as to insure broad participation\nby the international community.\nThe United Nations has a central role to play in\naccompanying the political reconstruction process in\nIraq, even if the tragic events of August have shown\nhow risky and vulnerable that process is. However,\nsuch a role requires a clear mandate and sufficient\nmeans.\nI wish to renew my sincerest condolences to the\nSecretary-General, to the bereaved families and to\ncolleagues, and express my high regard and admiration\nfor all the United Nations staff members for their\ninvolvement, their selflessness and the sacrifices that\nthey accept so steadfastly.\nThe principal security threat is the uncontrollable\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their\npotential use by some States in breach of minimal\nethical standards or by certain terrorist movements.\nThat threat is serious. We must each confront the threat\ntogether, by shouldering our fair share of the actions\nundertaken.\nThe European Union and its member States\ncurrently possess an essential document which deals\nwith the European security strategy. It should enable\nus, as Javier Solana quite recently reminded us in\nBrussels, to plot a European chart of the challenges\nfacing this world to better guarantee the effectiveness\nof our collective security system. Belgium will actively\nparticipate in this endeavour.\nFurthermore, we fully share the international\ncommunity\u2019s concerns about the nuclear programme of\nNorth Korea. We strongly call upon North Korea to\nabide by its previous international commitments. We\nare grateful to China for having offered a useful format\nfor discussion in this respect.\nAs for Iran, I trust that through a sustained and\nconstructive dialogue it will meet the expectations of\nthe international community and respond to the\nrequests of the International Atomic Energy Agency.\nBelgium will continue to participate in a\ndetermined and proactive way in the international\nefforts that were initiated two years ago to track down\nterrorism. In Belgium, there is no sanctuary for\nterrorism, nor will there ever be. Nevertheless, the fight\nagainst terrorism should not be used as an abusive\njustification for actions that would undermine the\ndemocratic quality and the sacred principles of the rule\nof law.\nFurthermore, I am not one of those who believe\nthat the military option is the exclusive answer,\nalthough obviously it should not be excluded. Much\nmore fundamentally, we need to systematically attack\nthe root causes of a phenomenon that is often rooted in\nthe feeling of powerlessness or in feelings of real or\nperceived injustice.\nFor this reason, Belgium will also continue to\nsupport, together with its European partners, the action\nof the Quartet for the re-establishment of peace\nbetween Israel and the Palestinian Authority. To\nachieve that goal, it is necessary that Palestinians\ndecide unambiguously to renounce the toleration of\nblind violence and that Israel, in the same spirit, stop\nfavouring the use of force.\nOne has the impression that, as difficulties pile\nup, we have fallen back into the traps of Oslo: a\ngradualism of small steps and a too-pronounced\nreliance on sequencing. The road map prescribes\nparallel advances on the security, political and\neconomic paths. From each side, we need to obtain\nbolder measures and the acceptance of the risks these\nimply. There is no alternative to the road map. It has\nnot yet been implemented seriously. We believe it is\nparticularly urgent to create a credible, on-site\nverification mechanism.\nIt is in Africa, particularly in Central Africa, that\nmy country commits itself in the most determined way\nto the restoration of peace and stability. We are\nencouraged by the successful installation of a\ntransitional Government in Kinshasa that now brings\ntogether all the parties. Now, State structures have to\nbe restored and good governance has to be introduced\nin order to allow for the return of foreign aid and\ninvestment. The persisting violence in the east of the\ncountry must end.\nIn this context, I wish to mention the remarkable\nefforts by the United Nations Organization Mission in\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC). I\nam particularly happy about the success of Operation\nArtemis. Apart from restoring security in Bunia, this\noperation has given MONUC the thrust it needed to be\nable to face up to the challenges of its new mandate.\n35\n\nNow, priority must be given to the preparation of\nelections in order to grant the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo a new start on a solid basis and to\nconsolidate its restored territorial integrity. Belgium\nwill be present at all levels and in every phase of this\nprocess. But I wish to insist on the fact that the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo needs the\ndetermined commitment of all the instruments of our\ncommunity. It would be unforgivable not to forge, here\nand now, the conditions for a complete stabilization of\nthe entire region.\nWe also need to help Rwanda to continue its\nnational reconciliation efforts, which are indispensable\nin order to guarantee sustainable stability in that fragile\ncountry. I am convinced the recent elections will\ncontribute to this goal.\nAs for Burundi, the implementation of the Arusha\nAgreements must continue, and the rebels have to be\nconvinced that they should join this process. My\ncountry looks forward to participating actively in the\nnew action on Burundi decided by the Economic and\nSocial Council. We hope that will help Burundi to\nbreak through its isolation within the international\ncommunity.\nFinally, my country closely follows the efforts by\nthe United Nations to reactivate the project for a Great\nLakes conference, which should seal the re-\nestablishment of peaceful relations and the\ndevelopment of cross-border cooperation among the\ncountries of the region.\nThe credibility of the United Nations does not\ndepend only on its willingness and capacity to manage\ncrises. It also depends on its capacity to respond to the\nexpectations of men, women and children all over the\nworld, who are directly or indirectly confronted with\nimbalances and injustice whose causes and solutions\nboth are found only at the global level. It is essential to\nmaster globalization, develop the promises it offers and\ncorrect its excesses.\nIt is clear that, in accordance with the analysis of\nthe Secretary-General, this challenge requires\nfundamental reflection on the architecture of the major\ninstruments of development. That demands openness of\nmind and should not exclude any option from the start.\nHas not the time come to reinforce the capacity of the\nUnited Nations to act effectively in this field? I wish to\nrepeat a question that I raised at the World Trade\nOrganization Ministerial Conference in Canc\u00fan.\nShould we not, for example, create a real Economic\nand Social Security Council, which would derive its\nlegitimacy and efficiency from law and which would\nhave the same power in the management of economic,\nsocial and environmental policies as the Security\nCouncil has on issues of peace? That is my conviction,\nespecially since those fields form the requisite\nbackdrop to achieving stability and security.\nThe Economic and Social Council needs to be\nreformed to give it a more decisive operational role in\nthe control of a world organization based on universal\nprinciples of equity. This goal should lead to broad and\nbalanced synergies between international organizations\nsuch as the World Bank, the International Monetary\nFund, the World Trade Organization and the\nInternational Labour Organization, which should really\nbecome instruments of the same project.\nThe founding principles of such a concept exist\nalready and are being applied in certain countries, such\nas in mine. I am referring more specifically to\nfundamental labour standards such as the freedom of\nunions, the prohibition of child labour and forced\nlabour and the right to quality employment, as well as\nenvironmental obligations, which are vital for\nsustainable development. I am also thinking of the need\nto exclude services of general interest from the market\nsphere.\nTo conclude, it seems to me that such an ambition\nwould opportunely translate the tremendous hope\ngenerated by the Millennium Summit. The Millennium\nDeclaration clearly defined the goals at our level. I am\npleased with the decision of the General Assembly to\nmake the five-year review of the Millennium Summit\nin 2005 into an important event, which I think should\nbe a summit of heads of State and Government. That\nsummit should assess the implementation not only of\nthe Millennium Goals, but also of the goals of all the\nmajor United Nations conferences.\nBut the success of that summit implies going\nfurther. It should at last boldly lay the foundation for a\nworld in which inequalities between poor and rich\ncountries can be filled in a sustainable way. It should\nnourish, in an irreversible way, the indispensable\nconfidence the world needs to be safer, more human\nand more brotherly.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like to extend\nmy heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Julian Robert\nHunte, Foreign Minister of Saint Lucia, on his\nassumption of the office of President for the fifty-\neighth session of the General Assembly. I would also\nlike to commend Mr. Jan Kavan, former Deputy Prime\nMinister and former Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\nCzech Republic, for his devoted efforts during his\ntenure as President of the fifty-seventh session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nFirst of all, I would like to touch upon the terrible\ntragedy that occurred last month. Special\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General Mr. Sergio\nVieira de Mello and other United Nations staff,\nworking diligently to facilitate the reconstruction and\nstabilization of Iraq, sacrificed their lives as a result of\nthe cowardly bomb attack in Baghdad. On behalf of the\nGovernment of Japan, I take this opportunity to pay\ntribute to Mr. Vieira de Mello and his colleagues.\nMuch of our time and energy since the general\ndebate last year have gone into the discussion of the\nIraq situation. In that process, questions have been\nasked about the role of the Security Council and the\nUnited Nations with respect to the Organization\u2019s\nprimary role of maintaining international peace and\nsecurity. On the occasion of this general debate, we\nonce again need to earnestly explore the meaning of\nthis matter.\nThere is no organization on earth more universal\nthan the United Nations. No other organization\naddresses so many diverse issues as comprehensively\nas it does. I strongly believe that the United Nations\nwill continue to play an important role that no other\ninternational organization can fulfil. The United\nNations role should be enhanced through reform in\norder to restore the confidence that was shaken in the\nIraq situation. All Member States are called upon in\nour joint effort to strengthen the Organization.\n38\n\nToday, we face a situation in which the\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the\nthreat of terrorism affect not only particular countries\nor regions but the world as a whole, presenting a new\nthreat to our lives and our livelihood. It is imperative\nfor each country to regard the issue as its own and to\ntake action in concert with the countries facing such\nimminent threats.\nIn order to establish an Iraqi Government run by\nthe Iraqis themselves as soon as possible, the\ninternational community must join hands for securing\npeace and promoting reconstruction, and the United\nNations must play an even more prominent role in\nthose efforts. Japan strongly expects that a new\nSecurity Council resolution will be adopted, that the\npath towards Iraqi self-governance will be clarified and\nthat the international partnership will be strengthened\nto promote reconstruction and security. Together with\nthe international community, Japan continues to make\nevery effort towards the restoration of security and the\nreconstruction of Iraq and in particular towards the\nsuccessful conclusion of the Madrid donors conference\nfor the reconstruction of Iraq to be held next month.\nWith respect to peace in the Middle East, I am\ndeeply concerned that the road map has reached a\ncritical stage. I call upon both sides to exercise the\nutmost restraint in order to restore calm on the ground.\nThe Palestinian Authority must resolutely disavow the\nuse of terror, work expeditiously to establish a new\ncabinet and take action to control the extremist\nfactions. Israel, in turn, must act with prudence and\ncaution, mindful of the consequences of its own\nactions. In particular, the expulsion of Chairman Yasser\nArafat can only result in a deterioration of the\nsituation. Japan once again urges Israel not to proceed\nwith the implementation of measures which would\nresult in Chairman Arafat\u2019s removal.\nFrom the perspectives of peace and security in\nNorth-East Asia and international non-proliferation, the\ndevelopment and possession of nuclear weapons by\nNorth Korea must never be tolerated. Japan once again\nurges North Korea to immediately and completely\ndismantle all of its nuclear development programmes in\na verifiable and irreversible manner. This issue should\nbe resolved peacefully by diplomatic efforts including\nthe six-party talks process. Based on the Pyongyang\nDeclaration between Japan and North Korea, Japan\nseeks the resolution of various outstanding issues\nbetween Japan and North Korea, including the nuclear\nissue, the missile issue and the abduction issue, which\nwas addressed explicitly by the Assembly last\nDecember in its resolution on the question of enforced\nor involuntary disappearances (57/215). Upon the\ncomprehensive resolution of those issues, Japan is\nlooking to effect the normalization of its diplomatic\nrelations with North Korea.\nWith regard to Iran, Japan calls upon Iran to take\nseriously the resolution adopted at the 12 September\nmeeting of the Board of Governors of the International\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Iran must appease the\nconcerns of the international community regarding the\nnuclear issue. It must comply immediately with all\nmeasures prescribed in the resolution, which include\ncooperating fully with IAEA to rectify problem points\nby the end of October of this year. Iran must also ratify\nthe IAEA Additional Protocol immediately and\nunconditionally and implement it in its entirety.\nThe very urgency of those issues reminds us of\nthe importance of the crossroads at which we now\nstand with respect to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation\nTreaty regime. The horror and devastation caused by\nnuclear weapons should not be repeated. Japan is\nredoubling its efforts to maintain and fortify the\nnuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime,\nwith this treaty as its core. At the fifty-eighth session\nof the General Assembly, Japan will submit a draft\nresolution entitled \u201cPath to the total elimination of\nnuclear weapons\u201d and aim to secure adoption of the\nresolution by an overwhelming majority of Member\nStates. Furthermore, Japan considers the early entry-\ninto-force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty to be of extreme importance as a concrete means\nof strengthening the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty\nregime.\nDespite the serious efforts of the international\ncommunity to combat terrorism in the wake of the\nterrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, precious lives\ncontinue to be lost by terrorist attacks in Jakarta,\nBaghdad and many other locations around the globe.\nInsofar as improvements in the terrorism-related\nresponse capabilities of all nations are required for the\neradication of international terrorist organizations,\nJapan continues to provide capacity-building assistance\nto developing countries, with special emphasis on\nAsian countries. In addition, Japan calls upon all\nMember States to work to bring about the early\nconclusion of the counter-terrorism conventions as well\nas the implementation of Security Council resolution\n39\n\n1373 (2001) in order to deprive terrorists of the means\nfor their activities and safe havens.\nIn the twenty-first century, we cannot address the\ndangers and threats now confronting the world with\nmilitary and political measures alone.\nOur responses must be well thought out, detailed\nand sustained, addressing every facet of the issues we\nface, including the social aspect, humanitarian and\nhuman rights concerns, and the question of economic\nreconstruction. Furthermore, we must strive to\nguarantee human rights, democracy and good\ngovernance by creating a social environment that\nenables each and every human being to realize his or\nher maximum potential.\nOn the basis of this realization, Japan has made\nthe consolidation of peace and nation-building one of\nthe pillars of its diplomacy and its international\ncooperation efforts, and it is contributing actively in a\nvariety of areas, including peacekeeping operations.\nMoreover, in the conceptual framework of human\nsecurity, Japan has made efforts to enhance both\nprotection and capacity at the individual, human level.\nJapan will continue to work for the realization of the\nrecommendations made in the report submitted by the\nCommission on Human Security in cooperation with\nthe United Nations, Member States and non-\ngovernmental organizations, through diplomatic\nmeasures such as official development assistance.\nSpecific examples of Japan\u2019s efforts include\nassistance in nation-building, such as the deployment\nof Japan\u2019s Self-Defence Forces in Timor-Leste; the\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration\nprogramme it is now implementing jointly with the\nUnited Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan; and\nsupport for the peace process and for reconstruction\nand development in the form of efforts such as the\nTokyo Conference on Reconstruction and Development\nof Sri Lanka.\nMeasures against infectious diseases are also\ncrucial in ensuring human security. The example of\nSARS demonstrated to the world yet again the\nimportance of international cooperation in the\nmitigation of such diseases. Japan welcomes the results\nof yesterday\u2019s General Assembly High-level Meeting\non HIV/AIDS, which reconfirmed both the\ncommitment of every nation to the goals set forth in the\nPolitical Declaration and the importance of the Global\nFund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.\nWith regard to Africa, Japan has been cooperating\nfor its development on the basis of the principles of\nownership and partnership, aiming at poverty\neradication through economic growth, as well as\nproviding assistance in conflict prevention in order to\nsecure the peace and political stability which are\nprerequisites to development. The Tokyo International\nConference on African Development (TICAD) process\nis now in its 10th year. TICAD III will convene on 29\nSeptember. In response to the ownership of the New\nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD),\nTICAD III intends to expand partnerships with\ninternational organizations and the countries\nconcerned, and particularly with civil society and\nAsian countries which have successfully realized\ndevelopment, in order to share the wisdom and\nexperiences of the international community in the area\nof African development.\nAs the representative of an Asian country, I\nwould like to take this opportunity to highlight two\nissues that relate to peace and security in the Asian\nregion.\nThe first is the detention of Daw Aung San Suu\nKyi by the Government of Myanmar. Japan is\ncontinuing to make serious diplomatic efforts to bring\nabout the expeditious resolution of this worrisome\nsituation and to facilitate concrete progress towards\nnational reconciliation and democratization.\nThe second issue concerns the Khmer Rouge\ntrials in Cambodia. Japan believes that it is necessary\nfor each country to extend considerable cooperation in\norder to ensure that these trials take place and that they\nexhibit an unswerving application of the principles of\nlaw and justice of the international community.\nIn the community of nations, diversity is both\nrespected and cherished. For that reason, the\nformulation of a set of common rules under which the\nentire global community can act as one is of extreme\nimportance. The United Nations has made significant\nprogress in this area to date. I would like to explain\nsome of the agenda items which Japan will be pursuing\nat the United Nations, here in the General Assembly\nand elsewhere, in order to formulate such rules. Such\nrules will constitute the basis for well-thought-out,\ndetailed and sustained responses to a broad spectrum of\nissues, including socio-economic, environmental and\nhuman rights issues.\n40\n\nIn the field of the environment, it is imperative\nthat the international momentum for climate change\nnegotiations be maintained. I appeal to the\nrepresentatives of all nations who are gathered here to\nrecognize the importance of the early entry into force\nof the Kyoto Protocol and of the formulation of\ncommon rules which will facilitate participation by all\ncountries, including the United States of America and\ndeveloping countries.\nThe protection and promotion of the rights of\ndisabled persons is also of great importance. Japan\nwelcomes the decision taken in June of this year to\nestablish a working committee which will draft an\ninternational convention on the promotion and\nprotection of the rights of persons with disabilities;\nJapan will actively participate in this process.\nWith regard to the United Nations Decade of\nEducation for Sustainable Development, Japan looks\nforward to the adoption of a resolution promoting the\ncreation of an implementation plan in which the United\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization (UNESCO) serves as the lead agency.\nDisaster prevention is an indispensable element\nfor a safer world in the twenty-first century, not merely\nbecause of its role in the follow-up to the World\nSummit on Sustainable Development, but also as an\nessential prerequisite for achieving much of the\nsustainable development agenda. Japan proposes to\nhost the World Conference on Natural Disaster\nReduction in order to develop new strategies on\ndisaster prevention.\nFor the United Nations to fulfil the role of\nbringing about a world of peace and prosperity based\non common rules embraced by the entire international\ncommunity, the reform of the United Nations,\nparticularly that of the Security Council, as its core,\nmust be urgently addressed.\nToday\u2019s conflicts have become more diversified\nand increasingly complex, as evidenced in cases where\na civil war escalates due to the dysfunctional condition\nof a State. To respond to these new challenges, the\nSecurity Council has taken on new tasks, such as the\ndeployment of multinational forces, when necessary, to\nrestore order. Such tasks also include the expansion of\nthe role of peacekeeping activities from military and\npolice activities such as ceasefire monitoring to\nhumanitarian activities, including assistance for the\nrepatriation of refugees, as well as assistance for\ndemocratic elections and reconstruction efforts. The\nSecurity Council must take on a variety of these tasks\nin working for the resolution of today\u2019s conflicts.\nFor the Security Council to address these\nchallenges comprehensively, there is a need to\nstrengthen the functioning of the Council by including\ncountries that are both willing and able to shoulder\nresponsibilities at the global level as permanent\nmembers. Japan continues to work diligently for the\nrealization of Security Council reform and would like\nto assume greater responsibility as a permanent\nmember in a reformed Council.\nThe issues about which I am speaking today are\nhardly new. Discussions on the reform of the Security\nCouncil have been under way for 10 years now. Yet,\ndespite a series of exhaustive discussions about how\nthe Council should be reformed, we are still unable to\nsee progress in any concrete terms.\nIt is no exaggeration to say that, if we continue\nalong this path, the ability of the United Nations to\nrespond adequately to new and complex challenges\nwill be seriously brought into question. We must take\nconcrete action now. The Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, makes a strong case for United Nations reform\nin his report (A/58/323) entitled, \u201cImplementation of\nthe United Nations Millennium Declaration\u201d. He\nproposes that we set 2005 as a deadline for reaching\nagreement on the changes that are needed in our\ninternational institutions if we are to meet the new\nchallenges, because 2005 not only marks the sixtieth\nanniversary of the founding of the United Nations but\nis also the year in which a review of progress on the\nMillennium Declaration will take place. I am of the\nview that a political decision should be taken on the\noccasion of that review at a meeting of heads of State\nor Government regarding the reform of the United\nNations, in particular the Security Council.\nWith regard to the \u201cenemy State\u201d clauses in the\nUnited Nations Charter, a General Assembly resolution\nwas adopted in 1995, recognizing them to be obsolete.\nThose clauses have not yet, however, been deleted\nfrom the Charter. This is an extremely regrettable\nsituation. Japan will work to find appropriate solutions\nto this issue, in view of the progress on United Nations\nreform.\nAdministrative and budgetary reform of the\nUnited Nations is also necessary in order to increase\nboth its effectiveness and its efficiency. With regard to\n41\n\nthe size of the United Nations budget, it is necessary to\ngive careful consideration to the financial burden on\nMember States. Japan calls on the United Nations both\nto conduct a strict prioritization of its activities and to\neliminate those activities which are neither essential\nnor urgent. We must also consider appropriate methods\nto make the scale of assessments for all Member States\nmore balanced. Finally, equitable geographical\ndistribution among Member States for the number of\nstaff members of the Secretariat has yet to be attained.\nThe present situation is of concern and needs to be\nimproved.\nJapan believes that international peace and\nprosperity can be achieved only through cooperation\namong nations, with the United Nations playing an\nimportant role. Japan has used all means at its disposal\nto contribute to United Nations activities, so that the\nobjectives contained in the United Nations Charter may\nultimately be realized. Let me make it clear that Japan\nwill continue to be actively engaged in United Nations\nactivities. However, the perpetuation of the same basic\nSecurity Council structure of 60 years ago leads many\nto question the legitimacy of the system under which\nthe United Nations operates. The legitimacy of the\nUnited Nations is at stake.\nIn closing, I would like once again to urge all\nMember States to take concrete actions to strengthen\nthe functions of this Organization and restore its\nlegitimacy in the eyes of the nations and citizens of the\nworld.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThis\nsession of the General Assembly is being held at a time\nwhen the world is confronted with the most serious\nchallenges of its history in all areas.\nThe Assembly has chosen Mr. Julian Hunte to\npreside over our work and for my delegation it is a sign\nof recognition of his qualities and competence. I would\ntherefore like to join my voice to those of other\ndistinguished heads of delegations preceding me in\nconveying to him my sincere congratulations as well as\nmy hopes for his complete success, and we pledge to\nhim the support of my country to assist him in\naccomplishing his task. We also wish to pay a tribute to\nhis predecessor, whose success was tremendous in\nconducting the work of the fifty-seventh session, which\nhas just ended. We ask him to accept our\ncongratulations and our gratitude and we hope he will\ncontinue to impart to us the benefits of his experience.\nWe would also like to respectfully convey our\nthanks to the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, for the\nwisdom that he has shown and for his tireless efforts\nwhich he continues to deploy, sometimes in extremely\ndifficult situations, so that the Organization can, as\nmuch as possible, reach the objectives which have been\nassigned to it under the terms of its Charter.\nDuring this fifty-eighth session of the General\nAssembly, we are going to commemorate the tenth\nanniversary of the genocide which, in less than 100\ndays, from April to July 1994, in plain sight of the\nentire world, claimed the lives of more than a million\nRwandans and caused the internal displacement or the\nexile of thousands of others. We hope that this will be\n17\n \nan occasion for the General Assembly to collectively\nrecommit our efforts, as Governments and peoples\nacross the globe, so that these types of horrors never\nagain occur. Toward this end, we suggest that 7 April\n2004 be declared, by this distinguished Assembly, as a\nday to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the\nRwandan genocide.\nWhile the advent of this sad anniversary obliges\nus to recall this genocide as something we must remember\nand as a sign of respect and of international solidarity, it\nis not the only reason we have taken the floor here. On\nthe contrary, we wish to share an experience which is\nvery hopeful, namely the rebirth of the Rwandan nation\nwhich, in our opinion, has been a test of stamina and of\nthe determination of an entire people. In fact, in the last\nfive months Rwanda, which in 1994 looked very much\nlike a failed State, courageously undertook its\nreconstruction and now has experienced some\npromising events, the most promising of its post-\ncolonial history.\nSince its accession to independence in 1962, the\nfirst pluralist presidential elections have just been held\nand they took place in an atmosphere of unprecedented\npeace and calm. The stunning victory of His\nExcellency Paul Kagame as President of the Republic\nin the vote that was held on 25 August, exactly one\nmonth ago, is part of the democratic process set in\nmotion since 1999 by local elections, followed in 2001\nby municipal elections and in May 2003 by the\nconstitutional referendum. This marks, de jure, the end\nof the transitional period, begun in the aftermath of the\nRwandan tragedy in 1994.\nThese free and transparent elections, as well as\nthe legislative elections which are ongoing even now as\nwe speak, are not only an important step in the process\nof democratization, but also and especially are\nrestoring Rwandans to their right and sense of pride at\nbeing able to make and write their own history, a\nhistory, which has turned its back forever on genocide\nand which is instituting, as critical values and objectives,\nunity, peace, justice, democracy and development.\nThese consultations, we are reminded, are not the\nresult of chance, and would not have taken place nor\nknown as much success as the international community\nhas seen, had it not been for the firm will of the\nRwandan leadership and the Rwandan people to\ncommit themselves with determination to peace and\nsecurity of individuals and property throughout the\nentire Rwandan territory; unity and reconciliation of\nthe Rwandan people; and good governance which, in\nthe end, is our policy engine and which has allowed us\nto dismantle the structure of a State that was too\ncentralized and totalitarian and which stifled positive\ninitiatives, as well as the involvement of the people in\ndecisions concerning their own development.\nWe have also set up principles of accountability\nand transparency at all levels of public life by creating\nstrong autonomous institutions to combat corruption,\nnepotism and abuses of power. The success of these\ninitiatives can be measured today by the fact that a\nrecent study of the World Bank Institute has cited\nRwanda among the developing countries that are the\nbest managed, the best governed and not corrupt. Such\npublic transparency would not have been possible\nwithout our having eradicated the culture of impunity\nwhich had taken root in our country.\nWe had to take steps to completely overhaul the\nclassical legal system and introduce a legal system that\nis participatory and traditional called Gacaca', which\nis inspired by Rwandan know-how and whose major\nobjective is not only to punish crimes committed\nduring the genocide, but also, and especially, to\nreconcile Rwandans.\nIt should also be pointed out that the 1948\nConvention on the Prevention and Punishment of the\nCrime of Genocide obliges the international community\nto prevent, stop and punish genocide. While the\ninternational community came up short in its obligations\nunder this Convention, we did greatly appreciate the\nsubsequent establishment of the International Criminal\nTribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), established to bring to\njustice and punish the perpetrators of this crime.\nOur country was particularly pleased and satisfied\nwith the recent decision of the Security Council to\nappoint a full-time prosecutor for the ICTR in order to\nimprove its performance and its effectiveness. We are\nof the view, however, that other reforms could still be\ninitiated to obtain this objective which, in our view,\nwould help restore human dignity.\nRegionally, the political and security situation in\nthe Great Lakes Region in Central Africa has tangibly\nimproved since last year. Rwanda is pleased with the\nongoing peace process in the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo, which has led to the formation of an\ninclusive transitional Government and the reunification\nof that country.\n18\n \nWe are disposed to work with this new\nGovernment, as well as with the United Nations\nOrganization Mission in the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo (MONUC), to achieve disarmament,\ndemobilization and effective repatriation, as called for\nin the Agreements of Lusaka and Pretoria, of the ex-\nFAR and the Interahamwe militia, whose belligerent\nactivities are at the heart of the two regrettable clashes\nbetween our two countries.\nWith respect to the situation in Burundi, this\nrequires more attention on the part of the international\ncommunity. Rwanda, at this point, is calling on all the\nparties to consider the best interests of the Burundians\nand to join with the ongoing peace initiatives supported\nby countries in the region so that we can put an end to\nthe unspeakable suffering of the Burundian population.\nThis being the case, at a time when these different\nAfrican peace initiatives are beginning to take form, it\nis time to call on the international community to\naccompany them and support organizing an\ninternational conference for peace, security and\ndevelopment in the Great Lakes region. This\nconference would hopefully produce a kind of Marshall\nPlan for the development of the region.\nElsewhere in Africa and throughout the world,\nRwanda condemns the fact that conflicts, often\nconflicts that have been going on for some years,\ncontinue to claim many human lives and deflect\nenormous financial and material resources that could\nbe allocated to developmental projects.\nWe are of the view, however, that these conflicts\nwill not disappear on their own, unless we pay\nattention to them and unless we attack the root causes\nof these conflicts and, in particular, unless we put into\nplace effective and appropriate mechanisms to prevent,\nmanage and resolve these conflicts.\nIndeed, we must all work together, resolutely, to\npromote dialogue in good faith, solidarity among nations,\nnon-exclusion, the human dimension, international law\nand diplomatic activities as a means worthy of the\nindividual and of nations to resolve their differences.\nThe point concerning United Nations reform is on\nthe agenda of our Organization and has been for\nseveral years, although we have never been able to\nagree on the scope and content of the necessary\nreforms. That the United Nations needs to be reformed\nis without doubt. In fact, as the United Nations\nSecretary-General indicated, when the stakes change,\nwe must adapt our responses to them.\nIt is certain that the challenges facing the\ninternational community today are different from those\nthey faced from the 1940s to the 1980s. Rwanda is also\nconvinced, therefore, that the institutions, the\nstructures and the working methods of the United\nNations, which have been adopted over the years must\nbe adjusted and fine-tuned to the realities of the day.\nWould it not be fair, for example, in a world\nwhich has fundamentally changed, that we question the\nmembership and the decision-making methods in the\nSecurity Council? At a time when we are requiring all\nnations to have democratic governance, is it not\nlegitimate to require the Security Council itself to be\nmore representative and more democratic in its\nmethods of work?\nRwanda supports the proposal submitted by other\nMember States to increase the number of members of\nthe Security Council to better reflect regional realities\nand therefore to allow a better representation of\ndeveloping countries. Nevertheless, in order to do that,\nwe must bear in mind the fact that the Security Council\nhas been placed as a body under the General Assembly\nand that its enlargement can in no way compromise\nthat order.\nWe must therefore better reorganize the United\nNations so that it can achieve the goals of ensuring\npeace and security among nations, developing more\nequitable international relations in the areas of\ncooperation and friendly ties and inspiring and\nguaranteeing the international order and international\nlaw. In doing so we must ask ourselves why the United\nNations has been unable to respond collectively and\neffectively to such recent crises and tragedies as the\n1994 Rwandan genocide and the situation in Iraq. Why\nhas the United Nations been unable to prevent or stop\nvarious crises throughout the world or to fulfil its\nprimary mission of ensuring peaceful co-existence among\nnations? Why has the United Nations been unable to be an\neffective and efficient catalyst for harmonious political,\nsocial and economic development in all nations? We\nbelieve that the answer to all of those questions, and\nmany others, will determine the nature and scope of the\nreforms to be undertaken. In that regard, we welcome\nthe Secretary-General's decision to establish a high-\nlevel panel to address the question of reform and to\nmake proposals to the General Assembly.\n19\n \nAs I said at the beginning of my statement, the\nmajor challenges in the world today include poverty;\npoor governance; economic, political and social\ninjustice   which give rise to many internal conflicts\n  international terrorism; globalization and the\nHIV/AIDS pandemic and other widespread diseases.\nThose challenges cannot be successfully addressed\nwithout greater and more effective cooperation on the\npart of all countries. Nevertheless, the development\ngoals for the new millennium, the New Partnership for\nAfrica's Development, the current series of\nnegotiations in the Doha round to allow greater access\nto world markets for products from developing\ncountries, the recent decision by the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO) to allow poor countries to import\nlow-cost basic generic medicines to combat such\nillnesses as AIDS, and the various tools established by\nthe United Nations to combat international terrorism all\nrepresent the beginning of collective responses to those\nchallenges. However, those initiatives will only bear\nfruit if all nations abandon selfish reflexes, such as\nthose that were at the heart of the recent failure of\nWTO negotiations at Cancun.\nRwanda would like to take advantage of this\nforum to reiterate its steadfast determination to commit\nitself and to contribute, however modestly, to address\nthose challenges. We are committed to working with all\nthe nations of the world to begin that undertaking in\nour region and in our dear continent, Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a great pleasure for me to\naddress the General Assembly under the presidency of\na fellow citizen of our Caribbean Community. Allow\nme to extend our warmest congratulations and good\nwishes to you, Sir, as you discharge the functions of\nyour high office.\nI offer our esteemed Secretary-General our\nappreciation for his astute and steadfast leadership in\nthese times of great challenge to the Organization. I\nwould also like to pay tribute to his dedicated staff,\nmany of whom have lost their lives in service to the\nUnited Nations.\nIn 1953, the people of Guyana were allowed for\nthe first time to exercise their democratic franchise\nunder universal adult suffrage to elect the Government\nof their choice. Today, 50 years later, my country has\nlearned, through the painful experience of misrule and\nmismanagement, the vital importance of democracy to\nour future as a nation. We recognize that to foster\ndevelopment, reduce poverty and safeguard human\ndignity, democracy must be allowed to grow and take\nroot. Having laid the basic foundation for good\ngovernance through free and fair elections, we now\nface the task of building a more prosperous and just\nsociety.\n4\n \nTo that end, my Government has embarked on a\nprocess of consultation and collaboration with all\nsectors of our population, including political parties,\nthe private sector and non-governmental organizations.\nThrough the recent reform of the Constitution,\nprovisions have been made to enhance fiscal\ntransparency, provide greater inclusiveness and\nguarantee the fundamental rights of our people. Those\nmeasures include six independent commissions on\nhuman rights, ethnic relations, women and gender\nequity, indigenous peoples, the rights of the child and\npublic procurement.\nMoreover, in an effort to foster greater social\ncohesion in Guyana, we recently invited the United\nNations Special Rapporteur on Racism to visit and\nengage the various sectors of Guyanese society so that\nthe international community can be informed of the\nbroad perspectives of our multicultural society and of\nthe several measures which the Government has put in\nplace to promote interracial harmony.\nIn further consolidation of the democratic\nprocess, my Government has embarked upon a\nprogramme to reform the justice and security systems\nin our society by building capacity for the prevention,\ninvestigation and resolution of crime and for the\nimprovement of the administration of justice. Much has\nbeen accomplished in that area, but much more remains\nto be done.\nAt the same time, we have taken several\ndevelopment initiatives that will ultimately lead to a\nbetter life for all our people. Among them are the\nnational development strategy and the poverty\nreduction strategy. We have worked hard to provide\nbetter housing, health and education facilities for our\npeople and have managed to make signal progress in\nreducing poverty. And by stimulating investment, we\nare creating new opportunities for development. We\nnow look to the future with the renewed hope that we\nwill be able to overcome the many challenges to our\npolitical, economic and social progress.\nHowever, in the face of a persistent debt burden,\ndrastically reduced development assistance and ever\npresent protectionist barriers, and in the prevailing\nclimate of international tension and uncertainty, many\ndeveloping countries, Guyana included, are made more\nvulnerable, and prospects for growth are severely\nimpaired. The failure of the recently concluded Cancun\nConference does not make us sanguine about the\nfuture. The international community is now hardly\nlikely to reach the Millennium Declaration targets that\nwere set by this Assembly three years ago.\nThe fate of nations, especially of those as small\nas ours, lies not in our hands alone. The process of\nglobalization has made us acutely aware of the need for\ngreater interdependence and international cooperation\nif we are to survive the many threats to our welfare.\nThat interdependence is the basis for multilateralism\nand for the United Nations.\nThe Charter of the Organization reflects our\ncollective commitment to cooperate to promote peace\nand development. However, we have yet to fully\nhonour that commitment. Regrettably, the world in\nwhich we live now, while placing a high premium on\ndemocracy at the national level, fails to live up to that\nideal in the international councils that shape our\ncommon destiny. We are concerned at that double\nstandard, as the aspirations of humankind for peace,\nsecurity and development cannot be fulfilled without\nthe effective participation of all States in global affairs.\nEspecially disconcerting is the practice by some\ncountries and international financial institutions to rely\non anecdotal or partial information   often from\nquestionable sources   to assess the performance of a\ngiven country. Needless to say, that can be very\ndamaging to the particular economy concerned, as it\neffectively deters further aid and investment. Similarly,\nwe are concerned by the inordinate delay in the release\nof development funds. The Heavily Indebted Poor\nCountries Debt Initiative, which was conceived as a\nmeans of assisting seriously indebted poor countries,\nhas been unconscionably delayed. Meanwhile, the poor\nof our countries must face continuing hardship and\nsuffering. They cannot be held hostage for much longer.\nThe success of international cooperation, and\nindeed of the United Nations system, will be determined\nby how well they respond to the interests and concerns of\nnot only the powerful but also the powerless, and not\nonly of the rich but, most urgently, of the poor. If truth\nbe told, their record thus far leaves much to be desired.\nIt is therefore imperative that a credible and effective\nsystem of global governance be established as quickly\nas possible. That will require a more fundamental\nreform of the United Nations, and indeed of the entire\nmultilateral system, than we have seen so far.\nAfter several crises in the decade of the 1990s,\nthere was a strong call for reform of the international\n5\n \nfinancial architecture to provide greater macroeconomic\nstability. The urgency of the campaign appears to have\ndiminished, however, even though the threat of further\ncalamity remains. Attempts to strengthen the role of\nthe United Nations in the development process now lag\nbehind, denying our countries a greater say in the\ndecision-making process pertaining to issues that affect\nour welfare. Nor have we been able to develop an\neffective security system to protect countries,\nparticularly the weak and small, from encroachments\non their sovereignty and territorial integrity.\nOur world continues to be subject to a wide array\nof threats to international peace and security. We\nrecently witnessed a series of terrible human tragedies.\nMany thousands have died as a result. If there is one\nlesson to be learned, it is that violence accomplishes\nnothing. Only through dialogue and negotiation,\nbolstered by social justice, can lasting solutions to\nthose problems be found. It is therefore imperative that\nthe United Nations, the multilateral Organization to\nwhich we all belong, be strengthened to effectively\npromote peace and development.\nIt is time that the United Nations Security\nCouncil, which has the primary responsibility under the\nCharter for international peace and security, be made\nmore representative of the wider international\ncommunity. The Council must be expanded, and the\nrole of developing countries in that body appropriately\nstrengthened. To that end, Guyana is prepared to\nsupport the candidacies of Brazil, India and an African\ncountry for permanent seats on the Council, as well as\na suitable number of non-permanent seats for other\ndeveloping countries. That expansion will no doubt\nenable it to better cope with the challenges that\nconflicts, both old and new, pose to global peace and\ndevelopment.\nNeither the many speeches that we make nor the\nseveral strategies that we occasionally devise in the\nhope of building global peace and development will\never accomplish much unless they are followed up by\nappropriate action. Sad to say, our frequent\ndeclarations of intent are not matched by deeds, a\nfailure that can be explained only by the lack of serious\npurpose on the part of many Member States. We have\nyet to transcend selfish national interests to reach a\nhigher plane of interdependence and multilateralism. I\nurge the international community to rethink its policies\nand to seriously consider the advantages of a more\nbalanced and equitable system of relations.\nThe world in which we now live calls for greater\ninternational solidarity and cooperation, not less. We\nmust therefore ensure that those ideals are at the\nforefront of our deliberations at the General Assembly\nand that we take practical steps to ensure and\nstrengthen our common home, the United Nations.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me begin by\ncongratulating you, Mr. President, on your election to\nthe presidency of the General Assembly. You are\nassuming your duties at a difficult juncture in\n25\n\ninternational affairs. I am sure that, under your\nguidance, the Assembly will make a positive\ncontribution to fostering peace and progress in the\nworld. Allow me also to extend my warmest thanks to\nyour predecessor, our good friend Mr. Jan Kavan, for\nhis commitment and diligence.\nWe fully subscribe to the statement delivered by\nMr. Frattini on behalf of the European Union, as well\nas to the priorities of the European Union that he has\nlaid out before the Assembly.\nWhen I held the presidency of the European\nUnion, just a few months ago, I had the honour to work\nclosely with the Secretary-General at a very crucial\ntime. Secretary-General Kofi Annan often has to wage\nan uphill battle in his efforts to safeguard the moral\nauthority of the United Nations and to carry out its\nmandate. His tireless efforts to promote peace and\nsecurity worldwide deserve our fullest support.\nIndeed, this year the United Nations has\nundergone one of the most testing periods in its history.\nDuring the Iraqi crisis the world's citizens put great\nfaith in the power of the United Nations to respond to\nthe potential threat of weapons of mass destruction,\nwhile at the same time preserving peace and the\nlegitimacy of international law. The leaders of the\ninternational community failed to unite around global\npublic opinion, and a war ensued. As Kofi Annan told\nthe Assembly, a new doctrine of pre-emptive force and\nunilateralist actions has called into question our long\ntradition of global consensus on collective security.\nParadoxically, despite that crisis, our citizens\nexpect more today from the United Nations, rather than\nless. Whether we are dealing with poverty, inequality,\nhuman rights violations, terrorism, pollution or\nweapons of mass destruction, the world looks to us for\nleadership. We are expected to transform today's\ninsecurity into tomorrow's opportunities. That may\nseem like a tall order, but it is possible. It is possible\ntoday, as we are witnessing a growing consciousness\nabout the need to think seriously about global\ngovernance. That consciousness has to do with the\nmagnitude and complexity of the issues with which\nhumankind is grappling. It also has to do with the fact\nthat, in an era of globalization, a problem in another\ncorner of the world can have major effects in our own\nneighbourhood of the global village.\nThe legitimacy of the United Nations is at the\nheart of that debate. If we are to convince the more\npowerful of the world that unilateralism does not pay,\nwe need to show that multilateralism is effective. We\nneed to prove that organizations such as ours can deal\neffectively with threats to our peace and security. We\nneed to rethink our institutions, which must be\nfinancially and politically viable. We must ensure that\nour institutions derive their legitimacy not only from the\naction we take and the just decisions we make, but from\nthe fact that they are truly democratic and that they are\nrepresentative of global consensus as far as possible.\nAll that is possible, but it requires courageous\nchanges   certainly the courage to open up a sincere\ndialogue between citizens, countries, continents and\ncivilizations. We therefore fully endorse the Secretary-\nGeneral's proposal for the reform of the United\nNations. By the time the Assembly meets next year, we\nneed to have achieved realistic targets and tangible\nresults, and to have re-evaluated the role of the various\nbodies of the United Nations and of their respective\nmissions. The role of the Security Council is\nparamount, and its composition must be more\nrepresentative in order to ensure full trust in its\nauthority and legitimacy. The United Nations can\nbecome central in safeguarding humankind's security,\npeace and prosperity. Greece will work towards that\ngoal if the General Assembly honours us by electing us\nto the Security Council for the 2005-2006 term.\nFrom the corner of the world I come from, I can\nseriously state that the prospect for peace is real. In the\nlast century Greece lived through two World Wars, two\nBalkan wars, a major war with Turkey, a famine, a civil\nwar, numerous dictatorships and confrontation with\nTurkey over Cyprus. We also became a major recipient of\nrefugees from the crises, ethnic cleansing and wars in our\nregion of South-Eastern Europe and the Middle East.\nToday there is hope in the Balkans that peace can\nbecome permanent, that democracy can flourish and\nthat human beings can live together in dignity,\nirrespective of their religious, political or ethnic\naffiliation. Greece and Turkey have emerged from a\nlong period of over 40 years of tension and suspicion\nwhen there was little contact and no bilateral\nagreements were ever signed. Twice in recent decades\nwe went to the brink of war. Today I can stand before\nthe Assembly and state that Greece and Turkey have\nratified 14 agreements in areas ranging from tourism to\nagriculture and education to security. We have also\nagreed on 10 confidence-building measures and,\nalthough fundamental differences remain on specific\n26\n\nissues, we are now working cooperatively to try to deal\nwith some of the most contentious and controversial\nquestions that have divided us for decades.\nFurther testimony of that improvement is the fact\nthat, with my Turkish counterpart, Abdullah G\u00b8l, we\nsimultaneously submitted yesterday in this building our\nratification instruments for the Ottawa Treaty banning\nlandmines. In Cyprus, an island divided after Turkey's\ninvasion and occupation in 1974, we perceive the\ncommon desire to build a democratic, united Cyprus\nwhere Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots can live\ntogether in peace. Last April, following the lifting of\nrestrictions on free movement, thousands of Cypriots\nseized the opportunity to cross the so-called Green\nLine to meet with one another and to demonstrate that\nit is possible for them to share a common future.\nHowever, that easing of restrictions is not a\nsubstitute for a comprehensive settlement to the\nisland's political problem. Over the years, Greece has\nactively supported the efforts of the Secretary-General\nto achieve a comprehensive settlement in conformity\nwith the relevant resolutions of the Security Council\nand the principles on which the European Union is\nfounded, namely, the Acquis Communautaire. Those\nresolutions must be implemented. We will not give up\nhope until all Cypriots can live together in harmony\nand security in a federal State with a single citizenship\nand without foreign troops on its territory. On 1 May\n2004, Cyprus will be a full member of the European\nUnion. We hold out the hope that the Annan plan will\nbe used as a basis for negotiating, and that a solution\nwill be found, so that the Turkish Cypriot population will\nalso enjoy the security and prosperity that accession to the\nEuropean Union will bring. It is possible.\nYet all those sustained efforts for peace in the\nregion would not have been possible if it were not for\nthe creation of a viable, stable and sustainable\nframework of shared values, principles, visions and\ninterests, as well as a deep commitment to respect of\nour citizen's rights and including a vision in which, as\nPericles said in his Funeral Oration, one is free of\nsuspicion of the other. That framework, vision and\ncommon values can be summed up in one phrase: our\nEuropean Union.\nFifty years ago, Europe was shattered by two\nworld wars and countless regional conflicts. Through\nour common values of respect for the rule of law,\ndemocracy, freedom, and solidarity, we have overcome\nwars and the Holocaust and have seen the fall of the\nBerlin Wall. Today the European Union is a model of\nmultilateralism, a system of collective governance that\nadvances the shared interests and addresses the\ncommon problems of a coalition of nation-States that\nall aspire to peace and security in a common union.\nEurope may not have a magic wand that can solve all\ncrises, but we have proved that it is possible to build a\nstable and democratic continent. It is that prospect that\nnow unites us in the Balkans, gives hope to Greek-\nTurkish relations and creates a common vision for\nGreek and Turkish Cypriots. The United Nations can\nlearn from our experience as it prepares to undertake\nnecessary reforms. What the European Union has\nprovided is not a magic wand. We have simply said\nthat matters of war and peace are so important for\nhumankind that they cannot merely be left up to\nleaders, no matter how great they may be. They cannot\nbe left up to negotiators, no matter how skilful they\nmay be. They cannot be left up to earthquakes,\napocalypses or inspirations, however momentous they\nmay be. What is needed is a stable, sustainable, secure\nenvironment of common values, international law,\naccepted practice and purpose. It is within that secure\nenvironment that we can work out roadmaps,\nbenchmarks, milestones, target dates and goals that can\nbecome both credible and powerful tools for the\npeaceful resolution of conflicts and the establishment\nof lasting institutions of stability and conviviality.\nThat is why the United Nations has become so\nimportant for Iraq and its people. That is why the\nUnited Nations and the Quartet are so important for the\nimplementation of the road map to solve the\nPalestinian conflict and the wider Middle East conflict.\nIf we differed in Europe on the means of dealing with\nIraq, we remain united in our conviction that the United\nNations has a vital role to play in the reconstruction and\nstabilization process. Indeed, I would argue that the\ncurrent predicament in Iraq is a stark reminder that\nmultilateral cooperation is an imperative for world\npeace and security. It will only be possible to bring\nlasting peace to Iraq if we all work together.\nIn referring to the importance of the role of the\nUnited Nations in Iraq we are simply stating the\nobvious need to create a stable international\nenvironment within which solutions can be nurtured,\nand where they can mature, in order to stabilize the\nregion. It is within that context that it must be possible\nto realize a Palestinian State by 2005, a State that lives\n27\n\nside by side with a secure Israel. It is also within that\ncontext that during our presidency of the European\nUnion we placed great emphasis on engaging in a\nmeaningful dialogue of cultures that could hopefully\nheal the deepening rifts with regard to how different\ncultures view our changing world. We also devoted\nconsiderable efforts during Greece's presidency to\nstrengthening Europe's relations with the Arab world.\nWe hope that that dialogue can continue to be an\ninvestment in, and an instrument for, furthering peace,\ndemocracy and prosperity.\nIraq challenged Europe to think globally. We\nrealized that in order to safeguard our citizens' security\nwe had to develop stronger foreign and defence\npolicies. We took the initiative during our presidency\nto launch the first European security strategy. We are\nnow creating more clearly defined defence policies and\ngreater military and crisis-management capabilities.\nLast June, the European Union adopted its first strategy\nagainst the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction, as well as a joint-action plan on terrorism.\nThat was quickly followed by a framework agreement\non weapons of mass destruction between the European\nUnion and the United States.\nSimilarly, problems such as terrorism, trafficking\nin drugs, arms and people, and the proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction all point to a world where\nconflict is not confined to national frontiers. It is only\nlogical to conclude that most problems can only be\nproperly addressed through multilateral action and\npolicies in our global village. Sustainable development\nwill bring about sustainable peace. But sustainable peace\nalso depends on the freedom of our citizens: freedom of\nchoice, freedom to participate, freedom from\noppression and freedom from fear and discrimination.\nDemocracy bodes well for security, because\nsecurity cannot be achieved without the legitimacy of\nour institutions and decisions. But democracy cannot\nbe imposed, it must be nurtured. That is the difficult\ntask ahead, namely, to create democratic processes in a\ntrans-national way. That is becoming a global\nchallenge that we cannot afford to ignore. It must be\npossible, otherwise we will always be prey to extremist\nforces that resort to violence, often exploiting the sense\nof exclusion among our citizens, many of whom feel\nexcluded from prosperity and human rights.\nThis year, such forces were responsible for the\nuntimely deaths of three champions of democracy.\nAllow me to mention their names: Zoran Djindji\u0107,\nSergio Vieira de Mello and Anna Lindh. Their tragic\ndeaths pose a critical challenge to the very freedom and\ndemocracy they fought so hard to defend. We must not\nallow the threat of violence, intolerance and fear to\nhold our democratic societies hostage. We must not let\ninsecurity blind us to the simple truth that democracy\nholds the key to a world without violence.\nIn our global village today, our challenge is to see\nto it that we have an international system that truly\ngoverns democratically. We must ask ourselves tough\nquestions. How representative and accountable are our\ninternational institutions? Who decides on global rules\nand regulations? Who implements those decisions?\nWhose interests do they serve? Why do so many of our\ncitizens feel moved to stage protests outside international\nsummits? How can we address their grievances and\ninclude them in the decision-making process? If we can\nfind satisfactory answers to these questions we will\nhave come a long way towards replacing today's\ninsecurity with tomorrow's opportunities.\nBuilding on our long history of democracy,\nGreece is committed to supporting and developing new\ndemocratic practices. One way to do so is through the\nInternet, which has created radical new possibilities for\nreinvigorating and enriching democratic dialogue. We\ncreated an on-line experiment during our presidency of\nthe European Union that is called e-Vote, an electronic\npilot project through which citizens can participate in\nongoing debates. Three months from now, we will\nassemble at Geneva for the first phase of the World\nSummit on the Information Society. There Greece will\nhost a special conference on the promise of electronic\ndemocracy. I invite the entire Assembly to attend.\nFinally, in this global village we also need to\nhave global festivals, even with our many difficulties,\nto celebrate humankind and our common values. The\nOlympic Games are one such festival. Greece will have\nthe honour to host a great homecoming on the occasion\nof the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens.\nWe have introduced in the General Assembly a\nnew draft resolution on the subject of building a\npeaceful and better world through sport and the\nOlympic Ideal. We want to encourage the notion that it\nis possible to create lasting peace from a pause in\nhostilities. The United Nations and, in particular, the\nSecretary-General have long championed the value of\npeaceful cooperation through sport. Since 1993, the\n28\n\nAssembly has unanimously adopted six resolutions\ncalling for a truce during the Olympic Games. This\ndraft resolution, like the ones before it, calls on all\nMember States to observe the Olympic Truce, the longest\npeace accord in ancient history. I urge the Assembly to\nsupport that draft resolution. Let us reaffirm our\ncommitment to the spirit of peaceful cooperation upon\nwhich the Olympics were founded. Let us send a\nsymbolic message from this international body of peace\nfor a peaceful Olympics and, ultimately, for a more\npeaceful world. Let us prove that that too is possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst of all, I would like\nto congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\nsession and to express gratitude to Mr. Jan Kavan for\nhis work as the President during the fifty-seventh\nsession.\nThis year has been hard for the United Nations.\nThe events surrounding Iraq have revealed weak links\nin the system of international security. Not for the first\ntime, the Security Council, owing to disagreements\namong its members, was unable to ensure the\nimplementation of its resolutions and to react\nadequately to the situation.\nThose disagreements continue to have a critical\ninfluence on the activity of the Security Council with\nregard to both Iraq and other crises and conflicts. It is\nclear that existing United Nations mechanisms do not\nmeet the requirements of our time, and it is necessary\n28\n\nto reform the United Nations, including the Security\nCouncil, which reflects the reality of half a century\nago.\nAzerbaijan supports the well-known reform\nproposals of Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in\nparticular with regard to the expansion of the\nmembership of the Security Council, and counts on the\ngoodwill of the permanent members of the Council\nwith regard to the revision of its mechanisms, in\nparticular the right of veto.\nWe hope that the international community will\nnow be able to consolidate its efforts to restore and\nstrengthen a united and indivisible Iraq and to establish\ndemocracy based on the free will of all of the Iraqi\npeople. Our country, which is ready to take part in this\nprocess, has begun to contribute to the strengthening of\nsecurity and stability in Iraq.\nThe terrorist act against the United Nations\nHeadquarters in Baghdad shocked the entire\ninternational community. The death of Sergio Vieira de\nMello and his colleagues was a tragic loss for the\nOrganization and all of us. What happened in Baghdad\nonce again showed how vulnerable we are in the face\nof terror and convinced us that terrorists are capable of\ncommitting any crime. The only response should be an\nuncompromising commitment to fight against anyone\nwho resorts to terrorism, no matter what goals are used\nas a cover. Selectivity and double standards have no\nplace in this respect.\nOur country, which has fallen victim to the\naggression, occupation and terror unleashed by\nArmenia, has for years been fighting terrorism on its\nown. Our appeals to the international community to\nunite its efforts in combating terrorism went unheeded.\nThe alarm went off only after 11 September 2001.\nSuccess in the fight against terrorism cannot be\nachieved without eradicating the underlying roots and\neliminating the factors that create a favourable\nenvironment for its dissemination. On the other hand, it\nis not possible to resolve conflicts throughout the\nworld, including in the southern Caucasus, under\nconditions of continuing terrorism or of support for it\nat the State level.\nWe have to keep in mind that terrorist groups,\ncreated and developed by separatist and extremist\nforces, are usually based in illegally controlled\nterritories, in the so-called grey zones that emerge as a\nresult of acts of armed separatism and external\naggression. One such uncontrolled grey zone is\nNagorny Karabakh and other regions of the Republic of\nAzerbaijan, occupied by Armenian military forces.\nWhile carrying out the comprehensive struggle\nagainst terror and resolving conflicts on the basis of\nprinciples and norms of international law, the\ninternational community should decisively resort to\nforce. That is the only effective way of restoring justice\nand ensuring the rule of law.\nThe delegation of Azerbaijan has repeatedly\ndrawn the attention of the international community\nfrom this high rostrum to the ongoing conflict between\nArmenia and Azerbaijan. Ten years have elapsed since\nthe Security Council adopted four resolutions\ndemanding the immediate, complete and unconditional\nwithdrawal of the Armenian occupying forces from the\nAzerbaijani territories. However, Armenia continues to\nchallenge the international community by ignoring\nthose decisions, whereas the Security Council and the\nMinsk Group of the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) do not undertake any\nadequate measures in that regard.\nAzerbaijan has on many occasions declared its\ncommitment to the peaceful settlement of the conflict\non the basis of norms and principles of international\nlaw. We are determined to continue with our efforts in\nthis direction, and we count on the active participation\nof the international community. Azerbaijan will never\naccept a settlement on the basis of the so-called\nexisting realities and will not cede a single inch of its\nland. Azerbaijan's patience is not limitless, and no one\nshould try to take advantage of it. Responsibility for\nthe deadlock in the settlement lies with the aggressor\nArmenia, and not with the victim of aggression,\nAzerbaijan. The passive position of an observer taken\nby the international community can only aggravate that\ndeadlock.\nOnly after Armenia evacuates all the Azerbaijani\nterritories and thus creates a basis for the peaceful\nsettlement of the conflict can Armenia count on normal\ninter-State relations and cooperation with Azerbaijan.\nBy rejecting our constructive proposals, based on the\nobservance of international law, Armenia is\ndemonstrating its genuine intention to seize and annex\nAzerbaijani territories.\nArmenia's authorities continue to profess the\nideology of aggressive nationalism, militarism,\n29\n\nseparatism and terrorism and to doom their people to\nthe deepest crisis. In a society where territorial\nexpansion and the search for external enemies are\ninstilled as a national idea, democracy and pluralism\ncannot take root. It should be realized in Armenia that\nthe present situation of its conflict with Azerbaijan will\nnot only fail to resolve but will also certainly aggravate\nits own serious internal social and economic problems.\nIt is with a sense of regret that one has to\nacknowledge that inaction by the international\ncommunity leads to the strengthened self-confidence of\nArmenia in pursuing its destructive policy. Both the\nOSCE Minsk Group and the Security Council have\nbacked off in the face of illegitimate force, thus calling\ninto question the seriousness of their intentions and\ncontinuity of their actions.\nAppeasement of the aggressor seriously\nundermines the whole system of international security,\nwhich is based on the inviolability of principles and\nnorms of international law. That attitude has on many\noccasions taken a heavy toll on the international\ncommunity.\nWe appeal to the Security Council to carry out the\nnecessary measures in order to ensure the\nimplementation of the above-mentioned four\nresolutions, and we expect that decisive steps will be\ntaken to stop criminal and aggressive actions in the\noccupied territories and on the line of engagement, as\nwell as to push the occupying forces to unconditionally,\nimmediately and completely evacuate the seized\nAzerbaijani territories.\nThe conflict has deprived almost one million\nAzerbaijanis of roofs over their heads. It is clear that\nthe forthcoming winter will again become another hard\ntest for the refugees and the internally displaced\npersons, hundreds of thousand of whom continue to\nlive in tent camps. The Government of Azerbaijan,\nusing its limited resources, spares no effort to mitigate\ntheir suffering. Recently, the President of the Republic\nof Azerbaijan by decree allocated more than $70\nmillion to the construction of housing for refugees.\nWhile we highly appreciate the assistance of the\ninternational community, we nevertheless are worried\nby its decreasing scale. We urge the relevant United\nNations agencies and donor countries, as well as non-\ngovernmental organizations, to boost their attention to\nthe problems of the forcefully displaced Azerbaijani\npopulation and to respond adequately to their needs. As\nfor the long-term resolution of this problem, it lies, of\ncourse, in the settlement of the conflict between\nArmenia and Azerbaijan and in the return of the\nrefugees and internally displaced persons to their\nhomes.\nThe conflict has also severely damaged the\neconomy of Azerbaijan. However, having mobilized\nour domestic resources, we managed to overcome\nserious social-economic crises and to move towards\nstabilization and development. Economic reform\npolicies and the oil strategy elaborated and being\nimplemented under the leadership of the President of\nAzerbaijan, His Excellency Mr. Heydar Aliyev, have\nalready yielded concrete results. These reforms have\nled to macroeconomic stability and high economic\ngrowth rates.\nThe promotion of the market economy and\nentrepreneurship increased the share of the private\nsector of the economy to 73 per cent. Figures on\nforeign direct investment per capita show that\nAzerbaijan is one of the leaders among the countries\nwith economies in transition. On average, the annual\neconomic growth rate is between 8 per cent and 10 per\ncent.\nThe implementation of large-scale transregional\nprojects on development and transportation of\nhydrocarbon resources of the Caspian Sea to the world\nmarket and the diversification of transport corridors,\ninitiated by Azerbaijan, have opened new prospects for\nthe social and economic development of countries\nalong the East-West corridor, aimed at the restoration\nof the historic Silk Road.\nThis progress would be impossible without\ninternal political stability, which has created the\nprerequisites and conditions for implementing radical\npolitical reforms and the development of democratic\nsociety. Today, Azerbaijani democracy stands at the\nedge of its next test of maturity and firmness. On\nOctober 15, the elections for President of the Republic\nwill be held in Azerbaijan. The legislative basis for\nconducting genuinely free and fair elections has been\nestablished in the country. The recently adopted\nElection Code was widely discussed at the local and\ninternational levels, and it meets the highest\ninternational standards. Numerous international\nobservers of the OSCE, the Council of Europe and\nother international organizations, as well as local\nobservers, will follow the presidential elections.\n30\n\nThe triumph of democracy, social progress and\nsustainable development on a global scale are\nimpossible unless the problems of poverty and sharp\ndisproportion in economic performance across different\ncountries and regions are resolved. In that regard, the\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals\nis extremely important. Combating poverty\npresupposes close interaction between developed and\ndeveloping countries.\nRegrettably, there is still no breakthrough in that\nregard. Developed States should pay more attention to\nthe problems of the countries with economies in\ntransition. Experience proves that narrow-minded\ninterests frequently prevail, and thus deadlocks emerge\nin the negotiation process. Azerbaijan believes that\nenlargement of parties to the multilateral trade system,\nas well as granting the provisions of special and\ndifferential treatment in the World Trade Organization\n(WTO) to both developing countries and countries with\neconomies in transition, will contribute to the\nsuccessful global integration of the latter.\nWe are firmly convinced of the need to develop a\ndialogue among civilizations and cultures. Only\nthrough dialogue and good will shall we defeat mistrust\nand confrontation, and unify our forces in addressing\ncommon threats and challenges.\nIn conclusion, allow me once again to reiterate\nAzerbaijan's strong adherence to its political course,\naimed at building a strong democratic State with a\nmarket economy, and our genuine willingness and\ndesire to effectively contribute to peace and\ninternational security.\n\n\n\n\n"

You may rest assured of my delegation\u2019s full\nsupport in the discharge of your important\nresponsibilities.\nIt is my painful duty to pay, along with so many\nof us, a tribute to the memory of Sergio Vieira de\nMello and his associates, who sacrificed their lives for\nthe people of Iraq in the service of peace and the\nUnited Nations. Our heart goes out to the families of\nthe victims of that cowardly terrorist act.\nThe world was shocked and saddened when a\nmost respected colleague, and a close friend of mine,\nthe late Anna Lindh, the Swedish Foreign Minister, fell\nvictim to a senseless act of crime in Stockholm. Her\nvision of the world and her deep commitment to the\nprinciples and purposes of the United Nations will\ncontinue to be a source of inspiration to all of us.\n4\n\nHungary aligned itself with the statement\ndelivered by the presidency of the European Union\nduring the general debate and fully supports it.\nWe live in a world of great opportunities and\nserious challenges. It is in this context that global\nproblems require global and concerted solutions. To\nthat effect, we must use the potentials of the United\nNations to make the best use of opportunities at hand.\nIn that respect, maintaining or restoring peace and\nstability, non-proliferation, development and human\nrights are in the focus of attention of the international\ncommunity. International terrorism, the proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction, grave armed internal\nconflicts, poverty and illegal migration constitute\nenormous challenges to all of us.\nHungary remains strongly committed to\nmultilateral institutions. We are firmly convinced that\nthe United Nations can and should play a major role in\nmeeting the multifaceted and ever growing challenges\nof our contemporary world. We, for our part, are deeply\ndevoted to assisting that role. Along with our partners\nin the European Union, we are more than prepared to\nstrengthen the United Nations as a unique instrument\nof a strong multilateral system to tackle global and\nregional issues for the sake of a safer and more secure\nworld. We will spare no effort to take an active part in\nmaintaining peace and security, enhancing the non-\nproliferation regimes, protecting and promoting human\nrights and fundamental freedoms, and establishing\ninternational standards.\nThe global fight against international terrorism\nmust remain a major priority of the United Nations. In\nthis context, we support the full and effective\nimplementation of the relevant Security Council\nresolutions. Hungary is keenly interested in widening\nthe scope of multilateral instruments in the fight\nagainst terrorism.\nAfter the success of the coalition forces in\nbringing freedom and the opportunities of democracy\nin Iraq, we have to turn our attention to the\nreconstruction and development of that long-suffering\ncountry. Hungary is strongly committed to supporting\nthe Iraqi people. Our fellow Hungarians are serving\nwith the coalition forces. We will also attend the\ndonors conference in Madrid later this fall.\nWe are closely following developments regarding\nthe United Nations assumption of an ever-increasing\nrole in Iraq. I would like to stress that the United\nNations has to assume its share of the work both in\nrestoring the sovereignty of Iraq and in the\nreconstruction process. I believe that our Organization,\nwith ample experience elsewhere, can play a\nsignificant role in the establishment of democratic\ninstitutions, the rule of law, respect for human rights\nand election-monitoring. We are studying intensively\nour possible contributions to this process. For the time\nbeing, though, our priority must be the stabilization of\nthe security situation in Iraq and the normalization of\nday-to-day life.\nHungary is deeply concerned by the grave and\ndeteriorating situation in the Middle East. We believe\nthat the implementation of the road map is the only\nframework for reaching a political settlement. An\neffective and credible monitoring mechanism is of\ncritical importance to that effect. The Quartet should\ncarry on with its mission in the peace process. We call\nupon both the Israeli Government and the Palestinian\nAuthority to dedicate all their efforts to the full and\nunconditional implementation of the road map.\nThe security situation in Afghanistan remains\nfragile. The Government of Afghanistan deserves our\nassistance and attention. Terrorist acts and illicit drug-\ntrafficking are causes for serious concern. I am\nconfident that, with the unwavering support of the\ninternational community, Afghanistan will soon be a\nbetter place for the Afghan people.\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,\ntogether with the means of their delivery, is a growing\nand serious threat to international peace and security.\nThe danger of nuclear, biological and chemical\nweapons in the hands of terrorist groups and States \u2014\nwhich are a menace to our world \u2014 represents new\nmajor security challenges, against which we must act\ntogether in a resolute manner, both regionally and\nglobally.\nEarlier this year, the European Union (EU)\nadopted a very important and far-reaching Declaration\non Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction.\nHungary will work hard with its partners in the EU\ntowards the effective implementation of that new\ninstrument and of the recently agreed EU Action Plan.\nIn the current world security environment, the\nTreaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n(NPT) needs to be reinforced. We call on the States\nremaining outside the NPT to accede to it\n5\n\nunconditionally and to accept the nearly universal\nnorms of nuclear non-proliferation.\nRevelations about large-scale nuclear\nprogrammes and the failure to provide sufficient\nexplanations as to their purpose and nature have given\nrise to legitimate concerns on the part of the\ninternational community. There is a growing\nrecognition \u2014 shared by Hungary \u2014 that those\nprogrammes imply serious proliferation risks as well.\nWe view the first follow-up meeting of the States\nparties to the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC),\nheld at Geneva in August this year, as encouraging.\nThe participants rightly focused on practical actions.\nWe look forward to seeing further progress in\nstrengthening national implementation of the BWC at\nthe next meeting, in November.\nHungary remains strongly committed to the\ninternational protection and promotion of human rights\nand of fundamental freedoms, including the rights of\nminorities. The United Nations is the only universal\nOrganization dealing with worldwide standards-setting,\nprotecting human rights and addressing violations of\nhuman rights in individual Member States. All those\nefforts deserve our unqualified support.\nHungary continues to attach particular importance\nto the protection of the rights of minorities. Regional\ninstruments aimed at improving the situation of\nnational and ethnic minorities have already been\nadopted to that end without major difficulties. A\nuniversal instrument on the rights of minorities has yet\nto be elaborated. We believe that, given the necessary\npolitical will on the part of Member States, the United\nNations will be able to fill that gap through an\ninternational minority protection system. The more\neffectively we act, the more beneficial the service that\nwe will be able to provide with respect to protecting\nvulnerable minority groups through standards and\nnorms.\nHungary stands ready and is willing to join others\nin redoubling our efforts with regard to strengthening\nthe United Nations system. Multilateral institutions are\nin serious need of reform, if they are to live up to the\nexpectations of the fast-changing political and\neconomic landscape of our times. The United Nations\ncannot be an exception to that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me at the\noutset to congratulate the President on his election to\nthe presidency of this General Assembly. The role of\nthe President in providing overall leadership to the\nAssembly is crucial and I am confident he will guide us\nwisely through the complex tasks ahead of us.\nA month from now, a group of young people will\ngather at the University of Iceland to take part in a\nmodel United Nations conference. It is good to see\nsuch enthusiasm for the ideals of the United Nations\namong young people \u2014 as well as a desire to\nexperiment with how the United Nations machinery\nworks in practice. But I wonder whether their model\nwill accurately reflect how our United Nations works. I\nam concerned that, if it does, will it increase or dampen\ntheir enthusiasm?\nIf they were to model the General Assembly, I\nsuspect that their model would contrast in a number of\nways with the real thing. Their agenda would be more\nconcise. They would concentrate on pure and more\nimmediate issues of urgency. They would have little\ntime for often-repeated resolutions whose relevance is\nchiefly historical. They would not allow such items to\ncrowd out more immediate matters. They would\naddress the world as it is, not the world of yesteryear.\nTo be honest, I am worried that the more accurately their\nUnited Nations model reflected the real thing, be it the\nGeneral Assembly or the Security Council, the more\ndifficult it would be to explain to those young idealists\nour purpose and convince them of our effectiveness.\nAs already stated by my Danish colleague, on\nbehalf of the Nordic countries, I would very much like\nto welcome the proposal of the Secretary-General to\nestablish a high-level panel of eminent personalities to\nmake recommendations on issues ranging from peace\nand security to reform of United Nations structures.\nThe General Assembly has tremendous achievements\nto its credit. It is, as we affirmed in our Millennium\nDeclaration, the chief deliberative policy-making and\nrepresentative organ of the United Nations. The\nachievements of the General Assembly in international\nnorm-setting and in the establishment of an\ninternational legal framework is undisputed. Its\npotential is great but, as the young people at our United\nNations model would bluntly point out, it needs fixing.\nIf we believe the General Assembly is where\ndeliberation should be carried out, let us ensure that the\nagenda and procedures allow debate and deliberation to\ntake place in an interactive manner. If we believe that it\nis the chief policy-making body, let us ensure that it\ndevelops policy, perhaps by linking debate more\nclosely with the decision-making process. Policy needs\nto be followed-up; we need to do more on\nimplementation. My delegation will contribute actively\nand constructively in the forthcoming deliberations on\nreforms of the General Assembly during this session.\nOur young people at the United Nations model\nnext month will in fact be modelling the Security\nCouncil. I suspect that they will raise some questions\nabout the composition of that body. Iceland is seriously\n27\n\nconcerned with the slow progress in the open-ended\nworking group. Though it provides, for the time being,\nthe appropriate forum for continued dialogue, Iceland\nwould welcome any additional initiatives to further\nintensify the process towards satisfactory resolution of\nthis important matter.\nThe Icelandic position on the reform of the Security\nCouncil is on record. It is essential that the membership of\nthe Council better reflect the membership of the United\nNations as a whole. At the same time, the efficiency of\nthe Council must be preserved. Further steps should be\ntaken to increase transparency in the decision-making\nprocess, in order to build on the welcome steps already\ntaken by the Council.\nIceland supports an increase in both permanent and\nnon-permanent seats at the Council. New permanent\nmembers should have the same rights and obligations as\nthe current permanent members. The veto right should\nbe restricted and an obligation to state the reason for its\nuse should be established, including why a permanent\nmember considers a matter to be of vital importance.\nIceland has, for the first time, put forward its\ncandidacy for membership of the Security Council for\nthe years 2009 and 2010. We see participation in the\nSecurity Council as a logical expression of our\ndetermination to fulfil our responsibilities within the\nUnited Nations and contribute as an active member of\nthe international community.\nThe promotion and protection of human rights must\nbe a central concern of all United Nations activities. In\nthis regard, much more needs to be done to implement\nour commitment regarding the rights of women and the\nrights of the child. Iceland has signed the United\nNations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish\nTrafficking in Persons and has enacted legislation\nagainst trafficking in human beings. Iceland is working\nagainst the trafficking of women through a common\ncampaign with the other Nordic countries and the\nBaltic States. The Icelandic campaign will focus on\ninforming and increasing awareness among the public\nabout this issue.\nWe should be especially aware of the implications\nfor human rights of new threats and new policies. In\nparticular, we must ensure that fundamental human\nrights are not violated in our counter-terrorist effort, as\nhas been underlined by the Secretary-General.\nIn Iraq, the United Nations itself has recently\nbeen the target of two terrorist attacks. I would like to\nuse this opportunity to express the most sincere\ncondolences on behalf of the Icelandic Government to\nthe United Nations and the families of the United\nNations officials who lost their lives. I would also like\nto wish those who were wounded full recovery.\nThe United Nations and the Security Council in\nparticular must address the issue of Iraq. Iceland, along\nwith many other Member States, is contributing to\nIraq\u2019s reconstruction and will continue to do so. The\nsituation will demand all our resourcefulness and a\nconcerted effort at cooperation by all parties in the\nSecurity Council to ensure that the people of Iraq are\nassured the destiny they deserve. This destiny should\nencompass peace and democracy, affording equal rights\nand justice to all Iraqi citizens.\nOn terrorists, renewed efforts must be made to\nreach an agreement on a universal definition during\nthis General Assembly. Such a definition would make\nthe fight against terrorists more effective.\nIt is estimated that close to 90 per cent of victims\nin today\u2019s armed conflicts are civilians, the majority of\nwhom are women and children. Women and girls\nexperience conflicts differently than men because of\ntheir status in society. Their rights must be protected in\nsituations of armed conflict and we must ensure that\nwomen play a central role in conflict prevention,\npeacekeeping and peace-building. United Nations\nSecurity Council resolution 1325 (2000) lays the\nground rules for this to happen and must be\nimplemented in all of its aspects.\nIt is our role to ensure that globalization benefits\nall countries, not least through targeted development\ncooperation. Sub-Saharan Africa will continue to be the\nfocus of our bilateral development cooperation while we\nwill also increase our contribution and involvement in\nmultilateral development cooperation, especially through\nthe United Nations Development Programme, the United\nNations Population Fund, the United Nations Children\u2019s\nFund, the United Nations Development Fund for\nWomen and the World Food Programme.\nI just returned, like many others, from Canc\u00fan,\nwhere we had difficult discussions on correcting the trade\nrules so that developing countries can operate on a more\nlevel playing field in world trade. This work is vital and\nwe must push on with it. With determination we can\nbreak through the impasse that we reached in Canc\u00fan.\n28\n\nIceland is one of the many island States in the\nworld whose well-being and development is crucially\naffected by the state of the marine environment.\nSustainable harvesting of living marine resources is the\nmainstay of our economy. Resolution 57/141, on\nOceans and the Law of the Sea, which was adopted\nduring our last session, provides for the establishment\nof a regular process for the global reporting and\nassessment of the state of the marine environment,\ncommonly referred to as Global Marine Assessment, a\nconcept that was initiated by Iceland in 1999.\nAn intergovernmental meeting should be\nconvened in 2004 to decide upon the modalities of this\nprocess and negotiate an agreement between United\nNations agencies. It is our sincere hope that such a\nmeeting could turn out to be fruitful in the process of\nthe establishment of the Global Marine Assessment.\nWe must craft for ourselves a United Nations\nwhich is task-oriented, representative, focused and\ncoordinated. I believe strongly that the United Nations\nshould not only be a place where we can talk about\nwhat we want to do, it must also be the place and\ninstrument to get things done. We have taken note of\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s call for changes in our\ninstitution by 2005.\nThere are varying opinions on how the United\nNations should operate, but I believe there is a general\nrecognition that the United Nations is, and must\nremain, the key forum in which we exercise our\ncollective responsibility. At the Millennium Summit,\nheads of State and Government reaffirmed their faith in\nthe Organization and its Charter as indispensable\nfoundations of a more peaceful, prosperous and just\nworld. They defined our priorities for this century and\nresolved to make the United Nations a more effective\ninstrument for pursuing all of these priorities. It is up\nto us, the Member States, to make it possible for the\nUnited Nations to realize these objectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The State Union of Serbia and\nMontenegro was created in the interest of peace,\nstability, the democratic right to freedom of choice and\nmoving quickly to a European track. We have assumed\nthe responsibility for a policy of non-compromise in\nthe Balkans. We have assumed the responsibility to\ndemonstrate that in the region that used to be burdened\nwith divisions and conflicts it is possible to work out\nan agreement that will push us forward together.\nWe are certain that our lives can be better if all of\nus in the region commit to that goal, if all of us in the\nregion look to the future and if all of us in the region\nlook to Europe and other people who share the same\ngoals. That is why we are sure that life can be better for\nall peoples.\nWith this hope, we agree with all who perceive\nterrorism as one of the greatest evils facing the world\ntoday. We can defeat terrorism only if we all join\nforces. That is why, for us, there is no alternative to\nmultilateralism, and the United Nations is the guarantor\nfor that, both today and tomorrow.\nTerrorism is not a problem only for the rich\ncountries, as the Secretary-General said yesterday. It is\na problem for every man and every country, just as it is\na problem for parents who lost their children just\nbecause they chose to swim in a river and belonged to a\ndifferent religion and nationality. We deplore the\ndeaths of those children, the same as we deplore the\nterrorist attack in Baghdad, which caused the death of\ninnocent people, among them Sergio Vieira de Mello.\nWe condemn these deaths as all humane, civilized and\nprogressive people do. But that is not enough. We must\nstrive to ensure that such things happen no more.\nThe activities of the United Nations in Kosovo\ndemonstrate that with good intentions on all sides there\nis hope for creating preconditions for dialogue, instead\nof hatred and conflicts, so that people discuss and\nresolve their problems instead of creating new ones.\nWe are glad that one of the crucial issues for the\nstability of this region   that of Kosovo   is on the\nthreshold of dialogue, as we have called for.\nWe have been encouraged by the announcements\nof representatives of the United Nations that the\ndialogue between Belgrade and Pristina could start by\nmid-October and that it has been supported within the\ncontact group. I hope that it will also be supported in\nPristina, as it is supported in Belgrade. In this\nundertaking as well, the role of the United Nations and\nits representative in Kosovo is extremely important.\nFor its part, Serbia and Montenegro will do its\nutmost to ensure the success of the dialogue. This is an\nopportunity that we must take advantage of, in the\ninterest of the European and democratic future of the\nregion. We have to be patient and persistent.\nWe are aware that we cannot change the past. But\nwe can do a great deal to improve our present and\nfuture. We seek peace for all people left without their\nhomes. There are more than 650,000 of them in Serbia\nand Montenegro, and we want them to live where they\nbelieve they belong. I am sure that within the\nframework of the tripartite agreement with Croatia and\nBosnia and Herzegovina we shall soon find a common\nsolution that will ultimately resolve that problem.\nFrom our own recent experience we know a lot\nabout victims and suffering. That is why we call for an\nend to violence in all parts of the world   in Baghdad\nand Iraq, and the Middle East. We are convinced that\nthe international community and the United Nations,\nprimarily the Security Council, will find a way to\nstabilization and to a life in peace and freedom for all\npeople. The human race has only one world to live in.\nWe in Serbia and Montenegro stand ready to contribute\nto peace efforts through peace operations, to protect\npeace and to defend each nation's right to a democratic\nfuture.\nOf course, we are primarily committed to the\nstabilization of the situation in the region of the\nWestern Balkans, cooperation among the countries in\nthe region, the fight against organized crime and full\ncooperation with the Hague Tribunal. No crime should\nbe left unpunished, and all perpetrators should be\nbrought to justice. Our goal is to join the process of\nEuropean integration as soon as possible, as well as the\nPartnership for Peace. The Thessaloniki summit of the\nEuropean Union and the countries of the Western\nBalkans defined clear goals. Serbia and Montenegro\nwill not let go of this chance for a European future. We\nhave a responsibility to create a better, more peaceful\nand dignified life for generations to come.\nThat is an obligation not only for us in Serbia and\nThat is a motive and force keeping us together in the\nUnited Nations to do all we can so that good may\nprevail over evil, peace over conflicts, democracy over\ndictatorship and economic prosperity over poverty. We\ncan do it together. This is not a utopia; it is a realistic\n6\n\npossibility which will be successful to the extent we\nare able to work together. Serbia and Montenegro trusts\nit can be done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me first pay\ntribute to the commitment and the courage of the\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General, Sergio\nVieira de Mello, and all the United Nations staff\nmembers who lost their lives in the unprecedented\nattack on United Nations headquarters in Baghdad. The\ndate of 19 August is engraved in the consciousness of\nthe international community and in the annals of the\nUnited Nations. We were forced to face a fact that we\nhave not tackled with the necessary determination in\nthe past: the vulnerability of United Nations staff\nworldwide. While legal protection can certainly not\nprevent an attack such as the one of 19 August, we\nmust nevertheless provide the best possible protection\nin this respect. We therefore hope that the General\nAssembly will take the necessary measures to make the\n23\n\nUnited Nations Convention on the Safety of United\nNations and Associated Personnel more effective.\nThe process that led to this engagement of the\nUnited Nations in Iraq constituted a major crisis for the\nexisting mechanisms dealing with threats to\ninternational peace and security, first and foremost the\nSecurity Council. This Organization is subject to and\ndependent on the political will of its Members. Its\ndistinctive quality lies in the fact that it provides\nlegitimacy in accordance with international law. This\noutstanding quality it must not lose, and we are all\nchallenged to stand up for this core function of the\nUnited Nations, which is a good part of its raison d''tre\nin today's world. The crisis the United Nations has\ngone through in connection with the action taken\nagainst Iraq will not be overcome simply by adopting a\npragmatic approach in dealing with the aftermath\nthereof. We welcome the ongoing discussions in the\nSecurity Council on a stronger and more meaningful\nrole of the United Nations in Iraq. At the same time,\nthere must also be a recognition that international law\ncontinues to be the foundation for our actions in\ndealing with problems of international peace and\nsecurity and that the rule of law needs to be applied\nboth at the national and at the international levels.\nLike any other State, in particular small States,\nLiechtenstein attaches the highest possible priority to\nthe rule of international law   expressed, inter alia, in\nour commitment to the International Criminal Court  \nand international relations that are based on rules\nderived from international legal standards. The United\nNations, as the core body for drafting and adopting\nthose standards, must continue to play its role in\ndefending and upholding them.\nIt is more obvious than ever that the Security\nCouncil is facing a particular challenge in this respect.\nWhile discussions in the media, in the academic world\nand in think tanks after the military action against Iraq\ninvariably have focused on the theme of the need for\nquick and effective Security Council reform, this sense\nof urgency was lost on the Open-ended Working Group\non Security Council Reform   the very body that has\nthe competence to make decisions on such reform.\nAfter 10 years of debate on this issue, we all appreciate\nthe difficulties attached to it, and they are indeed big.\nHowever, these difficulties are not sufficient\njustification for our failure to resolve an issue that\neverybody agrees is a major obstacle to the effective\nfunctioning of the Organization as a whole. It was\ntherefore rather disturbing to see the Open-ended\nWorking Group continue engaging in business as usual,\nwhile the world   the world we are supposed to\nrepresent, after all   unanimously called for effective\nand comprehensive reform.\nThe composition of the Council is clearly a\nreflection of a geopolitical reality that ceased to exist a\nlong time ago and enlargement thus continues to be an\nindispensable element of a meaningful reform of the\nCouncil. At the same time, there is also a clear need to\naddress other issues, such as the mechanisms for\ndecision-making and in particular the implementation\nof Security Council resolutions   whether adopted\nunder Chapter VI or Chapter VII   and issues of\nlegality. We hope that the initiative the Secretary-\nGeneral presented last week will contribute to making\nthe main organ that is at the centre of the world's\nattention a more effective and representative body.\nWhile the work on Security Council reform has\nbeen slow and unsatisfactory overall, it has\nnevertheless produced some important and positive\nresults. The Council has opened up to the membership\nas a whole and increasingly engaged in open debates,\nboth on thematic and on other issues of concern to the\nmembership as a whole. Liechtenstein welcomes this\ndevelopment and has participated in many of those\ndebates.\nThis increased openness of the Council, however,\ndoes not resolve the issue of its accountability. The\neffectiveness and credibility of the Council will be\nmuch enhanced if it bases its decision-making on a\ndialogue with the States on whose behalf it acts. In the\nrecent past, the Council has made some decisions that\nwere controversial and others that were of\nunprecedented reach. Some of the measures taken in\nconnection with financial sanctions impact directly on\nthe lives of individuals who have no means of bringing\ntheir grievances stemming from such decisions to the\nattention of the Council. Since the Council makes its\ndecisions on behalf of the entire membership and since\ntheir implementation is mandatory for all Member\nStates, there should be ways for all Member States to\nexpress the concerns they might have with regard to\nsuch decisions. The appropriate body for such\ndiscussions is obviously the General Assembly, the\nonly main organ of the organization of universal\nmembership.\n24\n\nWhen educating people about the United Nations,\nwe keep stumbling upon one issue: The need to explain\nthat the United Nations is not identical with the\nSecurity Council. The fact that the Council is seized\nwith the most burning issues and the most pressing\ninternational crises is only one part of the explanation\nfor this fact. The flip side which we must no longer\nignore is the increasingly futile struggle of the General\nAssembly to play its rightful role in accordance with\nthe Charter of the United Nations. An overburdened\nagenda, sterile debates, an overflow of documentation\nand the routine adoption of resolutions, that are but a\nrehash of past resolutions, have a combined devastating\neffect on the relevance of this body.\nThe General Assembly is today paralysed to a\npoint that keeps it from dealing with the politically\ncrucial issues and from acting in a quick and flexible\nmanner. A good illustration is the resolution in which\nthe General Assembly condemned the attack on the\nUnited Nations headquarters in Baghdad. Even though\neverybody shared the shock and dismay about this\nvicious attack, it took the General Assembly almost a\nmonth to adopt the said resolution.\nThe current state of the Assembly sadly plays into\nthe hands of its detractors. Presiding over the General\nAssembly is a very difficult task, Mr. President. If you\nare able to lead this Assembly out of its established\nroutine of paying lip service to its own reform and if\nyou are able to initiate the radical reform this body so\ndesperately needs, you will have created a lasting\nlegacy, and we will support you.\nMuch has been said about the crisis in which the\nUnited Nations finds itself after this difficult year.\nHowever, every crisis is an opportunity, and I hope that\nthe Assembly will take up its work in this spirit. Very\nrarely over the past few years has the public interest in\nthe United Nations been greater than it has over the\npast 12 months. We must ensure that the peoples of the\nworld continue turning to the United Nations as the\nplace where established rules are upheld, new\nchallenges are tackled and effective and responsible\naction is taken collectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Sergio Vieira de\nMello died for peace and human rights, causes that\nilluminated his life as a diplomat and a Brazilian.\nThere are other unfortunate examples from other\ntimes. We lost Anna Lindh, Swedish Minister for Foreign\nAffairs, and daughter of the one of the countries most\nclosely linked to social justice, who was educated in\nthe Nordic tradition of social advancement and\ncommitment to peace and democracy. Years earlier,\nanother Swede \u2014 Olaf Palme \u2014 died, a man of peace and\ngood will, to whom the international community bade\nfarewell with the song of Chilean Violeta Parra, Gracias a\nla vida, as a tribute to his struggles on behalf of the\npersecuted, the disenfranchised and the impoverished.\nAt the beginning of the 1960s, while on a peace\nmission, United Nations Secretary-General Dag\nHammarskj\u00f6ld, also from Sweden, died in what was\napparently an accident, amid the tangled, political\nturbulence in a Congo assailed by its enemies at home,\nas well as international factors that were depriving its\nsovereign leadership of vital oxygen. Still earlier,\nCount Folke Bernadotte \u2014 also Swedish \u2014 was a\nvictim of terrorism while on a peace mission for the\nUnited Nations in Jerusalem. Even before that, at the\nend of the Second World War, Swedish diplomat Raoul\nWallenberg, who, from Budapest, opened the way to\nfreedom for Jews who were being persecuted by Nazi\nbarbarity, disappeared without a trace.\nIt seems that nothing has changed. Social\ninjustice goes on forever. Conflicts repeat themselves.\nThe protagonists of historic change are physically\neliminated or morally destroyed. The advocacy of\nviolence is dragging us towards terrorism and war.\nInspired by the values of social justice,\ndemocracy and peace, on behalf of the President of the\n\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez Fr'as,\nI wish to reaffirm our support for the United Nations\nfrom a position that is critical yet unambiguous and\ntotally consistent with its loftiest goals. These same\nvalues inspire us in Venezuela, a country that prided\nitself on being the richest and most democratic nation in\nLatin America, but that squandered its privileged\nhistorical opportunities and fell into a process of ethnical\nand social decay that has brought us close to the abyss.\nAs a result, we had to assume a profound process of\ntransformation towards peace and democracy.\nThe sectors affected by the democratic\ntransformation have resorted to force to frustrate this\ncommitment of the majority. They have resorted to\nmilitary coup, oil sabotage, financial panic and media\nterrorism. Thank God that they failed, but they still\ncaused much damage.\nThe provisions of a Constitution approved by the\npeople in a referendum that expands the basis of\ndemocracy in a social State founded on law, and which\nis truly our country plan for all, have generated violent\nand anti-democratic opposition. Opening the way to\nparticipatory democracy and to an economy that is free,\nyet not anarchic, and that protects private freedoms\nwithout bowing to the almighty market, has stirred up\nthe most egoistic and insensitive sector of our country\nand of the international community \u2014 the neoliberals.\nOn this subject, His Holiness Pope Paul VI, in his\nencyclical Populorum Progressio, of March 1967, said\n\u201cThis unchecked liberalism leads to dictatorship\nrightly denounced by Pius XI as producing \u2018the\ninternational imperialism of money\u2019. One cannot\ncondemn such abuses too strongly by solemnly\nrecalling once again that the economy is at the\nservice of man.\u201d\nEntrepreneurs who took no risks, protected by a\ncolluding Government under a captive market, who did\nnot compete and who evaded taxation promoted a\nconspiracy against the legitimate Government of\nVenezuela, allied with international sectors that had\nbeen past beneficiaries.\nNow, therefore, our democracy, threatened\nunsuccessfully by certain Venezuelan media magnates,\ninvites members of the international community to see\nfor themselves in Venezuela the strength of our society\nand the immense civil liberties available in our country,\nincluding the broadest freedom of expression in our\nentire hemisphere. We will welcome witnesses to come\nto Venezuela and watch our television, read our\nnewspapers, interview the owners of the private media,\nlisten to commentators and news anchors, and draw\ntheir own conclusions. We need them to familiarize\nthemselves with the most hidden threat against\ndemocracy: the media dictatorship, a mirror of the\nculture of violence and mediocrity.\nOur process of social change in peace and\ndemocracy was interrupted by an assault against\nlegality by the media and their hypnotized followers. In\nscarcely three days, during their ephemeral de facto\nGovernment, all democratic institutions were\nabolished, before people and soldiers in the streets\nrestored normalcy. Today, we aspire to peace and\nreconciliation among Venezuelans. In our democracy,\nthere is room and hope for everyone.\nWe want also peace for our sister Colombia and\nin Northern Ireland, in the Balkans, between Jews and\nPalestinians and throughout the world. Peace is also the\naspiration of the Members of the United Nations, but\nthere will not be lasting peace without social justice; there\nwill not be stable democracies without social justice; and\nfreedom will be a fraud without social justice.\nWe congratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, on his balanced and firm guidance of the\nOrganization at the very difficult time that the world is\npassing through and on his wise and heartfelt message\nto this democratic Assembly.\nThis year, our activities in the General Assembly are\noverclouded by the attack on the United Nations\nheadquarters in Baghdad, where so many faithful servants\nof the Organization lost their lives, by the aftermath of\nthe war and the tense situation existing in the Middle East\nand by the alarming world poverty indices, a scenario that\nleads us to profound reflection and demands that we\nstrengthen the Organization\u2019s capacity to respond.\nVenezuela\u2019s action has been aimed at restoring\nand promoting multilateralism as a means and a\nblueprint for the shaping of a more democratic world.\nUnilateralism is monochromatic, worn out, oppressive\nand authoritarian; multilateralism is polychromatic,\nanimated, tolerant and democratic. In that conviction, we\nassumed the responsibility of chairing the Group of 77\nlast year and the Group of 15, whose summit meeting we\nwill hold next year in my country. There are mechanisms\nthrough which the developing world is expressing its\nmultilateral voice and its aspirations to the universal\ncommon good and to international social justice.\n37\n\nHistorical developments since 1945 require that\nwe have a more democratic and more representative\nSecurity Council. We must strengthen the General\nAssembly given its democratic and participatory nature.\nWe want the Economic and Social Council to be the\npowerful organ that it has not been allowed to be.\nThe Charter of the United Nations cannot be\ntailored to suit unilateral conveniences. War is not a\nromantic adventure that brings us to a happy ending in\nwhich the superheroes defeat the villains. Sometimes,\nwar turns into a death trap that causes harsher suffering\nthan the suffering that, in theory, it intends to alleviate.\nSometimes, it brings other wars, more violence and\nmore terrorism.\nUse of force by the State should not be\nundertaken at the discretion of those who happen to be\ninterested at the time. The responsibility of the\nOrganization\u2019s Members is collective, as the\ninternational security that we want to protect and\nguarantee must be. We all desire a better world for\nfuture generations, and why not for ourselves? We are\nall protagonists in this world drama; hegemonies\nappear archaic and authoritarian. Our objective is a\nstrengthened, universal and democratic Organization.\nA year ago in this Hall, we condemned the\nabominable terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, in\nwhich we lost thousands of citizens of the United\nStates and of other countries. That sudden holocaust\nwas perhaps the product of religious fundamentalism,\nbut it is unjust to single out the believers of one faith\nfor acts of extremist minorities when other minorities\nof believers have also committed crimes against\nhumanity in the name of the Lord. Terrorism destroys\nhuman lives, both of innocents and of combatants; it\ntorments family members, friends and peoples. There is\nno good terrorism, not in the name of an ethnicity or of\na nationality; not in the name of justice or of freedom;\nnot in the name of God.\nFour days ago, on behalf of the Bolivarian\nRepublic of Venezuela, I deposited the ratification\ninstruments of the International Convention for the\nSuppression of Terrorist Bombings, the International\nConvention for the Suppression of the Financing of\nTerrorism and the Optional Protocol to the Convention\non the Rights of the Child on the involvement of\nchildren in armed conflicts. Yesterday, the Venezuelan\nParliament made the Inter-American Convention\nagainst Terrorism a law of the Republic. We hope that\nthe ratification procedure will be completed within the\nOrganization of American States as soon as possible.\nNevertheless, we must continue the frontal assault\non the most widespread and destructive forms of\nterrorism: poverty and social exclusion. The developing\nworld is suffering from hunger, poverty and exclusion\ncaused by an unjust economic system enveloped in the\npractices of savage neo-liberalism and in the globalized\neconomy with an unfair scheme of commercial trade\nthat generates unemployment, exploitation, inequality\nand resentment. It is a system that attacks the dignity of\nthe human person. Its leaders are not accustomed to\nspeaking of social justice in their statements.\nOne initiative that the President of Venezuela has\nundertaken to fight poverty is the creation of an\ninternational humanitarian fund that we proposed at the\nInternational Conference on Financing for Development,\nheld at Monterrey; at the World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment, held at Johannesburg; and once again in\nthe General Assembly. The fund is designed to be a\nconsistent and innovative source for financing non-\nrefundable resources coming from the reduction of\nmilitary expenditures and money confiscated as a result\nof narco-trafficking and corruption. It will be an\neffective formula of international assistance to generate\nopportunities for economic and social progress in\ncountries excluded from traditional financing schemes.\nConverging proposals make us optimistic in the light of\nthis type of initiative.\nI conclude with a quotation from His Holiness\nJohn Paul II in 1994:\n\u201cThe world longs for peace and has a\ndesperate need of peace. Yet wars, conflicts,\nincreasing violence and situations of social unrest\nand endemic poverty continue to reap innocent\nvictims and to cause divisions between\nindividuals and peoples. At times peace appears a\ntruly unattainable goal! In a climate made cold by\nindifference and occasionally poisoned by hatred,\nhow can one hope for the dawn of an era of\npeace, which only feelings of solidarity and of\nlove can usher in?\u201d\nThat is how all Members of the Organization should\nconcentrate our efforts to find the necessary means that\nwill enable us to ensure peace and democracy at home\nand in the international community, availing ourselves\nof the best antidote to violence: social justice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like first of all\nto join earlier speakers in congratulating you, Sir, The\nHonourable Julian Robert Hunte, Minister for External\nAffairs, International Trade and Civil Aviation of Saint\nLucia, on your election as President of the General\nAssembly and to wish you every success as you carry\nout your duties. I would also like to extend our\nappreciation to Mr. Jan Kavan for the very efficient\nway in which he organized the work of the fifty-\nseventh session of the General Assembly.\nWe would like at the outset to express our\nprofound condolences to the whole family of the\nUnited Nations for the loss of Sergio Vieira de Mello, a\nbrave and able diplomat, and the other United Nations\npersonnel who died as a result of the deadly attack\nagainst the United Nations premises in Baghdad.\nI would like to take this opportunity to outline the\nposition of Uzbekistan on the key issues on the agenda\nof this forum. As is well known, since the events of 11\nSeptember 2001, the world has been on the verge of a\nfundamental transformation caused by new challenges\nand threats to security in many regions of our planet.\nThis harsh reality unequivocally increases the\nresponsibility of the United Nations as a unique\ninternational institution whose role cannot be\nsubstituted by anyone or anything. It also increases the\nresponsibility of each and every nation to preserve\npeace and stability in countering threats to modern\ncivilization such as international terrorism, extremism,\nand the ever-growing illegal drug trade.\nGiven our immediate proximity to Afghanistan,\nwe, the nations of Central Asia, know at first hand\nwhat these threats are and what they can bring to the\nworld, if timely steps are not taken to prevent and\neliminate them at their very core. In this context, it is\ndifficult to overestimate the significance of the actions\nof the international anti-terrorist coalition led by the\nUnited States of America and of the International\nSecurity Assistance Force, which are doing so much to\n12\n\nrevive and restore peace and stability in long-suffering\nAfghanistan.\nIn the meantime, despite the prerequisites for a\nfull-scale peace process in Afghanistan and sustained\ndevelopment of the region, the peace in the country is\nstill fragile. We believe that the resources of the\ninternational community, major international\norganizations and donor nations, as well as the\ncapabilities of neighbouring countries, should be more\nintensely engaged, as they are essential to post-conflict\nreconstruction.\nAfghanistan should become a harmoniously\nintegrated part of Central Asia, and this will positively\ncontribute to the enhancement of stability and security\nin the country and region. In view of the exceptional\nimportance of the socio-economic rehabilitation of\nAfghanistan, Uzbekistan is rendering assistance to the\nAfghan people in the reconstruction of damaged roads\nand the construction of new ones, as well as supplying\nelectricity to the northern provinces of Afghanistan.\nUzbek specialists have built eight large bridges along\nthe road from Mazari Sharif to Kabul. Uzbekistan is\nalso delivering humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan.\nMore than 1 million tonnes of humanitarian cargo have\nbeen shipped through our country\u2019s territory. We will\ncontinue to cooperate with international organizations,\nforemost with the United Nations, in this regard.\nThe lessons learned in recent years have\nconfirmed that overcoming the consequences of\nterrorism and extremism is more difficult than their\ntimely prevention. Moreover, the aggressive drive of\nterrorists to acquire weapons of mass destruction has\nbecome a new reality. The international community\nshould confront these far-reaching plans using an\neffective and streamlined system of measures to\nprevent access by terrorists to arms, new technologies,\nand dual-use material.\nUzbekistan welcomes the progress made in the\ndevelopment of legal instruments aimed at combating\ninternational terrorism. Tangible results, however, can\nbe achieved only by creating a global system of\ncomprehensive cooperation. That is why we support\nthe work of the Security Council Counter-Terrorism\nCommittee. We are confident that the regional anti-\nterrorism centre of the Shanghai Cooperation\nOrganization, established to collaborate with other\nsimilar centres, will prove to be an important\ncomponent of the global anti-terrorist system.\nTo combat the threat of international terrorism\nand extremism, it is important to confront the hotbeds\nall over the world of extremism and the dissemination\nof the ideology of fanatical ideologies. Despite current\nmeasures to isolate them, these centres still possess\nsubstantial financial resources and the capacity to\ninfluence the hearts and minds of young people and\nmobilize them for their far-reaching objectives. In\naddition to the measures being implemented today, it\nwould be desirable to establish a special United\nNations programme to promote education and\nawareness among young people and develop in them a\nstrong aversion to extremist ideology.\nUzbekistan maintains that the United Nations can\nand must play a more significant role in resolving the\nmost urgent issues of today\u2019s world. For this purpose,\nfirst and foremost, United Nations programmes must\nbecome more concrete and effective so that they can\nbetter target the real needs of regions. In this regard, I\nwould like to present the following views.\nFirst, Uzbekistan unequivocally supports further\ndevelopment of regional integration and considers the\nOrganization of Central Asian Cooperation (OCAC) as\na crucial mechanism of multilateral collaboration\namong the States of the region. We consider the\nOrganization\u2019s economic component, as well as the\nestablishment of water, energy, transport and\ncommunication consortia within its framework, as a\npriority.\nThe need to overcome the isolation of the region\nin terms of transport and communication is of utmost\nimportance among the objectives vital for sustainable\ndevelopment of the Central Asian States. In this\ncontext, I would particularly like to draw Members\u2019\nattention to the multilateral initiative to establish a\ntrans-Afghan transport corridor, which would provide\nlandlocked nations that encounter difficulties in\naccessing world markets with new access to seaports.\nUndoubtedly, the implementation of this project would\nboost trade and economic ties and fundamentally\nchange geopolitical and economic realities in the\nregion.\nWe believe it is high time for relevant United\nNations agencies, above all the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme, United Nations Industrial\nDevelopment Organization and the Economic and\nSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific, to develop\nprogrammes aimed at increasing the volume of aid to\n13\n\nthe region\u2019s States and Afghanistan for the purpose of\ndeveloping transport infrastructure and providing real\nsupport in communications projects.\nSecondly, Uzbekistan calls for strict compliance\nby all nations with a global nuclear non-proliferation\nregime. Today, in our view, the significance of the\ninitiative of Uzbekistan and other countries of the\nregion to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in\nCentral Asia has become paramount. We greatly\nappreciate the efforts of Secretary-General Kofi Annan,\nand the United Nations Department for Disarmament\nAffairs in supporting the expert group, which is\ncurrently working on a draft treaty.\nThe establishment of the zone is nearly complete,\nand, to legitimize it, Uzbekistan calls on all permanent\nSecurity Council members to develop a consolidated\nposition with the region\u2019s States on the provisions of\nthe draft treaty and its protocol.\nThirdly, Central Asia is facing a wide-scale\nassault by international drug cartels, which are using\nthe destructive power of international terrorism to\nprotect drug routes. Under these conditions, there is a\nneed for concerted efforts and effective international\nprogrammes under the auspices of the United Nations\nOffice on Drugs and Crime.\nWe believe that the establishment in Tashkent of\nthe regional information and coordination centre to\ncombat transboundary crime, proposed by President\nIslam Karimov during the visit of Secretary-General to\nUzbekistan last October, could become a tangible\ncontribution by the United Nations. We count on the\nsupport of the United Nations and donor countries in\nmaking this initiative a reality.\nToday, the United Nations faces the need to adapt\nits mechanisms to the realities of the new world,\nwhich, we think, is dependent upon the prompt\ncompletion of the process of reform of the\nOrganization. There is an urgent need to reorganize the\nSecurity Council so that it reflects current realities. An\nexpanded Security Council should include both\ndeveloped and developing nations. We reiterate our call\nfor inclusion of Germany and Japan in the Security\nCouncil as permanent members.\nIn conclusion, I would like to note that the\nprincipally new approaches taken by the United\nNations to the realities and prospects of Central Asia\nwill ultimately meet the fundamental interests of the\nentire world community. I am confident that this\nsession will give new momentum to the joint efforts of\nMember States to counter the threats and challenges of\nglobal and regional security.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me,\nSir, to discharge the agreeable duty of congratulating\nMr. Julian Hunte on his unanimous election to the\nPresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\nregular session. I would also like to commend your\npredecessor, His Excellence Mr. Jan Kavan, who\nfulfilled his mandate to the satisfaction of all.\nI note the efforts and specific involvement of the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, in the peaceful\nresolution of the complex crisis in the Great Lakes\nregion and Central Africa. The Congolese people\ncontinue to be grateful to the United Nations system\nfor the assistance that it gave it through the United\nNation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo and the Interim Emergency Multinational Force\ndeployed in Bunia and especially for strengthening the\npeacekeeping mandate of the United Nations\nOrganization Mission in the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo (MONUC).\nThe Congolese delegation associates itself with\nthe spirit of sympathy and solidarity elicited by the\nterrorist attack committed in Iraq against the great\nfamily of the United Nations. Indeed, the Congolese\npeople were also deeply moved to learn of the brutal\nand tragic death of the ardent defender of freedom and\nhuman rights, Sergio Vieira de Mello, to whom I pay\ntribute.\nAt a time when the entire world remembers the\ntragic events of 11 September 2001 in this very city of\nNew York, the United Nations was still mourning the\nloss of its staff and fell victim yet again to a terrorist\nattack in Iraq. The Congolese people renew their\nunequivocal condemnation of international terrorism.\nAfrica is not spared from the scourge of terrorism. It is\nenough to recall the tragic events in Nairobi, Dar es\nSalaam and Casablanca.\nThis session coincides with the final phase of the\nprocess of the establishment of transitional institutions\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is here that\nI would like to express my gratitude to the international\ncommunity, because its efforts, support and assistance\nin this peace process led to the signing and\nimplementation of the Comprehensive Agreement.\nIt is the hope of the people of the Congo and the\nTransitional Government to see the United Nations\nredouble its efforts and pursue its support for the\nprocess of peace and reunification now underway. At a\ntime when this lengthy war is coming to an end, it\nshould be noted that the Ituri district is still a gaping\nwound that the slightest careless mistake could\ninflame. While the deployment of the Interim\nEmergency Multinational Force in Bunia allowed for a\nsharp reduction in acts of violence and contributed to\n15\n\nstabilization of the security and humanitarian situation,\nthe situation in the provinces of North and South Kivu\nremain of concern.\nIt is important that neighbouring countries respect\nthe sovereignty, territorial integrity and political\nindependence of the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nso as to recreate a climate conducive to a return to the\nnormalization of relations in the region.\nAside from the numerous human lives affected by\nthis war, the plants and the animals have also endured\nimmeasurable damage. Our determination to restore\neverything that was destroyed is equalled only by our\nhope of turning our country into an oasis of peace for\nall. We believe that a United Nations fund to support\nthis effort would be fair compensation.\nAll the present efforts of the Transition\nGovernment for the reunification of the national\nterritory, the pacification of the country, the\nreconstruction of infrastructure and the restoration of\nState authority are working to achieve the ultimate\nobjective of transition, namely, the holding of free,\ntransparent and democratic elections. It is in that\ncontext that my country voices the hope that the\ninternational community will provide the necessary\nassistance at all stages of the electoral process.\nIn the peace process now underway, an area\nwhich is of critical importance and an imperative is\nthat of independent justice, whose equitable\nadministration would mark the end of impunity. On the\ndomestic level, the Transition Government is working\nto conclude successfully the reform advocated here, for\nequitable justice is the real proof of national\nreconciliation.\nOn the international level we believe that the\nmajor objective is the establishment, with the\nassistance of the United Nations, of an international\ncriminal tribunal for the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo to deal with crimes of genocide, crimes against\nhumanity, including rape used as a weapon of war, and\nmass violations of human rights. Moreover, to ensure\nthe best possible coverage for protection of human\nrights, as well as of humanitarian rights, the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo has ratified several\ninternational conventions, including the Rome Statute\nestablishing the International Criminal Court.\nGiven the important provision for the protection\nof human rights contained in that Statute, the Congo,\non the basis of respect for fundamental principles that\ngovern international relations, intends to see that there\nis strict respect for the implementation of that\ninstrument.\nAs one can see, a new era has dawned in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, an era of peace and\nreconciliation, of national unity and the re-\nestablishment of State authority, an era of\nreconstruction, economic recovery and development to\nconsolidate and put to use the gains of arduous political\nnegotiations.\nAware of challenges and looking toward the post-\nconflict period, the Transition Government has placed\nthe well-being of the Congolese people at the centre of\nits concerns. It intends to imprint on its programme the\nrequisite good governance, as well as macroeconomic\nmanagement that ensures the security of investments,\nrespects social rights and guarantees protection and\nlegal and judicial security for employment, business\nand foreign investment.\nWe remain aware of the importance of sharing\nthose resources likely to contribute to economic\nintegration, and we intend to conduct a policy of\ndialogue, openness and good-neighbourliness. The\npriority given to regional integration is a sign of our\nadherence to the initiative of the international\nconference on peace, security, democracy and\ndevelopment in the region of the Great Lakes and of\nCentral Africa. The Congolese people consider the\nholding of this forum a historic opportunity that must\nbe seized so that it can lead to the application of\nfundamental principles of international law.\nAs we are determined to maintain good\nneighbourly relations and relations of mutual respect\nwith border countries, and thus refuse to serve as a\nrear-guard base for subversive movements against the\ncountries surrounding us, we in turn will reject\ninterference or destabilization from neighbouring\ncountries.\nFor us there is a need to do everything possible in\norder to build peace in the region and to effectively\naffirm: a spirit of solidarity, of sharing and of peaceful\ncoexistence at the regional and global level; the fight\nagainst poverty and the HIV/AIDS pandemic; control\nof the movement and proliferation of small arms and\nlight weapons, which are claiming victims every day;\nand the campaign against the proliferation of\nantipersonnel mines.\n16\n\nThroughout my statement I have condemned\nterrorism in all forms. I also spoke of the consequences\nof the bloody, unjust and unacceptable war which has\njust devastated the fundamental infrastructure of the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. I have also referred\nto the significant progress made in the peace process\nunderway while emphasizing the importance of the\nsupport of the international community for the success\nof that process, which will culminate in the\norganization of elections.\nWe are aware and convinced that it is within our\npower to play a stabilizing role in Central and Southern\nAfrica upon which the stability and economic recovery\nof the region depend.\nI conclude by reaffirming the will of the people\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo to cooperate\nwith the international community in building a better\nworld that is designed to build peace and greater\nsolidarity among peoples and nations.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of\nthe Government of the Republic of San Marino, let me\ncongratulate Mr. Julian Hunte on his election to the\npresidency of the fifty-eighth session of the General\nAssembly. His election brings us great satisfaction\nsince he also represents a small country, Saint Lucia,\nlike ours.\nI also wish to express my country\u2019s appreciation\nfor the fruitful work and remarkable abilities of former\nAssembly President Jan Kavan. It has been a privilege\nfor us to cooperate with him.\nI cannot start my speech without mentioning the\ncowardly attacks on the United Nations offices in\nBaghdad, which took a heavy toll of lives including\nthat of Sergio Vieira de Mello, Special Representative\nof the United Nations Secretary-General in Iraq.\nOn behalf of the Government and people of San\nMarino, I take this opportunity to reiterate our most\nsincere condolences to the Secretary-General and the\nfamilies of the victims. Furthermore, we would like to\nexpress our deep appreciation to the United Nations for\nthe fundamental role it is playing in Iraq during this\ndifficult transition period for the Iraqi people. The\nnecessary conditions for social and economic\ndevelopment will be established only through security\nand stability, independence and democracy, the rule of\nlaw and respect for human rights.\nIn light of the above, I wish to express the hope\nthat the transitional Iraqi Governing Council,\nwelcomed and supported by the Security Council, may\noperate efficiently so that Iraq can fully enjoy its right\nto self-determination, its own sovereignty and establish\na democratic and representative Government,\ninternationally recognized and able to guarantee the\nconditions necessary for the country\u2019s reconstruction.\nWe also hope that the United Nations may further\nstrengthen its active humanitarian and civil role in\nfavour of the Iraqi population, so as to contribute to the\nrebirth of that nation through democracy and\ndevelopment. We hope that all countries cooperating in\nIraq to improve security and order, under the aegis of\nthe United States of America, after assuring a decisive\ncontribution to the liberation of the country from the\nprevious regime, will reach an agreement with this\nOrganization.\nTo this end, the drafting of a new Security\nCouncil resolution, the outcome of a lively debate that\nis going on now, would be a major political and\ndiplomatic achievement. It would definitely pave the\nway to democracy and progress in Iraq and embody the\nwill of many different Governments under the aegis of\nthe United Nations.\n29\n\nIn line with its tradition of solidarity, and as\ndemonstrated in recent years through its support of\nhumanitarian projects in Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nKosovo, the Middle East and in several African\ncountries, often in the context of ad hoc programmes\nand United Nations special missions, my country will\nbe pleased to contribute to the reconstruction process in\nIraq. For the achievement of this objective, the\nforthcoming conference on the reconstruction of Iraq is\nparticularly interesting.\nThe tragic, painful and unforgettable events of 11\nSeptember 2001 have also marked the proliferation of\ninternational terrorism and the escalation of terrorist\nattacks.\nToday\u2019s gathering in this important forum is a\nclear indication of our country\u2019s position and its\nsignificance is increased by the universal character of\nthis meeting.\nThe creation of the United Nations nearly 60\nyears ago, at the end of Second World War, attested to\na unanimous desire for lasting peace and justice. I\nbelieve that at the beginning of the third millennium it\nis the responsibility of the Organization to reflect\neffectively the will of States to fulfil that original\ncommitment and keep its original spirit alive through\ndialogue, mediation and cooperation. Conscious of this,\nSan Marino reaffirms its decision to reject all forms of\nterrorism and to contribute fully to its defeat, as\ntestified to by the Republic\u2019s accession to several\ninternational instruments of the United Nations and\nEuropean organizations.\nLikewise, San Marino has promptly followed up on\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001) and will continue\nto monitor terrorism at the national level, as can be noted\nby the implementation of the guidelines to combat the\nphenomenon of terrorism and its related aspects.\nUnfortunately, it is evident that terrorism, aside\nfrom being inspired by fanaticism and fundamentalism,\nis too often linked to underdevelopment and injustice;\ntheir victims can, in turn, become instruments of\nviolence and oppression. However, terrorism can also\nbe countered through the active support of international\ncooperation programmes to overcome disparities,\npoverty, discrimination, the violation of the rights of\nindividuals and peoples, a total absence of opportunities,\nand, as a result, hopelessness, in particular among the\nyoung, who are the future of mankind.\nOur collective efforts to restore favourable\nconditions for dialogue and mutual acceptance must\nnot be weakened by the growing concern of persistent,\nserious obstacles to the road map for peace in the\nMiddle East, where negotiations and agreements are\nbeing jeopardized by renewed terrorist attacks, hatred\nand retaliation. We are convinced that the Israeli and\nPalestinian peoples must be ensured the indisputable\nright to live freely in their own territory, where they\ncan exercise their full sovereignty in security and peace.\nThe success of the globalization process under\nway will ultimately depend on achieving peace and\ndevelopment for all. Within the framework of effective\nglobal cooperation, the role played by San Marino is\ninextricably linked to its tradition of freedom,\nindependence and democracy. Those principles, which\nhave characterized the Republic\u2019s 1700 years of existence,\ncontinue to inspire its international policy today.\nIn 1854 San Marino became the first European\ncountry to ban the death penalty. My country believes\nthat this issue, which is so important and topical, must\nremain a top priority for the General Assembly, even\nthough it is not on the agenda for this session.\nIn the field of human rights, the ethics of\ndiversity requires the acceptance of the human\ncondition. In that spirit, San Marino has followed with\nspecial attention the negotiations within the working\ngroup for the drafting of an international convention on\nthe rights of persons with disabilities.\nSan Marino continues to pay great attention to the\nfollow-up given to initiatives on HIV/AIDS being\ncarried out by the United Nations and to the search for\nadequate responses so as to prevent the spread of new\nepidemics such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\n(SARS). San Marino is also following with great\ninterest the work of the working group for the drafting\nof an international convention against the reproductive\ncloning of human beings, spurred by the conviction\nthat the cloning of human beings is an immoral and\ninhuman degeneration of biotechnological development\nand that such an abhorrent practice would be contrary\nto human dignity. The important ethical and moral\nimplications of this issue cannot be separated from\npurely scientific questions. We hope that the United\nNations will continue to strive for the protection of the\nfundamental rights of human beings.\nAdditionally, in the area of human rights, San\nMarino recently extended a standing invitation to the\n30\n\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights to visit the Republic whenever\nnecessary in order better to carry out its mandate.\nI wish to recall that San Marino was the first\nWestern European country to ratify the Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court, confident that the Court\nwould satisfy the widespread desire for justice and put\nan end to impunity for the perpetrators of the most\nserious crimes against the international community as a\nwhole. Let me also express our best wishes to the\nCourt, which is composed of authoritative judges, and\nconvey our hope that it will now be able to work in\naccordance with the objectives of justice, security and\npeace on which it is based. We are confident its work\nwill be fruitful and that it will always act independently\nand impartially.\nAll the objectives set out in the Millennium\nDeclaration could be achieved if an additional $50 billion\nper year were granted for development assistance, at a\ntime when global military expenditures total $850 billion.\nWe also wish to express our appreciation for the positive\nachievements of United Nations peacekeeping missions\ndeployed to many areas of the world afflicted by\nconflicts. Such results should encourage Governments\nto increase their support for those missions, which\npromote lasting, sustainable peace and the re-\nestablishment of democracy and the rule of law.\nSan Marino will continue to participate in joint\naction for the total elimination of anti-personnel mines.\nIn that context, San Marino urges countries that have\nnot yet done so to accede to the Ottawa Convention.\nThe tenth anniversary of the International Year of\nthe Family in 2004 will provide further incentive to\nreflect on and analyse the living conditions of our\npopulations, paying particular attention to children, the\nelderly and the most vulnerable in our societies. Such\ngroups deserve greater consideration from society.\nSociety must promote effective projects for education,\nsolidarity and adequate support.\nOnly a few days ago, the United Nations\nCommittee on the Rights of the Child reviewed San\nMarino\u2019s initial report on its implementation of the\nprovisions of the Convention on the Rights of the\nChild. The relevant measures now in force will soon be\nsupplemented by new ones in support of the family.\nIn underlining the validity of the reform\nprogramme started by the Secretary-General, we deem\nit necessary to continue efforts to reform the General\nAssembly, which is the most representative body of our\nOrganization. Indeed, the Assembly should enjoy\ngreater authority. We hope that agreement can also be\nreached on Security Council reform, and San Marino\nreiterates its support for the inclusion of a larger\nnumber of non-permanent members, in order to make\nthe Council more representative and democratic.\nLet me stress once again my country\u2019s\nappreciation for and commitment to activities carried\nout by the United Nations in building a world of peace,\nsolidarity and development.\nIt is in that spirit that this morning I signed three\nimportant international instruments: the Convention on\nthe Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against\nWomen, the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control,\nrecently adopted at the fifty-sixth Assembly of the World\nHealth Organization and the Second Optional Protocol to\nthe International Covenant on Civil and Political\nRights, aimed at abolishing the death penalty.\nWe need to continue our action at the international\nlevel despite all the difficulties and tensions that exist,\nbearing in mind that our joint efforts are essential to\nfinding a solution to the emergencies and concerns of\ntoday. Bringing about the necessary changes, we will\nbe able to reconfirm the validity of the basic principles\nof this Organization. We will responsibly set the\nconditions for our future and thus meet the\nexpectations of our peoples and our hearts.\nWhile expressing my best wishes to you, Mr\nPresident, to the Secretary-General and to all United\nNations officers, as well as to all Member States. I\nassure them that San Marino will be at their side in\nmeeting all of these challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

At the\nheart of the tragedy in that nation is the unprecedented\nassault on the ethic and function of multilateralism in\nworld affairs represented by the Security Council, the\nonly guarantor of global peace, order and security.\nSome powerful Western nations, led by the\nGovernment of the United States of America and the\nGovernment of Britain, went into a war of unclear\nobjectives in the face of clear opposition from the rest\nof the world, and, as we now know, with clear\nopposition from their own people as well.\nIt was and remains an unjust, illegitimate war \u2014\nunjust to the extent that it was founded and prosecuted\non false words; illegitimate to the extent that it was not\nsanctioned by the United Nations and has transformed\nitself into an effective occupation of a sovereign\npeople.\nThere can never be world peace under conditions\nof foreign invasion and occupation. There can never be\nworld security and order when naked power suspends,\nand substitutes with unilateralism, the hallowed\nprinciple of multilateralism, on the basis of which we\nhave made, kept, preserved and expanded peace since\nthe Second World War. We tell the General Assembly\nthat as a people from a continent that has suffered a\nsimilar fate in recent history; indeed, as a people who\nhad to overthrow foreign imperial occupation through\ncostly struggles.\n2\n\nIt is a strange logic that the Iraqis pay for a bad\npresident, a bad government and a bad war by\noccupation and loss of their sovereignty. Let us state\nhere quite clearly to both Britain and the United States\nthat the Iraqi people must have the sovereign right to\ndetermine the affairs of their country restored\nimmediately. Like all peoples of the world, their love\nfor freedom and self-rule is just as strong and just as\ndeep as their hatred for bad leadership and bad\ngovernment. Like all peoples of the world, they are\nunwilling to be occupied and governed by a foreign\ncoalition, however willing and powerful it may be. No\npeople want that, and we of Africa know it.\nWe must reject the present road map of naked\nunilateralism for consent-oriented statecraft in world\naffairs. What is the future of the world without the\nUnited Nations? We hope the coalition that willingly\nwent to war with Iraq without Security Council\nsanction is now willing to admit that defeating others is\nnot always the same as winning peace and that wars are\nended not by proclamations, but by just settlements.\nIndeed, we hope that they have learned from their\ncostly mistakes and are willing to let the United\nNations reassert its authority in the broader search for\npeace and security in Iraq.\nIf we are to overcome crises that could result in\ncalamitous wars and social breakdowns, and to achieve\npeace and stability with justice, we need humane global\ngovernance under the leadership of the United Nations,\nas distinct from a unilateral global state and\ngovernment. Only that type of governance can make\nand build peace, and indeed keep peace for mankind.\nLet it not be said that Zimbabwe enjoys\ncriticizing the United States and Britain for the sake of\ncriticism. Our criticisms are founded on sound,\nfundamental principles. Let it not be forgotten that\nZimbabwe was in the chair when the Security Council\nauthorized the first Gulf War. We stood firmly then by\nthe United Nations and the countries, including the\nUnited States and Britain, that removed Iraq from\nKuwait. We did so on the basis that expansionism and\noccupation of a sovereign country and people cannot be\nright, can never be just and warranted under any\ncircumstances. We admired the deployment of power to\njust ends, under the auspices of the United Nations. It\nis the absence of the same ingredients that explains our\nindignation and our sharp censure of the so-called\ncoalition of the willing that does not seem to recognize\nthat both the Iraqis and the world are unwilling to\nsanction the means employed and the end achieved.\nThe inadequacies of existing international\ninstitutions in dealing with present challenges is a sad\ntestimony to their flawed foundational conceptions\namidst changing circumstances. We have anachronistic\ninstitutions relying too comfortably on traditional\nnorms to address new challenges. Decades after the\ndefeat of Nazi Germany, does the world still need to\nrely on a system founded on the principle of rewarding\nthe allied Powers for defeating Nazi Germany and\nthereby bringing post-world war peace?\nAt its foundation, the United Nations collective\nsystem allowed two classes of response. If a minor\nPower committed aggression and there was unanimity\namong the five permanent members of the Security\nCouncil, a collective response could follow. However,\nif a permanent member was opposed to such action it\ncould use its veto. In historical terms, that approach\nrepresents the institutionalization of a particular form\nof world order, namely, the immediate post-1945 world\norder, which sought to reward and empower the allied\nPowers as the only competent stewards of world peace.\nBut the world has changed a great deal since then. Just\nas many new nations have emerged since then, the\nallied Powers have also evolved in ways that easily\nmake them actors of injustice, and therefore threats to\nworld peace. Global power is now unipolar.\nThe reality today is that we cannot treat the\nUnited Nations system as given. The institutional\narrangements in place were relevant only for a\nspecified period, and must inevitably be adapted,\ntransformed or even radically modified as material\ncircumstances have changed and prevailing meanings,\npractices and purposes have been challenged by new\ninter-subjective voices. In today\u2019s unipolar world, what\ncan the Security Council do to one of its permanent\nmembers whose actions threaten world peace?\nAt a time when citizens everywhere are pressing\nfor a greater say in national governance, it is\nimperative for us as heads of State and Government to\nseek, in turn, a fairer representation through the\ndemocratization of multilateral organizations such as\nthe United Nations, the Bretton Woods institutions and\nthe World Trade Organization. What is good for the\ngoose must surely be good for the gander. The present\nautocracy in global governance must be challenged\nstoutly so that all nations, big or small, have an equal\n3\n\nsay and equal power in the way in which we govern\nworld affairs.\nThe Security Council just has to democratize, and\nthat means re-examining its composition and the way\nin which power is distributed, and therefore exercised,\nwithin that crucial body. I am happy that the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s current report entitled \u201cImplementation of\nthe United Nations Millennium Declaration\u201d, is in\nagreement with our concerns that\n\u201cThe composition of the Security Council \u2014\nunchanged in its essentials since 1945 \u2014 seems\nat odds with the geopolitical realities of the\ntwenty-first century.\u201d [A/58/323, para. 96]\nIn the light of that stark reality, it is evident that the\ndecisions of the Security Council, which have a decisive\nimpact on events in the real world, increasingly lack\nlegitimacy in the eyes of the developing world.\nEven the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and\nthe International Bank for Reconstruction and\nDevelopment, popularly known as the World Bank,\nwhose raison d\u2019\u00eatre was to provide assistance to the\ndeveloping world, have succumbed to the whims and\ncaprices of the major Powers. The Bretton Woods\ninstitutions, in their current form and practice, are\ndesigned to deny developing countries the capacity to\nchart their independent developmental path. The\nextraneous conditionalities of the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions, imposed by the powerful countries for the\nqualification or disqualification of beneficiaries, are\nintended to further the national interests of the big\nPowers and to justify wanton interference in the affairs\nof small nations.\nIs it not a baffling irony that a small country like\nZimbabwe, which, after it responded positively to a\ndistress call by a neighbour suffering aggression \u2014\neven by United Nations reckoning \u2014 was deemed\nineligible to access IMF and World Bank funding for\nthe very reason of having gone to the rescue of that\nneighbour? One hopes that the new, recent realization\nby the World Bank that land reforms are at the heart of\npoverty eradication mark the beginning of a new\noutlook on its part.\nNotwithstanding that determined and resolute\nattempt at frustrating our land-reform programme, the\nfast-track phase through which we reasserted our\nsovereign right over our land as a principal resource is\nlargely concluded, and is now yielding tangible\nbenefits to the vast majority of our people. There is a\nnew sense of empowerment, yielding a happy sense of\nownership, which has brought thousands upon thousands\nof hitherto marginalized families back into the economic\nmainstream. Zimbabwe\u2019s National Economic Revival\nProgramme gives clear priority to agriculture as the\nengine for economic revival and growth. We are\nforging ahead on the basis of our own efforts and\nsupport from nations of good will. We are determined to\nmove on and succeed. A land review committee recently\nset up by my Government to assess the whole reform\nprogramme has now submitted its findings, which will\nhelp us in mapping the way forward to achieve\nsustainable development in the agricultural sector, in\nline with the criteria and objectives we set ourselves.\nIn the area of world trade, Zimbabwe believes in\na multilateral trading system that serves well all\nmembers of the trading nations. It is therefore a matter\nof some grave regret that the developing countries of\nthe South and those of the developed North could not\nreconcile their differences, and thus rendered\ninconclusive the Canc\u00fan mid-term review of the World\nTrade Organization\u2019s (WTO) Doha Development\nAgenda. We in the South were right to reject the\nso-called new issues that the North insisted be\nnegotiated first. We urge the North to engage in honest\nnegotiations and to desist from trying to use the WTO\nforum for hegemonic ends.\nZimbabwe and other countries in the subregion\ncontinue to grapple with the effects of the HIV/AIDS\nscourge. To combat the epidemic, my Government has\ndeclared HIV/AIDS a national emergency. We have\nembarked on a national programme of prevention, the\nhighlight of which consists of mass mobilization to\ndeepen awareness and understanding of the disease. As\na result of that campaign, our infection rate in the\nsexually active 15 to 49 age group has come down\nfrom 35 per cent to 24 per cent. Through our national\nefforts, the AIDS levy has to date raised $8 billion.\nThat money is being distributed through a\ndecentralized structure that ensures accessibility right\ndown to the village level. We call upon the\ninternational community to complement our efforts.\nThe situation in the Middle East remains grave\nand troubled. A conflict that is quite costly on both\nsides of the divide continues unabated, with the only\nresponse from the international community coming by\nway of episodic judgements that maldistribute blame\non the basis of individual national interests. Especially\n4\n\nwrong is the belief that settlement can come only through\nostracizing and even eliminating the leadership of the\nPalestinian people. Assassinations and extrajudicial\nkillings must be rejected as a formula for peace.\nZimbabwe welcomes the measures adopted by the\nSecurity Council aimed at strengthening the peace process\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We are\nencouraged by the increase, under a Chapter VII mandate,\nof the force levels of the United Nations Organization\nMission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as\nwell as by the imposition of a 12-month arms embargo\nover areas in the troubled eastern part of the Congo.\nWe also urge the international community to rally\nbehind the peace initiative of the Economic Community\nof West African States aimed at bringing peace to Liberia.\nThe transition to peace in Liberia has confirmed that, with\ninternational goodwill and support, African solutions to\nAfrican problems are possible. To strengthen the peace\nprocess, we call upon the international community to\naddress the humanitarian crisis facing the Liberian\npeople as a result of a debilitating civil war.\nMy country remains committed to playing a\npositive role in peacekeeping efforts carried out under\nthe auspices of the United Nations. Indeed, we have so\nfar played our part fully and magnificently.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly\naffords me the special privilege, honour and pleasure of\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your assumption of the\noffice of President of the General Assembly. As a\ndistinguished son of our neighbouring island, Saint\nLucia, you do great honour to your country and to the\nwhole Caribbean Community family. I take great pride\nin what you, Sir, a fellow Foreign Minister and my dear\nfriend, have accomplished, and trust that, under your\nastute leadership, this fifty-eighth session will chart the\nright course, which will enable the Organization to\nfulfil the expectations of mankind for a secure,\npeaceful and prosperous world. Who knoweth but that\nby some divine order you have come to the presidency\nof this body at such a time as this.\nLet me first express, on behalf of the Government\nand people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,\ndeepest sympathy to Secretary-General Kofi Annan\nand the entire United Nations family on the loss of\nSergio Vieira de Mello and other United Nations\npersonnel in the terrorist attack in Baghdad. Those\ndedicated United Nations workers strived for peace and\njustice for the people of the world. They lived for that\ncause, and, tragically, they gave their lives for that\ncause. We share the pain of this loss and the\nbewilderment over it, and pay tribute to all those\nUnited Nations staff members who put duty before self\nin the service of mankind.\nMy Government acknowledges with appreciation\nthe sterling work being done in difficult conditions all\nover the developing world by United Nations agencies,\nfrom peacekeeping and the restoration of democracy to\ndevelopment cooperation and humanitarian aid. I also\nwish to single out for particular mention the United\nNations Development Fund for Women and the United\nNations Population Fund. We urge Member States to\ncontinue to give support and assistance to these\norganizations, which make such a difference,\nparticularly in the lives of women and children, in the\npoorest sectors of the world.\nWe have heard speaker after speaker, over the\ncourse of the past week, suggesting that the United\nNations is in crisis. Many have proposed solutions for\nthe rectification of this unhappy state of affairs. It is\nmy Government\u2019s contention that the General\nAssembly needs to retake its place as the central\nplatform of the Organization, because it is the only\ntruly democratic arm of the United Nations. In this\nregard, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines intends to\nparticipate fully in the ongoing debate on reform which\nwill be led by you, Mr. President, and we are hopeful\nthat, with your able guidance, some real progress can\n2\n\nbe made in this fifty-eighth session. Of particular\nconcern to small missions like my own is the volume\nand variety of work between September and December\nevery year. The way the work of the General Assembly\nis designed makes it difficult for us to make the kind of\ncontribution that we would wish for the effective and\nefficient operation of the Organization. The Secretary-\nGeneral said in his report on the revitalization of the\nGeneral Assembly:\n\u201cThe proliferation of meetings and official\ndocuments places excessive demands on both the\nSecretariat and Member States. Many smaller\nMember States now find it practically impossible\nto play a meaningful role in even the most crucial\nactivities of the General Assembly and the\nEconomic and Social Council\u201d. (A/57/387,\npara. 23)\nIf the work of the General Assembly could be\nredesigned so as to spread the work load more evenly\nthroughout the calendar year, it would enable small\nmissions like that of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\nto participate fully in the work of the Organization.\nThe debate on the reform of the Security Council\nis fraught with many difficulties and challenges. It is\nmy Government\u2019s view that the simple enlargement of\nthe representation on the Security Council may not by\nitself necessarily lead to greater democratization of that\nbody. No matter how many reform theorems are\nadvanced, the will has to come from the permanent\nmembers of the Council that wield the veto. My\nGovernment has already urged an increase in the\nmembership of the Council, both permanent and non-\npermanent, but it seems to us that as long as the veto\ncontinues to exist, the Council will not be truly\nrepresentative of the wishes of the States Members of\nthis Organization and multinational diplomacy will be\nendangered. The Government of Saint Vincent and the\nGrenadines makes so bold as to say that the solution\nmay also well lie in the removal of the power of veto,\nto allow for more democracy, greater participation,\nopenness and transparency. Only then, perhaps, will\nthis Organization regain its integrity and respect.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines cherishes the\nrelationships that it enjoys with all countries, both large\nand small, represented here at the United Nations. The\nUnited Nations Charter confers that freedom of\nrepresentation on all peace-loving and democratic\nStates. Yet my country continues to be deeply troubled\nthat Taiwan is still being excluded from this body.\nWhile we seek to make the United Nations more\nefficient and effective through much-needed reform,\nwe can advance the cause and the call for reform by\nmaking the United Nations more inclusive through the\nadmission to membership of Taiwan and its 23 million\npeople, who have no voice in the United Nations.\nTaiwan is an exemplary global citizen that maintains\nfriendly relations with almost every country in the\nworld. We would wish for this Organization to be the\ncatalyst that promotes constructive dialogue and\nfriendly engagement so that the Taiwan situation can\nbe resolved in a peaceful, just and equitable way to the\nbenefit of the entire global family.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines is proud to be a\nState party to the Rome Statute of the International\nCriminal Court (ICC). We believe in the fundamental\nrole that the ICC has to play in our collective quest for\npeace and the promotion of the rule of law and justice.\nWe are determined to uphold its integrity.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines is proud of our\ncontribution to the emerging Caribbean civilization.\nLet me quote from a recent speech by our Prime\nMinister, The Honourable Ralph Gonsalves:\n\u201cThe reassembling of the African, Asiatic and\nEuropean fragments forms the basis of our very\nCaribbean civilization itself, which is at once\nshaped and yet evolving. Fundamentally, too, our\nCaribbean civilization, like all civilizations, has\nbeen built on labour \u2014 the producers \u2014 and the\ncontours of the society fashioned by the social\norganization of labour\u201d.\nMy small country has made the painful\ntransformation from colonialism to independent\ndemocracy in 25 short years. Our people chose not the\npath leading to war and conflict, but rather opted for\nthe highway of democracy, racial harmony and respect\nfor human rights conducting us to peace, tranquillity\nand future prosperity. But we are hampered in our\nquest. My country, like others in the region, is in\ndanger of losing an entire generation to the scourge of\nHIV/AIDS. We need the help of the international\ncommunity in the fight against this dreaded disease for\nthe preservation of our society.\nOur banana industry, which is the engine that\ndrives our economy, is shortly to succumb to the greed\n3\n\nof certain multinational companies, with the active\nassistance of the World Trade Organization. Without\nthe banana industry, whose doomsday rapidly\napproaches, our hardworking peasant farmers will\nbecome just another casualty of globalization. The\nEuropean Union mandates that its sugar farmers get\npaid 50 euros per tonne \u2014 or five times the world\nmarket price. Their farmers then dump their product on\nthe market, thus depressing prices for farmers\nelsewhere. So we may shortly have to bid farewell to\nthe sugar industries of developing nations like\nBarbados, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Mozambique\nand Guatemala. The United States of America spends\nmore than $3 billion dollars of its taxpayers\u2019 money\nevery year to subsidize its cotton growers. This,\nnaturally, signals death to the cotton farmers of\nBurkina Faso, Benin, Mali, Chad and other developing\nnations. How can the developed world, which\ncontinues to subsidize its farmers and which touts\nglobalization as the cure for all economic ills, continue\ndefending the indefensible?\nCanc\u00fan, as we all now know, was an abysmal\nfailure. We went there hoping to be led into the\nPromised Land \u2014 only to find ourselves lost and\nabandoned in the wilderness. We will continue our\ncrusade for economic stability and democratic harmony\nin our country, but it is self-evident that we need the\nhelp of the developed part of the world in order to be\nviable. It will benefit no one if small countries like\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines are marginalized and\nleft to flounder. We are a vulnerable country. The\nreasons why small island developing States are\nespecially vulnerable are too well known to be repeated\nhere. Our requests for special and differential treatment\nin the WTO are completely justified and, for the most\npart, largely ignored.\nMy Government is cognizant of the fact that\nterrorism threatens us all. We are therefore fully\nengaged in the process of implementing Security\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) \u2014 a process which has\nstretched our limited resources. The oft-repeated\npromises of help in this process are proving to be, like\nso many other promises made within these hallowed\nhalls, just that \u2014 promises. Yet we read with grave\nconcern in the New York Times just last week that,\nbetween them, two of the giants of this Organization\nexport arms worth nearly $20 billion every year \u2014 the\nmajority, of course, to developing nations. What do\narms do in developing nations? They are the fuel that\nfeeds the flames of conflict and terrorism.\nUnless we can collectively find the courage and\nwisdom to tackle the problems of poverty, disease and\ndespair, all the weapons in the world will not prevent\nthe spread of terrorism. We need to move beyond using\nthe United Nations as a talk shop and come together as\nresponsible nations to tackle the root causes of\nterrorism.\nThe security which the poorer nations of the\nworld desire is obtained not through the force of arms,\nbut in relief from burdensome debt, employment\nopportunities, shelter, food, clean water, a healthy\nenvironment and access to medical care and life-giving\ndrugs.\nDespite its imperfections, the United Nations is\nthe forum that gives us hope. Let us work together so\nthat we can bequeath to our children and to our\nchildren\u2019s children an Organization that can be used, in\nthe words of the Secretary-General, to save succeeding\ngenerations from the scourge of war, to reaffirm faith\nin fundamental human rights, to establish the basic\nconditions for justice and the rule of law and to\npromote social progress and better standards of life in\nlarger freedom.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMs. Lydie Polfer, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister\nfor Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg, regrets that she is\nnot able to speak to the Assembly today and has asked\nme to do so in her place.\nThe current President of the European Union, Mr.\nSilvio Berlusconi, has already presented to the\nAssembly the priorities and positions of the European\nUnion, which Luxembourg supports with conviction.\nThe United Nations remains in mourning\nfollowing the cowardly and inhuman attack of 19\nAugust 2003 against United Nations headquarters in\nBaghdad, which took the lives of 22 persons \u2014 most of\nwhom were United Nations personnel \u2014 including that\nof Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, Special Representative\nof the Secretary-General. Today our thoughts are with\nthose victims, who, day after day, through their work in\nthe service of the Organization, helped to make the\nworld a better place.\nAs was recently noted by the Secretary-General,\nthat heinous act raises important questions, because it\nis\n\u201ca direct challenge to the vision of world\nsolidarity and of collective security rooted in the\nCharter and articulated in the Millennium\nDeclaration\u201d. (A/58/323, chapter I, para. 2)\nIt is our responsibility, as representatives of the\nnations of the world, gathered here at the fifty-eighth\nsession of the General Assembly, to meet this challenge\nand to try to provide constructive answers that open\nprospects for the future.\nA few months ago, the Minister for Foreign\nAffairs, Ms. Lydie Polfer, presented to the Luxembourg\nParliament her foreign policy declaration in a context\ncharacterized by the deep divisions in the international\ncommunity that marked the international situation at\nthe beginning of this year. At that time, Ms. Polfer\nelaborated on these thoughts, which also define the\noverall approach of the Luxembourg Government to\nmultilateral cooperation.\n\u201cDuring the debates on Iraq, all sides\nextensively debated the role and the credibility of\nour shared institutions. Have they shown their\nlimits? Have they ceased to function? Are they\nstill adapted to our day and age? Is\nmultilateralism still relevant today? I would like\nto give a clear answer to this question. Yes, more\nthan ever, we need multilateral bodies that allow\nus to work together so that international law can\nbe established and respected, with international\nrules and procedures that ensure respect for\nhuman rights and that govern the lives of all\nStates, regardless of their size. This is not just\nwishful thinking, but something that is in our\ninterest.\n\u201cWe must not only assist in the development\nof these institutions, but also participate actively\nin strengthening them through committed and\nconstructive cooperation. The United Nations is,\nof course, the primary forum for such cooperation\nto take place\u201d.\nBut while we believe that multilateral cooperation\nremains the best way of dealing with the many current\ninternational issues, we must, however, reflect on ways\nand means of adapting such cooperation to the\nevolution of our world, with a view to defining a new\nmultilateralism for the twenty-first century and to\nrethinking the conditions of a new kind of global\ngovernance. In this context, the Millennium\nDeclaration charts a steady course that will enable us to\nmobilize the international community to take action on\na number of specific, quantifiable objectives.\nAmong recent advances, I would like to highlight\nin particular the achievements registered at the fifty-\nseventh session of the General Assembly under the\nleadership of President Kavan; we commend the\ninnovative work he did during his presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly. We wish also to stress the process\nof reflection that was inspired by the Brahimi report on\npeacekeeping operations.\nMuch work remains to be done, however. The\ntwo recent reports of the Secretary-General on the\nimplementation of the United Nations Millennium\nDeclaration and on the strengthening of the United\nNations provide them with both an analytical\n20\n\nframework and an operational plan of action of vital\nimportance. We must provide them with concrete\nfollow-up.\nThe United Nations must remain the premier\ninstitution for meeting the challenges facing\nhumankind and for finding shared solutions. To quote\nthe expressive words of Kofi Annan,\n\u201cThe challenge ahead is to strengthen our\ncapacity for collective action and thus forge a\ncommon destiny in a time of accelerating global\nchange\u201d. (A/57/387, chapter I, para. 2)\nWe must reaffirm the status of international law\nwhile developing it to take account of new situations\nand contexts. We are doing this successfully in the\nfields of the protection of human rights, the fight\nagainst terrorism, the environment, and in other fields.\nThe inception of the International Criminal Court\n(ICC) is a major stage, which we welcome. We hope\nthat it will soon begin work on the full range of its\nactivities, in accordance with the terms of its Statute.\nWe appeal to all Members of our Organization to\naccede to the Rome Statute in order to give the ICC the\nuniversality that will enable it to fight impunity for the\ngravest of crimes. We must continue, with\ndetermination and courage, efforts to reform and\nrevitalize our institutions. Much has already been done,\nthanks in particular to the efforts of our Secretary-\nGeneral regarding the Secretariat, whose structures\nhave been modernized and whose procedures have\nbeen rationalized, though work must continue,\nparticularly in the financial, budgetary and\nmanagement areas.\nLast week, the Secretary-General rightly drew our\nattention to the vital renewal of the intergovernmental\nbodies of our Organization \u2014 be it the Security\nCouncil, the General Assembly or the Economic and\nSocial Council. With respect to the General Assembly\nin particular, our President \u2014 whom I wish warmly to\ncongratulate on his election to his important post \u2014\nundertook a certain number of initiatives aimed at\nrevitalizing our annual session, in order to give it once\nagain the central place it should occupy as the primary\nvenue for meetings, debates and stock-taking. I wish to\nassure the President that Luxembourg \u2014 which holds a\nvice-presidency of the General Assembly \u2014 will fully\nsupport his endeavours.\nThe ability to work with updated methods on a\nstreamlined agenda that focuses on the real needs of\nour day seems to us to be a prerequisite for the\nincreased presence and greater relevance of the General\nAssembly in international debates.\nImportant progress has already been made in the\nareas of peacekeeping and peace-building. The\npresentation in 2000 of the Brahimi report launched an\nintensive process of reflection and debate, and led to a\nnumber of crucial decisions aimed at more effective\nmanagement of peacekeeping operations. The adoption\nof Security Council resolution 1327 (2000) and the\nAssembly\u2019s adoption on 3 July 2003 of resolution\n57/337, \u201cPrevention of armed conflict\u201d, constituted\nparticularly significant events, which we welcome, just\nas we support their practical implementation.\nWhile the debate has developed considerably,\npolitically and conceptually, we must emphasize the\nadmirable work carried out by the United Nations in\nthe field, in often difficult conditions. It should be\nrecalled that today our Organization is managing 15\npeacekeeping operations throughout the world,\nmobilizing approximately 40,000 Blue Helmets and\ncivilian staff. We can rightly be proud of this, without\nbeing complacent. The missions in Timor-Leste,\nKosovo and Sierra Leone have shown the decisive\nimpact that the United Nations can have when it has a\nclear mandate and adequate resources.\nHere again, much remains to be done. The\ndifficult situations that persist in countries such as\nAfghanistan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Liberia and in the Great\nLakes region, not to mention the \u201cforgotten conflicts\u201d,\ncontinue to demand greater attention by the\ninternational community. By contributing to the shared\neffort, particularly in Kosovo and Afghanistan,\nLuxembourg has shown its readiness to assume its\nshare of responsibility in this regard.\nSpecial attention should be given in the future to\nthe problem of the transition from intervention in\nemergencies and crisis situations to the handling of\npost-conflict contexts. Integrating all dimensions,\nparticularly the political, humanitarian, security and\neconomic, in a single approach, perfecting the\ninstruments and methodologies adapted to this type of\nchallenge, seems to us to be an urgent and necessary\ntask.\nThe Government of Luxembourg is convinced\nthat the noble task of preserving peace must be based\n21\n\non a broad and complex concept of security. New\nthreats have been added to the dangers of traditional\nmilitary confrontation. At the forefront of those threats\nare terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction.\nTwo years after the deadly attacks of 11\nSeptember, which touched the entire world, we can see\nthat great progress has been made in the fight against\nterrorism. A firm position of principle and a\nmultidisciplinary approach remain indispensable in\norder to combat and stop this widespread and\ndestructive phenomenon. Luxembourg will play its full\npart in this effort, which must be pursued tirelessly,\nwith our Organization playing a major role.\nThe danger of the proliferation of weapons of\nmass destruction continues to arouse the legitimate\nconcern of our peoples. World leaders have a\nresponsibility to confront this serious threat to peace\nand security by establishing and strengthening the\nnecessary international regimes. For its part, the\nEuropean Union has decided, on the basis of the\nEuropean Council\u2019s Thessaloniki Declaration, to\ndevelop a long-term strategy against proliferation, and\nhas already adopted basic principles and a concrete\nplan of action to give shape to this strategy.\nLikewise, international arms limitation and\nreduction efforts, particularly with regard to small\narms, must be continued and broadened.\nBut, given the immediate and tragic urgency of\nviolent conflicts and terrorist attacks, we must not lose\nsight of a more structural cause of global instability\nand insecurity: the persistence of poverty and\nunderdevelopment. In a world in which every year\nalmost 15 million children under the age of 5 die of the\neffects of poverty, we must continue unabated our fight\nfor development. The Millennium Declaration, the\nconclusions of the Johannesburg Summit and the\nMonterrey Consensus have shown us the way and the\nobjectives to be achieved in order to establish a real\nglobal partnership for development.\nThe dimensions of this basic problem are many\nand interdependent. I shall cite just three.\nThe first dimension is the fight against\nHIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, in which\nLuxembourg is strongly involved and which was quite\nrightly the focus of attention at the high-level debate\nthat opened this session of the General Assembly. The\nsecond is international trade. The failure of the Fifth\nWorld Trade Organization Ministerial Conference in\nCanc\u00fan is undeniably a major disappointment. If we\nwant to achieve a balanced and more just trade system,\nit is imperative that we resume the dialogue on the\nobjectives to be achieved and the way to achieve them.\nThe third dimension is financing for development,\nwhich, according to the Secretary-General\u2019s report on\nthe follow-up to the outcome of the Millennium\nSummit, remains \u201cwell below the level needed to meet\nthe Goals\u201d (A/58/323, para. 49), even though we are\npleased at a recent rise in the volume of official\ndevelopment assistance. For its part, my country is\nparticipating in this global solidarity effort by devoting\nover 0.8 per cent of its gross national product to\nofficial development assistance, with a view to\nachieving the target of 1 per cent about midway\nthrough the decade.\nWhile development remains the new name of\npeace, we must not lose sight of other factors of\ninstability, such as ecological problems, new infectious\ndiseases, transnational crime and corruption, and,\nlastly, grave and repeated violations of human rights\nand threats to democracy and good governance.\nLet us not forget, in that regard, the wise words of\nMr. Annan, who has written:\n\u201cGreater respect for human rights, along with\ndemocracy and social justice, will, in the long\nterm, be the most effective prophylactic against\nterror\u201d. (ibid, para. 76)\nGiven these multiple threats, defining a\nprogramme of shared security on a global scale, within\nmultilateral bodies, is a primary objective. The\nEuropean Union, an international actor deeply involved\nin a vast process of enlargement and constitutional\ndevelopment, has begun the discussion of a strategic\nconcept of security and defence, which will make a\nmajor contribution to the international debate in this\nregard.\nFor more than a year, international attention has\nbeen focused once again on the situation in Iraq. There\nis no need to go over again before this audience the\nsequence of events that led last spring to the onset of\nwar in that afflicted part of the world. We all remember\nthe deep divisions that emerged in the international\ncommunity during that period, threatening to upset the\nvery foundations of our Organization. Regardless of the\nstand that we may have taken individually regarding\n22\n\nthese events, we must now look to the future to\ndetermine the prospects of a better future for the Iraqi\npeople. That is the objective that should bring us\ntogether now.\nWe are convinced that the United Nations must\nplay a central role here, on the basis of a clear and\nsubstantial mandate accompanied by adequate\nresources. While it is primarily up to the Iraqi people to\ndecide their own future, we all agree that sovereignty\nshould be transferred to the Iraqis themselves as soon\nas possible.\nIn the phase of political, socio-economic and\ndiplomatic transition and reconstruction, there must\nquickly begin a steady transfer of authority and\nresponsibility to legitimate institutions recognized by\nthe Iraqi people. That process must include the drafting\nand adoption of a new constitution, and the holding, as\nsoon as the situation allows, of free, democratic\nelections. Among the essentials for this are the\nrestoration of basic living conditions and security in\nthe daily lives of Iraqis, reconstruction of the basic\ninfrastructure and a rapid relaunching of economic\nactivity.\nThe Security Council and its members bear the\nprimary responsibility, but the emergence of an\nindependent, democratic, prosperous and peaceful Iraq\nis in the common interest of all Members of our\nOrganization. Together with its European Union\npartners, the Government of Luxembourg remains\nconfident that through a broad mobilization the\ninternational community will be able to make a\ndecisive contribution to this objective.\nYear after year, the General Assembly must\naddress the situation in the Middle East, particularly\nthe Israeli-Palestinian conflict, because progress\ntowards a just and lasting peace remains difficult. Even\nfaced with a resumption of tension and repeated acts of\nviolence and terrorism, which we emphatically reject,\nwe have a duty and responsibility to persevere in the\nsearch for solutions that will enable reconciliation\namong the States and peoples of the region. The search\nfor peace must be tireless. The European Union\nremains prepared and determined to play its role,\nespecially through its action in the Quartet. We remain\nconvinced that the course charted by the road map\nremains the right way to break the current impasse. But\nall players who are directly involved must display good\nwill and good faith in re-launching the peace process\nby creating the indispensable conditions of confidence\nand security. That is the urgent appeal that we make to\nthem, that is the urgent task that we must undertake.\nIn the face of wars and violent conflict, in the\nface of new threats, in the face of violations of human\nrights, in the face of poverty and underdevelopment,\nthe law and multilateralism are an often fragile but\nirreplaceable recourse for nations. While we must try\nvigorously to remedy the weaknesses and\ninsufficiencies in multilateral cooperation, it remains a\nsource of hope for the men and women of the entire\nworld. This is a hope that we must not betray, this is\nthe primary responsibility that is ours at this fifty-\neighth session of the General Assembly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me begin by\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your assumption of the\npresidency of the General Assembly at this session. My\ndelegation pledges its support and its cooperation to\nyou. I wish you a very successful tenure of office. I\nalso wish to pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Jan\nKavan of the Czech Republic, for the efficient manner\nin which he presided over the proceedings of the\nprevious session. In addition, I wish to take this\nopportunity to commend the Secretary-General, Mr.\nKofi Annan, for his relentless efforts and dedication to\nthe cause of international peace, security and economic\ndevelopment.\nMy delegation wishes to express our deepest\nsympathies to the families of the United Nations staff\nwho died in the terrorist bombing at the United Nations\noffices in Baghdad on 19 August 2003. Those tragic\ndeaths are an incalculable loss to the United Nations.\nSuch violent acts should not be allowed to continue.\nMy Government also joins other Members of the\nUnited Nations in condemning these inhuman acts.\nI should like to state that Zambia condemns, in all\nits forms and manifestations, the terrorism that is\noccurring in various parts of the world. We pledge to\ncooperate with the international community in the fight\nagainst international terrorism. It is in that vein that the\nZambian Government welcomes Security Council\nresolution 1502 (2003), on the protection of United\nNations personnel, associated personnel and\nhumanitarian personnel in conflict zones, which was\nadopted on 26 August 2003 and which, inter alia,\nexpresses strong condemnation of all forms of\nviolence.\nThe tragedy in Baghdad underscores the need for\nconcerted efforts to strengthen multilateral approaches\nto international peace and security. The United Nations\nshould be allowed to lead efforts to achieve\ncomprehensive disarmament in nuclear, chemical and\nconventional weapons. Terrorists should be denied\naccess to all weapons of mass destruction.\nNuclear, chemical and conventional weapons,\nincluding small arms and light weapons, pose a serious\nthreat to international peace and security. In Africa,\nsmall arms and light weapons, as well as anti-personnel\nlandmines, have destabilized States and have taken a\ngreat toll on life and property. My Government is\nhopeful that this session will advance the horizon of\nthe international disarmament agenda.\nZambia mourns the untimely death of Ms. Anna\nLindh, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sweden, who\ndedicated her life to the pursuit of peace, social\nprogress and development. My country will miss her\nfriendship, dynamism and broad understanding of\ndevelopmental issues.\nAs a peace-loving Member State, Zambia will\ncontinue to cooperate with and to support the efforts of\nthe Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), established\nby the Security Council to fight terrorism. The CTC\nshould be encouraged to work to raise the capacities of\nMember States to fight international terrorism.\nEmphasis should be placed on addressing linkages\nbetween terrorism, money-laundering and organized\ncrime, which are among the most serious challenges to\nstability and peace in our era.\nThe strength of the United Nations lies in its\nlegitimacy, founded on the bedrock of principles of\ninternational law accepted by all Member States. It is\nessential that the conduct of international affairs be in\nconformity with those principles. The common security\nagenda should reflect a global consensus on all major\nthreats to peace and security. The spirit of cooperation\nbased on the shared values of equality and sovereignty,\nwhich are enshrined in our Charter, is a source of our\nstrength.\nPoverty is the greatest impediment to\ndevelopment. Poverty reduction therefore remains the\nforemost priority of developing countries and should\ncontinue to feature highly on the agenda of the United\nNations. It is regrettable that, since the Millennium\nDeclaration three years ago, indications are that most\ndeveloping countries risk falling short of achieving the\nMillennium Development Goals by 2015. This is\nlargely due to lack of resources and capacity and\nweaknesses in national and global economies. Zambia\ncontinues to strive to implement those goals.\nGlobalization has brought about both\nopportunities and challenges. But the current world\neconomic conditions are unfavourable to developing\ncountries in general, and to the least developed\ncountries in particular. Unless there is an increase in\nthe flow of the official development assistance (ODA),\nforeign direct investment and other forms of assistance,\nit will be difficult for these countries to come out of the\n12\n\nvicious circle of poverty and lack of development. This\nsituation is exacerbated by the huge external debts that\nthe least developed countries are struggling to pay off.\nGiven their economic problems, the least\ndeveloped countries, of which 34 out of 49 are in\nAfrica, there is need for support from the international\ncommunity within the framework of the 2001 Brussels\nPlan of Action. In that vein, I wish also to urge\ndeveloped countries to honour their pledges to meet the\ntarget of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product\noffered as ODA to developing countries.\nWhile we welcome the Heavily Indebted Poor\nCountries (HIPC) Initiative in addressing the external\ndebt, there is a need to broaden and ease the process of\naccessing funds. Equally important, developing\ncountries need easy access to the markets of the\ndeveloped countries. This is important to stimulate\neconomic growth. To level the playing field, my\ndelegation calls for the removal of agricultural\nsubsidies in developed countries, which have\ncontributed to the adverse and poor terms of trade for\nthe developing countries.\nZambia regrets the failure to achieve a consensus\nat the World Trade Organization Ministerial\nConference at Canc\u00fan. There is an urgent need to\novercome the impasse that emerged. Developed\ncountries should demonstrate a give-and-take spirit in\nthese negotiations.\nIn the effort to address social and economic\nproblems and promote development, the African heads\nof State and Government, at their summit held in\nLusaka, Zambia, in July 2001, adopted the New\nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD), to\nplace the continent on a path to sustainable growth.\nAlthough the ownership and the implementation\nof the NEPAD programme is the responsibility of the\nAfricans themselves, in order to succeed they need the\ncooperation and assistance of the international\ncommunity. My delegation would like to appeal to the\ndonor community, including United Nations agencies,\nto assist in the implementation of NEPAD.\nMy delegation is mindful that Africa\u2019s\ndevelopment is hampered by conflicts. Wherever these\noccur, there is no development; rather, there is more\ndestruction and loss of life and property. Zambia\ncommends the leadership of Africa for taking up the\nchallenge to resolve conflicts in the African way. We\nthank them for their time and resources directed at that\neffort. We are happy to note the positive developments\nthat have taken place in the recent past in various parts\nof Africa where the peace processes have led to the\ncessation of conflict and the return of peace.\nIn that regard, my Government reaffirms its\nreadiness to contribute to the international conference\non the Great Lakes region initiated by the United\nNations in collaboration with the African Union.\nThe international community should make efforts\nfor conflict prevention and resolution. Conflicts should\nbe avoided by creating a conducive political\nenvironment and allow political pluralism, democracy,\ngood governance and transparency to flourish. My\ncountry\u2019s commitment to the peaceful resolution of\nconflicts is unwavering, and we will continue to\nparticipate in peacekeeping operations.\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic is indeed a global\ncrisis. It is no longer just a health concern, but an\nimpediment to human development and political\nstability, which threatens international peace and\nsecurity. The startling figures of 42 million people who\nlive with HIV/AIDS globally, the majority of whom are\nin sub-Saharan Africa, and the 31 million people who\nhave died from the pandemic, should compel the\ninternational community to take concrete measures to\ncombat the scourge.\nThe scourge has ravaged Zambia. My\nGovernment is devoting considerable attention and\nresources to combat its spread and to limit its impact\non our communities. We are also tackling the problems\ncreated by the pandemic such as the plight of AIDS\norphans, street kids and vulnerable households. In this\ntask, Government, civil societies, the relevant United\nNations agencies and the private sector are all working\ntogether. Zambia is also cooperating with other\nGovernments as well in tackling this pandemic.\nThe Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS,\nTuberculosis and Malaria, which is a welcome\ninitiative, has provided renewed impetus to the\nprogrammes and interventions of Member States\ndesigned to combat these deadly diseases. There is a\nneed to contribute more generously to the Fund for it to\nbe solvent and viable. My delegation wishes to appeal\nfor easier access to these funds to enable affected\ncountries to procure cheaper and affordable generic\ndrugs that are urgently needed.\n13\n\nMy delegation calls for radical reform and\nstrengthening the world body to make it a more\nefficient and effective instrument to meet the\nchallenges of the twenty-first century. Zambia supports\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s proposals for reform of the\nUnited Nations aimed at the strengthening this world\nbody.\nIn conclusion, I wish to state that my delegation\nrecognizes the numerous challenges that the United\nNations faces. I have every hope, that through our\ncollective effort, we will succeed in attaining peace,\ndevelopment and prosperity for all humanity. Zambia\npledges her support in these efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a\ngreat pleasure for me to join with others who have\nspoken before me in congratulating, on behalf of my\ncountry, the Union of the Comoros, and on my own\nbehalf, Mr. Julian Hunte on his election to preside over\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session. We are\nconvinced that, given his wisdom and extensive\nexperience, he will guide our work to a successful\n8\n \noutcome. I am very pleased to assure him of the full\ncooperation and support of my entire delegation.\nI would also like to express appreciation for the\nopenness demonstrated by his predecessor, His\nExcellency Mr. Jan Kavan, throughout the fifty-seventh\nsession of the General Assembly, over which he\npresided with the skill and farsightedness that we all\nknow so well.\nI also pay tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, for his dedication to this global Organization   a\nsentiment that I am sure is shared by all nations.\nIt goes without saying that the challenges before\nus are great, as many changes are taking place in the\nworld at an ever-increasing rate, requiring renewed\ncommitment on the part of the United Nations, as well\nas a strengthening of its role. Unfortunately, every day\nwe see evidence of the risks that such changes entail.\nIn this context my country, the Union of the Comoros,\njoins those who have paid tribute to the memory of the\nUnited Nations staff members who fell as a result of\nthe indiscriminate violence and terrorism in Baghdad,\nincluding the Special Representative of the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello.\nToday more than ever, we should be concerned\nabout the direction in which the world is heading. The\nworld is characterized by violence, poverty and despair\n  despite the fact that science and technology have\nnever been more advanced and wealth never more\nabundant. The division of the world into developed and\ndeveloping countries does nothing to assuage our\ncommon fears and uncertainties.\nIt is true that the countries of the North are,\nincreasingly, questioning themselves on the subject\nterrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction. But it must be recognized that the\ncountries of the South, while asking themselves the\nsame questions, are also labouring increasingly under\nthe burden of debt, civil war, insecurity, poverty and\nendemic disease. The pursuit of security and harmony\nin the world therefore requires a sustained focus on all\ncountries with a view to achieving a safer, more unified\nand more humane world.\nOf course, as we see every day, terrorism,\ncowardly and indiscriminate, thrives in poverty and\nseeks to express itself through violence, exploiting the\nweakest links in the global chain. It respects no\nboundary, no race and no religion. As His Excellency\nGeorge W. Bush, President of the United States of\nAmerica, rightly said in his address to the General\nAssembly, the victims of terrorism are also to be found\nin Bali, Casablanca, Dar es Salaam, Mombassa,\nNairobi and Baghdad. We must respond, therefore, so\nas to ensure that such borderless networks never gain\nany respite and so as to prevent cowardice from\nholding sway and destroying humanity.\nIn order to better combat this situation, we must\nbring terrorists to justice and commit ourselves\nresolutely to the long-term fight against terrorism\nitself. In order to do so, we must fight frustration and\ninjustice and appeal for greater tolerance and for\nrespect for the right to differ and for the right of every\npeople to live in dignity.\nIn suppressing terrorism, however, we must guard\nagainst any tendency to strike a blow against human\nrights, and refrain from equating terrorism with certain\nreligions or regions. Indeed, committing such a grave\nmistake could give rise to a vicious circle of hatred,\nvengeance and isolationism at the global level. My\ncountry is steadfastly committed to preventing and\ncombating terrorism in all its forms, and we have set\nup the necessary institutional mechanisms to this end.\nWe appeal for greater technical and logistical support\nfrom the international community to help us to be more\nsuccessful in this fight.\nAll the countries of the world   those of the\nNorth and South alike   have a shared destiny.\nCountries and peoples cannot get along without each\nother. Solidarity is a necessity; complementarity is an\nobligation. But we must recognize and reaffirm that we\ncannot today truly talk about security in a world of\npoverty. We cannot talk about peace if we do not\nensure the economic development and well-being of all\npeoples. Harmony and democracy cannot reign in the\nworld if it is rife with inequalities and disparities that\nleave entire sectors of the global population in\nconditions of uncertainty, precariousness and oblivion.\nWe have, indeed, forgotten that humankind must\nbe at the centre of all of our concerns. Unfortunately,\nthe general feeling of uncertainty   the daily fear that\nall of us experience   vividly brings to mind the fact\nthat, whatever the social status of particular\nindividuals, humankind is vulnerable and people need\neach other in order to be reassured and to survive.\nBut the insecurity that causes so much anxiety\nthroughout the world and makes it seem so fragile has\n9\n \na number of different sources. We are entitled to ask, as\nwe consider the current situation, if it was wise in the\npast to have brought together   almost by force  \npeople of various nationalities, given that nothing was\ndone to foster a common desire among them to live\ntogether.\nIt should come as no surprise, therefore, that\nthere are inter-ethnic problems and friction between\nnationalities in many States throughout the world, and\nthat these are a source of instability and insecurity.\nThat shows the seriousness of lack of respect for the\ndifferences and even the character of each people in the\nworld's harmonious development.\nCountries and peoples throughout the world are\nsearching for their integrity, their sovereignty and their\nidentity. Most often, of course, that generates threats to\npeace and security. The same causes produce the same\neffects everywhere. My country, the Union of the\nComoros   today still a victim of its colonial past  \nis very eloquent testimony to that. But there are similar\ncases, particularly in China, in Morocco, in Palestine\nand in other regions. Under those conditions, the\nComorian State is experiencing   as might be the case\nfor any other country   all the difficulties of achieving\nreal development in its desire to consolidate democracy.\nToday, democracy and respect for human rights\nare requirements that must be respected by every\ncountry. It is universally established that democracy is\nthe most appropriate remedy to overcome the pain of\ncountries and of peoples. But it is also established that,\nwhatever the remedy, the dose must be prescribed\naccording to the patient's age and physical state, and\nobviously one must always bear in mind the possible\nside effects. So we must help every country to move at\nits own pace on the path of democracy, while bearing\nin mind each people's history and traditions.\nThe dialogue of cultures   openness towards the\nother   must be a permanent inspiration in the\ncommitment to a peaceful and responsible international\nlife. Multilateralism   which is the guarantee of\nparticipation by every nation in the world's progress  \nmust be safeguarded and strengthened. Therefore, we\nsupport the proposals of the Secretary-General, Mr.\nKofi Annan, for a restructuring of the Organization so\nthat it will be effective and can meet current\nchallenges. In that way, the moral authority of the\nUnited Nations will be gradually restored and\nmaintained. As for the Security Council   the body\ncharged with maintaining peace and security   it must\nbe reformed and its role must be fine-tuned. That is an\nessential condition for ensuring the success of its\ndiverse missions.\nIn its development, the world   if it is to be\nharmonious and stable   must concern itself with and\nbear in mind the most vulnerable regions and the most\ndisadvantaged countries. Among those, the small island\nStates deserve particular attention so that we can bridge\nthe development gap inherent to their geographical\nsituation. Only economic development   and thus real\nsolidarity between rich and poor countries   will\nguarantee stability and peace in the world. Thus will\ndemocracy and the rule of law be consolidated and\nstrengthened.\nThe New Partnership for Africa's Development\n  an ambitious project conceived in Africa by\nAfricans for Africans   must be a reality that is\nsupported by and profitable for all. Debt   which is a\ntrue burden and is truly stifling developing economies\n  must be circumscribed and overcome to liberate the\ncountries of the South and to give them the capacity for\nreal involvement in global wealth creation. But, in\norder to support the survival and emergence of our\neconomies, we must also put an end to agricultural\nproduct subsidies in the countries of the North and let\nthe market have free reign. Our countries seek and\nneed support so that they can emerge from economic\nmarginalization. Our assets and our potential deserve to\nbe valued. Our efforts must be encouraged.\nMy country, which believes in Africa's ability to\ntake charge of itself, is facing its future with\ndetermination and responsibility. I do not believe it is\nuseful to return to the ups and downs that have marked\nmy country's historical development   particularly the\npast few years, characterized by a secessionist crisis\nwith tragic consequences. Today, I welcome the new-\nfound normality and the significant progress achieved.\nWe owe that success to Comorian wisdom, to the\nnational conscience and to the multiform assistance of\nall our bilateral and multilateral partners. Today, we\nmust still establish the Assemblies. But the Comorians\nare convinced that only real economic development can\nguarantee national cohesion and ensure a secure future.\nThe international community's support is needed\nmore than ever before. I thank our partner countries\nand organizations, particularly the Republic of South\nAfrica and the African Union, which have always had\n10\n \nconfidence in the Comorian people and stand by them\nin their resolve to achieve stability and well-being for\nevery citizen. Together, we have an opportunity to\nguarantee a more just and more humane world. The\ninternational system's weaknesses, the blindness and\nthe deafness, and the ill-fated and suicidal networks\nmust be overcome, allowing the emergence of an\ninternational conscience, the guarantee of unity, peace\nand solidarity. The world needs each of us, every\ncountry and every difference, to guarantee its future.\nLet us commit ourselves, all together, with resolve and\ndetermination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThere is no reality more\noppressive than the silence of a nation. For too long,\nAfghanistan was a silenced nation, a country without a\nvoice. After decades of being suppressed into silence,\nour nation is beginning to have a voice of its own.\nRecovering from the tragedy of war and destruction,\nAfghanistan is determined to reverse the effects of the\nsuffering it has long endured.\nA lot has changed in Afghanistan over the last\ntwo years. But no change is so critical and pervasive as\nthe animated response of the people of Afghanistan to\nthe recent developments in our country. I find no sight\nmore rewarding than that of our young girls and boys\nflocking to schools every morning. I find few things\nmore engaging than the company of elderly\nrepresentatives who come to Kabul from far-flung parts\nof the country to discuss their priorities for\nreconstruction. And, in the same order, there is nothing\nmore enthusing than the active participation of Afghan\nmen and women in the process of public consultation\nfor the new constitution.\nFrom the public consultations conducted in\nconnection with the constitution drafting process, we\nknow that the people of Afghanistan want a modern,\nunitary State that is committed to Islamic values and\nthe preservation of peace and national unity, a State\nthat ensures security for all its citizens, enforces justice\nand the rule of law and promotes prosperity. As in any\npost-war society, the need for security and for\nremoving the threat of arms and armed factions is a\ncompelling issue for all Afghans. Our people demand\nthe establishment of truly national and competent\ninstitutions, notably the army and the police. Afghans\nwant State institutions that are professional and\nrepresentative and an administration that is efficient\nand free of corruption. The Afghan people want\ntolerance for other religions, protection of human rights\nand affirmative action to promote the rights of women.\nSince I addressed the Assembly in September of\nlast year, Afghanistan has taken significant strides in\nthe path of post-war reconstruction. While total\nstability may not have been achieved yet, today\nAfghanistan is more stable and peaceful than in any\nother period in its recent history. The International\nSecurity Assistance Force (ISAF), to the credit of the\nparticipating countries, has done a tremendous job of\nsecuring the nation\u2019s capital. That is partly the reason\nthat people from other parts of the country have\ndemanded that ISAF be expanded to their areas, too.\nWe see NATO\u2019s decision to take over the command of\nISAF in Kabul as a positive development. The Afghan\npeople have also welcomed the provincial\nreconstruction teams that are supported by the coalition\nmember States. Reconstruction and security are tied to\none another, and we are absolutely certain that no\nmatter what flag they fly, forces that ensure stability\nwill be welcomed throughout Afghanistan.\nHowever, we recognize that providing security to\nthe people of Afghanistan is ultimately our own\nresponsibility. We are grateful to the international\ncommunity, the United States and Germany in\nparticular, for making a determined effort to help us\nembark on a process of reforming and rebuilding our\nsecurity institutions, namely the Afghan National Army\nand the national police.\nAfter an arduous process of restructuring, we\nhave just completed the reform of the Ministry of\nDefence. That step is now paving the way for the\nimplementation of the nation-wide programme on\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration, which\nwill begin in earnest in mid-October with assistance\nfrom Japan.\nA Constitution is the bedrock of the modern\nState. Under the Bonn Agreement, my Government\nwas assigned the historic task of giving Afghanistan its\nnew Constitution. The commission assigned that task\nhas just finished the draft Constitution. The draft will\nbe submitted in December for approval to a\nconstitutional grand council of the Afghan people,\nwhich in our language is called a Loya Jirga. Work on\nthe reform of the judicial system and on drafting new\nsecondary laws has also continued, with notable\noutcomes achieved in recent months. The laws on\npolitical parties and banking have now been officially\nadopted.\nHaving started from a below-zero baseline, the 30\nper cent economic growth rate that Afghanistan\nenjoyed last year is a promising start. Committed as we\nare to an open-market economy, and seeing the private\nsector as the true engine for growth, we have moved\naggressively to create the legal and financial\n7\n\nframeworks needed for a positive environment for the\nprivate sector. Our newly adopted laws governing\ninvestment, banking and property rights, the new stable\ncurrency and the bureaucratic reforms we have enacted\nprovide a liberal and conducive underpinning for rapid\neconomic growth. Like never before, Afghanistan is\nopen to business.\nOnce, in the past, Afghanistan was at the centre\nof a global threat, that of terrorism. Our vision for the\nfuture is that Afghanistan should be a centre for\neconomic opportunity. We do not call ourselves a land-\nlocked country; rather, we are a land-bridging country.\nAfghanistan connects South Asia, Central Asia and the\nMiddle East, a fact to which geo-strategists have long\nbeen attracted. But it is time that Afghanistan\u2019s vast\npotential for facilitating trade and economic activity is\nexploited.\nThrough such nationwide programmes as the\nNational Solidarity Programme, the Government aims\nto take reconstruction to the villages and households of\nAfghanistan. Perhaps no other priority features more\nwidely in the demands of the Afghan people than the\nprovision of education. Today, fortunately, almost 40\nper cent of the students and teachers in primary and\nsecondary education are female. That is a huge increase\nfrom the close to zero percentage that we inherited\nfrom the Taliban. Millions of textbooks have been\npublished, and schools are being built at a higher rate\nthan ever. However, in other areas of service-provision\nthe need is much greater than our capacity to deliver.\nThe struggle against the production of, and\ntrafficking in, narcotics continues. We see a direct\nconnection between narcotics and terrorism, and it is in\nour absolute national interest to fight both. Both are\ntransnational challenges. We in the region and in the\ninternational community must take the strategic\ndecision, in the spirit of true partnership, to fight\nagainst both menaces.\nAs we acknowledge that the road ahead for\nAfghanistan is long and tortuous, we appreciate the\nfact that significant achievements have been made over\nthe last two years. The people of Afghanistan are\ngrateful to the international community for its crucial\nsupport. While countries that have extended a friendly\nhand to Afghanistan are far too many to thank\nindividually, it would be unfair not to single out the\nUnited States, the European Union and Japan for\nspecial thanks. The United States of America has led\nthe international community by example in offering\nsupport for Afghanistan. The additional assistance\nprovided to us under the Accelerated Success Initiative\nwill go a long way towards rebuilding our country. The\nneighbours of Afghanistan also have a special place in\nour hearts. Our people will always remember the warm\nwelcome they received from their brothers and sisters\nin Pakistan and Iran. In addition, Afghans hold\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan and his Special\nRepresentative Lakhdar Brahimi in very high esteem.\nTheir kind-hearted attention to Afghanistan is highly\nappreciated.\nCognizant of our new situation and the emerging\nopportunities that exist today, we are determined to\nbuild friendly, civil and constructive relationships with\ncountries of the world. We continue to extend a sincere\nhand of friendship to Pakistan and all our other\nneighbours on the basis of the requirements of a\ncivilized relationship. We will never permit our\nterritory to be used against any other country, and\nexpect the same in return.\nWe are deeply concerned about the loss of\ninnocent lives in Palestine and Israel. We support the\nrealization of the right to self-determination for our\nPalestinian brothers and sisters.\nWe are fully committed to remaining a resilient\npartner with the international community in the fight\nagainst terrorism.\nAll the achievements I have just noted amount\nonly to a good beginning. Our challenge is to stay the\ncourse. That will depend not only on the resolute\ndetermination of the Afghan people, but also on the\ncontinued engagement of the international community.\nWhile the achievements are significant, and\nalthough challenges are inevitable, today, in this forum,\nI wish to point to what can potentially amount to a\ncritical threat, namely, the ongoing threat of terrorism.\nThe crisis in Afghanistan may well be over, but the\nforces of violence continue to threaten. Embodied in\nvarious manifestations, from militant infiltrations to\nhateful teachings at places disguised as madrassas,\nterrorism continues to make inroads into the space of\npeace and prosperity that we want to secure for our\nnation.\nIslam, our universalist religion, has absolutely no\nplace for terrorism. The apostles of hatred who preach\nmurder in the name of religion and who abuse the name\n8\n\nof Islam and the sanctity of madrassas are the enemies\nof Islam. They act against all that Islam teaches,\nnamely, peace, tolerance, compassion, social justice\nand the good of humanity.\nTerrorists aim to harm the nation of Afghanistan,\na deeply believing Muslim nation that is averse to\nextremism. They pose a threat to the process of\nreconstruction in Afghanistan. Terrorists see their\nlasting defeat in the success of reconstruction. They are\ntherefore maliciously intent on derailing the process of\nreconstruction in Afghanistan. That must stop. We\nmust defeat the forces and ideas of violence in the\nregion. Today terrorism is a liability to the\nGovernments in the region. Governments must stop\nusing extremism as an instrument of policy. As long as\nterrorism survives in this part of the world, neither\nAfghanistan nor our neighbours, nor indeed the rest of\nthe world, can be safe.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me at the outset\nto congratulate the Honourable Julian Hunte on the\noccasion of his election to the important position of\nPresident, at the fifty-eighth session, of the General\nAssembly \u2014 the most representative and prestigious\norganization in the world. I am convinced that his\nelection is recognition of both the achievements of the\ncountry he represents and his personal merits.\nAllow me also to express my gratitude to Mr. Jan\nKavan for the responsibility he showed in carrying out\nhis duties as President at the previous session.\nI also must point out the remarkable role played\nby the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, in\nenhancing the authority and efficiency of the United\nNations, particularly in the context of the dramatic\nevents that the international community faced during\nthe past few years. For the entire world, the United\nNations was and continues to be an organization\nserving the noble ideals of peace, equality and\neconomic prosperity of the peoples on our planet.\nThe international community has undertaken\nenormous efforts to ensure that phenomena alien to the\nspirit and aspirations of the contemporary world such\nas poverty, oppression, terrorism and the dangers of\necological disaster are perceived as reasons for general\nconcern that have in turn led to mobilization of all\nnations\u2019 forces. We are aware of how the international\ncommunity has gone beyond adopting emotive\nhumanitarian declarations to establish institutions and\norganizations that are not only actively analysing\nvarious problems, but are also working to correct\neconomic, social and political developments, wherever\nthey occur.\nGlobal threats are being given a global rebuff,\nand the chaos of destruction is ever more strongly\nopposed by integrated ethics and new technology for\nstructuring international relations based on\nsupranational values of human civilization, the\nuniversality of the principles of democracy, civil\nfreedoms and life itself.\nThe epochal Millennium Summit and the summits\nheld at Rome, Monterrey, Doha and Johannesburg\nmarked the foreshadowing of a new system of global\npriorities aimed at preventing and neutralizing possible\nthreats. Clearly, that system is leaving less and less\nroom for resolving the individual problems of\nsovereign States and is increasingly opening the way\nfor making use of international mechanisms to that end.\nThat system, which has been increasingly gaining in\nmodern politics, is now determining the new context of\nthe relationship between States and international\ninstitutions, excluding the dependent attitude of trivial\nprofiting assumed by national elites towards\ninternational assistance and requiring a responsible and\ndecisive approach to the issue of reforming our own\n9\n\neconomies and establishing modern social and political\nstandards.\nUndoubtedly, we are currently entering a century\nof integration, an era in which traditional inter-State\nbarriers are coming down. Yet, it is an era in which the\nlocal interests of some countries may in fact lead to\nbenefits for the entire community. Therefore, it is\nextremely important to be aware that the current stage\nof globalization will not disappoint us, only if, on the\nway to integration \u2014 the integration of values and\nstandards \u2014 the initiative for taking the first step\nbelongs to the States themselves. That is a task that in\nprinciple is new for all us \u2014 heads of State and\npoliticians.\nIt is not gratuitous that I began my speech with\nthese considerations. I did so at the outset because only\nsuch an approach can provide for the success of the\nState I represent to significant extent.\nMoldova embarked on the path of independent\ndevelopment 12 years ago. The chronic Transnistrian\nproblem, de-industrialization and economic recession,\npoverty, nationalism and separatism served for a\ndecade as the calling card of our country.\nThe \u201cfirst step\u201d policy is being implemented in\nMoldova in two areas of the utmost importance. First,\nthere is the problem of the Transnistrian settlement. We\nare aware of the fundamental character of the motives\nthat are at the core of this 10-year-old conflict. As the\nprimary way to resolve these contradictions, we have\nproposed that a new State constitution be drafted and\nadopted through joint efforts. In the draft that currently\nis being elaborated, we are insisting on giving up the\nstatus of unitary State, which does not take into\naccount the profound specific characteristics of the\nTransnistrian region. We are laying as the basis of the\nnew State draft the principles of the federative\norganization of our country, which take into\nconsideration the long-term interests of all the regions\nof Moldova.\nIn eliminating the effects of the nationalistic\nhysteria characteristic of the early 1990s, which\ndivided both the society and the country, Moldova has\ndeclared itself determined to build a harmonious multi-\nethnic society, based on principles of ethnic and\nlinguistic liberalism and pluralism. I believe that it is\nprecisely this policy that corresponds to those\nintegrationist trends that are replacing isolationism and\nsecessionism.\nUnity in diversity \u2014 that is the principle of our\npolicy today, and that is the motto of the Moldovan\nchairmanship in the Council of Europe. We are firmly\nconvinced that only those transformations will be able\nto serve as the proper basis for resolving both the\ndomestic problems of the Moldovan State and the\nproblems concerning regional security.\nIn the second place, the Republic of Moldova has\nproclaimed the path of European integration a priority\nnational strategy of the State. We are well aware of\nhow difficult that path is, and of the responsibility it\nrequires, but at the same time we firmly state that it\nrepresents first and foremost an internal political and\neconomic option for Moldova. We know that this\noption requires effective and comprehensive\nconsolidation of the market economy institutions,\nfurther advancement of democratic reforms and the\ndevelopment of civil society and the social sphere. Yet\nhowever difficult the task before us may be, we hope\nthat in time our decision will lead to the establishment\nof a national consensus.\n\nPeace and security on our planet may constitute\nthe guarantee that all States will adopt a joint position\nregarding the acknowledgement of modern social,\neconomic, political and legal standards. It is clear that\nthere is no other way. Humankind is currently more\nvulnerable than ever to crises and disasters of every\nscope and degree. That is why civilization today does\nnot have, and should not have, any local problems; nor\ndoes it, or should it, have any dark corners where, as in\na hothouse, terrorism, repression and defiant disdain\nfor the opinion of the international community can\nflourish.\nIn developing such a position, the most important\nrole lies with the Security Council. In that context, I\nexpress my support for the idea of making the Security\nCouncil more representative. The Republic of Moldova\nstands for a reasonable increase in the number of\npermanent and non-permanent members in the Security\nCouncil, which would further ensure the principle of\nequal geographic representation and would reflect the\ninterests of all regional groups. Fully aware of the\ndifficulty of reaching consensus on that issue, I call\nupon all Members of the United Nations to make every\neffort to adopt a definitive decision to that end.\nThe Republic of Moldova also supports the idea\nof restoring the role of the General Assembly as the\n10\n\nmost important, representative and deliberative body of\nthe United Nations. Along the same lines, I think there\nis a need to consolidate further the capacity of the\nEconomic and Social Council as the coordinator of\nUnited Nations funds and programmes. I am sure that\nthe further development of United Nations institutions\nand structures will be the best proof of the viability of\nthe principles of the Organization, its growing prestige\nand its leading role in the world. I express the hope that\nthe United Nations will know how to place itself at the\nvanguard of current positive developments.\nI am firmly convinced that the proceedings of the\nfifty-eighth session of the General Assembly will take\nplace in a spirit of sincere cooperation and solidarity,\nso that the representatives of all States will make\nsustained efforts to achieve the noble goals of peace,\nstability and prosperity."

        "file_text": "\ufeffUruguay believes in the United Nations, has faith in the\nUnited Nations, will support the Organization and will\ncontinue to contribute to it, as it has been doing since it\nbecame one of its founding Members. It is comforting\nto note that, at this time of crisis for the Organization,\nvirtually all the participants in this debate have\nexpressed this same sentiment.\nSome six decades ago, the United Nations was\ncreated to promote and regulate multilateral\ncooperation, by which the international community\nagreed to address and resolve common problems. The\nstructure of the Organization, the functioning of its\norgans, and the rights and obligations of its Members,\nas formulated in the San Francisco Charter, all\nreflected the international political reality of that time.\nBut, over the course of more than half a century,\nthere have been profound changes in the structure of\ninternational society. Its actors have multiplied and\nbecome more diverse and there have been new and\nmore dangerous manifestations of violence. New\nthreats to peace that were not foreseen by the drafters\nof the Charter occur with increasing frequency. At the\nsame time, there has been an intensification of certain\ngrowing trends that seriously affect the well-being of\nhumanity, such as the degradation of the environment,\n18\n\nthe depletion of natural resources, epidemics and the\ncontrast between consumer societies and societies that\nlive in extreme poverty.\nIn recent years, and in particular during this\ngeneral debate, special emphasis has been placed on\nthe need to reform and revitalize the United Nations in\norder to adapt it to current realities. Uruguay shares\nthis position, not only because it considers that this\nOrganization has not been completely effective in its\nhandling of some recent crises, but because it\nunderstands that the scale of the changes in the world\ntoday justifies the search for ways of adapting the\ninstitution.\nAlthough it is true that the system of collective\nsecurity established by the San Francisco Charter has\nnot always been able to respond to crises effectively, in\nnumerous cases multilateral action by the United\nNations has succeeded in restoring peace in many\nregions and countries, contributed to the consolidation\nof democracy, and accelerated the reconstruction of\naffected countries. There are many more cases in which\nthe Organization, through its various organs, has\nexercised positive and decisive control over crises and\nconflicts, thus preventing the situation from becoming\nworse and ensuring a peaceful solution.\nThe process of reform, which is indispensable\nand cannot be delayed, should in our view be based on\nthe following premises.\nThe first is to preserve intact the purposes and\nprinciples of the Organization, as enshrined in the\nCharter of San Francisco. After all, if we all gather\nhere every year as the United Nations, it is because our\nnations are united around the values and ideals\nenshrined in the Charter and shared by all mankind,\nwhose permanent and universal validity transcends the\nvicissitudes and accidents of history.\nThe second premise is that the reform process\nshould be aimed principally at strengthening\nmultilateral action, because never before has the need\nto cooperate and act together to deal with international\nproblems been so great. Common global responses are\nneeded to the proliferation and diversification of\ninternational actors; the fact that the world is getting\nsmaller and more and more interdependent, due to the\nincrease in trade and the extraordinary development of\ninformation and communication technologies; and\nabove all the globalization of threats to peace, security\nand the well-being of our peoples. To use the words\nemployed by the Secretary-General in this Assembly\ntwo weeks ago, Uruguay believes in \u201ccollective\nanswers to our common problems and challenges\u201d\n(A/58/PV.7).\nTwo years ago, the international community,\nthrough the United Nations organs, offered a fine\nexample of solidarity by taking effective multilateral\naction in reaction to international terrorism, which\nthreatens Governments, peoples, ideologies, religions\nand above all human reason, imbued with such\nelementary values as tolerance, compassion, solidarity\nand respect for human rights.\nThe attack on the headquarters of the United\nNations in Baghdad \u2014 for which we wish again to\nexpress our most sincere condolences to the Secretary-\nGeneral \u2014 is but another example of the barbarity and\nfanaticism that we can successfully fight only if we\nwork together. With this attack, terrorism has given us\na raw example of its destructive universality. The\ndeaths of Special Representative Sergio Vieira de\nMello and of other colleagues is emblematic of the\ntragedy suffered.\nJust as in the fight against poverty, terrorism\ncannot be defeated as a conventional enemy would be\nwith a victorious battle. The eradication of terrorism is\nan ongoing objective whose achievement requires time,\npatience and perseverance. Only through a joint\napproach and multilateral action directed above all at\nthe roots of terrorism \u2014 not only at its atrocious\nmanifestations \u2014 will it be possible to reduce and\nhopefully to eliminate this perverse and ubiquitous\nenemy and at the very least ensure its total rejection.\nUruguay, which is party to most international\nanti-terrorism instruments, attaches priority to the\nconclusion of a general convention against\ninternational terrorism. In this respect, we wish to\nexpress our satisfaction to the Secretary-General for\nhaving chosen transnational organized crime and\nterrorism as an item in the signing and accession\nceremony for treaties promoted by the Organization on\nthe occasion of this general debate.\nThe third premise to which my country subscribes\nis that we must not forget that the United Nations has\nfor years now been engaged in a process of self-\ncriticism and self-reform based on the idea that\nstrengthening an institution means strengthening its\norgans. Reforms are being implemented in three of the\nmain organs of the Organization. The modalities of\n19\n\neach one of the respective processes differ. In the\nSecurity Council, we are pursuing reform of its\nmembership to make it more representative and to\nstrengthen its democratic character. In the General\nAssembly, we are pursuing its revitalization so that its\ndecisions can regain the authority they had in the past.\nIn the Secretariat, the purpose of change is to enhance\nits effectiveness, an objective towards which the\nSecretary-General is working strenuously. These three\nprocesses are closely linked to each other but, despite\nthis close link, we believe that they must continue to be\npursued, as is now being done, separately, each one in\nits respective forum.\nFor Uruguay, one of the most important aspects\nof these reforms is the strengthening of the General\nAssembly, over which you, Sir, are presiding with such\ndignity and whose decisions are the most genuine\nmanifestations of the will of the international\ncommunity. Recent reforms are aimed at making this\norgan more effective, but more profound changes are\nrequired in order to restore the authority which the\nCharter grants it and which the Assembly has exerted\nin the past. We believe that there is still a great deal of\nroom for reform. Obsolete structures and procedures\nremain. We also need to re-examine and evaluate the\norganization, conduct and outcome of the annual\nsession that brings us all here together every year,\nincluding the idea of concentrating the negotiation of\ndozens of resolutions into a few weeks. Uruguay will\nsupport far-reaching measures to revitalize the\nAssembly. A better relationship between the different\norgans is no doubt another of the necessary areas for\nreform.\nThe fourth and final premise is that the efforts to\nreform our institutions must be complemented by\nequally vigorous efforts to change our own conduct as\nMembers of the United Nations. When we agreed to\nbecome Members of this Organization, we freely\nagreed to fulfil in good faith the international\nobligations arising from the numerous treaties,\nconventions and other instruments that have resulted\nfrom the comprehensive legislative work accomplished\nby this Assembly, United Nations agencies and other\ninternational organizations and conferences.\nHowever, the provisions of many of these\ninstruments are not being implemented. At times, in a\nmisguided defence of sovereignty, common\nexpectations are thwarted in order to satisfy national\ninterests that frequently are not of decisive importance.\nProtection of the environment and the law of the sea\nare good, but not the only examples of areas in which a\nsharp contrast can be seen between the extensive\nlegislation that exists and the degree of\nimplementation. Consequently, year after year, the\ncompetent international agencies and organizations and\nscientific authorities report the ongoing deterioration of\nthe general environment, the abusive exploitation of\nnatural resources, pollution of the seas and reduction or\nextinction of marine species.\nThe question of the fulfilment of obligations\nassumed is the weak link in the chain of\nmultilateralism. We must seek ways of ensuring respect\nfor international obligations. Over the long term, the\nsatisfaction of common interests is the best way of\nsatisfying the national interest.\nWithout prejudice to this profession of faith in the\nUnited Nations, Uruguay, a country of Latin America,\nis actively participating in the Organization of\nAmerican States and in the inter-American system in\ngeneral. Uruguay is also fully committed to regional\nintegration processes, in particular to the Common\nMarket of the South. We see in these mechanisms a\npromising avenue to help overcome the difficulties that\nresult from our status as a developing country emerging\nfrom the most serious economic crisis of its history and\ntrying to overcome the obstacles preventing it from\nachieving insertion into the global economy, such as,\nfor example, the huge subsidies that the industrialized\ncountries grant to their agricultural producers.\nIn this connection, finally, we cannot but mention\nthe recent ministerial conference of the World Trade\nOrganization, held in Canc\u00fan, whose lack of progress,\nin our opinion, is a negative signal to a world that is\ndemanding fairer and more balanced rules, especially\nfor countries such as Uruguay, whose economies rely\nprimarily on the production of agricultural goods. We\nare hopeful that renewed impetus in the negotiations\nwill permit us to achieve positive results in the coming\nweeks and months in Geneva, to the benefit of the less\ndeveloped countries and the very future of international\ntrade.\nI close my statement conveying my country\u2019s\nsatisfaction and pride in seeing you, Sir, the Minister\nfor Foreign Affairs of Saint Lucia, a friendly country of\nour region, presiding over this Assembly. I wish you\nevery success in your work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn\nbehalf of the President of the Republic of Panama,\nMireya Elisa Moscoso Rodr'guez, and on my own\nbehalf, I extend my warmest congratulations to Mr.\nHunte on his election as President of the General\nAssembly at this session. The delegation of Panama is\ndeeply gratified that he has been appointed to guide our\ndebates, because he represents here the commitment of\ndeveloping countries, and in particular those of the\nGroup of Latin American and Caribbean States, to\nmultilateral efforts to achieve peace, respect for human\nrights, and sustainable development.\nStability and security, in their broadest sense, are\nthings to which all humanity aspires. We will never\nachieve these objectives, however, if, in attempting to\nshape this new world, we counter the aspirations of our\npeoples or attempt to base it on the systematic\ndevelopment of grand military alliances. Human\nsecurity, which is sought by all States, large and small,\ndepends exclusively on our dedication to the collective\nsecurity architecture that we have concentrated in the\nUnited Nations. Our duty, then, is to defend and\nstrengthen at all costs our Organization\u2019s objectives\nand purposes, in particular the integrity and authority\nof our international legal system.\nThe world has been through an extraordinary\nexperience this year, one that was hotly debated and the\nfallout from which is still far from clear. It is not too\nmuch to say that the trepidations over the events in Iraq\nthat were felt here in the United Nations and beyond\nhave had a number of repercussions both on the\ninternal work of this Organization and on the conduct\nof international relations.\nNevertheless, Panama is convinced that the\ndifferences that were aired in the Security Council are\na clear demonstration that it has functioned as it\nshould; that the diversity of opinions and approaches\nthat exist in the world were aired there without\nreservations; and that, although differences remained at\nthe end of the process, it had the marginal benefit of\nhighlighting the measurement and control requirements\nthat must be taken into account in the Security Council.\nApart from these differences, the Security\nCouncil acted appropriately in establishing a pragmatic\nrelationship with the occupying Powers in Iraq by\nmeans of resolution 1483 (2003) of May 22. In\naddition, our Organization is demonstrating that it has\nan irreplaceable role to play in the humanitarian field,\njust as it has in the political, diplomatic, economic and\nfinancial spheres.\nThe shocking slaughter that took place in\nBaghdad on 19 August and the killings of 22\nSeptember \u2014 painful acts of terrorism that took the\nlives of many national and international civil servants\nof the United Nations, including Special Representative\nSergio Vieira de Mello \u2014 must move us to consider\nand adopt urgent measures to ensure that the\ninternational community takes concerted action as soon\nas possible towards the reconstruction of Iraq. To all\ntheir colleagues and to the great United Nations family,\nwe express the most sincere condolences of Mireya\nMoscoso, President of Panama, her Government and\nthe people of Panama.\nDuring the Millennium Summit, Panama asked\nMember States, among other things, to return to the\noriginal spirit of the United Nations Charter. Consistent\nwith that request, we hope that all of us will accept the\nobligation to reconcile ourselves with the general\ninterests of the international community and to avoid\nacting solely in light of our particular strategic,\nmilitary or political interests.\nWe repeat that request today, and call attention to\nthe urgent need for strengthening the multilateral\nsystem as the guarantee of stability and security, which\nare fundamental for peaceful coexistence. Today,\nperhaps more than ever before, we must tackle the task\nof reforming our Organization so that the General\nAssembly can fulfil its proper function as the principal\npolitical body, and the Security Council can have a\ngreater capacity to deal with the new challenges that\nthe end of the cold war has brought with it.\nTo achieve this objective, Panama stresses the\ncontents of the Declaration on the Strengthening of the\nUnited Nations and Security Council Reform, adopted\nat the Eleventh Summit of Heads of State and\nGovernment of the Rio Group, which met at Asunci n,\nParaguay, in August 1997, calling upon Member States\nof the United Nations to correct the present imbalances\nin the composition of the Security Council, improve its\ndecision-making mechanisms, and bring greater\ntransparency to the conduct of its work.\n21\n\nWe firmly believe that an extremely important\nelement in this and other tasks facing us is the\nannouncement by the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan,\nthat he will establish a high-level panel comprising\neminent personalities from all regions of the world.\nPanama and the world congratulate him on having\nproposed this initiative.\nWe also wish to have the General Assembly\nbecome the forum in which to seek a solution to the\nproblem between the People\u2019s Republic of China and\nTaiwan. As Panama has noted on previous occasions,\nTaiwan has, in a sense, been left hanging in time and\nspace, protected and yet unprotected. Recently, in\nresponse to the need to combat the severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, the World\nHealth Organization was able to provide direct and\neffective assistance to Taiwan without violating or\nweakening the fundamental elements of the positions\nof the parties to that controversy. We believe that the\nUnited Nations system could act in several ways to\nhelp the People\u2019s Republic of China and Taiwan\nresolve their dispute in a peaceful way, while we fulfil\nour most cherished objective of responding, without\nexception, to the social needs of humanity.\nLast July we held here the first Biennial Meeting\nof States to Consider the Implementation of the 2001\nProgramme of Action on Small Arms and Light\nWeapons in All Its Aspects. We are still quite far from\nachieving our objectives, both nationally and\ninternationally, but we believe that that biennial\nmeeting injected new vigour into the efforts that we\nmust all make to keep our commitments.\nWe repeat our position, put forward at that\nmeeting, that the purposes and code of conduct put\nbefore Member States in the first two articles of the\nCharter must be crucial for securing peace and\nunderstanding among the nations of the world.\nWe would also stress that the massive clandestine\ntrafficking in small arms and light weapons, which\nfuels internal conflicts, dictatorships, guerrilla\nmovements and international terrorism, can only be\nblocked through close international cooperation. With\nequal determination, we must pursue the networks of\ntraffickers in narcotics and diamonds, which use bogus\nfirms and banks, thrive by corrupting public officials\nand are constantly working to destroy our societies.\nIn a follow-up to the Monterrey Summit, we in\nthe countries of the South renew our call for creating a\nmore just and efficient financial system, for eliminating\nthe inequities of globalization and financing for\ndevelopment, and for raising the depressed prices of\nour raw materials and other export products. As we\nhave stated on previous occasions, there is also an\nurgent need to agree on the proper mechanisms for\nforestalling financial crises and finding a solution to\nunsustainable external debt burdens, in accordance\nwith resolution 57/240.\nWe now approach the High-level Dialogue on\nFinancing for Development, which will be held in this\ncity on 29 and 30 October 2003. We must seize this\nopportunity to reinvigorate this part of our activity, and\nto review the progress achieved in ensuring effective\nSecretariat support, pursuant to resolution 57/273.\nAt the second meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee\nto consider proposals for a comprehensive and integral\ninternational convention to promote and protect the\nrights and dignity of persons with disabilities, it was\ndecided to create a working group to prepare and\nsubmit a draft text for negotiation among Member\nStates and accredited observers.\nPanama\u2019s position is represented in the\nDeclaration of Quito of 11 April 2003, which, in brief,\ncalled for promoting and protecting the rights and\ndignity of the 600 million persons living with\ndisabilities around the world, the great majority of\nwhom suffer constantly from poverty and lack of\nunderstanding. The international convention that we\nseek, as noted in the Declaration, must reflect \u201cthe\nuniversality, indivisibility and interdependence of all\nhuman rights and the principle of non-discrimination.\u201d\nThese concepts are thoroughly established in the\nUnited Nations Charter, the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights, international human rights agreements\nand other related instruments.\nIt is timely to refer here to the persistent and\ngrowing worldwide HIV/AIDS pandemic. Latin\nAmerican and Caribbean countries, too, are confronted\nwith a serious situation in this area. The Pan American\nHealth Organization met in Washington on 11 June to\naddress this issue, and noted that the demographic and\nsocial impact of HIV/AIDS in our region threatens to\nundermine the ability to carry out development\nprojects.\nWe therefore call on the United Nations system to\nmake available to Latin America and the Caribbean\nadequate resources to prevent this scourge. As is well\n22\n\nknown, our region today has some 2.5 million people\nsuffering from this terrible disease.\nIt is clear that the moral and technical presence of\nthe United Nations is essential in efforts to eradicate\npolitical, racial and religious intolerance, and in\nsupport of negotiations for pacification, reunification,\nself-determination and reconstruction, in order to\nensure that the peoples concerned can enjoy the\nbenefits of development.\nHaving said this, I urge our Organization to find\nexpeditious ways of helping those who are committed\nto the so-called road map for resolving the conflict\nbetween Palestine and Israel to secure the active\ncooperation of the countries of the region and of the\nGovernments of Israel and the Palestine National\nAuthority, so as to overcome the current scepticism\nover any imminent possibility of seeing the two\npeoples living in peace, within secure boundaries, as\ntwo sovereign States.\nEnsuring that that urgent task is carried out\nsuccessfully will require the ongoing participation of\nall of the neighbouring States. They must demonstrate\na joint willingness to become guarantors of the stability\nand security of the Israeli and Palestinian peoples and\nguardians of strict adherence to the Charter of the\nUnited Nations and to Security Council resolutions.\nI would like to conclude by referring briefly to\nthe International Criminal Court. With the election of\nits Judges and Prosecutor, the Court has become a\nreality. We recognize the concern that has been\naroused, particularly among the States parties to the\nRome Statute, by the fact that the Security Council, in\nits resolution 1487 (2003), renewed for one year the\nprovisions of resolution 1422 (2002) with regard to\nimmunity in cases relating to peacekeeping operations,\nas well as by the fact that bilateral immunity\nagreements have been negotiated separately by several\ncountries on the basis of article 98 of the Statute.\nPanama, a firm supporter of the International\nCriminal Court, believes that these pragmatic\nagreements are a response to a temporary situation, and\nthat they cannot and must not detract from the purposes\nand objectives of the Rome Statute. As States parties,\nwe cannot shrink from the obligations imposed by our\ndomestic jurisdictions in matters relating to war\ncrimes, and we are therefore convinced that the\npolitical concerns and suspicions of today will\ndisappear as it becomes apparent that persons who\ncommit monstrous crimes against humanity can never\nbe shielded by any State or protected by dreams of\nimpunity. Any State that holds to a different\ninterpretation on this point will be swimming against\nthe tide of human progress and international law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the\nGovernment and people of the Republic of Suriname, I\nwould at the outset like to take this opportunity to\nextend to you, Sir, a fellow brother of the Caribbean,\nand to the other members of the Bureau my sincere\ncongratulations on your unanimous election to guide\nthe fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly.\nSuriname shares in the satisfaction experienced\nby the Caribbean region. We are convinced that, given\nyour vast diplomatic experience and skills, you will be\nable to guide the affairs of the fifty-eighth session of\nthe General Assembly in a most effective manner. In\nthis regard, I can assure you that Suriname will support\nyou in every possible way.\nMy delegation would also like to express its\ngratitude to Mr. Jan Kavan, the President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-seventh session, for the\nmanner in which he chaired the affairs of this organ.\nWe wish him well in his future endeavours.\nLikewise, my Government would like to reiterate\nits support for Secretary-General Kofi Annan. His\ndedication to the goals and spirit of the Organization\nhas been exemplary and has served him well in\nprotecting the interests of humanity.\nMy Government strongly deplores the atrocious\nterrorist attack on the United Nations headquarters in\nBaghdad. Our thoughts are with the Secretary-General\nand with the bereaved families of those who perished\nas a result of the incident. We especially mourn the\ndemise of Sergio Vieira de Mello, a dedicated United\nNations staff member who laboured for the benefit of\nmany troubled societies.\nThe opportunities that arise from developments in\nthe world today are, unfortunately, not within reach of\nall the world\u2019s children. This world order, which is\nwell-developed on the one side, copes with serious\ndevelopment setbacks in the economic and social\nsectors on the other. Economic downfalls, declining\nhealth services and the persistence of an international\nnon-supportive environment are all circumstances that\naffect the ability of Governments, in particular in the\ndeveloping countries, to adequately implement policies\nthat are required. There exists a wider disparity\nbetween the haves and the have-nots, not only in\neconomic terms, but also in terms of opportunities\noffered by the rapid development in the digital sector.\nGlobalization can become an avenue to global\ndevelopment only if it becomes all-inclusive and\nassumes a human face.\nThis idea was behind the sense of urgency and\nunderstanding that participants in the global\nconsultative process for development cooperation\nbrought to the meetings in Doha, Monterrey and\nJohannesburg. These meetings generated the needed\npolitical commitment and momentum, as did the\nMillennium Summit, at the highest political level. We\nmust maintain this momentum and continue to\n5\n\ndemonstrate the political will and energy to implement\nthe decisions carefully drafted at these meetings.\nTo accelerate progress towards these goals, there\nis a need for a set of policies that generate stronger\neconomic growth, complemented by action to enhance\nthe capabilities of poor people to participate in growth\nand to access key social services. As agreed in Doha\nand in Monterrey, these efforts should enjoy stronger\nsupport from the international community, in particular\nthrough increased market access for developing\ncountries.\nMy Government also holds the view that it is\nnecessary for all relevant actors to continue to be\ninvolved in the process that should lead to the\ncoordinated and integrated implementation of the\noutcomes of these meetings. Such an approach should\nput us on a path of economic and social development\nthat reduces poverty and works for all the world\u2019s\npeoples.\nInternational peace and security predominantly\noccupy the international agenda. The maintenance of\ninternational peace and security is a major concern of\nthe international community, as declining security\naffects the protection of human rights and the very\nexistence of all human beings. It is therefore important\nthat global security be based on a secured and just\nframework that promotes the peaceful coexistence of\nall States. The Government of Suriname is of the\nconsidered view that the United Nations and its Charter\noffer the best guarantee for the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. Abidance by the\nsecurity framework laid down in the Charter is\ntherefore of utmost importance.\nDeclining security affects every member of the\ninternational community. It is therefore essential to\nincrease the involvement of the general membership of\nthe Organization in the agenda and work of the\nSecurity Council, while an increase in the membership\nof the Council should reflect the international political\nand economic realities and security needs of\ncontemporary global society.\nThe principle of human-centred security might\noffer the best possible and most effective road to travel\nin order to meet the security needs of today\u2019s world. A\ncommitment to human-centred security will generate\nmore integrated international cooperation in many\nrelated fields, from conflict prevention to disarmament,\nincluding respect for the rule of law and for human\nrights.\nThe United Nations must continue to be\ninnovative in its search for effective ways and means to\nincrease global security. We must continue to argue for\nmore tolerance and understanding among peoples.\nSuriname is one of the most ethnically varied nations\nin the world, where people of different religions and\nracial backgrounds live and work peacefully together,\nand with a Government and Parliament in which\nHindus, Muslims, Christians and Jews form one front\nto collectively work on the development of our country.\nThe dialogue among civilizations, in particular\namong religions, must be encouraged. We must\nfurthermore seek to remove those circumstances that\ngive rise to situations that foster global insecurity. This\ntask must be given a central place in any overall\nstrategy to increase international peace and security.\nMaintaining international peace and security must\nincreasingly become a common responsibility\ninvolving all actors, Governments and peoples alike.\nThe restructuring of the United Nations must also\nresult in achieving a more effective General Assembly.\nIt is important that the General Assembly be\nperceived by the general public as an important\ninternational body contributing to its development and\nprosperity. A restructured General Assembly, as the\nsole universal deliberative body, must continue to\nspearhead the debate on development, but must also\nincorporate into its agenda other issues of a global\nnature that are of special importance to humanity.\nThe common task ahead is to collectively work\ntowards sustainable human development and to create a\nglobal society in which equity, equality and equal\nrights and opportunities exist for all human beings and\nextreme poverty can be eradicated. Achieving such a\nglobal society requires the involvement, determination\nand commitment of every Government, civil society\nand business sector, as well as coordinated and\ncomprehensive actions by all these actors in the global\nfight against poverty and injustice.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffYou have assumed the presidency of the General\nAssembly, Sir, at a particularly critical time, when the\napplicability of rules, the reliability of mechanisms and\neven the authority of institutions have been called into\nquestion. We are now living through a period of\nuncertainty and questioning \u2014 uncertainty regarding\nthe validity of certain fundamental principles that have\nbeen taken for granted and questions about the path to\nfollow and the actions to be taken. Against such a\ndifficult backdrop and at a time that is, to say the least,\nunpredictable, it is encouraging to know that we can\ncount on your experience and myriad talents to guide\nour work. Guinea-Bissau is gratified by your election\nand congratulates you most warmly.\nOur programme of work is a heavy one because\nonce again we have been unable to draft an agenda that\nis more streamlined and less repetitive. As in the past,\nwe will therefore be confronted by claims that are all\nequally legitimate; unfortunately, however, as always,\nrancour will occasionally raise its head. This\ndemonstrates the extent to which you, Sir, will require\nthe contribution of each and every one of us in order\nsuccessfully to complete your mission. In this respect, I\nnote with satisfaction that all delegations that have\npreceded us at this rostrum have assured you of their\nfull support. You may rely on the full cooperation of\nthe delegation of Guinea-Bissau. This is all the more\ntrue since you have established your mandate under the\nsign of action, for it is clear that it is indeed vigorous\naction that we shall need to convince those who today\ndoubt the ability of the United Nations to meet their\nexpectations.\nWe need resolute action to ensure respect for the\nprinciples and implementation of the objectives of the\nCharter. We need collective action to strengthen the\nUnited Nations capacity to resolve such urgent issues\nas poverty and hunger throughout the world, the\nHIV/AIDS epidemic, the right to full enjoyment of\nhuman rights, control of weapons of mass destruction,\nand the deterioration of the environment, our most\nprecious heritage, to name but a few. We need\nconcerted, multilateral and vigorous action against\nterrorism and all those practice, finance, instigate or\nare involved in it and commit such cowardly and\ndastardly crimes as the attack on the United Nations\nheadquarters in Baghdad. We also need action to\npromote the adoption of urgent measures to guarantee\nthe security of the Organization\u2019s personnel.\nWe need urgent and consistent action, too,\ndesigned to extinguish hotbeds of tension, resolve\n23\n\nconflicts and restore peace wherever it is threatened.\nWe need thoughtful, participatory and realistic action\ndesigned to improve the functioning of the United\nNations system by introducing the necessary structural\nreforms and more democratic, transparent and rational\npractices in the Security Council, in particular, and\nhere in the General Assembly as well. We need\nequitable and united action to redress inequality in\ntrade, which was recently denounced at the World\nTrade Organization Conference in Canc\u00fan, and to\nadvance socio-economic development in the most\ndisadvantaged countries.\nEach of us is aware of the daunting nature of the\nintricate task facing us. All these objectives and many\nothers require of us the steadfast will to harmonize our\npoints of view while keeping in mind the crux of the\nmatter \u2014 our shared responsibility to work together in\nthe interests of all Member States. This collective\nendeavour can and must succeed, without, however,\nobliging us to renounce our principles or ignore those\nrules, the relevance and utility of which we are well\naware. To that end, we have a unique and irreplaceable\nframework \u2014 the United Nations, the sole truly global\nforum.\nTo be sure, our Organization is far from perfect,\nbut how could it be otherwise in a world as complex\nand unequal as ours? Moreover, we are the United\nNations, as was so well recalled by the Secretary-\nGeneral before this Assembly. Thus, it is not\nunreasonable to believe that, if we agree and if we so\ndecide, our Organization could be restructured and\nbetter adapted to the rapid transformations we are\nwitnessing and, in response to the hopes of all, more\ncapable of meeting the growing challenges. The\nnecessary reforms are possible so long as Member\nStates have the genuine and unflagging political will to\nimplement them.\nWe have undeniably been sorely tried and tested\nthis year. The tragic events of 19 August are still vivid\nin our memories, along with the bitterly painful\nmemories of our late colleagues and friends, who were\nkilled in a cowardly manner and cruelly wrested from\ntheir families. We will never be able fully to express\nour debt to Sergio and all the others who lost their lives\nin the service of the United Nations and the noble goals\nand ideals that we champion and shall continue to\nchampion together. We must emerge from this ordeal\nmore resolute and more united. Circumstances require\nno less and we are ethically compelled to do so.\nI wish here and now to congratulate the\nSecretary-General on his leadership and dedication to\nthe cause of peace and to hail the dignity, compassion\nand humanism that he demonstrated in the face of such\na tragic ordeal as the brutal, wrongful and unforeseen\ndeaths of colleagues and personal friends.\nThe United Nations, for the first time in a long\nwhile, has been bypassed \u2014 indeed, forced to take a\nback seat \u2014 in the management of a crisis, the nature\nand gravity of which required it to play its due role\ntherein. Beyond the differences that emerged within the\ninternational community, and in particular among the\nmembers of the Security Council, regarding the right\nway to deal with an outlaw, recidivist and dangerous\nregime, the issue of Iraq once again highlighted the\nlimitations of an Organization that, while universal,\nnevertheless depends on a small number of its\nMembers. That is one of the reasons behind the many\nfrustrations voiced year after year from this rostrum.\nOur continent, Africa, still faces difficulties of all\nkinds. Poverty and endemic malnutrition are\ncompounded by the agonies of HIV/AIDS, which\ncontinues to kill millions of individuals. There is also\nthe growing number of conflicts and the proliferation\nof small arms, which pose an ongoing threat to the\npeace and stability of the countries of our continent.\nThis unfortunate picture is particularly accurate\nfor West Africa, where several armed conflicts have\nerupted in recent years, with Liberia as their epicenter.\nEveryone is now aware of what some of us, the\nRepublic of Guinea in particular, have been saying for\nyears: The civil war in Liberia is contagious and the\ntrigger of a series of crises and armed conflicts in the\nsubregion. It has now touched countries that were once\nheld up as examples of political stability and economic\ngrowth and were believed to be immune to such\ndisasters.\nMy delegation should like to welcome the\nprogress recently made in Liberia. The people of that\ncountry deserve finally to live in peace. It is a people\nthat, as we all know, has suffered greatly from many\nyears of war and destruction. We were also totally\nshocked to see all those children being used as cannon\nfodder in a war that was unjustified and unjustifiable.\nWe also note with satisfaction the progress made in\nSierra Leone. There, too, it was high time for peace to\nbe restored. We are also pleased that our friends in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo have finally\n24\n\ncommitted themselves on the path to progress and\nnational reconciliation.\nMy country, Guinea-Bissau, has undergone some\nchanges, the nature of which and the methods used to\neffect them have been subject to criticism, running the\ngamut from simple regret to formal condemnation.\nThese are positions of principle that we understand and\naccept, for we have never ceased to proclaim our\ndevotion to democracy and the rule of law. I recall here\nthat my country was one of the first in Africa to wage\nan exemplary liberation struggle on behalf of freedom,\nhuman rights and democracy.\nHowever, the sad realities of life, particularly\nwhen they are characterized by chronic and dangerous\nconstitutional instability, can unfortunately lead to the\noverthrow of an existing regime specifically to prevent\nthe exacerbation of social and political tensions in the\ncountry that could lead to confrontation or even civil\nwar.\nIn Guinea-Bissau, a military committee decided\nto reflect in action the hopes for change of the majority\nof the population. Not a single shot was fired. No one\nin Guinea-Bissau has been arrested and I welcome the\nfact that the military has rejected any consideration of\nexercising power. In such circumstances, it is hardly\nsurprising that the people have adhered to this\nmovement, which has effected the changes they\ndesired. Indeed, the people\u2019s support was total.\nThe members of the military committee for the\nrestitution of the constitutional and democratic order\nwere in fact acclaimed as genuine liberators. In\nGuinea-Bissau, we had been in an untenable situation.\nOur people, whose courage and dignity cannot be\noveremphasized, had had enough. They had reached\nthe limit of what one can decently ask someone to put\nup with. I cannot sufficiently reiterate the extent to\nwhich our people deserve to be encouraged, supported\nand assisted.\nNow that we have decided to turn the page, to\nlook towards the future and to determine how we, the\ncitizens of Guinea-Bissau, can be reconciled, unite our\nforces, create synergy and act together for the well-\nbeing of our people, the international community\nshould intercede on our behalf and to provide the\nfinancial assistance we need. It is indeed financial\nassistance that we need, because our country and our\nState are destitute. We need international assistance to\nrecover, to meet our challenges and to ensure that our\npeople can eat. We need to see to it that those who\nchose freedom some 30 years ago can finally see it\nflourish, enjoy its benefits and understand why they\nfought and why they have a right to a decent and better\nlife.\nI should like to say here that, right now in our\ncountry, a process is under way that is bringing\ntogether all the vital forces of our nation. The political\nparties, the military committee and civil society \u2014\neveryone has come together to meet the challenge as\none and to answer the call of the people to join forces\nand work together. As I speak before this Assembly,\nthe membership of the Government is under discussion.\nThanks to concerted action and a professional and\nintensive analysis of the situation in our country, we\nhave been able to adopt an interim charter that\nspecifies all the stages required to restore as soon as\npossible the constitutional and democratic order that\nwe and the international community wish to see return\nto Guinea-Bissau.\nAn Interim President has been chosen by\nconsensus. This President is dedicated to working for\nthe unity of the country. He intends to strengthen\nnational unity and to serve as a catalyst so that we can\nreturn to our ideal of progress and freedom.\nIn conclusion, I should like to thank our brothers\nand sisters of the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) subregion, who have striven\nto help us get back on our feet, discuss and find the\nmost appropriate solutions to our problems. I thank\nfirst of all the Heads of State of Ghana, Senegal and\nNigeria, who have visited Guinea-Bissau, as well as the\nECOWAS ministers, who have never failed to support\nGuinea-Bissau. I also wish to note the assistance\nprovided to us by the Community of Portuguese-\nSpeaking Countries, which dispatched the Minister for\nForeign Affairs of Timor-Leste to advise us and to\nvoice the solidarity of that linguistic community, to\nwhich we belong.\nA country\u2019s national unity is its most precious\nasset. I cannot overemphasize that fact and I hope that I\nshall soon see democracy fully restored in my country.\nAbove all, however, I wish to see the people of Guinea-\nBissau happy. It is a proud and dignified people that\nhas suffered in silence \u2014 a most eloquent silence \u2014\nand that deserves the trust and assistance of the\ninternational community.\n25\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me, at the outset, to congratulate you\non your election to the presidency of the fifty-eighth\nsession of the General Assembly. This session will be\none of the most decisive ones for the United Nations.\nIn that spirit, I welcomed the call of the Secretary-\nGeneral to heads of State and Government to actively\nparticipate in the work of this session.\nI have come to New York to solemnly reiterate\nBulgaria\u2019s steadfast support for the United Nations. Its\nprinciples, objectives and the spirit of solidarity that\ninspires it are at the very core of my country\u2019s foreign\npolicy. I should like to pay sincere tribute to the\nremarkable efforts of the men and women who work\nfor the Organization in every corner of the world. The\nterrorist attack against the United Nations in Baghdad\non 19 August reminded us that nothing that we wish to\ndo through the United Nations would be possible\nwithout the self-sacrifice of those people. I take this\nopportunity to honour the memory of Sergio Vieira de\nMello and his colleagues, and I express once again the\nmost sincere condolences of the people of Bulgaria to\ntheir families.\nThe barbaric act of 19 August sounded the alarm:\nterrorism is far from being vanquished; the vigilance of\nall United Nations Member States must be redoubled\nand the effectiveness of their efforts tripled. Indeed, the\nvery function of the Security Council\u2019s Counter-\nTerrorism Committee cannot truly be effective unless it\nis supported by regional and subregional organizations.\nIt is a question of creating a genuine global anti-\nterrorist action network in which a high-priority role\nnaturally devolves to the European Union, to the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and to the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE). In my view, it is important that all United\nNations Member States sign and ratify as soon as\npossible the 12 Conventions related to the fight against\nterrorism, as the Republic of Bulgaria has done,\nwithout, however, forgetting to address the origin \u2014\nindeed, the root causes \u2014 of these desperate acts.\nAt the end of this year, Bulgaria will conclude its\ntwo-year mandate as a non-permanent member of the\nSecurity Council. The conjunction of circumstances\ncaused our Council membership to coincide with a\nparticularly dynamic \u2014 indeed, dramatic \u2014 phase in\ninternational life, during which the very credibility of\nthe United Nations was put to the test. It is obviously\ntoo early to draw all the possible conclusions from that\nexperience, but one thing is clear: peace and stability in\nthe world need the United Nations now more than ever\nbefore. In other words, there is no alternative to the\nUnited Nations.\nWe note that the credibility of the United Nations,\nand particularly of the Security Council, have been\ncalled into question each time Member States have\nseen their unity shaken. It is in that spirit that Bulgaria\nis doing its best to avoid the pitfalls of discord.\nWe fervently hope that the Council\u2019s unity will be\nrestored on the thorny Iraqi issue. The stability and\nprosperity of Iraq \u2014 which is emerging from a\nferocious dictatorship \u2014 are in the interest of the entire\ninternational community. Contributing to the country\u2019s\nstabilization in a concrete way, Bulgaria is working at\nthe diplomatic level to find a formula that will enable\nthe Iraqis to recover their sovereignty as swiftly as\npossible through a central and important United\nNations role in the political process under way in the\ncountry.\nIt is essential that the Council be able to provide\nthe United Nations a clear and realistic mandate that\nwould facilitate the mission of the Secretary-General\nand his associates in Iraq \u2014 a mission that is already\nextremely complex and perilous. I believe that the\nprovisional Governing Council represents the\ninternational community\u2019s best partner for helping the\nIraqis to rebuild their country. In that context, Bulgaria\n7\n\nhopes to resume its traditional friendly relations with\nIraq.\nMy Government is very concerned as a result of\nevents in the Middle East. The road map elaborated by\nthe Quartet remains valid and must be implemented by\nthe parties concerned. The Government of Bulgaria\nreiterates its appeal to the Palestinian Authority to fully\nmeet its obligations under the road map to stop suicide\nattacks against civilians. We call on the Israeli\nGovernment to stop extrajudicial executions and to\nrenounce its plans to expel President Yasser Arafat.\nAlthough South-Eastern Europe is experiencing a\nperiod of peace, accelerated development and better\nprospects for integration into European and Euro-\nAtlantic institutions, there are still points of tension\nthat cannot be ignored. Obviously, I am thinking of the\nsituation in Kosovo, where the United Nations is\nplaying an irreplaceable role. Bulgaria hopes for a\nmulti-ethnic, democratic and prosperous Kosovo, as\nenvisaged by Security Council resolution 1244 (1999).\nThe recent acts of violence make us think that the\nenemies of that particular Kosovo have not given up. I\nshould like to take this opportunity to emphasize the\nimportance that my country attaches to respect for and\nprotection of religious monuments in Kosovo. I can\naffirm that the solution to the Kosovo problem can be\nfound in dialogue \u2014 particularly dialogue between\nPristina and Belgrade \u2014 that respects the right of all\nthe province\u2019s inhabitants to live in peace, whatever\ntheir ethnic affiliation.\nTwo years after having had the opportunity to\nspeak before the General Assembly, I have the\nprivilege to share with Members Bulgaria\u2019s significant\nprogress in attaining its principal foreign policy\nobjective: joining the European Union and NATO. In\n2004, Bulgaria will become a member of the Atlantic\nAlliance. We are about to conclude negotiations with\nthe European Union with a view to acceding to it on 1\nJanuary 2007. Such progress will enable my country to\nbe even more effective in the implementation of the\nprinciples and ideals of the Charter of the United\nNations.\nBeginning 1 January 2004, Bulgaria will assume\nthe chairmanship of the OSCE for one year. The\nBulgarian chairmanship of that important regional body\nwill devote priority attention to cooperation with the\nUnited Nations. In our view, the experience\naccumulated by the OSCE with regard to organizing\nand observing free and democratic elections could be\nas useful to the United Nations as to other regional\nforums. The defence and consolidation of human rights\nare naturally part of our priorities.\nIt is difficult for me to conclude without\nmentioning what I believe to be the main thread\nrunning through the discourse in this Hall \u2014 the future\nof the United Nations. One thing is certain: at a time of\nglobalization, the sole institution of multilateralism\nthat is universal in nature is in fact irreplaceable. The\ngreat issues of the modern world - international peace\nand security, the fight against poverty and for\ndevelopment, the defence and promotion of human\nrights, and protection of the environment and of human\nhealth \u2014 cannot find lasting solutions except through\nthe efforts of, and within the framework of, the United\nNations.\nIt goes without saying that the United Nations can\nmeet these formidable challenges only if it undergoes a\nprofound process of reform. Reform must be\nundertaken without violating the principles or spirit of\nthe Charter. It must be carried out with determination,\nbut not in haste.\nThe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, has\nidentified the genuine problems that we, the Member\nStates, must tackle. As always, he has asked the right\nquestions. My Government supports his efforts to assist\nMember countries in crafting a clear and far-sighted\nvision of the future of the United Nations, in particular\nby means of his idea of appointing a group of eminent\npersonalities to provide ideas for such reforms.\nBulgaria is ready to participate in that act of collective\nreflection, which will require both courage and\nwisdom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI begin by paying a tribute to Dr.\nAkila Al-Hashimi, a senior member of the Iraqi\nGoverning Council, who died earlier today.\nI had the privilege of meeting Dr. Al-Hashimi\nearlier this year in London and later in Baghdad, and I\nwas struck by her courage and her dedication to the\nIraqi people. Dr. Al-Hashimi was murdered by those\nwho would deny the Iraqi people the democratic,\nprosperous future they so richly deserve. The best\nservice that we can render her memory is to defeat the\nterrorists and to ensure that her vision of a peaceful,\nfree Iraq prevails.\nOf course, we owe this service to all those who\nhave fallen in the cause of peace in Iraq. Sergio Vieira\nde Mello and the United Nations personnel who were\nkilled or injured in the blast in Baghdad on 19 August\nwere committed to bringing the ideals of the United\nNations to the people of Iraq. They paid the ultimate\nsacrifice for their dedication. We mourn their loss, but\nwe will not weaken in our resolve to help the Iraqi\npeople rebuild their country on the principles of justice\nand security.\nWhat, I think, makes Iraq so important was the\nway in which it tested the role and purpose of this\ninstitution over more than a dozen years. Throughout\nthat period, the international community remained in\nagreement that the regime of Saddam Hussein posed a\nChapter VII threat to international peace and security\nby its proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\nprogrammes and its unparalleled defiance of the will of\nthe United Nations. Yet, earlier this year, sadly, we\ndivided on when and what action was necessary to deal\nwith the Iraqi threat.\nOf course, I acknowledge the controversy over\nthe military action which the United Kingdom, the\nUnited States and others took and the heavy\nresponsibilities we now bear, but I firmly believe that\nthe decisions we took were the right ones. The\nauthority of the United Nations was at stake. Having\ngiven Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime a final opportunity to\ncomply with the United Nations, what would have\nhappened if we had simply turned away? Would the\nworld be a safer place today? Would Iraq be a better\nplace today? Would the United Nations be a stronger\ninstitution today? The answer to each of those\nquestions is no. Saddam Hussein would have been\nemboldened by our failure to act; every dictator would\nhave been encouraged to follow his example; and the\nauthority of this United Nations would have been\ngravely weakened.\nYet, whatever the arguments of the spring, we\nhave now to come together again for a common\npurpose. As the Security Council has recognized in its\nthree resolutions 1472 (2003), 1483 (2003) and 1500\n(2003), we have a shared interest in helping Iraqi\ncitizens to embrace the rights and freedoms which they\nhave been denied so long and for which this institution\nwas founded. Yes, the security situation does present\nformidable challenges. Terrorists who despise freedom\nare seeking to plunge Iraq into chaos. They have\ninflicted terrible blows on the Iraqi people, coalition\nsoldiers and international aid workers, but ultimately\nthey will fail.\nAnd let us also not lose sight of what has been\nachieved and what is taking shape. Saddam Hussein\u2019s\nreign of terror is over. The apparatus of torture and\noppression which claimed hundreds of thousands of\n31\n \nlives is at an end. Instead, we have the beginnings of a\nrepresentative Government run by Iraqis for Iraqis;\nnew ministries providing daily services to the people; a\nfree press; the freedom for members of all religious\ncommunities to worship as they wish; hospitals and\nschools in operation; bustling traffic on the streets and\nhighways; and a start to real economic regeneration.\nWe shall stay in Iraq as long, but only as long, as\nit is necessary to meet our clear responsibilities and to\nrestore sovereignty to the Iraqi people as quickly as we\ncan in an orderly manner. I hope very much that we can\nagree a new Security Council resolution to strengthen\nthe United Nations role in Iraq. In managing this\ntransition, we should be guided by three central\nprinciples: first, the transfer of powers must reflect\nrealities on the ground in Iraq, particularly the need to\nensure security; secondly, the Iraqi institutions must be\nsufficiently robust to take on increasing responsibilities;\nand thirdly, the exercise of executive powers and\nresponsibilities must be based on good governance,\ninvolving representative Iraqi authorities and coherent\nconstitutional arrangements. In other words, the timetable\nshould be driven by the needs of the Iraqi people and their\ncapacity progressively to assume democratic control,\nrather than by fixing arbitrary deadlines.\nIraq is, sadly, not the only territory in the Middle\nEast where the international community faces great\nchallenges. Three months ago, we all had high hopes\nabout the work of the Quartet of the United Nations,\nthe European Union, the Russian Federation and the\nUnited States in Israel and the occupied territories. It is\ntragic that these hopes were blown apart on 19 August\nby the terrorist atrocity in Jerusalem, which came only\na few hours after the terrorist atrocity against the\nUnited Nations in Baghdad, but the international\ncommunity has to stay united on both the means and\nthe ends in the Middle East. There are no alternatives\nto the road map and there can be no alternatives to the\noutcome the entire world wishes to see \u2014 two States,\nIsrael and Palestine, living side by side in peace and\nsecurity. This can be the only fitting memorial to the\nthousands who have died on both sides since the\nbeginning of this appalling conflict.\nThe breadth of the issues being tackled by the\nUnited Nations and its agencies demonstrates the\ncontinued relevance of this institution. The Counter-\nTerrorism Committee has given the United Nations a\nfocus for its work following  September two years\nago, but we must now build upon that work, giving the\nCommittee the expertise and the remit to reinforce the\ncapacity of Member States to tackle and to overcome\nterrorism.\nWe also know that proliferation is one of the\ngreatest threats we face alongside terrorism. Much\ngood work on proliferation is being done by United\nNations agencies, particularly the International Atomic\nEnergy Agency, but it is extraordinary that the Security\nCouncil itself has not addressed the issue of\nproliferation for over 10 years. In our judgement, it is\ntime that it did.\nProblems of internal conflict, on the other hand,\nare regularly on the Security Council\u2019s agenda. The\nUnited Nations has unrivalled expertise and experience\nin this area and has achieved great things in countries\nas far apart as East Timor and Sierra Leone, but nation-\nbuilding is a collaborative effort, requiring the\nresources and commitment of Member States if the\nUnited Nations peace-building is to be effective. We\ntherefore need new mechanisms to help prevent\nconflicts and then to help States before they collapse.\nWe must also make a real success of the\nMillennium Declaration. We have to overcome the\nsetback of Canc\u00fan and secure a positive outcome to the\nDoha Round.\nThese and other shared problems require\ncollective responses, as our Secretary-General so\neloquently said here in his speech on Tuesday. A key to\nthis is to ensure that the United Nations itself remains\nan effective global forum capable of delivering results.\nThe Secretary-General posed some difficult questions\ntwo days ago. I welcome his initiative to seek the\nadvice of a distinguished group to make proposals on\nreform. I welcome, too, his parallel commitment to\nmodernizing the United Nations and its agencies.\nFor our part, the United Kingdom is committed to\nmaking the Security Council more representative. The\nissue is not whether but how to do this. A bigger and\nmore representative Council, however, will not of itself\nmake it easier to make the tough choices which it has\nto face so often. The most important ingredient is the\npolitical will and determination of the members of the\nCouncil to take effective action.\nThe most important part of the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s speech on Tuesday was about the choices\nnow confronting the United Nations. He was right\nabout those. We have indeed come to a fork in the road.\n32\n \nDown one route lies a world in which the United\nNations strengthens its role as the collective instrument\nfor protecting our peace and security; down the other\nroute lies a world in which collective action becomes a\nsynonym for \u201cinaction\u201d. We must not take this second\nroute. The Secretary-General\u2019s speech was a challenge\nto all of us. We all share a world in which international\nterrorists strike down the innocent, regardless of faith\nor nationality, and we are all less secure when weapons\nof mass destruction are in reckless hands. We do not\nhave the luxury simply of rejecting unilateralism, while\nproposing no multilateral means of confronting and\ndealing with these threats.\nThe British Government is profoundly\ncommitted, as it always has been, to the ideals of the\nUnited Nations. To us, the importance of this\nOrganization has always been its ability to put those\nhigh ideals into effect. We will work wholeheartedly\nwith the Secretary-General and the international\ncommunity to ensure that the United Nations retains\nand strengthens both its idealism and its effectiveness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe\nserious events currently threatening international peace\nand security   armed conflict, terrorism, poverty,\ndisease and unfair trading practices   call urgently\nand firmly to mankind's conscience and, above all, to\nthat of the world's leaders. Guided by this\nconsideration, I come before this Assembly to share\nour common concerns with the other leaders of the\nworld and to seek appropriate answers that will restore\nconfidence and hope to humankind.\nGiven the importance of this gathering, the\nelection of Mr. Hunte to the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-eighth session in every way\nrepresents a tribute and a symbol of the honour being\npaid to a young and small nation, Saint Lucia. That\nhonour is ours as well   the honour of small States,\nwhich see this consecration as a demonstration of the\nUnited Nations awareness of the concept of the\nsovereign equality of States.\nWe extend the same sentiments to Mr. Hunte's\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan.\nWe must recognize, however, that all of our\nexpectations of this session will be chimerical if we do\nnot fully support the activities of the Secretary-\nGeneral. I therefore wish solemnly to congratulate Mr.\nKofi Annan on his active commitment to the cause of\npeace and justice and to reaffirm our complete trust in\nhim and our sincere encouragement. That is particularly\ntrue this year because our Organization was brutally\ntested and unfairly harmed by the heinous attack of 19\nAugust on the United Nations office in Baghdad, which\ntook the lives of a number of staff members, including\nthat of the Special Representative of the Secretary-\nGeneral for Iraq, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello. Burkina\nFaso once again pays tribute to their memory.\nThe convulsions of our times   reflected in the\nincreased hotbeds of crisis, the radicalization of\ninternational terrorism and organized crime, growing\npoverty and the proliferation of disease   convince us\nfully that international solidarity must remain active if\nwe are to guarantee our world the stability and security it\nso desires. Indeed, despite the undeniable involvement\nand efforts of the United Nations; regional organizations,\nsuch as the African Union; and subregional\norganizations, such as the Economic Community of\nWest African States, the Southern Africa Development\nCommunity, the Economic and Monetary Community\nof Central Africa and the Community of Sahel and\nSaharan States, to name but a few, in the management\nand settlement of many conflicts; and despite a certain\nnumber of success stories, such as the restoration of\npeace in Angola, Sierra Leone and more generally in\nthe Great Lakes region, the rolling wave of armed\nconflict, tension and instability threatens to become an\nongoing phenomenon.\nIn Iraq, given the tragic turn of events, we feel\nthat the Organization must once again be placed at the\nheart of the key responsibilities both in order to define\na transitional political process free of any taint of\ncolonialism and to rebuild the country.\nIn the Middle East, where the escalation of\nviolence and the intransigence of the belligerents make\nus fear the worst every day, we believe that the road\nmap offers an opportunity to emerge from this crisis.\nHowever, without an international body on the ground\n\n \nto follow up and monitor events, no agreement on this\nmajor conflict can work.\nWe cannot fail to mention the situations in the\nC\u00d9te d'Ivoire, Burundi, Sudan and the Horn of Africa.\nThe very least that can be said about these conflicts is\nthat they remain of concern, despite all the efforts that\nhave been made to settle them. Clearly, given its\nhistory and geography, the political crisis in the C\u00d9te\nd'Ivoire is a major source of anxiety to us, particularly\nsince the events of 19 September 2002. Above and\nbeyond its incalculable consequences in terms of\nhuman lives lost, human rights violations and economic\nand financial damage, that serious crisis has\ndemonstrated the extent to which we are so heavily\ninterdependent in our subregion. This is yet another\nreason to hasten integration. We therefore deeply hope\nthat the C\u00d9te d'Ivoire will return to lasting peace as\nsoon as possible through the implementation of the\nLinas-Marcoussis Agreement.\nJust as worrisome is the tenacity with which\nterrorism harries and defies the international\ncommunity, while using its own protean manifestations\nto evade the most impressive and sophisticated arsenals\nset up to contain it. Given the complexity of the\nphenomenon and the enormous obstacles to be\novercome, the only valid activity is to make a\ncollective response to what has become a threat to\neveryone. In this titanic struggle, it goes without saying\nthat Burkina Faso is on the side of civilization against\nbarbarism. It is pledged to this position, subscribing\nwithout hesitation to the anti-terror measures of the\nUnited Nations, particularly the relevant resolutions of\nthe Security Council.\nHowever, while anathematizing terrorists of all\nstripes, we must recognize that one of the sources of\nsuch tragedy is the despair of certain peoples, the\nvictims of intolerable frustration and injustice that are\nnot being addressed quickly enough. That is why we\nmust welcome the rejection by most countries in\nCancun of the unfair trading practices that subsidize\nthousands of farmers of the North while preparing the\ncertain deaths of millions of peasants of the South. It is\nalso why our claims on behalf of African cotton\ngrowers will intensify as the market becomes ever\nmore distorted. Considering that cotton production,\nwhich represents a tiny fraction of the economic\nactivity of the industrialized countries, is a key element\nof the poverty reduction policies and a basic factor of\nthe political and social stability of the States of\nWestern and Central Africa, it is easy to take the full\nmeasure of the bias to which we are subject. What is\ntrue for cotton is just as true for most of the\nagricultural products of the developing countries. We\nmust therefore work to redress such injustices.\nThe duty of solidarity in favour of development is\na moral duty for the countries of the North. Such\nsolidarity is an urgently-needed response to the\ndestitution of our populations, especially since it\naddresses peoples more than Governments. This\nimplies in no way that developing countries should be\ntaken in charge, but that they should be helped to\nassume responsibility for their own futures. As for\nAfrica, it has come to see that its salvation lies in\nendogenous development and has therefore decided to\ntake its own destiny in hand. That is the raison d''tre\nof the New Partnership for Africa's Development, to\nwhich the General Assembly is to devote a high-level\ndebate in the near future.\nIt will be noted that I have a personal stake in the\nproblems of development. I deeply believe that\ndevelopment through expanded job opportunities and\nthe progressive elimination of poverty is a sine qua non\nof peace and thus of the very survival of humankind.\nThis conviction led me to propose that, together with\nthe International Labour Organization, the\nOrganization of African Unity   and later the African\nUnion   begin considering the issue of employment\nand the fight against poverty in Africa. A ministerial\nmeeting was held in Ouagadougou in April 2002 on the\nissue in its many manifestations with respect to job\ngrowth as a means of defeating poverty in Africa.\nConvinced that such thinking must be carried out\nat the highest level, the African Union at its Maputo\nsummit decided to convene in Ouagadougou next year\nin 2004 a special summit of heads of State and\nGovernment on that very theme. For African leaders\nthis will mean turning into specific and realistic\nprogrammes and strategies their commitments to create\nemployment as a good way to combat poverty in\nAfrica.\nThat meeting will be preceded by a civil society\nforum, through which employers and employees, non-\ngovernmental organizations, the African diaspora,\ninstitutions and development partners will make their\ncontributions to our collective thinking.\nProgress, independence and peace are intrinsic\nvalues of democracy. All nations and peoples are\n12\n \nworking to meet that undeniable need. For more than a\ndecade, Burkina Faso has been firmly rooted in the rule\nof law, oriented by political pluralism, good\ngovernance and the strength of institutions that\nguarantee human rights. We are pursuing this anchor of\ndemocracy, convinced that there is nothing more\nimportant at stake. This requirement should be true for\neveryone   peoples, nations and international\norganizations.\nThus, the long-sought reform of the United\nNations, with the democratization of the institution, its\nstructures and operations, the main goal, is becoming\nan imperative. It must give greater and better\nresponsibilities to all nations, small and large, and\navoid exclusion, such as those that have been against\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan for 30 years. Nothing\njustifies keeping that country of 23 million inhabitants\nsidelined at the United Nations.\nWe are fully aware of the immensity and the\ncomplexity of the trials that disturb international life,\nbut they are not insurmountable. Who could doubt that,\ndespite such trials and pitfalls, the world could renew\nitself, if we were to agree to order our ambitions and\nefforts under the auspices of the United Nations? In\nthat connection, Burkina Faso, a Sahelian country,\naware of the continuing deterioration of the world\necological situation and its devastating affect on\ndevelopment, supports the idea of creating a\nspecialized United Nations body for the environment\npresented by President Jacques Chirac at the fifty-\neighth session of the General Assembly.\nIn conclusion, the clear awareness of what is at\nstake for the international community and, above all,\nthe commitment we have undertaken to protect future\ngenerations from the scourge of war, hunger and\nilliteracy, are also factors that auger a more peaceful\nand equitable society. We believe that, in that sign of\nhope and perseverance, we should always and\neverywhere direct our action.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIn September of each year the Member States of the\nUnited Nations politically rediscover the Organization\nof which they are shareholders and beneficiaries.\nThe practice of business as usual should not mark\nthis session of the General Assembly. The Secretary-\nGeneral suggested that the heads of State and\nGovernment come to New York to make their\ncontribution towards the strengthening of the United\nNations. Portugal, as a committed member of this\nOrganization, wishes to take part in this debate with a\nclear objective: to recognise, as does Kofi Annan, that\nthe United Nations is an indispensable tool, and also to\nrecognise that we must re-examine our practices and\nour working tools. Inactivity is not an option that this\nOrganization should contemplate.\nRethinking the United Nations means, first of all,\nreaffirming and rethinking its Charter. Maintaining\npeace and international security will continue to be our\nmain objective. But the reaffirmation of our faith in\nfundamental rights, in the dignity and worth of human\nbeings, in equality between men and women and in\nequality between nations, is also part of our vision for\nthe United Nations, as is the determination to promote,\ntogether, social progress and better living conditions\nfor our peoples.\nThese objectives must not be overlooked when\nthe Organization faces crises of confidence from time\nto time. The Secretary-General is correct in his\nencouragement to us to persevere. But a positive\nmental attitude is not enough. It is also essential that\nwe do not ask more of the Organization than it can\nprovide at any given moment. Otherwise, great\nexpectations will lead to great disappointments.\nRealism and pragmatism are necessary, but we\nmust not lose sight of the ambitious objectives that this\nOrganization is intended to serve. It is time for us to\nlook at the United Nations as a reflection of what we\nare collectively, and not as a convenient scapegoat to\nmask the incapacity that the Member States sometimes\nstill reveal when we should, but are unable, to act\ntogether.\n24\n\nWe are also bound to understand, sooner or later,\nthat we are facing common threats that require\ncommon responses. At the forefront of these threats is\nterrorism. In fact, a new type of terrorism has emerged:\nthe terrorism of mass destruction that constitutes a\ncrime against humanity; the terrorism that kills blindly\nand indiscriminately in New York, in Bali, in\nCasablanca and in Nairobi, in the name of non-values\npresented as values on ideological and religious\ngrounds; and the terrorism that did not spare the United\nNations itself, as we so tragically witnessed in\nBaghdad.\nThe crime which claimed the lives of Sergio\nVieira de Mello and his collaborators was an attack on\nall of the values which the United Nations represents. It\nwas an attack against us all. If there were still lingering\ndoubts or illusions when some thought that terrorism\nwas aimed essentially at some States, they disappeared\nin Baghdad.\nIt was not the Iraqi people who murdered Sergio\nVieira de Mello and United Nations personnel.\nTerrorists are responsible for that crime. It is not the\nIraqi people who are opposed to the United Nations\npresence in their country. Again, it is the terrorists. The\nUnited Nations must not bow to terrorism.\nPortugal believes that the United Nations should\nhave a central role in the definition of a global strategy\nfor fighting terrorism, largely because maintaining\ninternational peace and security depends on the\noutcome of this fight. It is a fight we must undertake\nwithout losing our souls, that is to say, the values on\nwhich this Organization is built. It is for this reason\nthat more security is necessary, but also more\ndemocracy, more dialogue between cultures and\ncivilizations, more development, more and better\nenvironmental protection measures and a drastic\nreduction in poverty.\nIt is also vital that this fight be undertaken in the\nname of, and with respect for, our law \u2014 international\nlaw. The concept of the rule of law should have real\nglobal resonance. This is why we defend the\nimprovement of the laws in force, namely through the\nnegotiation of a global convention on international\nterrorism. But we must also bear in mind that\ninternational law will be irrelevant without the\nimposition of its norms, by force if necessary.\nNew challenges and new threats require\ninnovative responses from the United Nations. It seems\nblatantly obvious that the composition and decision-\nmaking process of the Security Council are obsolete.\nBut changes are also needed in this Assembly, which\neach year automatically re-adopts hundreds of\nresolutions instead of adopting only those that are\nstrictly necessary. As for the Economic and Social\nCouncil, the most that can be said is that the external\nimpact of its actions is not perceptible, while the\nTrusteeship Council is nothing more than a relic devoid\nof any relevant objective.\nIn his report on the implementation of the\nMillennium Declaration (A/58/323), the Secretary-\nGeneral focused on this point with particular insight.\nThe proposals that he put forward should guide our\nthinking and joint action. But there is a particularly\nworrying aspect, on which we can, and indeed must,\nact without delay.\nI am referring to the need for the establishment of\na real preventive culture by the United Nations in\nmatters of armed conflict. In this context, we agree\nwith the relevance that the Secretary-General attributes\nto preventive diplomacy, to disarmament and non-\nproliferation measures, to peace-building, to respect for\nhuman rights, to good governance and to the\ndevelopment agenda.\nIn the final analysis, we must be fully aware that\nthe usefulness of the United Nations will always be\njudged as a function of its capacity to avoid and handle\nconflicts. In the implementation of that mission, the\nfundamental role lies with the Security Council, which\nhas, over the years, authorized various peacekeeping\noperations. The overall result has been positive.\nPortugal has contributed significantly to those\noperations and remains available to continue to\ncollaborate with the United Nations.\nBut conditions on the ground are not always\nclear-cut, and it is not always possible to separate what\nis and what is not a conflict, and what would justify or\nnot an intervention by the Security Council. There is an\nimmense grey area that can be perilous in pre-conflict\nand post-conflict situations.\nWe must also create the tools for dealing with\ncountries and situations that do not need support in\nterms of security, namely through a peacekeeping\noperation. The intervention of the United Nations at the\ncritical phase of a conflict, followed by a premature\nwithdrawal, may well end in failure, which will\n25\n\nessentially lead to the waste of the investment made by\nthe international community up to that point.\nThis assessment recommends, for example, that\nthe United Nations continue to monitor closely the\nsituation in East Timor. It is a country whose\ndemocratic institutions are still in the consolidation\nphase. Without a tradition of self-government, it has\nmade uncommonly rapid progress in several areas but\nis still in need of our help and attention. If we truly\nwant East Timor to be a real success story for the\nUnited Nations, it is important to give the people of\nEast Timor time to consolidate their institutions.\nHowever, in other cases in which a peace\noperation is not yet justified and where State\ninstitutions are fragile, where there is an enormous lack\nof basic services and development has not taken off, it\nis advisable to have a strong United Nations presence,\ncoordinated on the ground by the Secretary-General.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to\nmention Guinea-Bissau, which is frequently\noverlooked and which once again requires our\nattention. Having avoided falling into a destructive\nspiral as has happened to so many countries in the\nregion, that country is still fighting to recover. It must\nbe helped, not ignored. They are a people who can and\nshould be helped by the international community \u2014\nand indeed deserve to be. For that reason, we support\nthe efforts of the Secretary-General on behalf of\ndemocracy and development and applaud the original\ncontribution of the Economic and Social Council.\nUnder the present conditions, the Security\nCouncil does not take into account all the factors\ninvolved in prevention: security, nation building and\ndevelopment. Each one follows a more or less\nindependent path.\nThere is one other factor to add: the Council is\nfully absorbed with the management of the most\npressing matters on the international agenda and at\ntimes demonstrates a notorious lack of attention to\nsome countries in pre- or post-conflict situations.\nWe believe there is a solid case for advocating the\ncreation of a new institutional mechanism: a new\ncommission with the mandate to routinely monitor\ncases of conflict-prevention and the creation of\nconditions for peace and development. In conjunction\nwith the Security Council and the Economic and Social\nCouncil, which would both preserve their respective\nareas of competence, this commission could identify\nand deal with the most pressing needs. For each of the\ncountries in situations of risk, it would draw up\nintegrated strategies allying the objectives of security\nand strengthening institutions and economic and social\ndevelopment. While other decisions of great importance\nare being prepared, we can \u2014 and should \u2014 begin here\nto deal with pre- and post-conflict situations.\nIt is not enough for the United Nations to affirm\nits relevance. It is absolutely indispensable that the\nOrganization is seen as relevant by the Member States\nand that States act accordingly. The credibility of the\nOrganization must not be questioned. Otherwise its\nfunctioning and effectiveness may be severely\ncompromised.\nIraq is undoubtedly the case that requires of us\nall, in particular the members of the Security Council,\nthat we carefully evaluate the Organization\u2019s capacity\nfor action. A collective turn of the page is necessary,\nsince there is no valid alternative to a policy that\nenables the Iraqi people to freely define their system of\nGovernment and political leadership and that maintains\nthe country\u2019s political and territorial integrity. To build\na democratic society on the ruins of one of the most\nviolent dictatorships of the past century is a challenge\nthe international community must not shrink. It is a\ntask that demands much realism with respect to the\ndifficulties to be confronted.\nFor that very reason, Portugal has always been in\nfavour of the progressive involvement of the United\nNations in Iraq\u2019s stabilization process, with a\ncorresponding gradual transfer of power to Iraqi\nrepresentatives. We also encourage the Security\nCouncil to come to a rapid understanding on this\nmatter. For our part, we are already taking concrete\nsteps, including in the security field, to support all\nthose that are already locally assisting the Iraqi people\nto live in freedom.\nA larger commitment by the international\ncommunity is indispensable for resuming the Middle\nEast peace process. The road map cannot be shelved. It\nis up to us to demand a proactive attitude from all\ninterested parties. Also, we should not be indifferent to\nthe Palestinian people\u2019s legitimate desire for liberty\nand self-determination. Israel and Palestine will have to\ncoexist in peace and in security, within recognized\nborders. But here again, terrorism, which only benefits\n26\n\nthe enemies of peace, must be condemned without\nambiguity.\nGreat challenges generate great opportunities. It\nis up to us, the Members of the United Nations, to\ncreate the conditions that will allow this Organization\nto function in accordance with its potential and the\nideas that were an integral part of its creation. Those\nideas remain valid, and Portugal stands ready to give\nits contribution.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me at the outset to congratulate His Excellency\nMr. Julian Hunte on his well-deserved election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly. We are convinced\nthat his well-known personal and professional qualities\nwill allow him to lead our work to full success.\nWe particularly welcome the fact that a fraternal\nCaribbean country should hold so high a position. We\ntrust that your election will shed light on the role of the\nsmaller nations in this Organization and will allow us\nto consider the challenges that small economies face.\nToday, once again, the international community is\ngathered at the United Nations to consider the most\nserious problems afflicting mankind and to design\nspecific measures to resolve them. In so doing, we\nmust recall the essential purpose of this session  \nattaining peace, justice and well-being for each and\nvery individual on this planet. Indeed, the human right\nto peace informs, nourishes and justifies all other basic\nrights and constitutes the very essence of the purposes\nand principles of the United Nations.\nBasic individual freedoms, political, social and\neconomic rights and commitments to sustainable\ndevelopment and disarmament all have a single\npurpose   securing peace, freedom and happiness for\nall. The first step towards peace therefore is full respect\nfor human rights.\nFundamental human rights constitute a minimal\nframework of guarantees necessary to ensure the\nintegral development of the human person and the\nconstruction of a harmonious society. For that reason,\nrespect for human rights at all levels of society and for\nall peoples, without distinction, is indispensable.\nCosta Rica advocates for the strengthening of the\ninternational mechanisms for the promotion and\nmonitoring of human rights. We must overcome the\npoliticization of verification machinery by creating\n31\n\nobjective criteria for the implementation of human\nrights instruments in such a way that verification itself\nencourages policies that promote human rights and that\nconsolidate their protection.\nSimilarly, it is necessary to achieve the\nuniversality of international treaties that promote\nrespect for basic rights. In that context, we welcome\nthe fact that, in conjunction with the current general\ndebate, a special treaty event to promote the signature\nand the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the\nConvention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman\nor Degrading Treatment or Punishment is being held.\nThat instrument constitutes an effective mechanism for\npreventing those very serious violations of human\ndignity.\nWe welcome the creation and the establishment of\nthe International Criminal Court (ICC) at The Hague,\nthanks to the successful election of its Judges last\nFebruary. Fortunately, mankind now possesses an\neffective, independent and impartial institution with the\nauthority to prosecute the most serious crimes that\ninfringe upon human dignity.\nWe also deem it urgent to consider the\nrelationship between human rights and the\nenvironment. We welcome the fact that the\nJohannesburg Plan of Implementation recognized the\nimportance of studying, in an exhaustive and\ntransparent way, that relationship between human\nrights and the environment, including the fundamental\nright to development. We consider it indispensable that\nthis item be added to the agenda of the General\nAssembly.\nFull observance of human rights is being\nthreatened by some recent developments in the area of\nbiotechnology. Unquestionably, progress in the areas of\nmedical science and genetic research facilitate the\ndevelopment and the discovery of new therapies and\nmedical techniques. However, those same technologies\npose new ethical challenges, because they can be used\nto violate human rights and assault the intrinsic dignity\nof the human person.\nThe use of human embryos in scientific\nexperiments, discarding them in the process, is\nunacceptable. Cloning reduces the individual to a mere\nobject of industrial production and manipulation. That\nis objectionable both morally and legally. Costa Rica\nsupports the prohibition of all forms of human cloning\nand has proposed a draft resolution to this end, which\ntoday has dozens of countries sponsoring it.\nThe second step in the path to peace is to make\ndemocracy a form of life. True democracy is a\npermanent process that demands daily efforts of\ncoordination and cooperation in order to respect the\nwill of the majority and the rights of the minorities.\nTrue democracy also entails equal opportunities in the\nareas of social and economic development.\nA third step to peace is disarmament,\ndemilitarization and the reduction of military\nexpenditures. The reduction of military arsenals\ndecreases opportunities for violence and makes it\npossible to devote greater resources to social\ndevelopment programmes. In that context, we welcome\nthe progress made by the Central American nations\nregarding the reduction of their armed forces and\nmilitary arsenals. Two States from the region have\nalready abolished their armies   Panama in 1990 and\nCosta Rica since 1948. We support the proposal of\nPresident Bolanos of Nicaragua, on the reasonable\nbalance of forces in the Central American region,\nwhich will generate greater transparency and\nconfidence.\nMy Government supports the adoption of a\ncomplete ban on arms transfers to all terrorist groups,\nas well as to those groups and Governments that\ncommit gross or systematic violations of human rights\nor international humanitarian law. The prompt adoption\nof a legally binding convention to regulate the arms\ntrade is urgent.\nWe urge those States that possess nuclear\nweapons to truly commit themselves to the nuclear\ndisarmament negotiations. We call upon all States to\nrenounce the development of new nuclear weapons and\nto ratify the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty.\nWe welcome the fact that the member States of\nthe Organization of American States have recently\nadopted a Costa Rican initiative on the non-\nproliferation of chemical weapons in the Western\nHemisphere.\nThe pursuit of peace requires the peaceful\nresolution of conflicts through the mechanisms\nestablished pursuant to international law. The\nInternational Court of Justice occupies a central\n32\n\nposition as the principal judicial organ of the United\nNations that ensures the rule of law in international\nrelations. We urge all States to accept its obligatory\njurisdiction without conditions.\nIn order to make further progress towards peace\nwe must strengthen United Nations mechanisms\ndesigned to prevent armed conflict and humanitarian\ncrises from occurring and to re-establish the peace once\nsuch conflicts have broken out. The Security Council\nmust carry out its duties in a more effective, active and\nfair way; no national interest should prevent it from\ntaking action. In this context, we must revitalize the\nSecurity Council reform process, which, after 10 years\nof work, still lacks results.\nIn order to attain peace and prevent civil wars, we\nmust devote sufficient financial, technical and human\nresources to the peacekeeping operations carried out\nunder the auspices of this Organization. Such missions\nshould enjoy the resolute support and effective\nparticipation of all nations, as was reaffirmed in the\nRio Group statement on the situation in Colombia,\nadopted on 24 May in Cuzco. We urgently appeal for\nthis Organization to support the peace process in\nColombia and to urge the guerrilla movements to sign\nan agreement to cease hostilities and enter into an\nopen-ended and transparent dialogue with a view to\nreaching a peaceful and definitive resolution of the\nColombian conflict.\nThe United Nations must decisively address the\ndeep-rooted causes of armed conflict. It is necessary to\neliminate the sources of tension and violence. It is\nessential to eradicate the economic, social and political\ninjustices that fuel conflict.\nThe change of regime in Iraq, which we welcome,\nhas given the United Nations and the international\ncommunity at large a unique opportunity to fully\nintegrate that nation into the international system. We\nmust not miss this opportunity. We therefore call upon\nthe occupying Powers, the rest of the international\ncommunity and the United Nations to work for the\nreconstruction and normalization of that nation.\nFurthermore, we must not allow Iraq to become a\nsource of regional instability or a breeding ground for\ninternational terrorism. We must bear in mind the\nsacrifice made by Sergio Vieira de Mello and all the\nother United Nations personnel who gave their lives in\nBaghdad for this Organization and for the people of\nIraq. Their sacrifice must guide us in our work. Their\nmartyrdom must lead us to devote every effort to the\nprotection of the fundamental right to peace.\nToday, peace is threatened by the resurgence of\ninternational terrorism. All necessary measures must\ntherefore be taken, in conformity with the rule of law,\nto prevent acts of terrorism and punish those who\ncommit them. The fight against international terrorism,\nhowever, should not become an excuse to violate\nhuman rights or to adopt repressive measures against\nan innocent population.\nIn 1971, the General Assembly approved the\nentry of the People's Republic of China into the United\nNations. That decision was correct, inasmuch as it\npromoted the universal character of this global\nOrganization. In accordance with that same principle,\nmy country has since that time been advocating that the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan also be represented in\nthis Organization.\nWe believe that the Republic of China on Taiwan\ncould greatly contribute to the work of this\nOrganization. For many years that nation was an active\nMember of the United Nations. It participated\nconstructively in all of its activities and the work of its\nbodies. Since then, the Republic of China on Taiwan\nhas been developing close and productive relations\nwith peoples and Governments throughout the world,\npromoting programmes and projects for the sustainable\ndevelopment of communities. In keeping with the\nprinciple of universality that the United Nations itself\npromotes, Costa Rica advocates that both Governments\nbe represented at this Organization.\nI have set out a series of steps that are\nindispensable if peace is to be fully enjoyed. Such steps\nare the very least we need to take in order to fulfil our\ncommitment to peace   and that commitment must be\nabsolute.\nMay God bless us all as we work for the well-\nbeing of humankind.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffEcuador, a country profoundly committed to peace,\nreaffirms its most categorical condemnation of\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Terrorist\nviolence can never be justified for any reason and must\nbe fought with firmness, using all legal measures at the\ndisposal of States to counter this global threat. The\n15\n\naction of terrorist organizations and networks respect\nno national or regional borders. The successful\neradication of terrorism depends on international\ncooperation and the concerted action of States in\naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations.\nSince I assumed the presidency of my country,\nand now the presidency of the Andean Community, the\nissue of Colombia has been at the top of my agenda.\nMy Government, on behalf of the Ecuadorian people,\nhas expressed its concern at that conflict because we\nare linked to our neighbour Colombia by great ties of\nfriendship and deep historical roots.\nBecause of the serious threat that conflict poses\nfor the entire region, at the summit of the Presidents of\nthe Rio Group, held in Cusco in May of this year, I\nmade the following proposal. I urged Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan to employ his good offices to give\na decisive boost to the peace process in Colombia. I\ncalled on the guerrilla movements operating in that\ncountry to sign a ceasefire agreement and to join an\nopen and transparent dialogue, accompanied by a\ntimetable with definite deadlines to be discussed and\napproved by the parties, in order to reach a lasting and\npeaceful solution to the Colombian conflict. That\nproposal was enthusiastically embraced by all the\npresidents of the Rio Group.\nThat unnecessary, fratricidal bloodshed is no\nlonger a problem limited to Colombia or even the\nAndean nations. It is a conflict that increasingly\nthreatens the peace and stability of the entire world. We\nmust take care and act immediately before the monster\nbecomes uncontrollable. Therefore, at this global\nforum, I ask for all free nations of the world not to\nremain passive but decisively to support the Secretary-\nGeneral of the United Nations in the search for lasting\npeace in Colombia.\nThe issue of external debt should cease to be\ntreated as a purely economic matter or as cold\nstatistics. It must be seriously examined for what it is, a\ngenuine human and social tragedy resulting from the\nimmense suffering it causes among innocent people. It\nis too heavy a burden, preventing the progress of poor\nbut serious countries such as Ecuador, which manages\nits public expenditures with great austerity and fiscal\ndiscipline at a very great social cost, in order to comply\nwith its international financial commitments. These\npoor but serious countries are making profound\nstructural reforms to bring order to salary, labour and\ntax arrangements. These poor but serious countries are\ncombating corruption, social injustice and impunity.\nThey are working tirelessly to put an end to the\nprivileges of a gilded bureaucracy and striving to\nmodernize their public corporations. But it is not\nenough: their merciless external debt absorbs the larger\npart of those efforts and savings.\nWe are not asking for gifts. We are people of\nhonour, and we will continue to honour our obligations.\nWe are only asking for the opportunity to grow, to\nbecome developed at a faster pace and to pay our debt,\nwhich otherwise could be perpetuated for eternity.\nHow can we achieve the minimum standards for\neducation, health, growth and social welfare that are\ncontained in the manuals of the United Nations if my\ncountry, Ecuador, must divert more than 40 per cent of\nits budget to servicing its foreign debt?\nExternal debt must be dealt with urgently and\nseriously; the alarming figures in that respect make this\nclear. It is imperative that a comprehensive, historic\nand humanitarian agreement be reached among debtors\nand creditors alike to reduce the burden on the budgets\nof our countries, so as to increase the availability of\nfunds for social investment, to overcome the obstacles\nand budget restrictions that are preventing us from\nmoving forward with social infrastructure projects.\nWe will continue to meet our external debt\npayments; we cannot speak of true democracy if we do\nnot pay the social debt. This is a tragedy and a source\nof weakness for democracy in poor but seriously\ncommitted countries such as Ecuador. This reality\nundermines democracy and democratic stability.\nOn the subject of migration, something important\nneeds to be said. Migratory flows along natural\nsurvival lines cannot be halted by physical or legal\nbarriers. In recent centuries, marked by colonialism,\nand during the first half of the twentieth century,\nmarked by wars, millions of people left their homes\nand went elsewhere to seek refuge in new lands, among\ngenerous people. That is why they came to America,\nand America lovingly opened its arms to them.\nLet me say to the people of the First World: now\nthat the flow is the other way around, now that your\nchildren and grandchildren are going elsewhere, we are\nwondering why you are not opening your doors to\nimmigrants. I would ask: if history, with its mysterious\ndeterminism, is carrying them again to other lands, will\n16\n\nthey able to cite humanitarian reasons, or the need for\nreciprocity, in order to be welcomed? On behalf of\nAmerica, let me say that we will once again receive\nothers.\nMy Government, through our Foreign Ministry, is\ncommitted to preparing the groundwork and creating\nconducive conditions for the thousands of Ecuadorians\nwho want to return home. They will be protected by\nbroad-based programmes that serve returnees. With\nrespect to those who decide to remain outside the\ncountry, we are endeavouring to secure temporary\nprotected status for the undocumented, allowing them\nto lead a life in conditions of normalcy and dignity.\nMy Government also is making tremendous\nefforts to secure capital and foreign investments in\norder to generate jobs and prevent our citizens from\nhaving to leave their country, while at the same time\nprotecting family unity.\nI have the honour of presiding over a Government\nthat is implementing a strategic plan that will allow\nEcuador to achieve and consolidate sustained economic\ngrowth. One of the fundamental tasks of my\nAdministration is the uprooting of corruption, because\nthat phenomenon has been enemy number one of\ndemocracy, and therefore of development and\nprosperity, for many people in our region.\nThe fight against corruption is priority number\none for my Administration\u2019s plan. That is what I said\nduring my electoral campaign, and I am fulfilling my\npromise.\nA handful of people devoid of morals, taking\nadvantage of political and bureaucratic opportunities,\nseized Government funds and bank deposits. Now,\nusing their political connections, protected by\nprestigious, well-paid attorneys, and abusing the\ngenerosity of the countries giving them shelter, they are\nenjoying with impunity the money they stole from my\ncountry \u2014 a theft that destroyed not only our nation\u2019s\neconomy but also shattered illusions and crushed\ndreams and self-esteem, as well as the right to a life in\nconditions of dignity for millions of Ecuadorians.\nTherefore, from this rostrum of honour and\nfreedom, of equality and democracy, I ask all nations\nthe world over and the judicial systems of those\ncountries where those people have taken shelter for\ntheir unconditional and immediate support in bringing\nabout the extradition of individuals wanted by\nEcuador\u2019s judicial system, so that they can be tried\nfairly and transparently. I ask also for support in\nreturning to Ecuador those ill-gotten funds.\nWithin my country, 13 million Ecuadorians have\nmobilized to move forward and, under my leadership,\nhave, in eight months, made spectacular strides, as\nreflected by economic indicators. We have managed to\ncontrol inflation, ratcheting down inflation from 12.5\nper cent to 7.3 per cent a year, with forecasts for next\nyear of 4 per cent. The trade balance deficit has been\nreduced by 62 per cent when comparing the period\nJanuary-July 2002 with the relevant period for this\nyear.\nWe signed an agreement with the International\nMonetary Fund that opened to us the doors to\nmultinational credit organizations, and we have\nmanaged to open the nation to the world, with the\nresult that foreign direct investment increased 70 per\ncent between January and July 2003 over the same\nperiod in 2002. Oil exports have grown by 25 per cent,\nand non-oil exports by 12 per cent.\nConfidence in our country is evident because the\nfinancial system is functioning more smoothly. Total\ndeposits are steadily climbing, registering an increase\nof 6 per cent over the past six months. International\nmonetary reserves recorded a 35 per cent increase.\nExternal public debt, which amounted to 82 per cent of\ngross domestic product in 1999, has been reduced by\n41 per cent in 2003. Our country\u2019s rating as a risk-\nfraught country has been significantly reduced. This is,\nwithout question, an achievement for my\nAdministration, because, through this indicator, the\ninternational economic community as a whole is thus\nshowing confidence in Ecuador.\nEcuador has great energy potential, with\nremaining reserves amounting to some 1.5 billion\nbarrels and in situ reserves amounting to approximately\n8.9 billion barrels.\nEcuador is opening itself to the world for\ninvestment in the energy sector. We are working on a\nvariety of large-, medium- and small-scale\nhydroelectric projects to double our current energy\npotential.\nThe current Administration is working for the\nfuture \u2014 not just for the period of my presidential term\nbut for the next 50 years. The mining sector has been\nextensively studied in recent years by the world\u2019s\n17\n\nmajor mining companies, which reached the\ndetermination that Ecuador has vast potential.\nNow that my country is regaining its economic\nstability, my Administration has turned its attention to\nsocial development. This is an Administration that will\npay not only its external debt, but also the social\ndebt \u2014 the one that has struck hardest at our own\npeople.\nEcuador is a country of many resources, natural\nand human. It is opening itself to the world, to foreign\ninvestment. Indeed, investment is on the rebound,\nbecause foreign capital flows into our nation during the\nperiod January-July 2003 grew by 189 per cent over\nthe same period of the previous year. We need more\ninvestment in the oil, mining, hydroelectric, agro-\nindustrial, and tourist sectors.\nEcuador is a country with a touch of magic, with\nstunning natural panoramas, cultural diversity and\nvaried customs. Located at the centre of the world, in\nnorth-west South America, Ecuador has natural\ntreasures such as the Galapagos Islands, the exotic\nAmazon jungle and majestic volcanoes such as\nChimborazo and Cotopaxi.\nFinally, let me say that Ecuador\u2019s international\npolicy is focused on working for sovereignty and is\nbased on the interests of the people whom I have the\nhonour to represent, in the framework of unswerving\nsupport for the rule of law.\nThe future of global society cannot be separated\nfrom the well-being of each of the peoples of the\nworld. If our global society is not just and equitable, if\npeople are not free to fight for their legitimate rights\nand to realize their aspirations, there will be no peace\nand we will be unable to defeat terrorism or to\neliminate poverty \u2014 the worst of human rights\nviolations.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffPlease allow me warmly to congratulate Mr. Hunte, on\nhis assumption of the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-eighth session. I would also like\nto thank Mr. Jan Kavan for his valuable contribution as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its last session.\nI also take this opportunity to express my\nheartfelt condolences on the recent tragic deaths in\nBaghdad of Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, Special\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for Iraq, and\nother United Nations staff members.\nThe twenty-first century is about to complete its\nthird year, with hope and distress coexisting side by\n28\n\nside. Peace and development remain the overriding\nthemes of the times and the shared aspirations of\npeople of all races, colours and nationalities. The\nconcept of democracy and equality has planted deep\nroots in the hearts of the people. The shared\nconfrontation of global challenges through stronger\ncoordination and cooperation has become the\nconsensus of the international community.\nCountries are increasingly closer in their\neconomic relations. Advanced means of\ncommunications have made it possible to share\ninformation in real time. With their interests closely\nconnected and intertwined, countries are finding\nthemselves more and more like passengers in the same\nboat. Regional cooperation has grown substantially in\nboth depth and scope, with cooperation mechanisms\ntaking shape at various levels. Regional economic\nintegration is forging ahead in many parts of the world.\nThere are, however, many worrisome aspects of\nthe international situation. Local wars and conflicts\ncontinue to emerge sporadically. Although the Iraq war\nis over, peace remains elusive, with no end of suffering\nin sight for the Iraqi people. With the situation between\nIsrael and Palestine still experiencing ups and downs,\nthe Middle East peace process remains a long, uphill\njourney. In Africa, wars are still raging in some\ncountries.\nNon-traditional security concerns such as\nterrorism, drug-trafficking, arms proliferation, the\nspread of diseases and environmental degradation have\nbecome more pronounced. Given modern conditions,\nthey can easily spread within regions or even across the\nworld, making the security situation of human\ncommunities even more complicated.\nHumankind still confronts severe challenges in its\ndevelopment. In the past 30 years, the number of least\ndeveloped countries has doubled, reaching 50, which\naccounts for one quarter of the United Nations\nmembership. The ever-widening gap between the North\nand South and the aggravated disparity between the\nrich and the poor have become a major factor breeding\nnew conflicts and wars and undermining regional\nstability.\nAt a moment like this, people are inevitably\npondering the same question: in the interest of world\npeace and common development, what kind of new\nworld order should we establish in the twenty-first\ncentury?\nChina is of the view that the future well-being of\nhumankind hinges on closer international cooperation\nand a multipolar world. We should promote democracy\nin international relations. Multipolarization does not\nmean back-pedalling into the age of spheres of\ninfluence or a replay of the now long-gone rivalry of\nmajor Powers. It simply means bringing about a new\nregime of international relations under which all\ncountries \u2014 big or small, rich or poor, strong or\nweak \u2014 are treated as equals, and under which no\ncountry has the right to impose its will on others.\nWe should cultivate a new security concept based\non the principles of mutual trust, mutual benefit,\nequality and cooperation. Security should be\nmaintained through cooperation, and disputes should\nbe resolved peacefully through dialogue. The frequent\nuse of force and the threat of its use should be avoided.\nThe practice of building one\u2019s own security at the\nexpense of others should be rejected.\nWe should support diversity in the process of\ndevelopment. Our world is a place of many colours and\nstyles. A single musical note cannot make a melody,\nnor does a phonetic alphabet make a language. Human\nwisdom has produced so many civilizations, allowing\nus to follow different paths of development and a\nvariety of values. It is through the exchanges,\nemulations and integrations of diverse cultures that\nhuman reason and wisdom shine brilliantly.\nWe should dedicate ourselves to the\nempowerment of developing countries in their large\nnumbers. The developing countries, which make up\nthree quarters of the world\u2019s population, should\nbecome a key pillar of a multipolar world. Without\ntheir extensive participation on an equal footing, there\nwill be no democracy in international relations or a fair\nand rational world order. Without their economic\nrevitalization, there can be no common development of\nall humankind to speak of.\nWe should step up multilateral cooperation.\nMultilateral cooperation in various forms should\nbecome the principal vehicle in the handling of\ninternational affairs. Countries should join hands in\ntaking on global challenges through globalized\ncooperation.\nIn a multipolar world, countries should respect\nand consult with one another politically, strive for\ncommon development by helping one another\neconomically, prosper together by drawing on one\n29\n\nanother\u2019s cultural strengths and jointly maintain\nsecurity through mutual trust, thus working hand in\nhand to realize the peace and prosperity of humankind.\nMore than half a century ago, our forefathers\ngathered to give birth to the United Nations. The past\n58 years have seen the Organization\u2019s notable\naccomplishments in preserving peace in regions and\naround the world and in promoting human development\nand progress. The spirit of the United Nations\nCharter \u2014 characterized by such words as \u201cto live\ntogether in peace with one another as good neighbours\u201d\nand \u201cto promote social progress and better standards of\nlife in large freedom\u201d \u2014 has been widely accepted in\nthe international community.\nThe United Nations has become the most\nuniversal, most representative and most authoritative\ninternational organization in the world today. This is\nwhat history affirms and what reality mandates.\nChina maintains that in the current situation the\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter\nshould be adhered to and earnestly abided by with a\nview to realizing democracy, the rule of law in\ninternational relations and the mutually advantageous\ncoexistence of the countries of the world.\nIn handling affairs affecting regional or\ninternational peace, all Member States are obliged to\nmaintain the leading role and authority of the United\nNations and its Security Council. China is in favour of\nan important role for the United Nations in Iraq\u2019s post-\nwar arrangements and reconstruction and supports the\nrestoration of sovereignty to the Iraqi people at an early\ndate.\nChina also supports the United Nations carrying\nout the necessary reforms to enhance its role and\neffectiveness in the light of changing circumstances.\nThe United Nations is a microcosm of our world.\nThe world\u2019s hope rests on a strong United Nations. In\norder to build a better future for humankind, it is\nincumbent upon us first to turn the United Nations into\na forum for cooperation instead of an arena of\nrecrimination. No country is entirely populated by\nsaints and therefore no country should have the right to\nthrow the stones of prejudice.\nTo that end, we should forsake all the old\nbaggage of arrogance, estrangement and narrow-\nmindedness and let harmony, understanding and\ntolerance ring out loudly as the undiminished themes of\nthis great Hall. The ocean is made great by all the\nrivers it takes in. Let that be the motto of all Member\nStates.\nDevelopment is the foundation for world peace\nand human progress. We stand for stronger\ninternational cooperation and the achievement of\ncommon development.\nThe current state of affairs \u2014 in which the gap\nbetween the North and the South has been widening\nwithout pause, with some countries of the South\nlanguishing in dire poverty \u2014 must be changed without\nfurther delay. The key lies in establishing a fair and\nequitable new world economic order in response to the\nrequirements of economic globalization.\nAn open and fair multilateral trading regime\nshould be established and improved. The principles of\nmutual understanding and mutual accommodation\nshould be followed to bring about due progress in\nmultilateral trade talks. Close attention should be given\nto reforming and improving the international financial\nsystem, setting up a financial early-warning mechanism\nand enhancing the capacity of countries to prevent and\ndeal with financial crises.\nStronger South-South cooperation and North-\nSouth exchanges should be promoted. The developing\ncountries should step up their cooperation and\ncoordination and gradually change their\ndisadvantageous position in the economic globalization\nprocess. This coming December, the second ministerial\nconference of the China-Africa Cooperation Forum\nwill be held in Addis Ababa, where the two sides will\nwork together to deepen their equality-based and\nmutually beneficial cooperation and open up a new\nhorizon in South-South cooperation.\nThe developed countries should also shoulder\ntheir duties and responsibilities by giving greater\nsupport to the developing countries in the areas of\nmarket access, funding, technology transfer, debt relief\nand trade terms.\nAll human communities make an organic whole\nwhen it comes to development. When hundreds of\nmillions of fellow human beings are suffering from\ncold and hunger, the rich countries should not nor\ncannot enjoy their riches by themselves for long. The\nstriking contrast in wealth is eroding the very dignity\nthat all human beings share. Upon the monstrous gap\n30\n\nbetween the North and South cannot stand the great\nedifice of future prosperity.\nWhile addressing the development issue, it is\nnecessary to highlight the need for a harmonious\ndevelopment of the economy and society.\nAt present, humankind\u2019s further development is\nbeing increasingly hampered by excessive population\ngrowth, environmental degradation, energy depletion,\nthe decline and demise of indigenous cultures, and\nother constraints. Sustainable development can be truly\nrealized only when there is harmony, mutual\ncomplementarity and mutual promotion between the\neconomy and society, and between their development\nand nature.\nIn the first half of the year, SARS struck a\nnumber of regions and countries, which testifies yet\nagain to the crucial importance of public health in the\ncontext of development. While countries should\nstrengthen their public health systems, the world in\ngeneral should enhance its capacity to deal with major\ndiseases and disasters through an improved globalized\ncontingency response mechanism.\nThe Chinese Government supports the proposal\nmade by the World Health Organization (WHO) and\ncertain countries at the fifty-sixth World Health\nAssembly for the establishment of a global fund\nagainst SARS and is ready to contribute to it. We call\non all countries to support the United Nations in its\nrelevant activities, including incorporating public\nhealth into United Nations development programmes\nand other action plans and promoting regional and\ninternational cooperation in this regard.\nLast fall, the Communist Party of China convened\nits 16th National Congress, which called for the\nbuilding, during the first two decades of the twenty-\nfirst century, of a society that is well off in all respects.\nThis past spring, a new Chinese Central Government\nwas elected at the 10th National People\u2019s Congress \u2014\nthus a smooth leadership transition was realized.\nIn the first half of the year, the people of China\nput up a heroic fight against SARS and won a\nresounding victory. Many friendly countries and\npersonalities in the world, together with the World\nHealth Organization and other United Nations\nagencies, have rendered us valuable support and\nassistance, for which I wish to express our heartfelt\ngratitude.\nChina has kept its economic growth in high gear.\nThe first two quarters saw the nation\u2019s gross domestic\nproduct grow by 8.2 per cent over the corresponding\nperiod of last year, and foreign trade grow by 39 per\ncent. China\u2019s economic efficiency has improved\nmarkedly, and its reforms on all fronts are progressing\nin an orderly way.\nNeedless to say, China is a developing country. It\nstill has a long way to go before all its citizens can live\na comfortable, even affluent life. Development,\ntherefore, remains China\u2019s top priority.\nChina\u2019s development requires a peaceful\ninternational and surrounding environment. We will\ncontinue to pursue an independent foreign policy of\npeace and will seek to play a constructive role in\nregional and international affairs.\nChina will continue to push for friendship and\ngood-neighbourliness in the interest of peace and\ntranquillity in the region. Based on our support for a\nnuclear-free Korean peninsula on which peace and\nstability should be maintained, we initiated and\nsponsored the three-party Beijing talks and the first\nround of six-party talks. China remains committed to\nresolving the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula\npeacefully through dialogue and the building of a\nlasting peace there.\nTo develop, China needs the world, and a\nprosperous world also needs China. The market and\ncooperation potential unleashed by a rapidly\ndeveloping China could bring fresh and immeasurable\nopportunities to the region and to the world at large.\nWe desire peace, stability and development. We\naspire to equality, mutual benefit and a win-win result\nfor all. Conforming to the tide of history, China has\nopted for the path of peaceful development, linking its\nrejuvenation with that of the region, with the interests\nof the majority of countries, and with the lofty cause of\npeace and development for humanity. We hereby\npledge our continued and ever-greater contribution to\nworld prosperity and progress.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I am also certain that you are an excellent\nsuccessor to an excellent predecessor.\nI would like also to pay tribute to our Secretary-\nGeneral, for his determined efforts and dedication to\nthe service of world peace and the fulfilment of the\npurposes of the United Nations.\nThe current session of the General Assembly\ntakes place in a complex international situation\ncharacterized by mounting threats that imperil the\npurposes and role of our Organization.\nIndeed, recent developments have marked the\nopening of a new phase of instability, uncertainty and\napprehensiveness, highlighting the dangers arising\nfrom the side-stepping of our Organization in the\nconduct of world affairs. More than ever before, the\nOrganization\u2019s irreplaceable role is brought to the fore,\nas a universal forum responsible for maintaining an\ninternational order based on peace, security and\ncooperation for development.\nThe international community finds itself squarely\nfaced with the duty to restore its cohesion and mobilize\nits means and energy towards full rehabilitation of the\nUnited Nations, through the upholding, by all, of the\nCharter\u2019s purposes and principles, which constitute the\nindispensable foundations for a civilized international\nsociety.\nWe have to revive the strong momentum gained\nas a result of the Millennium Summit and further\nenhanced and carried forward through the role played\nby the United Nations in organizing a collective\nresponse against terrorism in the wake of the wanton\nattacks of 11 September 2001. Those attacks were truly\nbarbaric.\nPeace, security, and development issues are at the\ncore of the mission of our Organization. Today, they\nrequire a renewal of our commitment to international\ncooperation, especially since we live in an increasingly\ninterdependent world, where problems are also closely\ninterrelated.\nWe strongly support the view that the United\nNations remains the best place where Member States\nshould join in collective endeavours in their quest for\nthe common good. We should cooperate within the\nframework of our Organization and work together to\npromote development and compliance with\ninternational law, in order to lay the foundations for a\nstable and secure world rooted in solidarity.\n13\n\nTherefore, strengthening our Organization and\nimproving its effectiveness stands as a collective task,\na top priority and a shared responsibility of all Member\nStates that seek to prevent crisis situations, address\nthreats to international peace and security, and ensure\nnecessary conditions for sustainable development.\nAmong the challenges that should be confronted by the\ninternational community, I will dwell on terrorism first,\nbecause preventing and combating terrorism still\nrequires a high level of vigilance, mobilization and\nmultifaceted cooperation at the national, regional and\ninternational levels.\nAt the risk of repeating ourselves, we will\ncontinue to warn against all misconceptions and the\ntendentious association of terrorism with a particular\nreligion, civilization or geographical area. Equally, we\nneed to agree upon an accurate definition of terrorism,\nso as not to affect national liberation struggles and the\nlegitimate right of peoples to self-determination. Such\na clarification should be provided as part of the draft\nglobal convention against terrorism, currently on the\ninternational agenda. Launching a genuine dialogue\namong cultures and civilizations will be helpful in\nfostering rapprochement and understanding among\npeoples, by combating prejudiced viewpoints and\nnarrow-minded perceptions. Situations will still be\ntense wherever peoples are deprived of their rights, and\ndenied freedom and dignity.\nThis is the case in Palestine, where the\nPalestinian people are still denied the enjoyment of\ntheir right to exist, despite the universal recognition of\ntheir national rights today. The prevarication, delaying\ntactics and systematic repression used by Israel for\ndecades to defer the settlement of the Palestinian\nproblem, have now led to an explosive situation that\nseriously threatens regional and global peace and\nsecurity.\nThe international community should become\ninvolved in a more decisive manner to put an end to\nthis spiralling situation, and firmly urge Israel to fully\ncooperate for a global, just and lasting solution which\nnecessarily includes the establishment of an\nindependent and fully sovereign Palestinian State, with\nAl-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, and the withdrawal\nfrom the Lebanese and Syrian territories remaining\nunder occupation.\nIn this same sensitive region, the Iraqi people\u2019s\ntragic predicament endures. We must emphasize the\nurgent need to help them establish their own\nindependent institutions, to exercise unhindered control\nover their economy and natural resources and to\nmaintain their unity and territorial integrity. In our\nopinion, only the United Nations can legitimately and\neffectively accompany the institution-building and\nreconstruction of the country, and its role in these\nprocesses is of paramount importance.\nIn our immediate region, in Western Sahara, the\npeople of this territory, 28 years after withdrawal of the\nformer colonial Power, are still waiting for the right to\nexercise in freedom, and without constraint, their\ninalienable right to self determination in compliance\nwith international legality. Algeria has consistently lent\nits support to the efforts of the Secretary-General and\nhis personal envoy, as evidenced by its support of the\nSettlement Plan and the Huston Agreements, signed\nand accepted by the parties to the conflict, the\nKingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front.\nBy accepting the peace plan for self-\ndetermination of the people of Western Sahara,\nunanimously endorsed by the Security Council last\nJuly, and submitted by the Special Representative of\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. James Baker, Algeria has\nonce again shown its availability to fully contribute to\nthe settlement of this conflict. This settlement must\ncomply with the right of the people of the Western\nSahara to decide, in sovereignty, on their destiny\nthrough a fair and free referendum of self-\ndetermination, to be organized and monitored by the\nUnited Nations.\nThe challenges facing the world in the fields of\npeace, security and economic and social development\nare particularly acute in Africa. This continent has\nendeavoured over the last few years, with resolve and\ndetermination, to settle the conflicts affecting several\nof its regions, thus generating and encouraging a peace\ndynamic.\nIn order to achieve its peace and developmental\ngoals, Africa must, above all, rely on the support and\nenhancement of African endeavours. No doubt,\nhowever, it also needs increased international\ncooperation and support. The strategy of the New\nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD) aims\nspecifically at an optimal mobilization of both African\nand international resources, and the harmonization of\nthese contributions through a partnership based on\n14\n\nmutual commitments and balanced interests and\nresponsibilities.\nThe G-8 countries and European Union member\nStates, as well as other countries and organizations that\nare partners of Africa, have already taken steps to focus\ntheir Africa-related policies and programmes in support\nof NEPAD. Such a partnership should be intensified to\nhelp Africa, which is still lagging behind, to increase\nthe pace of its development, to catch up in achieving\nthe Millennium Development Goals, particularly that\nof reducing poverty to half its present level by the year\n2015.\nEnhancing international cooperation is also an\nurgent task, in order to ensure the bases for sustained\ngrowth of the world economy, and actual integration of\ndeveloping countries into the fields of production,\ntechnology and trade. Basically, there is a need to\nensure the necessary conditions so that globalization\nwill offer genuine opportunities for all. This implies\npromoting equitable rules of the game to advance trade,\nfinance, investments and technology transfer.\nIn this connection, we are concerned that the\nrecent World Trade Organization Ministerial\nConference, held in Canc\u00fan, did not manage to draw a\nframework for negotiations to revitalize the Doha\nmeeting, which was already well behind schedule. We\nare still convinced that the reactivation of these\nnegotiations and their successful completion, in\nconformity with the development agenda, holds to a\nlarge extent the key to the growth prospects of the\nworld\u2019s economy.\nIt is therefore of critical importance to overcome\nthe remaining difficulties on the basis of an approach\nthat takes into account the interests and concerns of all\nparties, as well as the need to restore the multilateral\ntrading system\u2019s integrity, and effectively implement\nthe special and differential treatment afforded to\ndeveloping countries. Adequate international action is\nalso required to address growing phenomena that are\nbecoming more pronounced, such as speculative flows,\nmoney-laundering, financing of terrorism, illicit\npayments and bribery, as well as harmful practices in\nthe field of corporate governance. This is needed to\nstimulate productive investment and ensure sustained\nlong-term growth. It is therefore important to tap the\nhuge investment opportunities available in the\ndeveloping world, in particular, which eventually will\nbenefit the world economy as a whole.\nSignificantly increasing official development\nassistance and acting with greater resolve to find\nsolutions to the problem of the external debt burden of\ndeveloping countries, as well as improving access to\nworld markets for the products of the countries of the\nSouth would all go a long way towards enhancing the\ninvestment climate in those countries and towards\nincreasing their share of world trade, which remains\nthe ultimate goal for achieving sustained financing for\ndevelopment. At stake is the establishment of a new\ninternational partnership based on the equitable sharing\nof responsibilities and benefits.\nTo conclude, let me once again put on record our\nfull confidence in our Organization, whose mission in\nfavour of world peace and economic and social\ndevelopment for all peoples, remains more valid than\never. We shall therefore continue to call on all Member\nStates without exception to contribute to enhancing the\nOrganization\u2019s authority and to provide it with the\nmeans necessary to fulfil its responsibilities.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like at the outset,\non behalf of the delegation of the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea, to congratulate Mr. Julian Hunte,\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Saint Lucia, on his\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at\nits fifty-eighth session.\nI would also like to express appreciation for the\nefforts made by the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, to strengthen the functions and role of the\nUnited Nations, as required under current\ncircumstances.\nThe political situation today is more unstable than\never. We are confronted by new challenges as we try to\nmake this century one of peace and prosperity for\nhumankind. Countries have been designated, on the\nbasis of extreme national chauvinism and hostility, as\npart of an axis of evil and as targets of pre-emptive\nnuclear attacks. Unilateral military attacks are being\nopenly perpetrated against sovereign States under the\npretext of the war against terrorism and on the basis of\nsuspicions that they possess weapons of mass\ndestruction.\nThe principles of respect for sovereignty and\nsovereign equality are being violated, and international\nrelations plunged into increasingly severe\nconfrontation and antagonism, because of neo-\nimperialist practices that are based on the supremacy of\npower.\n26\n\nAs we are well aware, this situation is a product\nof unilateralism, which is compelling countries to be\nsubservient to the high-handedness and unreasonable\ndemands of the super-Power. My delegation is of the\nview that the pressing common task before States\nMembers of the United Nations is to reject\nunilateralism and build a new world in which all\ncountries, large and small, coexist peacefully.\nI would like to draw the attention of the\nAssembly to the principled position and sincere efforts\nof the Government of the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea to ensure a fair solution to the\nnuclear issue between the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea and the United States, which is now\nthe focus of attention of the international community. I\nbelieve that it will be a positive contribution to the\nwork of the current General Assembly.\nThe nuclear issue is, in its essence, an outcome of\nthe hostile policy pursued by the United States to\nisolate and stifle the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of\nKorea politically, economically and militarily. It\noriginated from this deep-rooted hostility, which denies\nour system and refuses to co-exist with my country.\nMy country\u2019s consistent position is to resolve the\nnuclear issue peacefully through dialogue and\nnegotiations. Denuclearizing the Korean peninsula is\nthe ultimate goal, the initiative of the Democratic\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea and the earnest aspiration\nof the entire Korean nation.\nAccordingly, at both tripartite and six-party talks\non the nuclear issue, my country advanced proposals\naimed at achieving the denuclearization of the Korean\npeninsula. The announcement of the Democratic\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea \u2014 United States Joint\nStatement of 11 June 1993, the adoption of the\nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea \u2014 United\nStates Agreed Framework on 21 October 1994 and the\nsubsequent process of their implementation have\nclearly testified to our peace-loving stand and its\njustness.\nThe Korean people as well as the entire world\nwelcomed the historic inter-Korean summit meeting in\nJune 2000 and its resultant adoption of the June 15\nNorth-South Joint Declaration. They also sincerely\nhoped that these developments would lead to peace and\nstability in the region.\nHowever, the welcome atmosphere and the\nexpectations for peace and stability, raised for a while,\nsuddenly disappeared, and one party has resumed acute\nconfrontation. My country has been singled out as part\nof an axis of evil and the target of pre-emptive nuclear\nattack. That was then adopted as a policy and put into\naction. In particular, following the visit by the United\nStates presidential envoy to the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea in October 2002, the United States\nreversed black and white, alleging that my country had\nadmitted to have a secret nuclear weapons programme.\nIt also proceeded to unilaterally halt the supply of\nheavy fuel oil from November 2002 in violation of the\nAgreed Framework, and eventually it nullified all the\nbilateral agreements.\nThe United States even put pressure upon my\ncountry to give up its nuclear programme and accept\nnuclear inspection with the aim of disarming the\ncountry, while openly attempting to overthrow the\nGovernment by force. The peace now maintained on\nthe Korean peninsula is entirely thanks to the powerful\ndeterrence to war, which has been built up by our\npolicy of independence, the songun policy. Our\ndeterrence policy is not intended to attack anyone, but\nto serve as a means of self-defence to safeguard our\nsovereignty in all intents and purposes.\nIn order to resolve the nuclear issue peacefully\nthrough dialogue, the hostile policy towards my\ncountry should be changed fundamentally. That is the\nkey to the solution of the nuclear issue. At the six-party\ntalks in Beijing in late August, my country set as a goal\nthe abandonment by the United States of its hostile\npolicy towards us in exchange for renunciation of our\nnuclear programme. To achieve that goal, we proposed\nto take all necessary measures through a package deal\nand to work towards the implementation of these\nmeasures on a step-by-step basis, following the\nprinciple of simultaneous action.\nOur proposal contains a detailed account of the\npackage deal and the order of simultaneous action for a\ncomprehensive and fair solution of the nuclear issue,\nincluding abandonment of the hostile policy towards\nthe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, the\nconclusion of the non-aggression treaty between the\nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and the United\nStates, renunciation of the nuclear programme and\nnormalization of bilateral relations.\n27\n\nSimultaneous action is a realistic way to\ndenuclearize the Korean peninsula, and any opposition\nto it is tantamount to rejecting denuclearization. Other\nStates participating in the Beijing talks also demanded\na package solution and simultaneous action, urging a\npeaceful settlement to the nuclear issue. However, the\nUnited States alone repeated its unilateral call for my\ncountry\u2019s abandonment of nuclear weapons programme\nfirst, with no reference to the change of its hostile\npolicy which is the key to the solution of the nuclear\nissue. The United States even behaved imprudently,\nasserting that a non-aggression treaty is neither\nappropriate nor necessary and that it is not interested in\nsuch a treaty.\nThe United States went so far as to insist that if\nbilateral relations are to be normalized even after my\ncountry scraps its nuclear programme, a full range of\nother issues such as missiles, conventional weapons\nand human rights should be addressed. In a word, the\nposition of the United States is that it will discuss the\nsteps that it will take only after we have taken every\naction. Under the present circumstances, in which my\ncountry and the United States are levelling guns at each\nother, asking the other party to put down their guns\nfirst does not make any sense. This demand can only be\nconstrued as having the ulterior motive of disarming\nand eliminating my country.\nThe result of the six-party talks has convinced us\nonce again that the United States is seeking to disarm\nus by means of pressure and that it is still pursuing the\nhostile policy of stifling our country. Since it has been\nproven that the United States is only interested in\nturning the six-party talks into a ground for completely\ndisarming and eliminating my country by all means,\ninstead of co-existing peacefully with us, we have been\ncompelled not to maintain any interest in or\nexpectations for such talks.\nAs clearly stated, we have never made any\npromises with regard to the next round of the six-party\ntalks. All developments concerning the nuclear issue\nprove well that pressure can never be a means for\nsettlement of the nuclear issue and multiparty talks can\nbe fruitful only when there is commitment to the\nabandonment of the hostile policy towards my country.\nOur demand is modest and simple. We just want both\nsides to drop their guns simultaneously and co-exist\npeacefully.\nHaving reaffirmed the position of my\nGovernment, which I believe is the most reasonable\nand just in addressing the nuclear issue, I hope that the\nPresident and the United Nations Member States have a\ncorrect understanding of our position and actively\ncooperate for a fair solution of the nuclear issue and for\npeace on the Korean peninsula and in the region as a\nwhole.\nThe Government of the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea remains steadfast in its policy and\ndetermination to realize peace and the reunification of\nKorea and thus contribute to peace and security in the\nregion and in the rest of the world. Thanks to the ideas\nof national independence and great national unity of\nthe great leader General Kim Jong Il, the inter-Korean\nsummit meeting was held in Pyongyang for the first\ntime since the national division and the North-South\nJoint Declaration was made public on 15 June 2000.\nThat marked a turning point in accelerating national\nreunification through the concerted efforts of the entire\nKorean nation. Despite ups and downs in recent years,\nthere are active efforts to realize independent and\npeaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula under\nthe banner of the June 15 North-South Joint\nDeclaration.\nThis year alone, a series of North-South\nministerial-level talks were held and a groundbreaking\nceremony to re-link interrupted railways and roads took\nplace. Reunions of separated families and relatives\ntook place, and various economic exchanges are now\nunder way.\nOn 15 August, independence day, a splendid\nnational meeting for peace and reunification was held\nin Pyongyang that demonstrated once again the\naspirations and determination of all Korean nationals in\nthe North, the South and overseas for reunification.\nThe Government and people of the Democratic\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea will achieve national\nreconciliation, unity and reunification and contribute to\nsecurity in the region and the rest of the world by fully\nimplementing the 15 June North-South Joint\nDeclaration, upholding the great idea of the respected\nGeneral Secretary Kim Jong Il.\nAn important task before Member States at\npresent is to establish a just and equitable international\norder and relations, in keeping with the aspirations and\ndesire of all humankind.\n28\n\nTo that end, it is important, among others things,\nto ensure that the principle of respect for sovereignty\nand equality is fully observed in international relations.\nUnilateralism and high-handedness should be totally\nrejected and opposed, as they contravene the Charter\nand principles of international law.\nIn order to establish just international relations,\nthe functions and the role of the United Nations must\nbe enhanced and democratized. Democratizing the\nUnited Nations means decisively enhancing the\nauthority of the General Assembly and reforming the\nSecurity Council.\nThe General Assembly should be empowered to\nreview resolutions of the Security Council on such\nissues as sanctions and the use of force directly\naffecting international peace and security and to submit\nits relevant recommendations.\nRegarding Security Council reform, we believe\nthat priority should be given to ensuring full\nrepresentation of the non-aligned and other developing\ncountries that constitute an overwhelming majority of\nthe United Nations membership.\nOur people graciously celebrated the fifty-fifth\nanniversary of the founding of the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea on 9 September, thus demonstrating\nthe dignity and the might of the Kim Il Sung nation,\nfirmly united single-heartedly around the great leader\nGeneral Secretary Kim Jong Il.\nThe Government of the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea will continue, on the basis of\nindependence, peace and friendship \u2014 the fundamental\nideals of its foreign policy \u2014 to contribute actively to\ninternational efforts for a just, equitable and new world\norder by further intensifying cooperation with all\nMember States.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to\nextend my congratulations to the President on his\nunanimous and well-deserved election as President of\nthe fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly. This\nis a difficult period for any person to preside over the\nGeneral Assembly, and I wish him every success. I also\nwish to thank Mr. Jan Kavan of the Czech Republic for\nhis exemplary work as the outgoing President.\nLast year, while addressing the General\nAssembly, I referred to the commencement of the peace\nprocess in Sri Lanka and promised to report on its\nprogress. Progress in the peace process in Sri Lanka is\ndue to the fact that we stopped talking about talking to\neach other and actually began to talk. We have been\nlucky, because the international community did not\nsimply talk about helping us, it actually did so.\nIn moving from conflict to peace in Sri Lanka we\ninitiated fundamental change in policy and strategy. We\nshifted from confrontation to negotiation, identifying\nand recognizing the root causes of the conflict. The\nsuccess story that Sri Lanka is fast becoming also\ndemonstrates the value of the support of the\ninternational community acting in concert. That the\nglobal community, moving with a common purpose,\ncan succeed in re-establishing peace, democracy and\nprosperity has been amply demonstrated in the Sri\nLankan experience. After 20 years of conflict, our people\nare now enjoying the fruits of 20 months of peace.\nThe role of the international community in\nenabling us to move from war to peace has been\noutstanding. The facilitation provided by Norway has\nhad the result of bringing the Government and the\nLiberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) together in\nseveral rounds of negotiation. President Chandrika\nKumaratunga's continuing declaration of commitment\nto a political solution has been invaluable. The moral\nand material support that our other frontline sponsors\n  India, the European Union, Japan, Canada and the\nUnited States, along with the multilateral institutions of\nthe United Nations and the rest of the international\ncommunity   have given, and continue to give to us,\nhas guaranteed that our efforts to consolidate and\nmaintain the peace will strengthen and develop.\nLast November at Oslo, our international partners\nendorsed and underwrote a paradigm shift in policy\nwhen the Government and the LTTE accepted that the\n13\n\nfuture political order in Sri Lanka would include\nmoving towards a federal polity where the unity and\nterritorial integrity of the country would be ensured.\nAgain, in June of this year at Tokyo, 52 nations and 21\nmultilateral agencies, many of them of the United\nNations system, pledged their support to Sri Lanka's\npeace efforts, rehabilitation and development\nprogrammes. The massive and unparalleled financial\ncontributions alone totalled $4.5 billion over a four-year\nperiod. Those are indeed landmark events underlining the\nvalue and strength of international action.\nI must, however, inform the Assembly that, like\nin all negotiations in a peace process, we find ourselves\ntoday at a temporary impasse in the talks. Within the\nnext few weeks we should know the results of a\ncomprehensive review undertaken by the LTTE in\nresponse to our earlier proposals regarding an interim\nadministrative arrangement for the north and east of our\ncountry. That they should take so much time and effort\ncan be seen as a positive sign. We in turn will look\npositively at the proposals put forward by the LTTE, and\nwill do everything in our power to keep the peace\nprocess moving forward to a successful conclusion.\nMeanwhile, our collective efforts, which have\nbeen handsomely supported by the international\ncommunity and multilateral agencies, at providing\nrelief, rehabilitation and development to the conflict-\naffected areas of the country are proceeding apace.\nEconomic growth is marching ahead, from a growth\nrate of -1 per cent in the year 2001 to possibly 6 per\ncent this year. And tourism is booming.\nThat has thus far been the story of Sri Lanka. In the\nrecent past there have indeed also been some success\nstories in the United Nations: in Haiti, Somalia, Angola,\nKosovo and East Timor. But they are not enough.\nThe United Nations represents a unique concept\nfor international order formulated by the Allied Powers\nto address challenges to peace and security and to\ndevelopment and democracy in the aftermath of the\nSecond World War. President Roosevelt, in his 1943\nChristmas Eve radio talk, said that as long as Britain,\nRussia, China and the United States stuck together in\ndetermination to keep the peace, there was no\npossibility of an aggressor nation arising to start\nanother world war.\nBut the world that the United Nations is called\nupon to represent today is an immeasurably changed\nworld. Today's problems, as the Secretary-General has\nreminded us, are problems that respect no borders and\nno laws. The proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction, environmental degradation, alienation and\nexclusion, conflict, global terrorism, disease and endemic\npoverty are foremost among those problems. Inescapably,\nthe United Nations remains the central, indispensable\nforum in which we can collectively and democratically\nrespond to the challenges that we face in common.\nBut the United Nations is under enormous stress.\nThat strain comes from the structure of the Organization\nitself. As a result, the adequacy and effectiveness of the\nrules and instruments devised over 50 years ago to bring\norder and reason to the post-Second-World-War\ninternational scene are being questioned. The apparent\nirrelevance of the current multilateral rules and\ninstitutions to deal with the manifold problems of today\ncompel our urgent attention. In the words of the\nSecretary-General, it challenges our ability to deal\nwith the least difficult issues and to do so effectively'.\nHence the rationale for reform   which is insistent,\ncompelling and radical   cannot be averted; for words\nwithout action are meaningless, as we in Sri Lanka\nhave learned at a bitter cost.\nTake for example the profound issues surrounding\nIraq. There are members in the Hall today who believe\npassionately that the United States and its allies were\nwrong to intervene in Iraq. Then there are those of us\nwho feel that the United States and its allies had no\nchoice but to intervene, that the failure of the United\nNations had created the need for a world policeman,\nhowever reluctant it might be. But Iraq is more than a\ndivergence of views on a major issue. It shows the\ninadequacies of the present collective security system,\na decision-making system which grappled with the\nissue of Iraq for over a decade without a solution and\ncreated a deadlock at a most critical time.\nThe United Nations has already paid a dreadful\nprice. The attack on United Nations headquarters in\nBaghdad not only deprived the world community of\nsome of its most devoted and talented servants but\nraised to the fore issues relating to the mandates\nentrusted to the United Nations by its Member States.\nIt represents, undoubtedly, a direct challenge   a\nchallenge which must be met.\nAny reform must be radical, so that in this\nchanged world   so different from the one it was\ncalled upon to serve in 1945   the United Nations can\nhave the capacity to cope with war, poverty, human rights,\n14\n\nterrorism and a dramatically changed environment in\nwhich weapons of mass destruction have become so\npotent a symbol. We have to move beyond rhetoric and\nfrom cosmetic change to major surgery if we are to\novercome the challenge ahead. Rhetoric is not a\nsubstitute for decisive action. Frantic activity is not a\nsubstitute for concerted action, and the adoption of\nresolutions does not make a tangible difference in the\nday-to-day lives of our peoples. Above all, let us recall\nthat inaction in itself is a deliberate and a considered\ndecision to do nothing. We should not rival the League\nof Nations' impotence on Abyssinia.\nThe problems we are encountering at the present\ntime compel us courageously and resolutely to address\nand overcome the fundamental inadequacies that afflict\nour international institutions and processes.\nThis year has seen the propitious coming together of\nthree events which have framed thus far the political,\nfinancial and economic ordering of our world. I refer to\nthis session of the General Assembly, the gathering of the\nFinance Ministers at the Bretton Woods institutions,\nand the discussions at Cancun on the reordering of the\nworld trade regime. At all three meetings, the call for\nstructural reform was insistent and compelling. All\nthree   the United Nations, the Bretton Woods Twins\nand the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\n(GATT)   were born out of the trauma and dislocation\nof the Second World War. For over 50 years they have\nserved our many causes in varying ways, at times with\nlimited success, at times with despair at their inability\nto effectively deal with the fundamental problems of\nthe day. After the Asian crisis, the Bretton Wood\ninstitutions came under close scrutiny, and today we\nare discussing how the developing countries can have\ngreater say in their decision-making.\nRecent experience under the Doha Round of the\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) process at Cancun\nfurther illustrates the problems that face us. No one\nexpected an agreed formula to come out of Cancun. On\nthe other hand, it need not have ended in collapse.\nThe Secretary-General's report has identified\nmany of the defects of the system that need to be\naddressed. Other speakers, too, have made proposals in\nthis regard. At this stage, I should like to mention that,\nin our view, any expansion of the Security Council as a\nresult of reforms must involve a manageable number,\nand Asia must be given its due. This was ignored in\n1945.\nWhile many have urged a radical reform of the\nstructure of the United Nations so as to make it able to\nrespond to the challenges that confront multilateralism\nat the present time, most have been hesitant to suggest\nideas that are both practical and doable. I believe that\nthe time has come for all of us who accept in principle\nthe value of this institution, the United Nations, and the\nobjective it stands for to think out of the box   to\nthink creatively, imaginatively and unconventionally.\nIf I were to hazard an approach, it would be along\nthe lines of going back to our roots. The outline of the\nUnited Nations prepared at Dumbarton Oaks in August\nand September 1944 was agreed to at Yalta in February\n1945 at the level of head of Government. The Charter\nwas signed at the final meeting in San Francisco, in\nJune 1945. All this was completed in just 10 months.\nI, for one, would like to suggest that the Secretary-\nGeneral and a carefully selected group of political leaders\nthemselves come up with recommendations for United\nNations reform. Their recommendations could be placed\nbefore a special session of the General Assembly, at\nwhich heads of State or Government would be present.\nI suggest that the time frame for this need not be\nany longer than at the inception of the United Nations,\n58 years ago.\nIn conclusion, let us remind ourselves that 11\nSeptember was a tragic wake-up call for all of us. The\n19th of August was a tragic wake-up call for the United\nNations.\nWe have before us a historic opportunity to build\na United Nations worthy of the people whom we have\nthe honour to represent   a United Nations where\nhonesty is not clouded by diplomacy, where realism\nreplaces rhetoric, and where action supplants treaties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, like\nmy colleague from Armenia, I would like to express\nmy highest tribute to the memory of the outstanding\nindividuals whose tragic loss is a blow to the international\ncommunity that is absolutely beyond repair.\nThe assassination of Anna Lindh, the Foreign\nMinister of Sweden, has demonstrated once again the\nrisk involved in noble dedication to public service in a\nworld exposed to senseless acts of violence and has\nfilled people all over the world with the deepest sorrow.\nThe death of Sergio Vieira de Mello and his staff\nmembers came as a shock to the international community.\nThe question is, why were they killed? That horrible act\nof terror seems to be highly symbolic because, in the\nwords of the Secretary-General, it directly challenges\nthe vision of global solidarity and collective security\nrooted in the Charter of the United Nations. Sadly, that\nis the context in which we must address the concerns\non our domestic and international agendas.\nLast year, when addressing the Assembly, I put\nforward a proposal to prepare a new act for the United\nNations at the dawn of the twenty-first century. I was\npersuaded then, as I am now, that such a document\ncould give fresh impetus to the principles and\nmechanisms of the United Nations in a changing world.\nIt should entail the elaboration of a new catalogue of\nnorms of international conduct in the face of the\nsecurity threats and global challenges of today.\nDevelopments on the international scene since I\nput forward that initiative have strengthened my belief\nthat the United Nations would only benefit from a new,\nstrong political signal reconfirming its role as a beacon\nof stability and a reliable instrument for managing\nchange.\nI believe that the best way to create the proper\nconditions for an unconstrained debate on the future of\nthe United Nations is to engage outstanding public\nfigures of international stature in an informal setting. I\nsuggested at the time that a group of eminent\npersonalities be charged with the task of producing an\noutline of the document, which would then be submitted\nfor assessment by Member States. The composition of the\ngroup should ensure its independence, appropriate\nintellectual format and knowledge of international\naffairs. In addition, such a group's excellent moral\nstanding and political weight would guarantee that the\ndocument designed to serve as an inspiration to\nMember States would be of the highest value. Thus, an\nessentially intellectual exercise initiated outside the\ninstitutional framework of the United Nations could be\ntransformed into a political process, culminating in the\nadoption of the new act by the General Assembly.\nI remain deeply convinced that despite the rapid\nchanges in the international environment precipitated\nespecially after 11 September 2001, the United Nations\ntoday   almost 60 years after its foundation   should\nretain a central role as a mechanism for resolving global\nproblems and as a guarantor of international legitimacy.\n33\n \nIt is a great source of satisfaction for me that the\nPolish initiative corresponds to the thinking of the\nSecretary-General and his efforts to increase the\neffectiveness of the United Nations and safeguard the\nposition of the Organization as the most important\ninstitution of international security and cooperation. I\nwholeheartedly support his views on the need for\nreview, and possibly a radical reform, of the\ninternational security architecture, as reflected in his\nlatest report on the implementation of the United\nNations Millennium Declaration (A/58/323), as well as\nhis timely proposals voiced at the outset of our debate.\nIndeed, we can no longer safely assume that our\ncurrent multilateral rules and institutions have the\ncapacity to confront the current array of old and new\nthreats to peace and security.\nSince I presented my proposal last September, we\nhave consulted extensively with governmental\nrepresentatives from a number of countries. A rich\ncollection of suggestions and comments has been\ncompiled that will be invaluable in developing the\ninitiative. In the consultation process, we were\nencouraged by the shared view of many countries as to\nthe need to adapt the United Nations to current\nchallenges.\nTaking into account the initial outcome of the\nconsultations, the Government of the Republic of\nPoland has produced a memorandum in which we have\nsketched a proposed outline of the mandate of the\nGroup of Sages.\nThe initiative, as reflected in the memorandum, is\nin effect an invitation to a conceptual and holistic\nreflection on the nature of changes in the international\nsystem and on the most desirable vision of a new, more\neffective international order. It deals with the questions\nposed by a whole spectrum of present-day challenges,\nincluding security risks related to globalization and the\nemergence of non-State actors, the development gap and\ninternational solidarity, governance and subsidiarity.\nThe novel character of today's challenges calls\nfor new ways of thinking and an innovative approach.\nIt is true that protracted regional conflicts remain a\nvery serious source of instability. Yet, along with those\ntraditional threats, today's security environment has\nbeen increasingly dominated by a combination of new\nthreats of a more diverse and unpredictable nature.\nThey originate mostly within State borders rather than\namong States, notably in failing and failed States that\nare unable to control their own territories, and they are\noften posed by non-State actors.\nTo use the Secretary-General's terminology,\ntoday's threats are both hard' and soft', and they\ntend to reinforce one another. We are confronted with\nterrorism that has a global reach, motivated by\nextremist ideology and unconstrained in its readiness to\ninflict massive casualties. We are facing a growing risk\nof proliferation of deadly weapons and the spread of\norganized crime that often accompanies State failure.\nThese hard' challenges are compounded by chronic\nunderdevelopment in many parts of the world.\nSoft' threats, such as widespread poverty,\ndeprivation, hunger, malnutrition and rampant\ninfectious diseases, take their tragic toll on peoples\nliving in countries with poor economic growth. These\nare usually found in regions where development is\noften thwarted by bad governance and violent internal\nconflicts that result in large-scale humanitarian crises,\nmassive abuses of human rights, political and social\ndisruption and, ultimately, the collapse of State systems.\nIn the face of the new realities confronting the\ninternational community, we need to forge a consensus\non the conceptual and political framework for the\noperation of the United Nations in upcoming decades.\nIn this context, let me stress that my initiative is not\nintended to revise or change the United Nations\nCharter, which should remain the basis of international\nrelations. Instead, the New Political Act should place\nthe Charter in the context of the ongoing transformations\ntaking place in the international environment. It should\nprovide a new conceptual framework for, and political\ninterpretation of, the Charter, adapting the United\nNations to present-day realities and regulating the\nOrganization's activities in those areas that are not\ncovered by the Charter. It should accomplish that goal\nby redefining the objectives of the United Nations,\nidentifying new tasks and specifying operational\nmodalities for the Organization.\nThe Millennium Declaration was a clear\nmanifestation of the ability of the Organization to take\nup new tasks and confront the most pressing\nchallenges. We must make every effort to increase the\ncapacity of the United Nations to achieve the goals set\nout in that landmark document, and I believe that the\nNew Act could add a political impetus to the\ncontinuous work under way to fully implement the\nDeclaration. Yet our experience in the post-cold-war\n34\n \nera made clear not just problems related to the capacity\nof the United Nations, but also the lack of clarity and\nconsensus on certain principles essential for effective\naction in the new security environment.\nA source of serious concern is the fact that the\nlack of an agreed and common interpretation of many\nterms and principles which are fundamental in the\ninternational domain could lead to chaos in\ninternational relations. The New Act for the United\nNations   while taking into account the current\nchanges in the international order   should therefore\nreflect the relations between numerous principles and\nthe international conditions dominated by non-\ntraditional threats. It should examine, for example,\nquestions related to issues such as respect for human\nrights and the principle of State sovereignty, the right\nof self-determination and territorial integrity, conflicts\nand crisis management, and the principle of non-\ninterference in internal affairs. It should also address\nthe possibility of inscribing newly emerged concepts,\nsuch as human security and the responsibility of States\nto protect the vulnerable, into the conceptual basis of\nthe international system.\nIt is a painful reality that the United Nations is\ndeeply divided. This limits its effectiveness and\noccasionally even calls into question its ability to act.\nThe basic question is, therefore, how can we restore to\nthe United Nations the sense of unity and cohesion\nembodied in the very name of the Organization? How\ncan we prevent paralysis in management by the United\nNations of international security? And how can we\nadjust the operating principles of the Organization so\nas to enable those countries that are able and willing to\nrespond adequately to new threats to act within the\ninstitutional framework of the United Nations?\nIn my view, this difficult goal is unattainable\nwithout a reaffirmation of the United Nations as a\ncommunity of shared values and shared goals. Such a\nreaffirmation could reintegrate the Organization and\ninfuse it with a new sense of purpose. Hence, at the\ncore of my initiative there is a need for a profound\nreflection on the values and principles that bind the\ninternational community together and define the\nbehaviour of States towards each other, towards other\nactors on the international scene and towards their\ncitizens.\nLet me reiterate once again that Poland strongly\nsupports the Secretary-General's intention to establish\na high-level panel of eminent personalities to examine\nthe role of collective action in countering current\nsecurity challenges and to review the operation of\nmajor United Nations organs, with a view to\nrecommending necessary reforms. This idea is in\nperfect conformity with my initiative. I believe that the\nideas which we collected in the course of last year,\nreflected both in the memorandum of the Polish\nGovernment and in the responses of leading experts\nand scholars, could provide a good starting point and\nmake a useful contribution to the work of the panel.\nI wish to affirm the strong commitment of my\ncountry to ensure the successful outcome of the\nSecretary-General's initiative. I intend to convey the\naforementioned collected comments of eminent\nintellectuals on the future of the United Nations to the\nPanel for its consideration.\nThe war against the murderous regime of Saddam\nHussain has exposed, in a painful way, the challenges\nrelated to the principles and practice of multilateral\naction and has revealed the unresolved dilemmas in\nthis domain, which   in my view   should be\naddressed in the New Political Act for the United\nNations. For the time being, though, the international\ncommunity must focus its attention on the situation on\nthe ground. I believe that the United Nations should be\na key factor in post-war Iraq's transition to the rule of\nlaw, democracy and independence. The tremendous\ntask of the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Iraq\nshould be shared by the entire international community.\nWe must work out arrangements which will help\nIraq assume, as soon as possible, its rightful, dignified\nplace among the nations of the world. For its part,\nPoland remains committed to the stabilization effort in\nIraq. Our participation in that endeavour is guided by\nthe need to create the conditions for the Iraqi people to\ndetermine freely their own future and to begin a new\nchapter in the history of that great nation, leading it to\ndevelopment and prosperity.\nOn Monday, 29 September, the United Nations\nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime\nwill enter into force. I am proud that the idea put\nforward by Poland during the World Ministerial\nConference on Organized Transnational Crime, held at\nNaples in November 1994, was transformed   with\nthe broad support of the international community  \ninto a binding United Nations Convention.\n35\n \n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the\nPhilippine delegation I would like to extend warmest\ncongratulations to the President and the members of the\nBureau on his election to the leadership of the fifty-eighth\nsession of the United Nations General Assembly.\nThe past twelve months have been a most\ndifficult and challenging period for the United Nations.\nA community of cynicism has formed regarding the\nability of the United Nations to rise above the morass\nof disunity and disruptive competition among major\nPowers to fulfil its catalytic role in promoting\ninternational peace and security and development.\nBut, while it is undeniable that the United\nNations has struggled over the past twelve months, its\npredicted decline is greatly exaggerated. Economic\nlinkages among nations have widened and deepened in\nmany sectors. The interconnectedness of the global\nvillage continues to infringe upon traditional political\nboundaries. For instance, the tentacles of international\nterrorism have spread insidiously all over.\nThese and current developments have displayed that\nwithout the centripetal pull provided by international\ncooperation and partnership through the United Nations,\nthe world would tend to drift apart. The rich would\nbecome richer and the poor poorer. Conflict and\ndisharmony would erupt along political, ethnic and\neven religious fissures. We face the paradox of a world\ncontracting through advancing technology and, at the\nsame time, drifting apart along the seams of inequality.\nThree years ago, 146 heads of State and\nGovernment and 189 Member States blazed the trail to\nthe future by crafting the Millennium Declaration. In\nthe three years since the millennium started, in the\nthree years since the Millennium Summit, much has\nbeen done, though much remains to be accomplished to\nachieve the goals that the United Nations set for the\ntwenty-first century.\nI am pleased to report that the vision of the\nMillennium Summit and pursuit of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals in my country have begun to bear\nfruit, as they have been applied in our peace process\nfor the southern Philippines, in Mindanao.\nThe Philippine Government and the Moro Islamic\nLiberation Front (MILF), the Muslim separatist group\nin the southern Philippines, realize that the prescription\nof the United Nations is the only correct and viable\none: that peace is an indispensable condition for\n9\n\neconomic development, just as development is an\nessential component of peace. Nothing will do more to\nlift the Philippines out of poverty than peace itself.\nThat is why we are negotiating peace with the MILF.\nThe Government of Malaysia has been a prime mover\nin helping us negotiate peace, and I thank them.\nTo complement these efforts, the Philippines has\nlaunched its bid for observer status in the Organization\nof the Islamic Conference (OIC). I will be attending the\nOIC conference next month in Malaysia and hope to\nuse that time to advance the peace process in Mindanao\nand advance understanding among all faiths.\nI wish to take this opportunity to thank the United\nNations community for its support for the Philippines\nas a non-permanent member of the Security Council for\nthe term 2004-2005, and to ask for your continued\nsupport during the elections to the Council.\nWe wish to contribute our long experience in the\nUnited Nations system, as an original founding\nMember of the Organization. We have actively\nparticipated in the Council's initiatives towards the\npreservation of global peace and security throughout\nthe past six decades, both as a past non-permanent\nmember and as a contributor to United Nations\npeacekeeping operations and other Council activities.\nThe Philippines has actively contributed military\nand police personnel to United Nations peacekeeping\noperations in Africa, Asia, the Americas, the Middle\nEast and Europe over the past half-century. We are now\npreparing to contribute a contingent to join the latest\nUnited Nations operation, the deployment to Liberia\nnext month.\nOur guiding principles for our Council participation\ninclude the following. The principle of collective\nsecurity established under the Charter should be\nobserved. The Security Council should maintain and\npursue a multilateral approach towards the performance\nof its primary role of maintaining international peace\nand security. Observance of the rule of law is of\nparamount importance in the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security.\nI believe that there is a strong role for the United\nNations to play in Iraq and welcome and encourage\nUnited Nations involvement to share the burden with\nother nations, like the Philippines, that are already\nparticipating in the reconstruction of Iraq.\nIt is heartening that we adopted an important\nresolution on conflict prevention at the last session of\nthe General Assembly. As long as conflicts occur, there\nis a need to strengthen our capacities for peacekeeping,\npeacemaking, and peace-building.\nInternational security, which in recent experience\nis mostly threatened by imploding and failed States,\nmust be animated by the need to protect individuals\nand communities from violence. It has also been amply\ndemonstrated that democracy is the condition most\nconducive to a flourishing rule of law.\nErecting mechanisms and infrastructure for the\nrule of law should be included as a key part of any exit\nstrategy of United Nations peace operations. It is our\nview that the Security Council should provide the\nleadership in moving the United Nations to a stronger\ncommitment to the rule of law in areas where the\nUnited Nations is conducting peace operations.\nMeanwhile, the challenges posed by the global\nthreat of terrorism are being effectively addressed\nthrough growing international coordination and\ncooperation, particularly in the exchange of\ninformation, best practices and lessons learned.\nWe are actively assisting the work of the Security\nCouncil's Counter-Terrorism Committee in fighting the\nspectre of global terrorism, and we are in the process of\nratifying the important international conventions on\nterrorism. At the same time, I am working with other\nheads of State to ensure continued cooperation in our\nbattle to rid South-East Asia of the threat of terrorism.\nWhat is required of us today is to link up once\nmore with the vision that our leaders charted at the\nMillennium Summit and other recent international\nconferences, and we should do this under the banner of\nthe United Nations.\nThe United Nations was created 58 years ago to\nserve as the multilateral forum of the international\ncommunity to join hands in confronting challenges. It\nis sobering to remember that no country, big or small,\nrich or poor, can feel safe or think that it can remain\nunaffected by violent conflicts, environmental\ndegradation and human suffering. The United Nations\nmust continue to adapt to changing conditions to fulfil\nits envisioned role, and we support the call of the\nSecretary-General for reforms in the structure of the\nUnited Nations.\n10\n\nThe United Nations is a sui generis global\ninstitution that can play a catalytic role to confront all\nthese challenges now and in the future. Therefore, it\nbehoves every Member of this Organization to make\nthe United Nations increasingly relevant and to invigorate\nit to become a modern, nimble and determined agent for\nchange, which benefits mankind's condition.\nWe should instil the concept of strength and\ngreatness, not in terms of the ability to achieve or\nmaintain dominance over others, but in terms of the\nability of nations to work with others in the interest of\nthe international community as a whole.\nWe favour the strength of consensus in which the\nfuture of world peace, security and prosperity lie.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI present the warm\nwishes of the Government and people of Solomon\nIslands on the election of Mr. Julian Hunte as President\nof the fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly. I\nalso offer gratitude to his predecessor for presiding\nover the last session.\nAnd we salute the Secretary-General for his bold\nleadership of our Organization. Through him, Solomon\nIslands wishes to pay tribute to the members of the\nUnited Nations staff and others who lost their lives\nduring the senseless attack on the United Nations office\nin Baghdad last August and the recent incident a few\ndays ago.\nFifty-eight years ago, the United Nations was\nfounded to, among others things, guarantee freedom,\npeace and security and to promote economic and social\nadvancement to all people. Over the years, many\nthreats to international peace and security have receded\nor been resolved. The cold war has ended. Security and\narms control regimes are in place. Institutions such as\nthe World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and\nothers have been established to address the economic\nand social dimension of humankind\u2019s needs.\nIn spite of these significant achievements, peace,\nsecurity and our quest for sustained economic and\nsocial development remain the main challenges of our\ntime. New and complex threats to international peace\nand security have emerged at alarming and global\nscales during the past decades.\nInternational terrorism continues unabated in\ndifferent parts of the world, targeting and killing\nmainly innocent and vulnerable civilians. There can be\nno other option but for the international community to\nredouble efforts to fight this evil menace on all fronts.\nSolomon Islands remains committed to its obligations\nunder Security Council resolution 1373 (2001). Steps\nare being taken to enact relevant legislation and to\naccede to international conventions to counter terrorist\nactivities.\nSolomon Islands believes that a lasting settlement\nof the crisis in the Middle East will have positive\n15\n\neffects on global peace and security. We therefore\nsupport the efforts to bring lasting peace and stability\nto the region, especially to the Israeli-Palestinian\nconflict and the situation in Iraq. The United Nations\nmust play a crucial role in the Middle East peace\nprocess.\nThe primary responsibility of addressing the\ndaunting challenges we face today lies with individual\ncountries. However, history proves that much more\ncould be effectively achieved through multilateralism.\nWe all agree that this era of globalization brings new\nglobal challenges. And global challenges require\ncooperative global solutions. The United Nations, as\nthe leading and legitimate multilateral institution, must\ntake equal responsibility in addressing the global\nchallenges we now face and must therefore be\nstrengthened.\nThis is why Solomon Islands supports the\nSecretary-General\u2019s ongoing reform of the United\nNations system as a process, not an event. Yes, the\nreform process has achieved positive results and\ngreater transparency, but we need to do more if our\nOrganization is to remain effective and relevant to the\nchanging political environment.\nA reformed and restructured Security Council is\nalso necessary. Japan, Germany and others deserve\npermanent membership in the Council. They are\nequally capable of contributing constructively to\nachieving and maintaining international peace and\nsecurity. The use of veto power by the permanent\nmembers should be restricted to the provisions of\nChapter VII of the United Nations Charter.\nRestoring law and order, economic recovery and\nsimply bringing normalcy to Solomon Islands have\nbeen difficult challenges which my Government faced\nwhen we took office in December 2001. But having\nmade the commitment to address these challenges\nthrough the Government\u2019s strategic plan and priorities,\nwe have engaged ourselves in a series of dialogues and\nconsultations with our development partners. Our\nintentions are clear \u2014 we want outside assistance to\nrestore law and order and economic recovery.\nLast July, with unanimous bipartisan support, the\nSolomon Islands National Parliament adopted enabling\nlegislation that authorized outside assistance to restore\nlaw and to help the economy to recover. Following an\nexplicit invitation by the Government, the Regional\nAssistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI)\nled by Australia, was assembled and deployed under\nthe auspices of the Pacific Islands Forum\u2019s Biketawa\nDeclaration and in accordance with the provisions of\nthe United Nations Charter.\nI am pleased to inform you that the immediate\nimpacts of RAMSI have been significant and positive.\nSecurity in terms of law and order has been re-\nestablished and the Government\u2019s finances are\nbeginning to stabilize. The course of action through\nRAMSI is the best option we took. It is a unique\nregional cooperative and partnership arrangement that\nis not merely limited to re-establishing and maintaining\npeace and security. It accords Solomon Islanders the\nbest real opportunity to rebuild the country and address\nthe deep-rooted problems we have had for years,\nincluding fighting corruption, restoring the principles\nof democracy, good governance and respect for\nfundamental human values and rejuvenating the social\ncohesiveness of our people.\nRAMSI\u2019s work ahead will be challenging, but we\nassure RAMSI of every support and cooperation. The\nGovernment and the people of the Solomon Islands are\nequally committed to achieving this common objective.\nWe deeply appreciate the overwhelming support\nof the Pacific Islands Forum countries, expressed\nthrough the Forum Declaration on the Solomon Islands,\nthe Forum Foreign Affairs Ministerial Statement and\ntheir active contribution as Participating Countries in\nthe Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon\nIslands (RAMSI). These countries are committed in\ntheir resolve to help a neighbour recover and rebuild.\nFor this, I say \u201cTagio tumas for helpem fren blong\niufala\u201d.\nWe also appreciate the support RAMSI has\nreceived from the wider international community, the\nCommonwealth, the United Nations, the European\nUnion and other individual bilateral donor partners. We\nlook forward to more active support to complement the\nimportant work RAMSI is doing in addressing the\nimmediate and long-term objectives and plans.\nThe Government\u2019s National Economic Recovery\nand Development Plan of 2003 to 2005 will be\nformally presented to our development partners in\nNovember. Our immediate objectives are to restore and\nmaintain law and order, to bring about macroeconomic\nNote: Solomon Islands pidgin for: \u201cThank you for helping your\nfriend\u201d.\n16\n\nstability and income growth, to restore full services in\nhealth and education and to re-establish the foundation\nfor sustained economic growth and human\ndevelopment.\nWhile the immediate security situation and\neconomic situation of the country are being addressed\nby RAMSI, the planned November meeting will\nprovide the opportunity for the rest of our development\npartners to define their respective roles and assistance\ntowards achieving these key objectives.\nAs a least developed and island State, our\neconomic, social and environmental vulnerabilities are\nmajor constraints to achieving sustainable economic\ngrowth and livelihoods. But we place our hope on\ngreater international support and partnership to address\nthese constraints in order to meaningfully and\nsuccessfully implement our national development plans\nand such key policy outcomes as the 2000 Millennium\nDevelopment Goals, the World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment (WSSD) Johannesburg Plan of\nImplementation and other programmes within the\ndevelopment agenda of the United Nations.\nImplementation of the 2000 Millennium\nDevelopment Goals has been slow. We have, however,\nnow incorporated those objectives into the\nGovernment\u2019s Economic Recovery and Development\nPlan of 2003 to 2005, as priorities for national\nimplementation.\nThe Solomon Islands looks forward to\nparticipating fully in the review process of the\nBarbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States. We\nenvisage the outcome of the 2004 international meeting\nin Mauritius to be one that will focus on real\ncommitments and practical implementations of the\nProgramme at the national and regional levels.\nThe Brussels Programme of Action for the Least\nDeveloped Countries (LDCs) provides yet another\nopportunity and dimension for addressing the pressing\nproblems facing poor countries. Implementation of this\nProgramme at the national level has been slow. Real\ncommitments from the international community to\naddress our constraints, including capacity and\nindebtedness, have, however, not been forthcoming\neither.\nWe commend the work of the High\nRepresentative of the Office for the Least Developed\nCountries in seeking international support and\ncommitment to implement the Programme. We further\ncall on the international community to seriously\nconsider more resolute measures, such as cancellation\nof debts to highly indebted poor countries.\nAs a member of the World Trade Organization\n(WTO), the Solomon Islands is equally concerned that\nthe Canc\u00fan meeting failed to yield positive results.\nLike other least developed countries, we have a key\ninterest in the development dimension of the Doha\nRound, and we wish to re-echo what we stated in\nCanc\u00fan, namely that a new, equitable and fair trading\nsystem must take into account issues such as the\ndifference in income, economic size, technological\ndevelopment and private sector capacities of countries.\nThe Solomon Islands attaches great importance to\nregional cooperation. The communiqu\u00e9 of the leaders\nof the Pacific Islands Forum last August, which has\nbeen made available as an official document of the\nfifty-eighth session of the United Nations General\nAssembly, reflects the range of issues that directly\nconcern us in the Pacific region. Those issues include\nclimate change and sea-level rise, fisheries and the\nprotection of our marine environment, trade,\nsustainable development and security-related issues. As\nsmall States with inherent geographical and structural\ndisadvantages, our strength lies in pooling our\nresources to address these issues collectively. We call\nupon the United Nations to take more active part in\nregional initiatives.\nAllow me at this juncture to express once more\nour strong support for Taiwan to be admitted as a full\nmember of the United Nations. It is an undeniable fact\nthat under international law, Taiwan is a sovereign\nstate. It has a transparent and democratic political\nsystem, a vibrant and progressive economy and a\nhighly efficient social system, all of which are\ncompletely independent with no control whatsoever\nexercised by the People\u2019s Republic of China.\nTaiwan is a willing partner, able to meet its\ninternational obligations under the Charter. Its\ncontribution to the international community and the\nglobal economy are well known. Yet only a fortnight\nago, this body once again denied the wishes of the\npeople of Taiwan to be considered for membership in\nthe United Nations. Over the years the international\ncommunity has discriminated against its 23 million\npeople. The delayed World Health Organization\n17\n\nassistance to Taiwan during the outbreak of severe\nacute respiratory syndrome early this year is an\nexample of how reasons of power politics prevail over\ntimely humanitarian assistance.\nI have made the assertion that the United Nations\nmust remain relevant to the changing political\nenvironment. It must live up to the fundamental values\nand principles enshrined in its Charter. It must remain a\nuniversal and all-inclusive Organization, capable of\nserving all its Members, however big or small, however\npowerful or weak and of whatever creed, religion or\npolitical belief. Every country must be treated with\nequal respect and attention. The United Nations must\nalso live up to its principle of equality of all nations in\nthis new millennium.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffExactly 10 years ago today, the Head of Tajikistan\naddressed world leaders for the first time from the high\nrostrum of the General Assembly. At that moment,\nfollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union, our country\nwas taking its first steps as an equal member of the\ncommunity of nations.\nThe establishment of Tajikistan as a modern,\ndemocratic, secular State coincided with the emergence\nof the need to search for our own ways of interacting\nefficiently in a rapidly changing world. Against the\nbackground of the inter-Tajik conflict, we had but little\ntime to find effective methods of dealing with the huge\npolitical, social and economic problems of the\ntransitional period.\nToday, full of pride in the peace-loving,\nindustrious and talented people of Tajikistan, I am able\nreport to the representatives of the world\u2019s countries\nthat we have emerged with dignity from the toughest\ntrial that has ever befallen our nation. It stands to\nreason that Tajikistan, its people and its statehood were\nable to withstand that trial largely thanks to support of\nthe international community. The United States,\nRussia, China, Japan, India and Iran, the European\nUnion and Central Asia States and many other\ncountries, large and small, supported the young Tajik\nState during that dramatic period of our history. The\nUnited Nations played a special role in this process.\nTajikistan greatly appreciates this support, and is\nstriving in turn to be a responsible member of the\ninternational community.\nA decade may not be sufficient time to take full\nstock of progress made on an international or national\nscale. However, trying to understand the lessons of the\nmultifaceted and dramatic events at the turn of this\ncentury could be very useful to our common quest to\nmake lasting improvements to the world order.\nFor Tajikistan, the main lesson to be drawn is\nclear: the future lies with democracy within sovereign\nState borders and with the democratization of\ninternational political and economic relations. The\nlesson to be drawn is that establishing a democratic\nsociety is in many ways the same for all countries, but\neach case is also unique. Our own experience has\nshown that today there are no countries or peoples\nunwilling to accept democracy or unprepared for it.\n2\n\nThe peoples of Asia cherish the same values as the\npeoples of Europe, America or Africa.\nIt is also obvious that specific conditions, and\neach nation\u2019s historical heritage and cultural traditions,\nclearly influence the pace and form of the democratic\nprocesses in each country. This issue was thoroughly\ndiscussed at the Fifth International Conference of New\nor Restored Democracies that was recently held in\nMongolia. We believe that its outcome will give a fresh\nimpetus to democratic processes everywhere, including\nAsia.\nEstablishing a democracy should not be\nconsidered as being easy to achieve, but rather as an\nextremely complex step-by-step process. In this sense,\nthe experience of developed democracies is indeed\ninvaluable. Nevertheless, even they are still struggling\nto strike an optimal balance between the interests of the\nState and the individual and resolve the question of\nhow to meet the basic needs of their citizens while\nrespecting the primacy of the right to private property\nin a market economy.\nThe people of Tajikistan won their independence\nand democracy through enormous suffering and\nhardship. Peace prevailed in our country only when we\nrecognized that national accord should prevail over\npolitical ambitions and military confrontation, as the\nhighest goal of society, united not only by common\nefforts to survive but also by a strong faith in its\ncreative capacity.\nThe brightest prospects for Tajikistan lie in a\nvision of a future developed democracy and prospering\nsecular State, bolstered by a strong civil society.\nDuring his visit to Tajikistan last year, Mr. Kofi Annan\ncould see the tangible outcome of the United Nations\npeacekeeping activities and striking change in the\nmood of the people, who now have hope for the future\nof their children and their country.\nWe are convinced that the democratic processes\nin Tajikistan will gain momentum. We have all the\nprerequisites for this. The restoration of peace in\nTajikistan in 1997 laid a solid foundation for a secular\ndemocratic State. The constitution was adopted by a\nnational referendum. State bodies of authority have\nbeen performing efficiently at all levels, reflecting the\nentire spectrum of the extensive political life of the\ncountry.\nThis does not imply that nothing threatens our\nyoung democracy, or that it is invulnerable. As a\nPresident who knows the needs and problems of the\npeople who have entrusted me with such a high office,\nI will be sincere and share some of my thoughts. These\nconcern both domestic and international affairs,\nincluding relations with the United Nations.\nFirst of all, we have no right to discredit the idea\nof democracy itself, in which Tajik society continues to\nplace its hopes for a better life. However, experience\nhas shown that there are no simple recipes for\nconverting the political process into economic\ndevelopment. Moreover, Tajikistan\u2019s experience\ncompellingly demonstrates the need for comprehensive\npost-conflict rehabilitation. Enhancing the practical\nbenefits of such efforts must be a priority for the\nUnited Nations system and the international\ncommunity. Conflict zones must be transformed into\nareas of stability, and serve as examples to help to\nprevent new tragedies.\nDonors must make pledges that are responsible,\nand do not merely raise hopes. The central coordinating\nrole in this respect undeniably falls to the United\nNations. We are deeply grateful to the numerous\nfriends of Tajikistan, including international financial\ninstitutions, for their support. We attach special\nimportance to our cooperation with the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme and other United Nations\nagencies. We believe that the United Nations Tajikistan\nOffice of Peace-building is doing useful work to enable\nthe international community to better grasp the positive\nchanges in our country and its interests and needs.\nNow that Tajikistan has reached a new stage of\ndevelopment, we especially appreciate the assistance to\nachieve our priority goals. Today, as never before,\nTajikistan needs assistance and practical support for\neffectively tapping our rich human and natural\nresources. We are resolved to making our economy up\nto date and competitive, inter alia, in order to overcome\npoverty once and for all.\nI must note with regret that despite the many\ngains in international affairs these past years, the\ninternational community has still not managed to truly\nresolve the problem of poverty. Though the item has\nbeen discussed at many conferences and forums, no\nspecific actions towards eliminating poverty have\nresulted. The growing gap between the rich and poor\ncountries is becoming a global challenge and threatens\n3\n\nto emerge as the main obstacle to the harmonious\ndevelopment of both individual countries and the\ncommunity of nations as a whole.\nOf course, we must bear the primary burden of\naddressing social and economic problems. However,\ndeveloping countries are justified in their expectations\nfor alleviation of the external difficulties encountered\nin integrating into the world economy, which, in our\ncase, is connected to access to investment, markets and\nhigh technologies. Equally pressing for us are the\nproblems of landlocked countries that have long been\ndiscussed at international conferences, particularly\nclosed borders and the many barriers to the free\nexchange of goods, services, capital and labour.\nI would like to draw attention to another such\nissue: the problem of freshwater. We are glad that\nTajikistan\u2019s proposal to proclaim 2003 the International\nYear of Freshwater was enthusiastically supported by\nthe international community. Experience has shown\nthat it was a very timely decision that met the\nexpectations of us all. The shortage of freshwater is\none of the most urgent concerns of the new\nmillennium. Every year the demand for water increases\nbecause of the need to produce sufficient food \u2014 and I\ncan provide statistics in support of that assertion. Some\n1.2 billion people have no access to freshwater. More\nthan 5 million people die every year from water-related\ndiseases. According to estimates of the United Nations\nFood and Agriculture Organization, meeting the food\nneeds of the growing global population will require a\n60 per cent increase in food production over the next\n30 years. By 2030, one out of every five developing\ncountries will be experiencing enormous difficulties\nbecause of current and future water shortages.\nA significant investment must be made in\nupdating technology and improving water resource\nmanagement so as to support economic growth and\nlessen the burden of poverty.\nGuided by the Water Appeal, which was adopted\non 1 September 2003 by the participants of the\nInternational Freshwater Forum in Dushanbe, I propose\nthat the period 2005-2015 be proclaimed the\nInternational Decade of Freshwater.\nThe adoption by the General Assembly of a\nresolution on this important matter would mean the\nlogical extension of the idea of the International Year\nof Freshwater. It would also be in keeping with the\nprovisions of the Millennium Declaration, which set\nthe goal of halving, by 2015, the number of people who\nlack access to freshwater and sanitation.\nThe International Decade of Freshwater would\nallow the international community to continue its focus\non the issue of the shortage of water. Water, the\ncommon heritage of humankind, is vital for the\npreservation of life on Earth and essential for ensuring\nsustainable development.\nIt is well known that terrorism poses a threat to\ndemocracy. Tajikistan has had first-hand experience of\nthis problem, as for 10 years we have been a kind of\nbuffer zone against the expansion of terror in Central\nAsia and other countries. Precisely for that reason,\nTajikistan has taken an active part in all efforts to root\nout that evil.\nWe are equally resolute in our condemnation of\nand desire to counteract all forms of terrorism. In this\nstruggle, which we can win only through united efforts,\nthere can be no selectivity or double standards. It is\nclear, however, that terrorism cannot be curbed solely\nby military methods. It would be equally erroneous to\nbelieve that the phenomenon is rooted in a single\nreligion or culture. The rejection of democracy is not\nthe only source of terrorism; terrorism also takes\nadvantage of injustice and suffering, of the arrogance\nof some and the sense of humiliation felt by others.\nTerrorism shows up in places where one\n\u201cabsolute truth\u201d is confronted by another. Although\nterrorism has nothing to do with the conflict of\ncivilizations, the extension of the dialogue among\ncivilizations that was begun by the General Assembly\nin 1998 can contribute to better mutual\nunderstanding \u2014 the lack of which is quite evident.\nDialogue is always more constructive than war.\nDialogue conducted in all areas will liberate\ninternational relations from fear and mistrust and will\nmake international cooperation constructive and\ncreative.\nOur consolidated efforts have dealt a severe blow\nto terrorism as an organized phenomenon, but such\nefforts have not yet defeated it. One of the lessons\nlearned in the course of this struggle \u2014 a struggle in\nwhich Tajikistan is an active participant \u2014 is that\ninternational terrorism has no ideology, nation or\nhomeland. Furthermore, terrorism cannot exist without\nfinancial and logistical support. In this context, we\nshould note that democracy is threatened by another\n4\n\nphenomenon that is no less frightening \u2014 that of drug\naggression.\nThe illicit trade in drugs has become one of the\nmajor sources of financing for international terrorism.\nThe urgency and magnitude of the problems related to\nthe illicit drug trafficking provide clear proof that this\nis a global menace that endangers international stability\nand security as a whole.\nTajikistan has an extensive border with\nAfghanistan, and finds itself in a position between the\nworld\u2019s major producer of opium and heroin and the\ndrug-consuming countries, to which international\norganized crime is smuggling the \u201cwhite death\u201d.\nAs President of Tajikistan, I consider the need to\ncurb drug trafficking through my country to be one of\nour nation\u2019s top priorities. During his visit to Tajikistan\nlast year, the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, had\nthe opportunity to observe the great professional skill\nand dedication of the staff of the Agency for Drug\nControl that has been established there with the support\nof the international community.\nAccording to United Nations data, Tajikistan is\nranked fourth in the world and first in the\nCommonwealth of Independent States in terms of the\nquantity of drugs withdrawn from trade. As a result of\nour efforts in the past four years, more than $1 billion\nworth of opiates has been confiscated from drug\ndealers.\nThe struggle against such narcotic aggression,\nwhich generates multibillion dollar profits in countries\nlocated far from Tajikistan, will be successful only\nthrough the consolidation of collective efforts.\nGiven the increased drug threat, and in order to\nexpand multilateral cooperation in combating it,\nTajikistan proposes the establishment of a global\npartnership to counteract the drug threat. Such a\nunique, broad anti-drug coalition could become a\nreliable barrier to the expansion of this scourge.\nThe Secretary-General could become coordinator\nof such a partnership, and the United Nations Office\nfor Drug Control and Crime Prevention could become\nits central executive body. Such a global partnership\nwould coordinate all efforts in the field at all levels,\nincluding the regional level.\nI would like to take this opportunity to draw the\nattention of Members to another issue that is cause for\nconcern. Certain groups of people have been using the\nglobal communications media recently in an attempt to\nequate such grave threats to humankind as terrorism\nand extremism with the holy religion of Islam. Such an\ninterpretation represents a distortion of the peaceful\nessence of Islam and presents the religion to the\ninternational community as a source of evil and\nviolence, thus giving rise to hostility towards the entire\nMuslim world and encouraging neo-fascist and other\ndiscriminatory attitudes.\nWe would like once again to stress that the acts of\nterror that are being carried out in a number of\ncountries are crimes, committed by cruel, merciless\npeople who are driven by the lust for power and\npersonal gain - people who have nothing to do with the\nholy religion of the world\u2019s Muslims.\nHumanity must understand that Islam is not a\nreligion of violence, but like the world\u2019s other\nreligions, calls upon people to show mercy and\ncompassion and appeals for peace and harmony.\nTajikistan supports increased regional\ncooperation in all areas. Our goal is to create a zone of\npeace, stability, harmony and prosperity in Central\nAsia.\nTurning Central Asia into a zone free of weapons\nof mass destruction is a matter of principle for\nTajikistan, and that is why my country endorsed the\nidea of establishing a nuclear weapon-free zone in the\nregion.\nMeanwhile, I would like to join the common\nconcern about increased difficulties related to the non-\nproliferation of these types of weapon in the world,\nincluding South Asia. I am convinced that the time has\ncome not to weaken, but rather to intensify, collective\nefforts and expand disarmament mechanisms.\nAnother issue has become a challenge of the\ntwenty-first century \u2014 the increasing number of\nterritories aspiring to the status of State but not\nrecognized as such by the international community.\nThose territories become criminalized from within,\nestablish external ties that are not quite legal and\nbecome catalysts for regional conflicts.\nFor that reason, it is in the interest of the\ninternational community to start, in the short term, to\ndevelop universal criteria for international recognition\nof States. By doing so, it would be possible to prevent\nthe provocation of separatist sentiments in certain\n5\n\nregions that are fraught with negative consequences for\nthe destinies of many peoples and States.\nTajikistan notes with satisfaction the considerable\nprogress in the revival of Afghanistan. We are\nenthusiastic about how the international community is\nresolute in its support for processes of national accord\nand peace-building in our neighbouring country.\nTajikistan is deeply aware of the need to render\ninternational support to Afghanistan, and it will\nincrease its assistance to the efforts undertaken by the\nAfghanistan Government headed by Mr. Hamid Karzai.\nMeanwhile, we are persistent in calling on the\ninternational community not to lessen its attention to\nthe needs of that country, to renew its vigorous\ncommitment to rendering support for positive change,\nto give fresh impetus to the peace process, making it\nirreversible, and to dramatically increase efforts to\nuproot drug production in Afghanistan.\nGiven the global danger of the drug problem, I\nonce again call on the international community and\nrelevant international organizations to develop a\nunified programme of action aimed at eradicating the\nproduction, manufacture and dissemination of drugs in\nthat country.\nThe situation in Iraq continues to be a cause for\npain and concern. Conditions there are still far from\nnormal. It is not only a matter of the post-military\nenvironment, the lost lives of military personnel, and,\neven more sadly, of peaceful citizens. It is a matter of\nthe lack of acceptable living conditions for many Iraqi\npeople.\nThough positive changes are obvious, restoring\nIraq\u2019s sovereignty is the greatest priority. We share the\nmajority opinion regarding the fact that the Iraqi people\nthemselves should determine their future and that the\ninternational community, embodied by the United\nNations, should be called on to render assistance in the\nimplementation of that goal.\nEvery people follows its own road to democracy.\nHowever, only together can we deal with the\nchallenges and the threats we face on this path.\nThe United Nations remains the ultimate, indeed\nunique, mechanism for taking collective action to\naddress global issues. The noble goals for human\ndevelopment set out in the Millennium Declaration,\nwhich Tajikistan joined in signing, is convincing proof\nof that. The United Nations has united almost all\ncountries of the world. All of us, the United Nations\nfounding Member States and recently admitted\nMember States, pledged to observe its Charter. And\nthat is the way it should be.\nOur Organization is currently experiencing\nanother test \u2014 the search for efficient answers in new\ncircumstances with new requirements for world\ndevelopment. The point is that the Organization and its\nmajor bodies should keep up with the processes\noccurring in a constantly changing world. Though\nreform of the United Nations is under way, the time has\ncome to channel the practical activities of all its bodies\ninto real priorities.\nIn the field of international peace and security,\nthe focus should be on the prevention of military\nconflicts, both intergovernmental and internal.\nThe General Assembly, the Economic and Social\nCouncil and all other components of the United\nNations system are faced with the need to find\nconvincing answers to the globalization process, in\norder to bridge the gap between the industrialized and\nthe developing countries.\nWe expect improved professional skills from\nSecretariat staff members and increased practical\noutcome of their work and of the work of all United\nNations agencies, for the benefit of all Member States.\nThe feeling that the United Nations is going\nthrough a crisis that materialized at some point is\nalready fading. It is being substituted by an awareness\nof the need to strengthen the Organization, as well as\nfor collective interaction within its framework. The\npreservation and the development of the Organization\nis our common goal, as the international community\nhas no another similar universal mechanism.\nThe United Nations is the heritage of all\nhumanity. Tajikistan will be resolute in doing\neverything possible for the successful implementation\nof the noble mission of the United Nations for the\nbenefit of all mankind.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me\nprofound pleasure to welcome and congratulate\nMr. Julian Hunte in regard to the lofty position that he\nnow holds. It was not long ago that he was fighting\nalongside the ambassadors of the Latin American and\nCaribbean Group. He represents the smallest country\nthat has ever ascended to the presidency, and, for his\nCaribbean colleagues, there will be additional rejoicing\nwhen his photograph appears on the Wall of Presidents.\nIt is my hope that our younger diplomats will\nendeavour to emulate him and continue to demonstrate\nthe mettle of small island developing States. But let me\nalso pay tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, for\nthe able and skilful manner in which he conducted our\ndeliberations during the fifty-seventh session. The\nSecretary-General and his staff must also receive\nacclaim for their diligence and steadfast work. We\nmourn and grieve for the United Nations staff members\nkilled and wounded in Baghdad, and, indeed, for all\nmembers of the staff who have made the ultimate\nsacrifice in upholding the ideals of the United Nations.\nWe have often repeated statistics on human living\nconditions, but it seems to be just a recitation.\nNonetheless, in the hope that this year figures may\nmove those in control to make a meaningful attempt at\n25\n\nremedies, let me join the list of other colleagues who\nhave recalled the fact that almost half of the world\u2019s\npopulation subsists on less than $2 a day, and a fifth\nlives on less than $1 a day. The point to be stressed is\nthat global inequality has increased. The digital divide\nis widening, the number of refugees and displaced\npersons has grown, and the AIDS crisis is devastating\nnumerous societies.\nWhat tends to be ignored is what developing\ncountries have been doing for themselves. In the\nCaribbean, the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)\ncountries have come to each other\u2019s assistance in times\nof crisis, whether there be natural devastation by way\nof earthquakes, volcanic eruption, drought or floods.\nWe have used our military forces positively, to rescue,\nto stabilize and to rehabilitate, when suffering the\nvicissitudes of nature. Strapped as we are in regard to\nfinances, we have assisted one another in regard to the\nseverest of economic constraints. If an unbiased\nevaluation is made, it will be clear that average gains in\nhuman development in low- and middle-income\ncountries have been substantial and higher than gains\nin income. Life expectancy has increased by 59 per\ncent, and illiteracy has been reduced from 39 per cent\nin 1970 to 25 per cent at the turn of the century.\nNevertheless, current development trends are not\nsustainable and are placing extreme pressure on the\nenvironment and on the impoverished, who bear the\noverwhelming brunt of environmental degradation. Our\ncoastal systems are threatened, dominant countries are\nfishing indiscriminately within our exclusive economic\nzones, and our coral reefs have not only been damaged\nbut are disappearing. Yet aid has declined as a share of\ngross national product, and World Bank research\nindicates that, without a doubling of development\nassistance, the endorsed Millennium Goals are unlikely\nto be achieved.\nDevelopment experts appear to have a single\nfocus. We fully accept the necessity for market\nreforms, but they are insufficient in themselves. There\nis a need for broad social reforms. Equitable income\ndistribution and secondary school enrolment have been\nfound to be insensitive to growth, while air quality has\nbeen negatively correlated to growth. The global\ninstitutions continue to listen to their identified experts\nand to disregard local experience, whether from the\naged and wise or from the young and brilliant.\nSustained development requires a significant\npercentage of domestic or local ownership.\nOur religious literature states that continuing a\nlifestyle demands the depositing or planting of seeds,\nfrom which, in a relatively short period of time, comes\nnew life and the continuance of organic existence. With\nthat in mind, it is imperative that development\nstrategies clearly take into consideration those who will\nsucceed us, and Antigua and Barbuda, which devotes\nmuch attention and planning to the advancement of its\nyouth, is advocating continued global focus on this\nissue in order to ensure a more harmonious\ninternational atmosphere than the one in which we\ncarry out our activities.\nWith that in mind, Caribbean heads of State and\nGovernment have met with representatives of the\nWorld Bank and are jointly in the process of, first,\nidentifying the risk and protective factors and\ndeterminants of youth behaviours and development;\nsecondly, demonstrating that the negative behaviours of\nyoung people are costly not only to themselves but also\nto society as a whole; and, thirdly, identifying key\nintervention points for youth development,\nunderscoring identified risk and protective factors.\nPresently, as a result of this joint thrust, we are\ntargeting sexual and physical abuse, HIV/AIDS as\nlinked to misguided values about sexuality, the\nincidence of rage, youth unemployment, and social\nmisconceptions as to the use of alcohol and marijuana.\nMoving forward requires modernizing the educational\nsystem and maximizing the protective effect of schools,\nupgrading public health-care systems, making families\na top policy issue, and strengthening community and\nneighbourhood support to adolescents.\nAntigua and Barbuda believes that, whereas aid is\nsorely needed, its effectiveness will be limited unless a\nlevel playing field is provided in regard to trade and\ninvestment in developing societies. There cannot be\nmeaningful progress by talking about the relative\nsignificance and importance of free trade. We listen\nand see the dominant countries employ various and\ndiverse forms of agricultural protectionism, while\ntaking away from former colonies of exploitation vital\npreferences needed to keep their products on the\nmarket. Why should globalization be oppressive to the\npusillanimous? We have been listening to the\nmodifications of the philosophies of Cobden and\nBright, but are feeling the yoke of global practices,\nknowing that never in modern history has there ever\nbeen free trade.\n26\n\nThe fears of developing countries in regard to the\npractices and realities of globalization, as opposed to\nits often-vaunted philosophy, were manifested at\nCanc\u00fan in September of this year. Canc\u00fan, we have\nbeen made to understand, means snake pit in the local\nMayan language, and our hope is that there will be\nsome meaningful effort to overcome the drawbacks.\nDeveloping countries will be hindered from developing\nthemselves if lip service alone continues to be paid to\npoverty. The first step in the elimination of poverty is\nto adequately recognize the multifunctional role of\nagriculture. This multifunctional role incorporates food\nsafety, animal welfare and the preservation of land.\nUnfortunately, Canc\u00fan proved once again that the\ndominant countries would continue to exempt\nthemselves from the rules governing free trade and to\ndomestically provide substantive subsidies to their\nfarmers, while denying the former colonies of\nexploitation the right to preferences.\nThe year 2004 will mark the tenth anniversary of\nthe first United Nations Global Conference on the\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates, which was held in Barbados in 1994. In looking\nback at the almost 10 years since that Conference, we\nhold these following truths to be self evident: In the\nBarbados Programme\u2019s attention on the unique\ncircumstances of small island developing States, the\ncorresponding actions to address these circumstances\nby the international community, has been lacking. This\nis the opportunity presented by the international\nmeeting, to review the implementation of the\nProgramme of Action that will be held in Mauritius in\nAugust 2004. It presents us with a second chance to\nidentify a set of concrete actions which will be needed\nto further the implementation of the Barbados\nProgramme of Action and thereby regain the\nmomentum lost by small island developing States in\ntheir quest for sustainable development. So far we have\nnot been satisfied that problems relating to the trans-\nshipment of nuclear waste through our waters, bilging\nand fishing indiscriminately in our Exclusive Economic\nZones have been given any meaningful consideration.\nMy Government welcomes the entry into force of\nthe Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention\non Biological Diversity, having recently deposited our\ninstruments of ratification for both the Protocol and the\nStockholm Convention on Persistent Organic\nPollutants. As a Party to the Kyoto Protocol to the\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange, we wish to lend our support to the call made\nby the Foreign Minister of Japan for parties to the\nClimate Change Convention to maintain the\ninternational momentum for climate change\nnegotiations, for the early entry into force of the Kyoto\nProtocol and for the formulation of common rules that\nwill facilitate participation by all countries.\nThe Millennium Development Goals constitute an\nambitious agenda for reducing poverty and improving\nlives. The challenge to implement them is enormous. A\ncase in point is the target of halving by 2015 the\nproportion of people without access to safe drinking\nwater and proper sanitation. To meet this target, the\nworld will need to connect approximately 200,000\npeople to clean water and 400,000 people to improved\nsanitation each day.\nThat will require three things: first, innovative\nfinancing mechanisms to assure the necessary doubling\nin financial flows to developing countries for water and\nsanitation, from current spending of $10 billion each\nyear, to about $20 billion a year; secondly, greatly\nimproved governance of scarce water resources, built\naround holistic, integrated water resources management\nstrategies that encompass priorities from drinking to\nagriculture and industrial development; and thirdly, a\nclear focus on building capacity where it is needed\nmost: working directly with local communities,\nespecially women, to help craft and implement their\nown solutions. And this is just for water.\nWe see, as the dominant Powers repeat their call\nfor universal democracy, that the former colonies of\nexploitation must remind them that democracy is most\ndifficult to achieve among those witnessing the tears\nand the conditions of hungry children. Democracy\nstruggles to maintain itself among those who are\nracked with illnesses and weak from the lack of\nadequate nutrition. Democracy is practically a utopian\nideal, in which there are defined class divisions and\ninsurmountable social barriers. For democracy to thrive\nand prosper, all sectors of the society have to\nparticipate fully with regard to economic growth and\nan adequate distribution of income. It is, therefore,\nincumbent that society work toward integral, equitable\nand sustainable social and economic development. In\nAntigua and Barbuda, in the midst of our trials and\ntribulations, we have maintained democracy, and it is a\nhallmark of our existence.\n27\n\nThe products of science, technology and\ninnovation have to be harnessed and designed to add\nvalue to the real components of development. Wealth\nmust be generated in order to raise the dignity and the\nesteem of mankind, and to garner respect for the\ninternationally recognized fundamental rights and\nprinciples of labour. Without such, socio-economic\ndevelopment and, consequently, the full enjoyment of\ndemocracy will be held in abeyance.\nMy country is at a loss to fully comprehend why\nsome of the major countries of this world oppose the\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC). It is vital to our\nsecurity and development. The Court represents a\nrevolution in legal and moral attitudes toward some of\nthe worst crimes on Earth. Whereas many developing\nStates have suffered under the yoke of globalization,\nthe ICC represents a plus for the globalization process,\nits principles of justice and the rule of law in\ninternational affairs. The Rome Statute has sufficient\nchecks and balances to allay all fears, and we remain\nconvinced that the ICC will be a legitimate judicial\ninstitution to adequately judge individuals for war\ncrimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. We\nreiterate that this can be done while guaranteeing States\ntheir rights, as they are protected from any interference\nby the Court if they pursue the given crimes at the\nnational level, and that the prosecutor\u2019s autonomous\npower is accompanied by guarantees against using the\nCourt for specious or politically motivated endeavours.\nThe Non-Self-Governing Territories of the\nCaribbean look to Caribbean members of the Special\nCommittee on Decolonization, more commonly known\nas the Special Committee of 24, to give guidance in\nregard to their constitutional evolution. This year there\nwas a breakthrough in Anguilla, as the United\nKingdom agreed to have the regional seminar held in\none of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, and for the\nfirst time the United Nations Secretariat agreed to write\ndirectly to the local representatives, rather than through\nthe representatives of the administering Powers. But\nmore importantly, the United Kingdom sent a senior\nofficial from the Commonwealth and Overseas Office,\nwho was to gain the respect of the seminar participants.\nThe Non-Self-Governing Territories greeted this\ndevelopment, and all sent delegations that were vocal\nand explained that their options had never been\nexplained to them. They were eager to remain in touch\nwith the United Nations Secretariat, and sought to take\nadvantage of whatever experiences, educational and\notherwise, the United Nations could provide. In an\natmosphere of cordiality, the administrating Power and\nthe non-self-governing territories expressed ways and\nmeans of promoting development and advancement for\nthe territories. Quite significantly the non-self-\ngoverning territories hailed the new policy of the\nUnited Kingdom for consultation with the elected\nofficials of its territories on the appointment of\ngovernors.\nMy country would not like to give the impression\nthat we are only concerned with development, as this\nwould be far from the truth. We are cognizant of other\nglobal issues, particularly with reference to peace and\nsecurity. The images that are constantly before us with\nreference to Iraq and the Middle East leave us\nquestioning the brotherhood of mankind. The United\nNations has to be unified with reference to the\nrehabilitation of Iraq, and the transition of its\nadministrative structures into the hands of its nationals.\nWe subsequently give our support for the peace\nprocess in the Middle East, based on the respective\nresolutions of both the General Assembly and the\nSecurity Council. Likewise, we give wholehearted\nsupport to the preservation of the role of the United\nNations and other organizations in working toward the\nstabilization and security of Afghanistan.\nIn the same vein, we support and encourage the\nefforts made to resolve the conflicts in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, and the stabilization of peace in\nparts of West Africa and the Balkans.\nWe continue to press for the revitalization of the\ndisarmament process, non-proliferation of nuclear\nweapons and general arms control.\nThese are indeed perilous times, and, when an\nevent occurs in a distant part of the globe that can\ndrastically affect us domestically, total disregard of the\nneed for tolerance will not only produce resentment but\nalso the dangerous practice of intolerance. For such\ntimes it is far better to remember the words of Thomas\nPaine, who stated that \u201cThe world is my country, all\nmankind are my brethren, and to do good is my\nreligion.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffA few days\nago, the United Nations was again attacked in Baghdad\n  just one month after the United Nations\nHeadquarters was targeted in a devastating terrorist\nattack. My heartfelt sympathies   not only as the\nForeign Minister of Austria, but also as a former staff\nmember working here at the Headquarters of the\nUnited Nations   go to the victims, their loved ones\nand all colleagues in the United Nations family. Sergio\nVieira de Mello and his colleagues died as heroes. As a\nhost country to the United Nations, Austria firmly\nsupports the Secretary-General's call to provide the\nutmost security for United Nations personnel on\nmissions everywhere in the world. Those United\nNations staff members had dedicated their lives to\nhelping the most vulnerable. Today, we are called upon\nto live up to their cause.\nThis has also been a year of lethal attacks on\npoliticians who courageously stood for a human face\nfor politics. We remember, with sadness, the outstanding\nleadership qualities and invaluable contributions of Zoran\nDjindjic and Anna Lindh. We are equally saddened to\nlearn that Ms. Aquila al-Hashimi, member of the Iraqi\nGoverning Council, has succumbed to the wounds she\nsuffered in the recent terrorist attack.\nWhat is at stake today is the way in which the\nUnited Nations can best shoulder its responsibility for\nglobal security and peace and how we as Member\nStates can support the United Nations in this task.\nAustria, as one of the host countries of the United\nNations, feels a sense of responsibility for the future\nfunctioning of the Organization.\nThe intense public scrutiny of the Security\nCouncil's actions over the past 12 months has opened a\nwindow of opportunity for re-launching our efforts to\nfind unity of purpose based on a common security\nagenda between all nations. In this context, I greatly\nwelcome the report of the Secretary-General on the\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration, which\nmakes one thing crystal clear: we face nothing less\nthan the need for a far-reaching overhaul of the United\nNations system in order to enhance efficiency and\nlegitimacy.\nWe must respond to this challenge and\nenergetically revive the reform debate. The urgency we\nare faced with today should render a new attempt more\nsuccessful.\nFirst of all, a priority issue should be the reform\nof the procedures of the United Nations system. The\ncomposition of the Security Council is at odds with the\ngeopolitical reality of the twenty-first century. It does\nnot reflect the growing number of United Nations\nMembers or the necessary regional balance. Decision-\nmaking is therefore perceived by many as lacking\nlegitimacy. In my view, this discussion is not only\nabout who should be represented in the Security\nCouncil, but   and this is at least as important  \nabout ensuring that the decision-making is in the\ninterests of world peace and global security. In this\ncontext the regional groups have to accept their\nresponsibility by coming forward with solutions.\nAs a member of the European Union, which is\nabout to give itself a constitution for the twenty-first\ncentury, it is important to note that we are moving\ngradually towards a genuine common foreign and\nsecurity policy. To this end, a security doctrine is being\nelaborated by High Representative and Secretary\nGeneral Solana for the European Council. Speaking\nwith one voice also means more common positions in\nSecurity Council matters. This logic might one day\neven lead to the European Union having a seat on the\nSecurity Council.\nAustria sees its national interest best served by\nthe multilateral approach of a strong United Nations\nsystem, with the Security Council living up to its\nresponsibility for world peace and with the primacy of\ninternational law and the universality of human rights\nmaintained by all.\nInternational terrorism is a direct and lethal threat\nto global and collective security. The terror attacks of\n11 September 2001, and those against the United\nNations Headquarters in Baghdad, have one thing in\ncommon: they were targeted against civilization as a\nwhole. United Nations leadership is needed more than\never to prevent and combat terrorism globally. In the\nUnited Nations system-wide division of labour, the\nVienna-based Terrorism Prevention Branch of the\nOffice on Drugs and Crime contributes to counter-\nterrorism efforts and offers valuable technical\nassistance to States with regard to signing, ratifying\nand implementing international conventions and\nprotocols related to terrorism.\n36\n \nAnother hard threat to international security is the\nproliferation of arms, in particular the spread of\nweapons of mass destruction. What is needed is\nobvious: the strengthening and universalization of\nexisting disarmament, non-proliferation and export\ncontrol regimes. As a practical contribution to this\ncause, Austria has agreed to serve as an immediate\ncentral contact for the 109 subscriber States of the\nHague Code of Conduct Against Ballistic Missile\nProliferation.\nFurthermore, the Conference on Facilitating the\nEntry into Force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\nBan Treaty, which I had the honour to open on 3\nSeptember, appealed, in its Final Declaration, to all\nStates to sign and ratify that Treaty, in particular to\nthose 12 countries whose ratification is required for the\nTreaty's entry into force. Let me repeat and support\nthat appeal.\nIn the field of non-proliferation, the work of the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) under the\nleadership of Director General Mohamed ElBaradei is\nessential. Last week's General Conference of IAEA\nunanimously endorsed the necessity of strengthening\nthe international nuclear safeguards system. Recent\nissues of compliance concerning Iran and the\nDemocratic People's Republic of Korea have again\nshown the central role of IAEA.\nOne of the most important immediate tasks is the\nstabilization and reconstruction of Iraq. We are\nconvinced that success in the aim of restoring the\nsovereignty of Iraq as quickly as possible will hardly\nbe feasible without the United Nations playing its part\non the basis of a sound, viable and coherent policy.\nIn line with the human security approach, Austria\nwas among the first to offer humanitarian aid. In\nAustrian hospitals we provided urgent medical\nassistance for children in critical condition.\nFurthermore, Austria participates in the Adopt a\nHospital' programme and is about to equip two\nhospitals in Nazariyah. Together with Slovenia and\nJordan, we are preparing the establishment, south of\nBaghdad, of a centre for war-traumatized children.\nThese are efforts aimed at providing relief for the\nweakest and most vulnerable members of Iraqi society.\nIn spite of renewed efforts by the international\ncommunity to revive the Middle East peace process,\nthe conflict between Israel and the Palestinians has\nagain tragically deteriorated. But current setbacks must\nnot stall the implementation of the road map. Austria\ncontinues to strongly support the role and the\nresponsibility of the Quartet. The concept of two States\nremains the only viable solution. The promise of land for\npeace must be reactivated to create a basis of trust and\nrespect on which to build. Terrorism destroys such hope.\nI turn now to what the Secretary-General called\nsoft threats. Here, his report coincides with the goals of\nmy recently concluded presidency of the Human\nSecurity Network to strengthen the universal system by\nforging interregional consensus on issues pertaining to\nhuman security. That places the individual human\nbeing and his or her protection at the centre of our\npolicies. As a concrete result of my presidency, the\nministers of the Network adopted a manual on human\nrights education. That unique training tool, based on\nthe universality of human rights, is designed for global\nuse and adaptable to target groups. The Network also\nadopted a strategy for supporting children affected by\narmed conflict, along with a training curriculum for\nchild rights experts and a compendium of the relevant\ninternational child protection standards   an effort in\nwhich we cooperated closely with the Special\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General, Olara Otunnu.\nThe Millennium Development Goals have\nbecome fundamental benchmarks in our efforts to\nachieve more inclusive and equitable globalization, and\nwe   both developing and developed countries  \nneed to strive for their implementation at the global,\nregional and national levels. In that context, as part of\nthe partnership effort agreed to in Monterrey, I am\nhappy to announce that Austrian official development\nassistance will be increased by 35 per cent in 2004.\nThe Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment recognized the importance of energy for\nthe attainment of the Millennium Development Goals.\nAustria welcomes the additional impetus created by the\nRenewables 2004 Conference. I am also glad that the\nRenewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership\nwill establish its secretariat in Vienna. Meanwhile,\nAustria will use the synergies created by these\nactivities to continue its endeavours to build up the\ncapacity of the Global Forum on Sustainable Energy,\nwhich I launched in 1999.\nAt this point, let me express Austria's\ndisappointment that the Ministerial Meeting in Cancun\ncould not sustain the momentum towards achieving\nacceptable solutions for fair trade. Such a setback must\n37\n \nnot repeat itself, not least because trade is an engine for\ndevelopment. I support the notion that we also need to\nbegin a reform of the decision-making process within\nthe World Trade Organization. We must avoid a\ntendency towards ending multilateralism and towards\nrelying exclusively on bilateralism or regionalism in\ntrade.\nThis year, we commemorate the tenth anniversary\nof the 1993 Vienna World Conference on Human\nRights, which confirmed the universality, indivisibility\nand interrelatedness of human rights as well as the\nimportant nexus among human rights, democracy and\ndevelopment. Human rights disasters that we have\nwitnessed since   such as those in Rwanda and\nSrebrenica   must not be allowed to recur. One\nessential step in that regard is the Optional Protocol to\nthe Convention against Torture and Other Cruel,\nInhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment,\nwhich I signed this morning.\nHuman rights must protect in particular the weak,\nwomen and children. As a woman and as Foreign\nMinister of my country, I have always spoken out in\nfavour of the rights of women and against the\nfrequently terrible infringements of those rights, such\nas genital mutilation, the stoning of women and the\nenslaving and trading of women and girls on the sex\nmarkets. Those horrendous practices must stop. And\nthere is reason for hope: today is a good day for\nwomen's rights. News has reached us that Ms. Armina\nLawal was acquitted by the Nigerian court. I am very\nhappy about that outcome. Let us remind ourselves that\nthe all-important fight against terrorism must not entail\na lessening of hard-fought-for human rights standards.\nOver the years and under the guidance of the\nSecretary-General, Austria has placed great importance\non a comprehensive dialogue of cultures and\ncivilizations. This November, I will host a second\nmedia seminar on the topic of Cultural diversity: the\nquest for common moral ground and the public role of\nthe media', exploring how the free media can\ncontribute to cultural understanding and respect. A\nseminal event in the context of that dialogue was the\nfirst-ever conference of European Islamic leaders in\nAustria, held in June of this year, which adopted a\nstrongly worded declaration in support of tolerance.\nHow can we contribute to stability in the regions\nof the world? Europe has its own experience with\ncreating a zone of stability and welfare. The signing of\nthe European Union (EU) accession treaty with 10 new\nprospective members in April of this year is an\nimportant contribution to security on our continent.\nThe strategy of EU is also geared towards exporting\nthat peace dividend to new neighbours of the enlarged\nEU further to the east and to the south-east and in the\nMediterranean region. Let me highlight one\nencouraging event from that region, which I was able\nto witness from a close vantage point when I visited\nBelgrade less than two weeks ago. I am talking about\nthe important gesture of President Marovi\u0107 of Serbia\nand Montenegro and of President Mesi\u0107 of Croatia,\napologizing on behalf of those of their countries'\ncitizens, who had committed acts of violence against\none another in recent history.\nThe vision of global solidarity, collective security\nand a global culture of human rights are rooted in the\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter\nand of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I\nam grateful to the Secretary-General for his courage\nand leadership to engage us in an honest, future-\noriented debate. The time to act is now. I can again\nassure the Secretary-General that Austria supports him\nin that important endeavour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me at\nthe outset to express my pleasure at seeing in the\npresidency of the General Assembly a representative of\nthe Group of Latin American and Caribbean States. I\nwould ask you, Sir, to extend my greetings to\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, along with our full\nrecognition of his leadership, which has given this\ninstitution of ours a new impetus. I would also ask you\nto convey to him and to the entire staff of the United\nNations our condolences over the death of Mr. Sergio\nVieira de Mello.\nWe live in a world of fragile and perilous\nbalances, the result of our collective inability to\nachieve genuine peace and shared well-being in the\ncontext of international legality. We are confronting\ntoday an economic globalization that is triggering\nimbalances to the detriment of developing countries,\nparticularly the poorest. We are also confronting a\nglobalization of violence, suffering the threats of\nterrorism as well as the war against it, and international\norganized crime that weakens public security and\njeopardizes world peace.\nWe share these problems along with the\nresponsibility to find a solution to them. No country,\nlarge or small, can overcome alone either the\nchallenges of the present or those that will have to be\nmet successfully in the future. The attitude that will be\nessential in the face of threats to international peace,\nsecurity and development is that of responsibility\nshared among all nations.\nMexico knows that we, the peoples of the United\nNations, can together ensure that hunger, intolerance,\nexclusion, crime and illegitimacy are banished once\nand for all. Together, we can guarantee every\nindividual the right to live in human dignity and the\nright of future generations to grow, develop and\ncontribute to the history of human civilization. In our\nMillennium Declaration, we have an irreplaceable\nguide on how to meet the challenges of the present and\nthe future.\nMexico has made significant progress in terms of\ndemocracy, freedoms, gender equity, respect for\nminority groups, health and education, and particularly\nin reducing poverty and improving income distribution,\nas reflected in the resolute and rapid advances we have\nmade towards the attainment of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals. We have come one third of the\nway towards achieving those goals in the past two\nyears alone and we shall have essentially attained them\nby 2010, well before the target date of 2015.\nThough Mexican men and women will not be\nsatisfied merely by achieving those goals, we know we\nare on the right track. Now is the time not for us to\nshrink from challenges, but rather to be hopeful about\nour joint labours and our work as a team. We feel the\nsame about the international situation as we do about\nthe national context.\nConvinced therefore of the validity, usefulness\nand relevance of our Organization, Mexico appeals\nfrom this supreme global forum for shared international\nresponsibility. This Assembly, the most representative\nbody of humankind, is the most appropriate forum in\nwhich to call for collective action. Here the major\ninternational problems have been discussed, and here\ndialogue has been made the cornerstone of the effort to\nfind solutions. Here, therefore, we must focus our\nefforts on achieving shared peace, security and\ndevelopment.\n21\n\nThis is the first general debate of our Assembly\nsince the Iraq war. Our Organization is at a critical and\ncrucial juncture. The attacks on the United Nations in\nBaghdad have harmed our Organization and hurt us all.\nAn attack on the United Nations is an attack on all its\nMembers. The events in Iraq sparked a debate that\nranks among the most far-reaching in the life of the\nUnited Nations. As a non-permanent member of the\nSecurity Council and, above all, assuming its\nresponsibility as a member of the world community,\nMexico has been faithful to the principle of seeking the\npacific settlement of disputes, in accordance with the\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter.\nWe have been actively and constructively\ninvolved in negotiating resolutions and are convinced\nthat they will lead to the swift restoration of full\nsovereignty and independence for the Iraqi people. One\nof the top priorities of our Organization is to give\nimpetus to the process of restoring sovereignty,\nresulting in the establishment of a representative\nGovernment for Iraqi men and women.\nThe debate over the issue of Iraq requires us to\nact upon our commitments and change the way we\nthink about when the use of force is legitimate, in\naccordance with the Charter. It is vitally important that\nwe review States\u2019 commitments to abide by\ninternational law and the existing machinery to ensure\ncompliance with Security Council resolutions. The\nagreements reached and reforms achieved will greatly\nand profoundly determine the future effectiveness of\nthe United Nations and proper functioning of the\ncollective decision-making processes that underpin the\nmultilateral approach.\nAbove and beyond Iraq, the world is closely\nfollowing many other major challenges. As we have\nnoted today, the unfinished job of peace-making in the\nMiddle East, Afghanistan, Africa and the Balkans\nimplies new threats and challenges to international\nsecurity. A particular source of concern is the increase\nin tensions in Asia, in light of the development of\nweapons of mass destruction.\nWe have always been a nation committed to\npeace, convinced that dialogue, negotiation and the law\nare effective conflict-resolution instruments. Today, we\nreaffirm that it is time to give special emphasis to\ndiplomatic action and to work together to meet\ncommon challenges. In view of the world\u2019s present\npotential for destruction, it is time for us to ensure that\ndiplomacy and negotiation get priority attention with\nregard to international disputes. Reaffirming the\nprinciples and values that govern our actions on the\ninternational scene, Mexico is appealing for peace and\nglobal cooperation so that, together, we can effectively\nfoster international peace, security and development.\nHistory teaches us that, unless great economic\nand social disparities, injustice, discrimination,\nintolerance and lack of international cooperation are\naddressed, we will continue to endure current threats\nsuch as terrorism. Mexico is unequivocally committed\nto combating terrorism. Combating it effectively\nrequires not only better and more intense international\ncooperation but also new approaches to international\nlegality. The fight against terrorism will not be\neffective without a new recognition of international law\nand a United Nations system that has sufficient\ncapacity to ensure compliance with it.\nWe must confront this and other challenges by\nadopting a holistic view of our responsibility for\nmaintaining and restoring peace in the world today,\nwhile tackling the structural causes of conflicts. To\nmeet those challenges will require sustained conflict-\nprevention capacity, the mobilization of political will\nand a strategically targeted commitment of resources.\nSuch a perspective can be contributed only by\nthis universal Organization, the only such body with\nthe legitimacy, experience, capacity to convene peoples\nand the moral force to concert our efforts for the sake\nof peace and universal well-being. The response to the\nglobal challenges facing us requires a robust political\neffort on the part of all nations \u2014 an effort that is\npossible solely from within these halls.\nAs a nation that has always done its utmost to\nattain the noble objectives of the United Nations and\nconvinced of the relevance of the principles and values\nthat gave rise to this Organization, Mexico renews its\nfirm commitment to the United Nations and its ideals.\nSecurity cannot be built based on barriers or\nignorance. True security and lasting peace among\nnations is based on mutual understanding and a\ndemonstrated belief in equal treatment for all\nnations \u2014 ideals that have developed over time within\nthis Organization.\nThe relevance of this Organization is undeniable.\nMexico reaffirms its confidence in multilateral\narrangements. We have associated ourselves with the\n22\n\nappeal by the Secretary-General to put forward\ninnovative ideas and approaches geared towards\nreforming the United Nations. We agree with the\nSecretary-General\u2019s view that the international system\nis in crisis and with his appeal for fundamental reform\nof the United Nations. Members can rest assured that\nMexico will make every diplomatic effort to reform\nand update our Organization, which the international\nsituation necessitates. Mexico considers that real\nreform must be based on five specific guidelines.\nThe first is to strengthen our collective security\nsystem to ensure rapid responses to crises and\ntransparent collective decision-making. The second is\nto guarantee support for economic and social\ndevelopment of States, particularly for the least-\ndeveloped. The third is to guarantee respect for the\nsovereignty and independence of States while assuring\nat the same time the legitimacy and legality of\ninternational efforts to combat impunity. The fourth is\nto promote and protect human rights. The fifth is to\nincrease the effectiveness of decision-making.\nWe must revitalize the commitment that States\nand nations make to observing universal norms.\nReforms must concentrate on the performance of our\nmultilateral system. The work of the Security Council\ndemonstrates this need. Without question, debate over\nits composition involves the need to make it more\nrepresentative and thus increase its legitimacy.\nAlthough the central issue is the functioning of the\nSecurity Council and respect for its resolutions, the\ndiscussions of the past decade have focused on\nexpanding the membership and selecting new\npermanent members.\nThere is little worth in considering a Council with\na larger membership if the resolutions that it issues are\nnot respected or if they lack a common interpretation\nof the scope of their provisions. We must ensure the\nright kind of representativeness, limit and regulate the\nright of veto and call for greater transparency and for\ncreating a more balanced relationship with the other\norgans of the United Nations system, particularly the\nGeneral Assembly.\nWe must ensure that the Council does not exceed\nits competencies or shirk its responsibilities. Let us\nthink democratically. Let us seek a balance between the\nmain organs of the United Nations. Let us dare to\nachieve a reform of the General Assembly that will\ninclude safeguarding its quality as a universal,\nparliamentary forum, without abandoning its ability for\ndecision-making and acting in a timely manner. Let us\nthink of a new type of collective security system that is\neffective and balanced, which would function under the\nguidance of our democratic body par excellence \u2014 the\nGeneral Assembly.\nInertia has caused each main organ of our\nOrganization to act in a manner that is removed from\nthe main purposes and objectives of the United\nNations. The development agenda must be better linked\nto conflict prevention and peace-building activities\nmust include mechanisms to ensure economic and\nsocial development. For that reason, we must also think\nabout how to strengthen the Economic and Social\nCouncil and about whether we can and should turn it\ninto an economic and social security council.\nMexico believes that reform should bring the\nUnited Nations into line with the requirements of an\never-changing world, in order to help us to overcome\nthe existing gaps and fresh challenges. Today, faithful\nto the principles, values and ideals of our Organization,\nwe have the obligation to build a new international\narchitecture, which, with a vision for the future, leaves\nfratricidal conflicts and struggles behind, opens new\navenues of understanding and international cooperation\nand forges new paths towards peace, international\nsecurity and development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like to extend\nto you, Sir, my warmest congratulations on your\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-eighth session. We are indeed very happy to see a\nMinister from a fellow Commonwealth, and also an\nisland State, presiding over the session. I am sure that\nyour diplomatic skills, experience and grasp of the\nissues will harmoniously steer our work. I would also\nlike to express our thanks and appreciation to your\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, for the excellent record of\nhis presidency.\nThis year my country is about to fulfil its most\nambitious aspiration \u2014 joining the European Union.\nAfter having signed the accession treaty in April, we\nexpect to become a full member, along with nine other\nacceding countries, on 1 May 2004. But already we are\nassociated with the work of the Union and participate\nin all meetings and in the life of the new European\nfamily of the 25 members. Hence, Cyprus is represented\nby the statement of the Italian Presidency of the\nEuropean Union and fully subscribes to its contents.\nUnfortunately, the current session is taking place\nin a heavy and loaded atmosphere. The deadly attack\nagainst the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad\nlast month, as well as the most recent one of two days\nago, continue to fill us with bitterness and indignation.\nWe all share the feeling of great injustice and insult to\nthe international community. Once again, I wish to\nexpress our deep condolences to the victims\u2019 families\nand our sympathy to those injured. At the same time,\nwe should also convey the message that such actions\nwill not deter us from the pursuit of the high ideals of\nthe United Nations and its engagement in Iraq.\nFrom Baghdad to Jakarta, from Russia to India,\nand back to the heinous attacks of 11 September two\nyears ago, terrorist acts around the globe serve as a\npainful reminder that terrorism transcends borders and\nattacks universal values. Freedom, democracy, human\nrights and humanity itself have to be defended by the\ninternational community with persistence and\ndetermination. At the same time, we should be cautious\nand ensure that our actions are fully in line with the\ncherished values we want to uphold. As the threat is\nunfortunately far from over, a genuine global\nmobilization, under the aegis of the United Nations, is\nof the essence if this endeavour is to be successful.\n2\n \nCyprus is playing its part fully in this concerted effort\nand is among the countries that have ratified all 12 of\nthe international conventions pertaining to terrorism.\nFurthermore, it has recently ratified the United Nations\nConvention on the Safety of United Nations and\nAssociated Personnel of 1994.\nThe non-proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction has become, and rightly so, a top priority in\nthe world\u2019s agenda. The risk of acquisition of such\nweapons by terrorist groups highlights even more the\ngravity and the urgency of the issues to be addressed.\nIn that respect, the United Nations has a truly\ninstrumental role to play. The universalization of, and\ncompliance with, multilateral treaties related to\ndisarmament and non-proliferation, as well as verification\nmechanisms and internationally-coordinated export\ncontrols, are essential tools in our efforts. We have\nrepeatedly expressed our genuine commitment to\ninternational norms in the field of disarmament. I am\nhappy to report that Cyprus, earlier this year, ratified\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the\nOttawa Convention.\nThe Government of Cyprus attaches great\nimportance to the international effort against mine\nproliferation and the clearing of minefields. For this\nreason it has taken the initiative to clear all minefields\nlaid in the buffer zone by the Cyprus National Guard\nimmediately after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. In\nthis regard, I would like to announce today my\nGovernment\u2019s decision and firm commitment: first, to\nunilaterally start within the next two months, in\ncooperation with the United Nations and with the\nfinancial support of the European Union, mine\nclearance in the buffer zone and, secondly, to\nunilaterally proceed with the destruction of an\nappreciable amount of stockpiled antipersonnel mines\nthis year during the month of November. This is just a\nfirst step but, I believe, a major one in the\nimplementation of our obligations under the\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and\non Their Destruction (Ottawa Convention).\nThis year again, the situation in the Middle East\nremains a source of major concern for the region and\nbeyond. The Quartet\u2019s road map, with the\noverwhelming international support it enjoys,\nrepresents an historic opportunity that should not be\nmissed. Unfortunately, in recent days, the international\ncommunity has held its breath as blind and spiralling\nviolence thwarts the efforts to place and maintain on a\nsolid track this process which would lead to a\nsettlement. The necessary political will should be\ndemonstrated by both sides, at all levels, and be\nmatched with persistent action on the ground, in the\nright direction.\nI would like to take this opportunity to reiterate\nour longstanding position for a just settlement, in\naccordance with international law, United Nations\nresolutions and the agreements reached between the\nparties, which will put an end to the occupation and\nrealize the aspirations of the Palestinian people for the\nestablishment of an independent state, side by side with\nIsrael, in peace and security. Cyprus, a country of the\nregion with traditionally close relations with both\nparties, stands ready to assist in every possible way.\nThe realization of the Charter\u2019s vision of a just,\npeaceful and prosperous world remains inextricably\nlinked with the commitment to promote and protect\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms in full\nconformity with their universal, indivisible and\ninterdependent nature.\nThe Republic of Cyprus, still witnessing serious\nviolations of human rights within its territory by\nforeign armed forces, places human rights at the very top\nof its agenda. While working hard for the promotion and\nprotection of the human rights of all its citizens under the\nharsh circumstances imposed by the invasion and\noccupation of a significant part of its territory, Cyprus\nnever loses sight of the universal dimension of human\nrights and remains active and resolutely watches over\nthe protection of human rights throughout the world. It\nreaffirms its full support of the Secretary General\u2019s\nefforts to integrate human rights into the whole range\nof United Nations activities and reiterates its\ncommitment to working closely with United Nations\npartners towards their universal implementation.\nWe still strive in Cyprus for establishing the fate\nof all those Cypriots, both Greek and Turkish, missing\nsince the Turkish invasion of 1974. This is a major\nissue of a purely humanitarian character and we seek\nthe support of the international community as a whole\nin order to put an end, at last, to the continuing ordeal\nof so many families. For this to happen, the\ncooperation and political will of the Republic of\nTurkey are absolutely necessary.\nFurthermore, the rights of the few remaining\nenclaved persons in the occupied part of Cyprus\n3\n \ncontinue to be violated. The rights of the refugees are\nalso still being denied, while our people face new faits\naccomplis by the occupation army, as in the case of the\nadvance of the Turkish Army in the area of Strovilia.\nWith the assistance of the international community we\nare, nevertheless, resolved to persevere in the\nimplementation of international conventions and for\nthe restoration of the human rights of all Cypriots.\nIn view of the new challenges that the United\nNations is required to face, Cyprus strongly supports\nthe Secretary General\u2019s United Nations objectives,\nwhich aim at adapting the internal structures and\nculture of the Organization to new expectations. It\ntherefore welcomes the work done on strengthening the\nmanagement and administration \u2014 as well as\nstreamlining the budget \u2014 of the United Nations.\nMy country also attaches great importance to the\nimprovement of the intergovernmental structure and\nprocesses of the United Nations and the revitalization\nof the General Assembly as essential elements of the\nreform process, whose aim is to bring about a stronger\nUnited Nations system that will be able to effectively\npursue the priorities adopted in the United Nations\nMillennium Declaration.\nWe certainly need effectiveness but we cannot\nseparate it from legitimacy. In Cyprus, we know, from\nour own experience, both the importance of legitimacy\nand the need for effectiveness. We have been facing the\ncatastrophic results of aggression and we have been\nstruggling for more than 29 years for the solution of\nthe problem created by the invasion and occupation of\nthe northern part of our country by Turkey.\nDespite all efforts, Turkish intransigence has not\nbeen curbed and their defiance of numerous resolutions\nof the General Assembly and of the Security Council\ncontinues unabated. Such an attitude constitutes not\nonly unacceptable behaviour in international relations\nbut is also completely anachronistic and\nincomprehensible to any rational thought. Furthermore\nit is at variance with the will and the wish of the\noverwhelming majority of Turkish Cypriots themselves\nwho are persistently asking for a solution and for\nparticipation in the accession of Cyprus to the European\nUnion. We continue, as far as we are concerned, to do\nour best to bring them on board and we have embarked\non an ambitious policy in order to enhance their\nstandard of living and allow them to fully enjoy the\nrights and benefits that they are entitled to as Cypriots.\nIn Cyprus, we have faced adversity for so many\nyears and we have survived. Hence, we know that we\nhave to persevere. We still believe in the United\nNations and we are grateful for its interest and\ninvolvement. I would like to take this opportunity to\nexpress our sincere thanks to the Secretary-General for\nhis tireless efforts within the framework of his mission\nof good offices in Cyprus, entrusted to him by the\nSecurity Council. I would like also to praise the work\nof the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General,\nMr. \u00c1lvaro de Soto, and all members of his team, of his\nassistant of the United Nations Mission, as well as of\nthe United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus and\nof the contributing countries. I believe that it is\nappropriate to mention this here at this stage because,\nas you all know, the continuing and longstanding\nTurkish intransigence thwarted a few months ago what\nwas probably the strongest initiative ever of the United\nNations for finding a solution in Cyprus.\nWe understand and share the bitterness and the\ndisappointment of all involved regarding this failure\nbut, as I said before, we should not give up. We have\nalways counted on United Nations support and\ninvolvement and we will continue to do so. We are\nalways ready, whenever the Secretary-General invites\nus, to engage in serious negotiations on the basis of his\nplan in order to reach a settlement as soon as possible,\nin conformity with relevant United Nations resolutions.\nWe hope that it will soon be possible for the other side\nto realize that they have to return to the negotiating\ntable, to cooperate constructively with the Secretary-\nGeneral and to demonstrate the necessary political will\nto yield a settlement.\nA solution is urgently needed in Cyprus, a\nfunctional and viable solution that will embrace all\nCypriots and will allow our country to take its stride\nand fully assume its place and role within the European\nfamily. A united Cyprus in a united Europe will thrive\nand progress with its partners towards a secure and\nprosperous future, working hand in hand with all other\nmembers of the international community for the\npromotion of universal values and peace.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThree\nyears ago, we held the Millennium Summit, during\nwhich we crafted a clear-cut common vision for the\ntwenty-first century, a road map to confront the\nchallenges of globalization: peace and security now\nfacing new threats, development and international\ncooperation, the environment, pandemics and so forth.\nOne year later the first challenge to this\nreassuring and ambitious edifice arose, the terrorist\nattacks of 11 September 2001. The international\ncommunity reacted unanimously and immediately\nadopted a collective response. A few months later we\nwitnessed the aggravation of tensions with the Iraq\ncrisis, which severely tested the principle of collective\nsecurity and moral authority of the United Nations, to\nthe point that we doubted the rationale for and the\nsurvival of what should be, after all, our common\nhome.\nFinally, and most recently, we have witnessed the\nfailure of the Ministerial Meeting of the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO) in Canc\u00fan. This deadlock in\ndefining a negotiating process to revive the Doha round\nplaces in jeopardy the growth prospects of the world\neconomy which would otherwise benefit all people.\nThis can also be interpreted as a new opportunity to\nmarginalize the countries of the South.\nAll of this shows that this present session is being\nheld in a particularly worrisome context. These\ndevelopments are dangerous for the management of\ninternational affairs that should be marked with a spirit\nof dialogue, consultation and openness.\nWe must, therefore, return to the spirit of\nmultilateralism that characterized the Millennium\nSummit. We must reaffirm, loud and clear, the role of\nthe United Nations as a central axis of collective\nsecurity and inspiration for the rules of international\ncooperation aimed at justice and equality.\nFor this reason it is important to strengthen the\nrole of our Organization and improve its effectiveness.\nThe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, has now\npresented a very edifying report in this connection and\nwe very much encourage him to persevere along the\npath of reform and rationalization and to place the\nmultilateral system at the core of the management of\ncrises and the display of leadership in the world.\nYour election, Sir, to the presidency of this\nsession of the General Assembly is, for us, a\ntremendous asset. It symbolizes the sovereign equality\nof all States, large and small, and is a way of paying\ntribute to your great qualities and your diplomatic\nexperience. We are convinced that you will know how\nto skilfully guide our debate on multilateralism to a\nsatisfying outcome, very much in keeping with the high\nexpectations of the community of nations.\nThis year, once again we see the challenges to\npeace and international security at the very core of our\nmajor preoccupations. Everyone remembers the attack\nof 19 August 2003 against the United Nations offices\nin Baghdad. The death of the Special Representative of\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, and\nseveral dedicated servants of the United Nations, is still\nalive in our memories.\nIn paying tribute to their courage and dedication,\nwe must do everything within our power to ensure that\ntheir sacrifice was not made in vain and that the cause\nthey served so heroically does indeed triumph in the\ninterests of the Iraqi people and the noble ideas of the\nUnited Nations.\nWe must therefore encourage the Security\nCouncil to return to its essential unity so that the\ninternational community, led by the moral authority of\nthe United Nations, can help the Iraqi people to find\npeace, security and stability and reconstruct their\ncountry devastated by war and many years of embargo.\nNot far from Iraq, the international community is\nstill confronted with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n14\n\nThis shows that the infernal cycle of violence can only\nlead to a dead end. The two parties must come to their\nsenses and return to the vision set out in the road map,\nwhich provides for the creation of a Palestinian State\nthat is independent, democratic and viable, living side\nby side with Israel and its other neighbours in an\natmosphere of peace and security.\nThe Security Council approved this vision in\nSecurity Council resolution 1397 (2002) and the two\nparties committed themselves to respecting the road\nmap on 4 June 2003 at the outcome of the Aqaba\nSummit. We must now bring them back to the\nnegotiating table, with no pre-conditions, and demand\nthat they refrain from any measure or unilateral action\nthat is incompatible with the goals of the road map.\nStill on the subject of peace and security, it seems\nto be necessary and essential to emphasize that we\nmust refrain from conflating terrorism, religion or\ncivilization as belonging to any geographical area or\nsupporting any national liberation struggle.\nJust as we must be firm, demanding and united\nwhen confronting acts of unjustifiable blind violence,\nwe must also be vigilant so as not to be tempted by\nconvenience.\nIn our relentless struggle against terrorism, it is\nimportant to give appropriate responses when it comes\nto the sovereignty of peoples, respect for human rights,\nsocial justice and combating poverty. We must also\nseriously analyse the causes that serve as the breeding\nground or pretext for terrorism. This is also part of\nconflict prevention and, to some extent, the prevention\nof terrorism.\nThis year we are celebrating the twenty-fifth\nanniversary of the first special session of the General\nAssembly on disarmament. It is regrettable to note that,\nsince the end of the cold war, so little progress has\nbeen accomplished and today\u2019s deadlock in the\nConference on Disarmament is a tragic display of our\nfailure.\nAt a time when the international community is\nlegitimately concerned about weapons of mass\ndestruction that might fall into the hands of terrorists, it\nis important to remind all of the actors that they must\nabide by the multilateral agreements and scrupulously\nrespect them.\nWithin the context of disarmament activities, we\nwelcome the holding, last July in New York, of the first\nBiennial Meeting of States to Consider the\nImplementation of the 2001 Programme of Action on\nSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. My\ncountry hosted in Brazzaville, from 12 to 14 May 2003,\na sub-regional seminar on the implementation in\nCentral Africa of the United Nations Programme of\nAction to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit\nTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its\nAspects and presented at that time a report reflecting\nAfrica\u2019s firm determination to eradicate this scourge.\nAs part of its implementation of the Ottawa\nConvention on anti-personnel landmines, from 9 to 10\nSeptember 2003, Congo destroyed its stock of\nlandmines. During two public operations carried out\nwith the support of Canada and the United Nations, our\nGovernment destroyed 5,220 landmines. We intend to\ncontinue with an operation to search out landmines in\nthe southern part of our country that borders on Angola\nand the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nThis is to illustrate the degree of cooperation that\nprevails among the countries of Central Africa when it\ncomes to questions of peace and security.\nAfrica is seen today as the focal point for the\nchallenges confronting humanity, in particular as\nregards armed conflict, underdevelopment and the\nproliferation of pandemics. But this is not all that\nAfrica has to offer the rest of the world. Various\ncourageous initiatives now show Africa\u2019s\ndetermination to take its fate into its own hands: the\nadoption of the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s\nDevelopment (NEPAD), the African Peer Review\nMechanism and the Council for Peace and Security.\nThe African Union Summit that was just held in\nMaputo, Mozambique, eloquently displays this attitude\nof ours. My delegation associates itself with the\nstatement made on 24 September by His Excellency\nMr. Joaquim Alberto Chissano, President of the\nRepublic of Mozambique, on behalf of the African\nUnion. The Acting President clearly informed the\ninternational community about the resolve of the\nAfrican continent to overcome current obstacles to\nbuilding a new Africa in the areas of peace, security,\ndemocracy, human rights, economic development and\nregional integration.\nIt is precisely in this sprit that His Excellency\nMr. Denis Sassou Nguesso, President of the Republic\nof Congo, put forward his thoughts in a statement\nentitled, \u201cFor a Pan-African Pact against Aggression\u201d\n15\n\nat the summit in Maputo, which constitutes a\ncontribution to preventive diplomacy that will help to\nspare the African peoples the horrors of fratricidal\nstrife and enable them to devote themselves exclusively\nand usefully to development objectives and a code of\nconduct between African States, lending timely support\nto the framework outlined by the Peace and Security\nCouncil of the African Union. My country, which is the\ncurrent acting President of the Economic Community\nof Central African States (ECCAS) and the Central\nAfrican Economic and Monetary Community\n(CAEMC), takes such concerns to heart as it discharges\nits mandates in the management of various crises that\nare shaking our subregion.\nWe have already had the opportunity to deplore\nthe fact that Central Africa suffers from the paradox of\nbeing both one of the richest subregions on the\ncontinent and one of the weakest zones in terms of\nhuman development indices. All the current initiatives\nof the leaders of the subregion are geared towards the\nresolution of this paradox. Thus, during the past year,\nsignificant progress had been registered in the various\ncountries that have experienced, or are experiencing,\narmed crises \u2014 Angola, Rwanda, the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, Congo, the Central African\nRepublic, Burundi and Chad. In the quest to resolve\nthese crises, we have counted on the cooperation of\ndiverse partners, especially the United Nations and\nAfrican Union.\nAllow me to briefly touch on some of the\nsituations that require particular attention from the\ninternational community. With respect to Angola, while\nwe welcome the return of peace in that country,\nravaged for nearly three decades by civil war, we wish\nto urge the international community to help the\nAngolan authorities in their efforts at reconstruction.\nWe continue to support the intention of the Angolan\nGovernment to submit for consideration at the present\nsession a draft resolution on international assistance for\nthe reconstruction and economic development of\nAngola.\nWe also welcome the positive developments\nunder way in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\ndistinguished in particular by the establishment of\ntransitional institutions and the deployment of the\nUnited Nations Organization Mission in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo in Ituri. We urge the\ninternational community to continue its support for the\npacification and reunification process under way in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and to further\ncontribute substantively to the reconstruction\nprogrammes in place. I would like to reaffirm our\nsteadfast wish to see this neighbouring and brotherly\ncountry find peace again, a guarantee for stability of\nthe subregion.\nI am also duty-bound to draw the attention of the\ninternational community to the situation in the Central\nAfrican Republic, which has been confronted for years\nwith serious and persistent economic, social and\nsecurity problems. I would like to recall here that\nalarmed by this ever-worsening situation, CAEMC has\nestablished an ad hoc committee on the Central African\nRepublic, presided over by His Excellency El Hadj\nOmar Bongo, President of the Gabonese Republic. It\nhas also deployed a peacekeeping force in that country.\nCAEMC\u2019s involvement in the Central African\nRepublic, which has received much encouragement,\nparticularly from the Security Council, mainly aims at\nthe reconciliation of the Central African people, the\npacification of the country and the prompt restoration\nof constitutional order. The holding of a Central\nAfrican dialogue fits precisely in the framework of the\nrecommended measures.\nThis country, which has suffered greatly these\npast years, truly needs assistance from the international\ncommunity to regain peace, stability, economic growth\nand democracy. That is the meaning of the appeal made\nat Brazzaville on 17 May 2003 by the ECCAS\nMinisters at the meeting of the United Nations\nStanding Advisory Committee on Security Questions in\nCentral Africa.\nStill with respect to our subregion, I would like\nfinally to stress in particular the crisis that raged in the\nDemocratic Republic of S\u00e2o Tom\u00e9 and Pr'ncipe in July\n2003. At that time, ECCAS, the African Union, the\nCommunity of Portuguese-Speaking Countries and\nNigeria worked in perfect concert to re-establish the\nconstitutional order shattered in this country on 16 July\n2003. While we commend the contribution made by the\nUnited States and South Africa, we would like to\nappeal again for the entire international community to\ngive substantial assistance to the Democratic Republic\nof S\u00e2o Tom\u00e9 and Pr'ncipe, particularly to the\nemergency programme that has just been established by\nthe Government of this country.\nWe must also follow with great interest\ndevelopments in Burundi, where every step forward\n16\n\nmust be supported and encouraged to make the process\nirreversible. To that end, the international community\nis urgently called upon to make good on the financial\ncommitments made during the conferences in Paris and\nGeneva.\nThe situations that I have just mentioned lead us\nto the relevant conclusions of the open Security\nCouncil meeting on 22 October 2002 on strengthening\ncooperation between the United Nations system and the\nCentral African region in the maintenance of peace and\nsecurity. At that meeting, we expressed our\nappreciation for the cooperation between our region\nand the United Nations while welcoming, inter alia, the\nwork of the Standing Advisory Committee on Security\nQuestions in Central Africa. We welcomed the multi-\ncountry programme of demobilization and reintegration\nput forward by the World Bank.\nSince then, we welcomed the visit of the Security\nCouncil in June 2003 to the Great Lakes region and the\nmultidisciplinary mission of the United Nations\nsystem, and we are eagerly awaiting its conclusions.\nThese conclusions will allow us to meaningfully\nparticipate in the future public debates of the Security\nCouncil on our subregion, one year after the meeting\nthat elaborated a comprehensive, integrated,\ndetermined and concerted approach to the problems of\npeace, security and development of Central Africa.\nEnergized by that approach, we intend to\nparticipate in the international conference on peace,\nsecurity, democracy and development in the Great\nLakes region. We intend to seize this historic\nopportunity to exorcise the demons of hatred and\nviolence and lay the foundation for peaceful\ncoexistence among our peoples and nations, which\nshare a common destiny.\nWhile reaffirming the central role that the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo has to play in that\nconference, I would like to stress that the Republic of\nCongo, my country, which is close to the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo in so many ways, would not\nunderstand if it had to attend as an observer at this\ncrucial event. The same goes, by all accounts, for other\nneighbouring countries of the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo, such as Angola and the Central African\nRepublic.\nThe issues of peace, security and building\nnational unity were at the core of the Congolese\nauthorities\u2019 concerns during the past year. It is in this\nframework that the 17 March 2003 agreement must be\nplaced, thanks to which peace continues to reign\nthroughout the entire territory.\nHaving regained peace, we are seeking to build\non it each day, particularly by implementing the\nprogramme of disarmament, demobilization and\nreintegration of ex-combatants. We are also working\ntowards the resettlement of internally displaced\npersons. It is not hard to fathom that these missions\nrequire considerable funding, which the Congo cannot\nprovide alone. We would like to thank all our partners\nfor their active solidarity.\nWe must still meet the great challenges of\nreconstruction, economy recovery, poverty reduction\nand the fight against HIV/AIDS, all sectors for which\nnational strategies have been adopted. To implement\nthis vast project, which we have called \u201cThe New\nHope\u201d, we are mobilizing all the national forces\ncapable of providing assistance to the State, including\nlocal government authorities, non-governmental\norganizations, civil society and the private sector. In\nthat framework, we have conducted negotiations with\nour external partners with a view to benefiting from the\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative.\nAll of these achievements can be implemented\nonly in a world free from fear, as envisaged by the\nfounders of our Organization, and as we believe today.\nThis is why we wish to reiterate our faith and\nattachment to the United Nations, an irreplaceable\nframework and beacon of all hopes for peace for\nhumanity, and which has never seemed more clearly\nnecessary than today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI bring a message of\npeace from Bangladesh.\nPlease allow me to congratulate the President on\nhis election. I wish him every success in the formidable\ntask of leading the United Nations to continued\nrelevance and credibility in these stormy times. I am\nconfident that he will build upon the legacy left by his\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan.\nWe commend the Secretary-General for his\nstewardship in these difficult times. The United\nNations has been faced with extremely challenging\nsituations over the past year. We have lost one of our\nmost outstanding men of peace \u2014\nMr. Sergio Vieira de Mello and many of his colleagues.\nSuch senseless and despicable acts must not be\nrepeated.\n\n\nThe new millennium, which we all heralded with\nso much hope, has been plunged into turmoil.\nIntervening events in the last three years have changed\nour world forever. They have left us groping for\nsolutions. The events of 11 September 2001, the\nAfghan and the Iraq war, the open confrontation\nbetween Israel and Hamas and the African civil wars\nshape some of the dimensions of this world of disorder.\nDriving these crises are new realities \u2014 an all-out\noffensive against terrorism, arguments for pre-emption\nand unilateral action as an option for security, the\ntargeting of Islamic radicalism and its fall-out as\nreligious profiling. Somewhere, the coin of global\ncooperation has been debased.\nEach year we come to this Assembly to reaffirm\nour faith in the United Nations and our commitment to\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter. Today, we\npause to grapple with doubts that have arisen about the\nrelevance of the world body. I hasten to add that for\nBangladesh, this pause is very short-lived. The cardinal\nquestion is not what is wrong with the United Nations,\nbut what is right with it and how we can make it serve\nour purposes despite seeming setbacks.\nThree compelling factors stand out. The first is\nuniversality. All 191 States of the world wish to be\nwithin the fold of the international community. Second\nis the flip side of globalization. The bottom line is that\nno one State alone can deal with the intricate problems\nfacing our world \u2014 be it the dysfunction of the\ncollective security system, an interlocking economic,\nmonetary, financial and trade grid, the challenges of\nglobalization, international terrorism, environmental\ndegradation, new diseases, trans-border organized\ncrime, and so on. The conclusion is clear. The United\nNations is indispensable as the central organ for the\ncollective management of world affairs.\nThe third factor is legitimacy. As has been\nunderlined, the greatest strength of the United Nations\nremains its legitimacy, founded on the bedrock\nprinciples of international law. There is no substitute\nfor that legitimacy. It is by this measure that we look to\nthe United Nations.\nBut as the Secretary-General notes in his report\non the implementation of the Millennium Development\nGoals, \u201cThe war exposed deep divisions in the\ninternational community, with accusations of double\nagendas\u201d. He goes on to observe that \u201cThe war in Iraq\nbrought to the fore a host of questions of principle and\npractice that challenge the United Nations and the\ninternational community as a whole\u201d. This is a sad\ncommentary on the state of the world body today.\nIn contrast, we have noted that wherever the\nUnited Nations was allowed to take up its rightful role\nand responsibility, and where it was provided with\nnecessary support, it has achieved success, durable\npeace and stability. The experience of East Timor,\nSierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo, to name only a few, have vindicated the\nlegitimacy, role and relevance of the United Nations.\nWar can be won by military might; the challenge lies in\nwinning peace. That is what the United Nations, with\nover half a century of experience in peacemaking,\npeacekeeping and peace-building, is best placed to do.\nWe in Bangladesh place our full trust \u2014 and have\ntotal confidence \u2014 in the capacity of the United\nNations to address matters of international and global\nconcern, including peace and security. We see the\nUnited Nations as a source of inspiration, initiative and\nsupport in our national, regional and international\nendeavours. It is in this forum that we establish\ncommon standards, universal values and shared\nprogrammes. In a globalizing world, no nation is an\nisland; none can prosper alone. We therefore believe\nthat today, more than ever before, the Organization\ndeserves the support of all of our nations in a more\nactive and demonstrable way.\nThe Secretary-General deserves our appreciation\nfor bringing the focus of the Organization back to its\nsocio-economic agenda. We welcome his report on the\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals.\nHis assessment of the progress in achieving the\nMillennium Development Goals is sobering. While\nsigns of progress for a given region are noted, the road\nto 2015 is long for many of our nations. The report of\nthe Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the\nPacific and the United Nations Development\nProgramme concerning the Millennium Development\nGoals, for instance, draws attention to the worrying\ndeclines in the flow of official development assistance\nto the least developed areas and countries; it described\nthat as \u201cunacceptable and unconscionable\u201d. The report\nhas also called for reforms in the international trade\nsystem to help the poorest countries.\nAgainst that backdrop, the setback at the World\nTrade Organization Ministerial Conference, held at\nCanc\u00fan, warrants an early resumption of the\n12\n\nnegotiations. A breakthrough will require courageous\ndecisions and significant compromises. Our\ncommitment to the Millennium Development Goals\nalso requires that the negotiations be concluded\nsuccessfully. The global economic situation today\ndictates equitable trade policies and fair trade practices,\nwhich were sought in the Doha round. The economic\nsurvival and the socio-economic stability of many\nnations depend on how we handle post-Cancun\nchallenges. The stakes are very high for all of us, in\nboth the short and the long term.\nThe development policies and programmes of our\nGovernment, led by the Prime Minister of Bangladesh,\nBegum Khaleda Zia, are based on the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals. Our resource allocation in the\nsocial sector remains high, and we have prepared a\nthree-year economic growth, poverty reduction and\nsocial development strategy. That is a major initial\npolicy framework. We look forward to working closely\ntogether with our development partners in our\nimplementation of those policies.\nThe governance paradigm in recent decades has\nhappily embraced the fundamental tenets of democracy.\nIn Bangladesh, we have the necessary institutions in\nplace. We are reforming, modernizing and expanding\nthem. As a thriving democracy ourselves, we support\nUnited Nations efforts aimed at promoting the rule of\nlaw, good governance and human rights. We believe\nthat all human rights \u2014 including the right to\ndevelopment \u2014 should be pursued in a comprehensive\nmanner and with a holistic approach.\nThe past year has seen serious developments in\nthe international peace and security situation,\nespecially in Africa and the Middle East. Bangladesh\nhas taken a positive and constructive approach to all\nthese issues. We have consistently supported the efforts\nof the United Nations in that regard. We have done that\nas a matter of our commitment to the purposes and\nprinciples of the United Nations and its Charter.\nIn practical terms, Bangladesh has remained a\nmajor partner of the United Nations in its peace and\nsecurity mission. Over the past two decades,\nBangladesh has participated in United Nations\npeacekeeping operations in four continents, including\nthe most perilous ones. We are currently among the\nlargest contributors of troops and other personnel to\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations, with\nthousands of our troops in eight Missions, in C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire, Western Sahara, the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo, Sierra Leone, Ethiopia and Eritrea, Kosovo,\nTimor-Leste and Georgia. Recently, we are also\ncommitted to taking part in the proposed United\nNations mission in Liberia.\nThe people of Iraq have inherited a civilization\nthat is ancient and one of the most glorious. The\npresent situation in Iraq should be resolved while\npreserving the interests of the people of Iraq and\nensuring long-term peace, security and stability in the\nregion. Bangladesh reiterates its support for the\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and political\nindependence of the country. We stand ready to take\npart in the reconstruction and rebuilding of Iraq in the\ntrue spirit of brotherhood that characterizes the\nrelationship between our two nations and peoples. We\nreiterate our call for ensuring a clear, effective and\ncredible role for the United Nations in Iraq\u2019s transition\nto democracy and in the country\u2019s reconstruction.\nBangladesh supports the forthcoming international\nconference on Iraq\u2019s reconstruction to be convened by\nthe United Nations, and we look forward to a\nsuccessful outcome.\nThe recent developments in the Middle East are\nextremely worrying. It is clear that the progress made\nfrom Oslo to Madrid and the present is now seriously\nthreatened. The road map that the Palestinian side\naccepted with great courage has not been seriously\naccepted or implemented by the other side.\nPreconditions have been imposed, making peace\ndifficult. The Israeli practices that are well known to\nthe Assembly continue to be applied in occupied\nPalestine. There are gross and systematic violations of\ninternational humanitarian law and fundamental human\nrights. The vicious and criminal announcement of the\nintention to expel and even assassinate President\nYasser Arafat calls for global condemnation in the\nstrongest possible terms. All of that runs counter to the\nglobal demand for the peaceful settlement and\nestablishment of a Palestinian State to live as a good\nneighbour in peace and security.\nBangladesh reiterates its support for the early\nestablishment of a sovereign, independent State of\nPalestine in accordance with the relevant United\nNations resolutions. We call for a more active role on\nthe part of the United Nations, and we ask the Security\nCouncil to assume its responsibilities towards the\npeople of Palestine. We urge the diplomatic Quartet to\nintensify its efforts to prevent further escalation and to\n13\n\naddress the threats against President Arafat, a Nobel\nPeace laureate and the undisputed leader of the\nPalestinian people. We urge that the peace process be\nplaced back on track. We call for renewed efforts\naimed at a comprehensive solution of the Middle East\nissues within a given time frame.\nInternational terrorism remains a scourge. In the\npost-11 September 2001 context, it has taken centre\nstage in our global concerns. We reiterate our\nunequivocal condemnation of terrorism in all its forms\nand manifestations. Bangladesh is party to several\ninternational conventions on combating terrorism, and\nwe are in the process of acceding to the remaining\nones. We are actively involved in the elaboration of an\nadditional protocol to the South Asian Association for\nRegional Cooperation\u2019s Regional Convention on\nSuppression of Terrorism. The protocol will strengthen\nthe Convention by incorporating provisions that\ninclude those contained in recent Security Council\nresolutions, in particular resolution 1373 (2001).\nBangladesh attaches great emphasis on disarmament.\nWe believe that it is closely related to international\npeace and security and has a direct relationship with\ndevelopment. Bangladesh is party to all international\ndisarmament treaties covering nuclear, biological,\nchemical and conventional weapons. Seeking general\nand complete disarmament is our constitutional\ncommitment. International peace and security, human\nsecurity and the security of our planet have been the\nprime considerations in making our policy choices.\nWe have supported all efforts at disarmament. We\ncontinue to believe in the value of all measures, even\npartial efforts at arms control and disarmament. Our\nconviction has been vindicated by our progress in the\ncontrol and ban of a number of weapons. The\nmultilateral track, including the Conference on\nDisarmament, needs to be revived.\nBangladesh has renounced all weapons of mass\ndestruction \u2014 biological, chemical and nuclear. The\nsituation along the borders of the two nuclear-armed\nSouth Asian countries has been a matter of global\nconcern. As a close neighbour, we too have a\nlegitimate cause for concern. In this context, we\napplaud the Secretary-General for his recent call for the\nelimination of all nuclear weapons. The imperatives, in\nview also of the threats to the existing regimes and\ntheir implications, do not require elaboration in this\nHouse. We would thus urge a renewed consideration of\nthe International Court of Justice (ICJ) opinion and the\nreport of the Canberra Commission on the Elimination\nof Nuclear Weapons.\nIn our region, as elsewhere, particularly since we\nare challenged by abject poverty, hunger, illiteracy,\nlack of safe drinking water and disease, our priorities\nshould be socio-economic development, not\nnuclearization. We need to foster cooperation, not\nprepare for confrontation.\nIt is with this thought that our late\nPresident Shaheed Ziaur Rahman conceived of\ninstitutionalized regional cooperation leading to the\nemergence of the South Asian Association for Regional\nCooperation (SAARC). We firmly believe in the value\nand indeed the imperative of cooperation in our region.\nWe hope that together we shall also be able to establish\na peaceful, friendly and prosperous South Asia. We\nwould draw inspiration from other parts of the world\nwhere such regional economic integration has worked\nwell for the people of those regions.\nIn today\u2019s world, perhaps the most potential\nsources of conflict of interest within countries and\namong them would centre on natural resources, in\nparticular, fresh water. We call for management of\nshared resources without depriving or causing damage\nto the economy or ecology of any of the countries\nconcerned or the region.\nFor example, any unilateral withdrawal of water\nfrom international rivers should be prohibited, as such\naction would cause great damage to the environment,\nagriculture, industry and the overall economy and\necology of other countries. All actions in such areas\nshould conform to international law and the norms of\nequity, justice and, of course, fair play. Any decision\nwith regard to shared natural wealth should be through\nconsultation among all concerned countries.\nBangladesh identifies itself closely with the\nproblems of Africa. We believe in the efficacy of\nSouth-South cooperation as a mutually beneficial\npractice among societies at comparable stages of\ndevelopment. The launching of the African Union has\nbeen inspiring and that of the New Partnership for\nAfrica\u2019s Development (NEPAD), encouraging. We are\nconfident that the leadership of Africa and its people\nwill succeed in transforming the continent into a\npeaceful and prosperous one.\nWe have developed greater knowledge, special\nbonds and closer friendship with many African nations\n14\n\nthrough our participation in their democracy and\nnation-building efforts and through peacekeeping and\ndevelopment activities. Bangladesh will continue to\nwork together with them in addressing the challenges\nof building durable peace and sustainable development.\nThe specific problems facing the landlocked and\nsmall island developing countries require special\nattention. We hope the Almaty Conference has created\na fresh impetus to address their needs. We must also\naccord support to countries that are in the process of\ntransition in their economies.\nThe 1990s have seen a series of major United\nNations conferences. Each has adopted an elaborate\nimplementable programme of action with clear and\nspecific responsibilities at national, regional and\ninternational levels. The International Conference on\nFinancing for Development, held in Monterrey,\nMexico, the World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment, held at Johannesburg, and the Third\nUnited Nations Conference on the Least Developed\nCountries, which met in Brussels, have reinforced the\nearlier commitments. Now is the time to focus our\nefforts \u2014 individual and collective \u2014 to implementing\nthe programmes of action emanating from those\nConferences.\nThe United Nations has, in recent years made\nsignificant progress in reforming itself in\norganizational and substantive terms. Further progress\nremains to be achieved in various areas, including the\nSecurity Council, where reforms are essential to make\nthe Council more representative, democratic and\neffective.\nAlso in need for further reform are the General\nAssembly and other major organs, including the\nTrusteeship Council, which could be revived. We need\ncertainly to go further. Bangladesh welcomes the\nproposal of the Secretary-General to establish a high-\nlevel panel of eminent persons for examining the\nchallenges to peace and security. We look forward to\ntheir report. In this regard, we would underline the\nimportance of preserving multilateralism and\nconsensus.\nDecisions on budget cuts must not compromise\nthe functioning of the Organization and budgetary\nexercises must not adversely affect the interests of the\ndeveloping countries, in particular the least developed\nones. There should be adequate provision for mandated\nactivities in the developing countries.\nIt will remain our goal to bring the United\nNations to the centre of global development efforts.\nThe Economic and Social Council can play a crucial\nrole in this regard. It must examine innovative and\ncreative methods in its work. Bangladesh has sought\nelection to the Economic and Social Council during the\ncurrent session. As we have done in the past,\nBangladesh seeks to contribute, as a member of the\nCouncil, to the pursuit of the United Nations social and\neconomic agenda. We hope we shall receive valuable\nsupport from all Members of the Assembly.\nThe Millennium Development Goals set a number\nof achievable targets in the most pressing areas.\nBangladesh is committed to achieving them for our\npeople. We shall also work closely with all other\nnations so that these objectives are realized equally for\nall of us. But we aspire to go beyond. We urge\ncontinued focus on the implementation of the outcome\nof the 1990s cycle of international conferences. They\nrepresent a comprehensive agenda for humanity for our\ncentury. We must follow up on them for our present\nand future generations and for the progress of\nhumankind. Let us all try to create a better world for all\ngenerations.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, I pay sincere tribute to\nthe President on his election to preside over the\nAssembly at the fifty-eighth session, which is being\nheld in a particularly important context in this century.\nHis long experience and his expertise on international\nissues, as well as the role that his country, Saint Lucia,\nplays in the Caribbean region, guarantee that our work\nwill be a success.\nI also congratulate the other members of the\nBureau, and cannot fail to commend the skill with\nwhich the President\u2019s distinguished predecessor, Mr.\nJan Kavan, of the Czech Republic, conducted the work\nof the fifty-seventh session.\nI reiterate to the Secretary-General the full\nsupport of the Transitional Government of the Central\nAfrican Republic for his unceasing work at the head of\nthe Organization to ensure peace and security in a\nworld beset by terrorist threats and widespread\ninsecurity.\nThe Central African Republic joins those who\nhave honoured the memory of the United Nations\npersonnel who fell victim to the wanton violent act of\nterrorism in Baghdad on 19 August, including Mr.\nSergio Vieira de Mello, and reiterates its sincere\nsympathy to the Secretary-General. We appreciate his\ndecision to maintain the United Nations mission in\nIraq, despite everything.\n24\n\nFor a decade, the General Assembly has adopted\nmany recommendations, whose implementation has not\nalways brought solutions to our diverse shared\nconcerns.\nBefore my delegation contributes its appraisal of\nthe state of the world, against the backdrop of the many\nchallenges of the twenty-first century, I would like, on\nbehalf of His Excellency Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9, President of\nthe Central African Republic, and of the Republic\u2019s\nGovernment and people, to express the wish that our\nmeetings may be crowned with success.\nA world that cherishes peace, progress, solidarity\nand concord is the objective to which the entire world\naspires and the main philosophy of the founding fathers\nof the United Nations. Indeed, when peace is not\nassured, various crises ensue. Aggravating factors like\ndestitution, penury, extreme poverty, HIV/AIDS,\ntuberculosis and malaria, combined with intolerance,\ninjustice, indifference and social inequality, greatly\nthreaten the balance of peace in many regimes of the\nworld, and particularly in the Central African Republic.\nIt was against this background that a surge in\npatriotism occurred on 15 March this year in the\nCentral African Republic as the outcome of a process\nto which all the leading lights of the nation contributed.\nThe situation that prevailed in my country before\n15 March was the subject of several debates, and\nunsuccessful attempts at settlement, by the Security\nCouncil, the African Union\u2019s/Central Organ of the\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\nResolution, the Central African Economic and\nMonetary Community (CAEMC) and the Community\nof Sahelo-Saharan States. A number of bilateral\ninitiatives also failed.\nI reiterate once again the gratitude of the\nGovernment and people of the Central African\nRepublic to the Secretary-General, the United Nations\nPeace-building Support Office in the Central African\nRepublic, the Security Council members and\nparticularly friendly countries, who generously\ncontributed to supporting the Central African people at\nan extremely difficult time.\nSince 15 March the resolve of the Transitional\nGovernment to work for a return to normal\nconstitutional life has resulted in significant advances,\nin the framework of the implementation of\ncommitments according to the following timetable:\nMay 2003, establishment of the National Transition\nCouncil to replace Parliament;. September 2003, the\nholding of a national dialogue for the Central Africans\nto examine the deep causes of their long-standing\nconfrontations; 2004, holding of a constitutional\nreferendum; the third quarter of 2004, presidential\nelections; and fourth quarter of 2004, municipal and\nlegislative elections.\nThis consensual transition, scheduled to end in\nJanuary 2005, should establish security throughout the\ncountry, improve public finances and revive the\neconomic and social sectors, which are engines of\ngrowth.\nThese main points of our overall policy and of the\nTransitional Government\u2019s economic and social\nrecovery strategy now being implemented are\nsupported and commended by the neighbouring\ncountries in general, and in particular by the members\nof CAEMAC, which acknowledge the work of the new\nregime.\nThe member countries of the United Nations\nStanding Advisory Committee on Security Questions in\nCentral Africa, at their nineteenth ministerial meeting,\nheld in Brazzaville from 14 to 17 May this year,\nexpressed their support for the change that had\noccurred in Bangui in a declaration, and appealed to\nthe international community to provide assistance to\nthe Central African Republic.\nThe exhaustive report of the situation before\n15 March presented by the President of the Republic,\nHis Excellency General Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9, to the special\nsummit of CAEMAC devoted exclusively to the\nsituation in the Central African Republic led heads of\nState and of delegations to understand and support the\nTransitional Government\u2019s efforts to bring about a\nreturn to constitutional order. Clear signs of the\nsignificant progress in establishing national\nreconciliation and restoring constitutional and\ndemocratic order are the fruitful discussions with many\nfriendly countries and partners, the consultations\nbetween the Central African Republic and the\nEuropean Union which have been going on since\n22 May, and the fact-finding visit to Bangui from 17 to\n21 August of the Committee of Ambassadors of the\nAfrican, Caribbean and Pacific States.\nIn his introductory report to the Millennium\nSummit, the Secretary-General recalled that people are\nthe purpose of any activity. Nothing could be more\ntrue. My delegation would like to see the United\n25\n\nNations regain its authority in order to help promote\nhuman rights, democracy and development throughout\nthe world.\nProtecting and guaranteeing human rights\ncontributes to a country\u2019s national concord and to the\nstrengthening of its democracy. This was so well\nunderstood by the Central African Republic that on\n15 March we chose consensual governance, at the\ncentre of which the well-being of the citizens and the\nprotection and guarantee of their rights are the highest\npriorities.\nImplementing this will require resources that\npermit the widespread promotion of human rights and\nsocial development. My delegation hopes that the\nUnited Nations will become more involved, at the\nbeginning of this third millennium, in international\naction to create a true human rights culture. To do this,\nthe United Nations needs to reform, renew itself and\nadapt to today\u2019s world. It will have to rationalize its\nprocedures, methods and approaches to all questions\nwithin its purview.\nIt will be understood that my delegation would\nlike to see the Security Council reformed, so that it\nmay better discharge its noble mission. Even if the veto\nis not as abused as it was during the cold war, Security\nCouncil membership needs to be reformulated, both at\nthe level of permanent membership and non-permanent\nmembership, in order to reflect the new realities of our\nworld. This is the view of the delegation of the Central\nAfrican Republic.\nThe need for a new approach in relations between\nStates means that we all need to make a real\ncommitment. This led to the adoption of the\nConstitutive Act of the African Union as an expression\nof the desire of Africa to meet, together with the\nUnited Nations, all the challenges of the twenty-first\ncentury. My country will spare no effort to promote\nthis new dynamism.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffSir, may I, as Prime\nMinister of Malaysia and Chairman of the Non-Aligned\nMovement, offer my sincere congratulations to the\nPresident on his election as President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-eighth session. I am confident that\ngiven his wisdom, experience and diplomatic skill, he\nwill be able to steer the proceedings of this session to a\nsuccessful conclusion. I wish to assure him of the\n10\n \nfullest cooperation of the Malaysian delegation. I\nstrongly believe that the members of the Non-Aligned\nMovement would similarly render their full support\nand cooperation to him.\nAllow me also to pay tribute to his predecessor,\nHis Excellency Mr. Jan Kavan, for his dedication and\nthe effective manner in which he conducted the work\nof the fifty-seventh session. I also commend the\nSecretary-General for his efforts and perseverance, and\nI salute the men and women who had dedicated and\ngiven their lives in the service of the United Nations.\nThe General Assembly has been conceived as a\nforum for the nations of the world, big and small, to air\ntheir views and grievances freely, as the stakeholders in\nthe governance of the international community.\nUnfortunately, it is subservient to the Security Council,\nwhich in turn is subservient to any single one of the five\nvictors of a war fought more than half a century ago. It\nis hardly a democratic forum, but it is all that the great\ncivilization of the late twentieth and early twenty-first\ncenturies has \u2014 a civilization that is supposed to\nuphold freedom.\nStill we, the small nations, have much to be\ngrateful for. From being the colonies of the Europeans,\nwe are now independent and we are granted\nmembership of the United Nations with the right to\nspeak, albeit with proper restraint and decorum, in this\nAssembly. As independent nations, we believe that we\nhave a right to manage our internal affairs ourselves\nwithout foreign interference.\nWe admit that there are abuses in the management\nof our countries by some of our Governments, but our\ndetractors should remember that they, too, abused their\nGovernments\u2019 power when they seized land belonging\nto indigenous peoples and exterminated them, claiming\nthat it was their \u201cmanifest destiny\u201d, the \u201cwhite man\u2019s\nburden\u201d, to bring civilization by setting up their own\ncountries in these lands and confining the indigenous\npeoples to barren reserves, with no role in the\nGovernment of the new nations. What they did to the\nindigenous peoples is not out of character, for in their\nown countries they carried out pogroms against the\nJews, inquisitions and mock trials, torture and killing\nby burning at the stake.\nWe all carry the baggage of history, but we would\nwillingly leave it behind were it not for the fact that\nhistory has a nasty habit of repeating itself. Today, we\nare seeing the resurgence of European imperialism. At\nfirst, we thought that the colonization would be virtual.\nMerely by economic strangulation and financial\nemasculation, the newly independent countries could\nbe brought to their knees, begging to be recolonized in\nother forms. Today, however, we are actually facing the\nold physical occupation by foreign forces. Puppet\nregimes are installed, dancing as puppets do.\nThis institution, the United Nations, in which we\nhad pinned so much hope, despite the safeguards\nsupposed to be provided by the permanent five, is\ntoday collapsing on its clay feet, helpless to protect the\nweak and the poor. This United Nations can just be\nignored, pushed aside, gesticulating feebly as it\nstruggles to be relevant. Its organs have been cut out,\ndissected and reshaped so that they may perform the\nway the puppetmasters want. The World Bank, the\nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Trade\nOrganization have now been turned into instruments of\nhegemony to impoverish the poor and enrich the rich.\nIt is not surprising that today the disparities between\nrich and poor are far greater than ever.\nWith an impotent United Nations and its agencies\nturned into national organs of the powerful, the small\nnations are now naked and hapless. Even if we are\ntotally innocent, there is nothing to prevent trumped-up\ncharges being brought against us.\nWe feel a great need for the integrity and\ncredibility of the United Nations to be restored.\nFortunately, the breach of international norms has been\nby countries which are reputedly tolerant of free speech\nand the rights of others. When criticisms are forbidden,\nthe abuses will increase until they become intolerable\nand revolt takes place, with all the destruction that\naccompanies it. That was what happened with Saddam\nHussein on a national scale. That can also happen on an\ninternational scale. Free speech provides the safety\nvalve, the absence of which must eventually lead to an\nexplosion.\nSince the Asian financial crisis in 1997, Malaysia\nhas not been able to recover fully. This crisis was\nfollowed by the collapse of the dot.com companies and\nthe massive cheating by the huge multinational\ncorporations of the rich. Then came the 11 September\n2001 attack by terrorists, which precipitated an\nunprecedented tightening of security worldwide and the\ninvasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. The world now lives\n\n \nin fear \u2014 the rich of terror attacks and the others of\nbeing made targets of suspicion and pre-emptive\naggression.\nThen came severe acute respiratory syndrome\n(SARS), which almost bankrupted many airlines and\nthe tour and travel business. SARS disappeared almost\nas quickly as it appeared, but there is no guarantee that it\nor similar new infectious diseases will not come back.\nThe world has lost its way. The hopes of the post-\nSecond-World-War period and the United Nations were\ndashed by the cold war. The cold war is over now, but\nthe resultant unipolar world and the ascendancy of\ncapitalism have brought about new threats. No country\nis safe from marauding currency traders who, in a few\nshort days, can demolish the patiently nurtured\neconomies of the developing world. Far from being\ncurbed, these highway brigands are lauded for their\nphilanthropy. Robin Hood at least stole from the rich to\ngive to the poor. These highwaymen steal from the\npoor and give a paltry sum to assuage their sense of\nguilt. They are no philanthropists.\nThe unipolar world dominated by a democratic\nnation is leading the world into economic chaos,\npolitical anarchy, uncertainty and fear. We are not\ngoing to recover or have peace so long as threats are\nused for political and economic reforms that most of\nthe world is not ready for or willing to accept.\nIf we want to have democracy, the rule of law and\nrespect for human rights, the powerful must\ndemonstrate their commitment to all these noble ideas.\nAnd they can begin by restructuring the United\nNations, in particular by abolishing the undemocratic\nsingle-country veto. This should be replaced with a\nmodified veto whereby two veto powers, backed by\nthree other members of the Security Council, would be\nneeded to block any United Nations resolution. Even\nthat, however, should be gradually dismantled in\nfavour of majority decisions in the Security Council.\nThe other important agencies of the United\nNations must be freed from the domination of any\nsingle country. Gradually, they should be made more\ndemocratic.\nThe free market must be recognized for what it is\n\u2014 a market in which the bottom line is paramount. It is\nnot a political force for the disciplining of\nGovernments. For the right to exploit world trade, a tax\nshould be levied by the United Nations and used by the\nUnited Nations to build needed infrastructure for the\npoor countries of the world. Exchange rates should be\nfixed by an international commission based on relevant\nissues. Apart from a small commission, no profits may\nbe made by speculating or manipulating exchange\nrates. Subsidies by rich countries for the production of\nfood and other products must be forbidden, although\npoor countries should be allowed for a stipulated time\nto protect their industries and food production.\nThe world has lost its way. The world is moving\ntoo fast. We need to pause to take stock of things.\nThere is a Malaysian saying that when one loses his\nway he should go back to the beginning. We need to go\nback to the beginning. If we dare to admit it, many of\nthe problems that we face today are due to the arbitrary\nexpropriation of the land of the Palestinians in order to\ncreate the State of Israel in order to solve the European\nJewish problem.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMy congratulations go to you, Sir, and to the people of\nSaint Lucia on your election, together with my thanks\nto your predecessor, Mr. Kavan, for his work over the\npast year. You have our full support and best wishes in\nall your efforts to promote the interests of the members\nof this Assembly.\nMay I couple these greetings with my great\nappreciation to our Secretary-General and his staff. We\nare very grateful indeed for their dedication and service\nduring one of the most difficult years in United Nations\nhistory.\nIn particular, I wish to add once more the deepest\nsympathy of the Government and people of Brunei\nDarussalam to the families of Sergio Vieira de Mello\nand of all who lost loved ones, colleagues and friends\nin the attack on the United Nations headquarters in\nBaghdad. His Excellency and his staff were our public\nservants, our representatives and our people. The attack\non them was an attack on us all. As such, we condemn\nit and all other acts of terrorism.\nWhen Brunei Darussalam had the honour of\nbecoming a Member of this Organization, we\ncommitted ourselves to two principles. The first was\nnationhood and all that this implies in terms of the rule\nof international law and the procedures that govern the\naffairs of this Assembly. The second was multilateral\ndecision-making and, in turn, all that this also\nimplies \u2014 respect for fellow members, sensitivity to\ntheir deep concerns and the need for dialogue and\nconsultation as equal partners in the conduct of\ninternational affairs, no matter how long and how\nfrustrating the process involved may be.\nWe continue to maintain our belief in these\nprinciples in spite of many disappointments in the past\nyear, both here in the United Nations and earlier this\nmonth at the World Trade Organization. We feel that\nthey are the only basis upon which international affairs\ncan be conducted fairly. They apply to all the great\npolitical and economic organizations of which we are\nmembers and we especially look to the United Nations\nto uphold them.\nBy this token, the United Nations is whatever we\nourselves make it. We form the largest coalition in\nhistory and we share responsibility for its successes\nand its failures. Among those is our failure to bring in\nthe changes that are necessary if we are to evolve with\nthe times in which we live.\nSince 1992, this Assembly has been debating\nreform. It has the support of a large majority here,\nincluding all members of the Non-Aligned Movement.\nThe results of our failure to build on this support can\nnow be clearly seen. Our Security Council has been\ngravely divided and the past year has left a legacy of\nbitterness. The consequences for the ordinary people\nwe represent \u2014 the people of developing nations year\nafter year, the people of Iraq for the past 10 years or\nmore, and the citizens of Palestine for over half a\ncentury \u2014 have been ever more disastrous.\nIn all this time, Members have been well aware\nthat decision-making at the United Nations needs to be\nmore inclusive and genuinely multilateral. On many\noccasions, they have expressed the desire that the\nOrganization reflect today\u2019s world rather than the\nworld of half a century ago. They wish to feel truly part\nof the decisions it makes.\nAs it operates now, however, many observers feel\nthat the actual Members of this Organization are too\nweak to act effectively in solving the great affairs of\nthe day. It is claimed that international affairs are now\nbeyond the control of individual nations. They are\nglobal \u2014 global finance; global economics; global\ndevelopment; global poverty; global crime; and, of\ncourse, global terrorism. Consequently, some voices\ndeclare that an Assembly of individual nations, many\nof them small and still developing, has no power to\naddress such matters.\nThat is a depressing scenario and, of course, none\nof us here really wants to believe it, but it does have\none merit. It forces us to examine what the United\nNations can actually do most effectively and what it\ncan realistically achieve. The reply from too many of\nour people today would be, we fear: not much. This\npresents a powerful case for reform.\nI therefore feel that we must frankly acknowledge\nour part in the feelings of hopelessness and frustration\nthat are being voiced by ordinary people and indeed by\nmany Governments. At present, restoring belief in the\nUnited Nations ability to act on their behalf may be our\nmost important immediate task. On the one hand, the\ngreat world institutions are technically multilateral.\nThey are run by the Governments of the world. Yet, in\n21\n\nfact, many of these Governments feel excluded from\nthe most important decisions. Many interested parties\nfeel that they are also on the outside.\nMultilateralism, in other words, appears to have\nits limits. Beyond them, it seems, the stronger nations\ntake over. This basic division, we hope, can be brought\nto an end. That is why we were so pleased to hear our\nSecretary-General emphasize the need for reform in his\naddress last week. We congratulate the Secretary-\nGeneral on the structural reforms he has overseen. We\nalso thank him for the many times he has kept us in\ntouch with his thinking and that of his staff and we\nthank him for the hopes he has continued to express\nabout the future of our world Organization.\nWe still share his optimism. Nevertheless, that\nfeeling can be maintained only if agreement on reform\nof the whole United Nations system is a real\npossibility. We accept that the task of bringing about\nthis kind of overall change is extremely hard. The\nreports of your own Working Group, Mr. President,\nshow a difficult pattern emerging over the past 10\nyears. There are more and more proposals and basic\napproaches continually diverge. Even though we\nlargely share the same objectives, we remain divided\non the means to achieve them.\nThe divisions we have seen this year, however,\nsuggest that we cannot keep postponing change. They\noffer a test of whether the United Nations is indeed\ncapable of evolving. That test must be passed, so we\ncontinue to support work on Security Council reform\nand offer our strong encouragement to the Secretary-\nGeneral in the proposals he outlined last week.\nIn the face of today\u2019s problems, the United\nNations must continue to offer powerful reasons for\noptimism about the future. We believe that this calls for\na determined and united effort to address the root\ncauses of the anger of all who feel unjustly treated. To\ndo this, the United Nations as a whole must be a\ngenuine partnership between nations. It must stand for\nshared idealism and a shared sense of human justice.\nThat is what no other body can do.\nThat is what the work of Sergio Vieira de Mello\nand his colleagues was dedicated to. In their memory,\nand in that of all who have given their lives to this\nOrganization, we all need to do a lot better at working\ntogether than we have over the past year.\n\n"

She was taken from us by an evil act that\nis beyond comprehension, while carrying out her\nimportant work. We will all miss Anna; she should be\nhere today.\nWe need the United Nations today more than\never. We need the United Nations to provide a more\nsecure world, to fight international terrorism, to resolve\nconflicts and to halt the spread of weapons of mass\ndestruction. We need the United Nations in ensuring\nfundamental human rights for all people. We need the\nUnited Nations to establish, implement and develop an\ninternational legal order based on the rule of law. And\nwe need the United Nations in combating poverty and\nsecuring sustainable economic growth.\nIraq has been a key challenge for the Security\nCouncil. A united Council provided the United Nations\nwith a mandate to assist the people of Iraq in a wide\nrange of areas, including facilitating and supporting the\npolitical process. Iraq, the United Nations and the\ninternational community as a whole suffered a tragic\nloss in the recent attacks. But it should not make us\nwaver in our determination to continue working for a\nbetter future for Iraq. Those evil attacks must not\ninspire other terrorists to threaten the United Nations\npresence in Iraq. Sovereignty should be transferred to\nthe Iraqis as quickly as possible, but the international\nmilitary presence must be maintained until security is\nfully restored. The United Nations role and presence in\nthis process must be strengthened.\nImmense challenges lie ahead of us. Our goal is\nto ensure that the twenty-first century becomes the\ncentury in which each and every one of us can live in\npeace, stability and growing prosperity   a century in\nwhich freedom, respect for the individual, human rights\nand democracy become daily realities, not just abstract\nideas, for billions of people.\nConsidered over time, the United Nations has a\nstrong scorecard. We have managed to transform the\nparalysed cold war Organization into a key forum for\ninternational discussions and decisions in all fields. Let\nme highlight three areas where the United Nations\ncould be even stronger.\nFirst, the United Nations is at the forefront of the\nfight against poverty. By agreeing to achieve the\nMillennium Development Goals by 2015, we have set\nourselves measurable targets by which we must all\nstand and be counted. In Monterrey and Johannesburg\nthe developing countries acknowledged responsibility\nfor their own development, based on good governance,\ndemocracy and the rule of law. The African efforts\nmust be especially highlighted and supported. Every\nindividual on the African continent must feel the\nurgency of our collective efforts to improve his or her\nliving conditions. Only then can the tide be turned on a\ncontinent that has been lagging behind for too long.\nDenmark's commitment to development speaks\nfor itself, be it in terms of development assistance or in\nrelation to trade liberalization. Especially for the\nbenefit of the developing countries, we need such trade\nliberalization. Therefore, the lack of results in Cancun\nwas a great disappointment. We needed results, both\nfor the developing world and for the global economy.\nWe did not achieve those results in Cancun, but\nDenmark will certainly work hard to achieve them in\nthe future   not least for the developing world.\nDenmark supports a high-level event in 2005\nfocusing on the commitments made in the Millennium\nDeclaration in order to give new energy to the\nimplementation of all the Millennium Development\nGoals. Denmark stands ready to provide a full account\nof its efforts to achieve the Goals, including in the\nfields of trade and development assistance.\nSecondly, the United Nations is essential for the\nestablishment, the implementation and the development\nof an international legal order based on the rule of law.\nThe United Nations was created with a strong purpose\nand a great vision. The concepts and values of the\nCharter   of international peace and stability based on\nequality among nations and respect for their\nsovereignty   are universal.\nThe strength of our values and of our principles\nmust be measured by our ability to apply them to the\nrealities around us. We must be ready to adapt our\ncollective actions to the needs of the world. Attesting\nto that is the immense work done in the fields of human\nrights; the rights of women and children, including the\nright to reproductive health care and services; the\n34\n\nstruggle against terrorism; and the efforts to control\nnuclear, biological and chemical weapons.\nFurthermore, the establishment of the International\nCriminal Court is the single most important step in the\nmodern history of international criminal law. It sends a\nstrong signal that the international community will no\nlonger allow the most serious international crimes to\nremain unpunished.\nDenmark firmly believes that a democratic\nsociety based on the rule of law is the best guarantee\nfor stable development, in terms of both upholding\nfundamental freedoms and furthering social justice.\nHuman rights are universal and must be applied by all\nStates. It is imperative that all States be committed to\ncooperating constructively with the United Nations\nhuman rights mechanisms and that they overcome\ntraditional attitudes concerning State sovereignty.\nThirdly, the United Nations is at the core of\nefforts to tackle old and new security challenges. The\nSecurity Council has successfully taken on\ninternational terrorism, and it should continue to focus\non how to deal with weapons of mass destruction.\nAnother pressing issue is how to prevent the\nbreakdown of societies and to address the root causes\nof conflicts; and, if prevention is unsuccessful, how to\ndeal with the breakdown of social order. A strategic\nvision on how to deal with the new challenges is\nurgently needed.\nThe Security Council still reflects the power\nstructures that existed at the end of the Second World\nWar. Consequently, a comprehensive reform is needed\nto make the Council more representative and, at the\nsame time, to safeguard the efficiency of the decision-\nmaking process. It is of equal importance that the\nSecurity Council ensure compliance with its\nresolutions.\nThe process towards more targeted and smart'\nsanctions should be continued. We must ensure that\nsanction regimes clearly monitor whether the objects\ntargeted are in compliance with the aims pursued by\nthe sanctions. Assistance to Member States in\nimplementing sanctions should also be considered.\nAccompanying resolutions with incentives or carrot-\nand-stick measures could be another option.\nWe would also welcome a strengthening of the\ndivision of labour and cooperation with regional and\nsubregional organizations. Over the past 50 years, we\nhave been building strong regional institutions to\novercome our divisions and to manage our problems.\nWith the initiative of the New Partnership for Africa's\nDevelopment and the rapid intervention of the\nEconomic Community of West African States in\nLiberia, recent developments in Africa are very\nencouraging in that regard as well. To further promote\nthose developments, we must all continue and expand\nour political and financial support for the strong and\nprogressive African leadership.\nOver the years, Denmark has been active in world\naffairs and has been a strong supporter of the United\nNations. We shall continue to focus on areas where we\ncan contribute to make the world a better place in\nwhich to live for all. Denmark is therefore seeking to\nbecome a member of the Security Council in 2005 and\n2006. If we become a member of the Council, we shall\nwork to further develop the Council's efficiency and its\nimpact. We shall work for increased synergy among the\nmilitary, political, humanitarian and developmental\naspects of conflict management. We hope we can make\na special contribution to solving the various conflicts\nthat are still not settled around the world, and we shall\ndo our utmost to prevent new conflicts from arising.\nOur aim will be to continue to build bridges between\nthe multiple interests of the Members of the United\nNations.\nUnderpinning our vision of a strong United\nNations for the twenty-first century is the need to\nstrengthen and reform the Organization at all levels and\nin all its aspects. We express strong support for the\nSecretary-General and for his persistent efforts in that\nregard, and we hope that the Secretary-General's high-\nlevel panel will provide new inspiration and fresh ideas\nfor us all. But we, the Member States, must take the\nlead; the ball is in our court. We must enable the\nUnited Nations to take credible, efficient action to meet\nthe challenges of this century and of this millennium;\nthat is our collective responsibility and duty.\nAs a member of the European Union, Denmark is\nworking actively towards these goals, and I can assure\nthe Assembly that all the Nordic countries strongly\nsupport the Secretary-General's proposals and are\nready to face these challenges. Let us together ensure\nthat the United Nations is ready, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn\n19 August 2003, the international community took a\nblow to the body in Baghdad in odious acts that caused\nthe tragic loss of approximately 20 United Nations\nofficials, including the lamented Sergio Vieira de\nMello, Special Representative of the Secretary-\nGeneral. By attacking a symbol as prestigious as the\nUnited Nations, the forces of evil intended to destroy\nthe firm resolve of our Organization to carry out its\nmission of safeguarding international peace and\nsecurity.\nThose unspeakable crimes demonstrate once\nagain the intensity of terrorism in all its forms and\nunderscore the vital need for the international\ncommunity to reaffirm its solidarity in order to find the\nways and means to stamp out this scourge, which\nremains one of the greatest threats to humankind\u2019s\nharmonious development. My delegation energetically\ncondemns those vile acts and pays tribute to the\nmemory of the victims. It renews to the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, the sincere compassion of\nthe people and Government of Guinea, particularly of\nHis Excellency General Lansana Cont\u00e9, President of\nthe Republic of Guinea.\nMy delegation also wishes to take this\nopportunity to express its deep gratitude to Mr. Annan\nfor the courage and the effectiveness with which he is\nleading the destiny of our Organization. The Republic\nof Guinea will be unstinting in its efforts to make its\ncontribution to the influence of the United Nations,\nwhich, it hardly needs to be said, remains the primary\nframework for concerted action in the conduct of\ninternational relations.\nI wish to take this opportunity to convey my\ndelegation\u2019s warmest congratulations to you, Mr.\nPresident on your well-deserved election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\nsession. Appreciating your great ability, there can be no\ndoubt that you will skilfully follow up the work of your\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, whose dedication and skill\nwere greatly appreciated in the course of the previous\nsession.\nAfrica, where more than one third of the\npopulation lives in absolute poverty, continues, alas, to\nbe the scene of fratricidal wars, whose negative effects\nundermine the development policies of its States.\nNotwithstanding that bitter state of affairs, marked\nprogress has been made in extinguishing hotbeds of\ntension. Hope is reborn in West Africa.\nSierra Leone is being stabilized, thanks to the\nactive support of the international community, but also,\nand above all, thanks to the patriotism of Sierra\nLeoneans and the determination of their leaders to\nclose the book on war. My country, while expressing its\nappreciation for the respect shown for the criteria for\nthe withdrawal of the United Nations Mission in Sierra\nLeone (UNAMSIL), takes the view that the success of\nthat plan also hinges on increased assistance to Sierra\nLeone, as well as the effective restoration of State\nauthority throughout the territory.\nIn Liberia, with the departure of President\nCharles Taylor on 11 August, a new era is becoming\napparent for that country, scarred by 14 years of\nfratricidal war, which augurs well for the subregion as\na whole \u2014 particularly the Mano River basin, whose\noverall development has long been jeopardized. We\nwish to pay tribute to the efforts of the Economic\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) and the\nUnited Nations that have made it possible to secure a\nceasefire and to achieve the Comprehensive Peace\nAgreement in Accra, thus opening the way for the\nestablishment of a Government of transition and\nnational reconciliation. My delegation appeals to the\ninternational community for effective support for the\nimplementation of the Accra accord, so that Liberians\ncan finally be reconciled among themselves and can\ntackle the reconstruction of their country in renewed\ndemocracy.\n7\n\nThe joint action undertaken by ECOWAS, the\nUnited Nations and the development partners to deploy\nthe multinational force and ensure the maintenance of\npeace in Liberia should be supported and welcomed.\nThe establishment of this stabilization force has proved\nvital to facilitate the implementation of the\nComprehensive Peace Agreement, to make it possible\nto carry out a disarmament, demobilization and\nreintegration programme and to promote the return of\nrefugees and national reconciliation.\nHowever, my country remains convinced that the\nperpetrators of hateful crimes must answer for their\nacts. That is why we support unreservedly the decisions\nof the Special Court for Sierra Leone in its fight\nagainst impunity. That is a moral and political\nrequirement.\nIn C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, my delegation urges all the\nparties to pursue dialogue to implement effectively the\nLinas-Marcoussis Agreement, and thus achieve\nnational reconciliation.\nIn Guinea-Bissau, recent developments have\nmade even more fragile a situation that was already\nprecarious because of years of political instability and\neconomic crisis. My delegation appeals for the creation\nof better conditions for a rapid return to normal\nconstitutional life, which is vital to the recovery of that\nfraternal country.\nGuinea attaches great importance to the\nrestoration of lasting peace in our subregion. It has\npaid a heavy price in terms of instability, whose\nnegative consequences have impeded its progress.\nDespite a particularly difficult economic situation\nmarked by the drastic drop in bauxite and aluminium\nprices and the soaring price of petroleum, Guinea\ncontinues to tackle the burden of refugees and\ndisplaced persons. I wish to reiterate the Guinean\nGovernment\u2019s appeal to the donor community for\nincreased assistance in managing refugees and\ndisplaced persons and for strengthening the capacity of\nour country to pursue its programme to combat poverty\nwhile consolidating its democratic achievements.\nI would like to address the situation in the Great\nLakes region, where there are promising prospects. In\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, despite the\nhumanitarian crisis in the eastern part, considerable\nprogress has been made, particularly in the context of\nthe disengagement of foreign armed forces and current\ndemobilization and reintegration operations. We hope\nthat the Transitional Government of National Unity\nwill do its utmost to preserve the territorial integrity of\nthe country and to promote a return to normal\nconstitutional life.\nMy delegation appeals to the international\ncommunity to support the United Nations Organization\nMission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\n(MONUC) with the resources necessary to carry out its\nmandate, which has been enhanced by Security Council\nresolution 1493 (2003).\nIn Burundi, my delegation welcomes the\nencouraging results in the implementation of the\nArusha Agreement and calls on all parties to put an end\nto hostilities to strengthen the peace, which is still\nfragile, and to promote humanitarian assistance.\nIn the Central African Republic, my delegation\nappreciates the commitment of the new authorities to\npromote the return to constitutional legality in the\ncontext of consensual management.\nIn the Horn of Africa, the permanent and binding\ncommitment of Ethiopia and Eritrea concerning the\ndelimitation of borders is a prelude to the return to\npeace between the two countries. With regard to\nSomalia, my delegation hopes that the Mbagathi\nConference in Kenya will make it possible to overcome\npast contradictions and restore comprehensive\neverlasting peace.\nI cannot fail to address the thorny question of the\nWestern Sahara, which has mobilized the energies of\nthe international community for decades. The Republic\nof Guinea, which has always advocated a peaceful\nsettlement of the issue, remains convinced of the urgent\nneed for a political settlement under the auspices the\nUnited Nations \u2014 the only body that can guarantee a\nfair and lasting solution that is mutually acceptable to\nall parties.\nThe future of our continent is closely bound up\nwith international peace and security, and so we will\ncontinue to express our profound concern about\nconflicts that cause upheavals in other parts of the\nworld.\nFirst, in the Middle East, the appointment of\nPrime Minister Mahmoud Abbas, the publication of the\nQuartet\u2019s road map and the establishment of a\nunilateral cease-fire by the Palestinian armed groups\nhad given us grounds for hope. These hopes,\n8\n\nunfortunately, are threatened by the resumption of the\ncycle of violence. We have together a historic duty to\nsalvage peace. The international community and the\nQuartet must do everything to give a fresh impetus to\nthe dialogue between the parties. For their part,\nPalestinians and Israelis have the obligation to honour\ntheir respective commitments, in order to win mutual\ntrust.\nMy delegation is convinced that a comprehensive\nand lasting settlement of the crisis in the Middle East\nnecessarily involves tackling the Lebanese and Syrian\naspects and the implementation of the relevant\nresolutions of the Security Council. Guinea, which has\nalways been at the forefront in defending legitimate\nstruggles for just causes, hails the historic role of\nPresident Yasser Arafat in restoring the inalienable\nrights of the martyred people of Palestine. Here we\nreiterate our firm opposition to any attempt to\nundermine his political or physical integrity, and once\nagain send him our sympathy and support. We also\nencourage the new Prime Minister of Palestine, Mr.\nAhmed Qorei, to do his utmost to create favourable\nconditions for dialogue aiming at a durable resolution\nof the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nOn the question of Iraq, which is going through a\nphase that is crucial for its future, my delegation\nencourages the United Nations to continue and\nstrengthen its peace mission and its mission of\nreconstruction and humanitarian assistance so that the\nIraqis can quickly take charge of their country\u2019s destiny\nin unity and democracy.\nWith regard to Afghanistan, the international\ncommunity needs to step up its assistance, particularly\nin the area of security and development assistance, so\nas to give support to the Transitional Administration, in\nimplementation of the Bonn Agreement.\nMy delegation urges on the Korean peninsula the\nparties to pursue their efforts to achieve the peaceful\nand independent reunification of the two Koreas and to\nsettle the nuclear issue by dialogue.\nThe Guinean Government reaffirms its\ncommitment to the principle of a single China. It\nwelcomes the efforts being made by the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China to safeguard international peace and\nsecurity.\nConcerning the crisis in Cyprus, whose resolution\nis still bogged down, in spite of the Secretary-General\u2019s\ndetermination, we appeal to the parties to show\npolitical will, so that they may return to the negotiating\ntable on the basis of the revised plan.\nPoverty, armed conflicts, weapons of mass\ndestruction, terrorism, organized transnational crime\nand violations of human rights and international\nhumanitarian law, continue to be major obstacles to\npeace, security and development. Safeguarding\ninternational peace and security depends on our\ncommitment to eradicating the proliferation of small\narms and light weapons, as well as mercenary\nactivities, all of which fuel conflicts, particularly in\nAfrica.\nThis is all the more true since in July, in this very\nHall, Member States were able, at the First Biennial\nMeeting of States to Consider the Implementation of\nthe United Nations Programme of Action to Prevent,\nCombat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms\nand Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, were able to\ngauge the devastating effects of light weapons, whose\nmajor victims, unfortunately, continue to be women\nand children. My delegation reiterates the appeal by the\nEconomic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS) for adequate financial assistance to\neffectively implement the moratorium on small arms\nand light weapons. It also calls for effective\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 1467\n(2003), adopted at the end of the workshop organized\nby my country when it held the presidency of the\nCouncil in March 2003, on the theme \u201cProliferation of\nsmall arms and light weapons and mercenary activities:\nthreats to peace and security in West Africa.\u201d\nMindful of their primary responsibilities for the\nrecovery of the continent, African leaders are\ncontinuing their efforts in implementing the New\nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD)\neffectively. The commitments undertaken at the second\nsummit of African Union heads of State at Maputo are\npart of this process. Guinea welcomes the support of\nthe international community, particularly the G-8\ncountries for the African Union and its programme,\nNEPAD. We also welcome the initiatives taken by\ndevelopment partners to increase public assistance,\nrelieve debt and provide for improved access to\nmarkets.\nGuinea welcomes also the useful arrangements\nplanned by the United States, the European Union and\nJapan to combat the HIV/AIDS, malaria and\n9\n\ntuberculosis pandemics, as well as food insecurity.\nThese efforts, which we encourage, were undoubtedly\nstrengthened by the recent agreement at the World\nTrade Organization (WTO) enabling the poorest\ncountries to have access to generic drugs and thus to\ntackle the health tragedy of 6 million deaths annually\nas a result of those three pandemics alone.\nMy delegation, however, regrets the lack of\nconsensus at Canc\u00fan at the Fifth Ministerial\nConference of the WTO. We remain convinced that the\ninternational community will continue the debate,\naiming at further integration of the weaker economies\ninto the world trading system. We need to do our\nutmost to ensure that globalization is better managed\nand less iniquitous. The common good must be at the\nheart of our concerns.\nThe path ahead of us is still long and full of\npitfalls. The midterm review shows that, at least as far\nas Africa is concerned, there is not great optimism abut\nachieving the objectives of the Millennium\nDeclaration. We hope that the spirit of solidarity which\nis still developing at the level of the international\ncommunity can be translated into tangible acts and\ngalvanize everyone to action, so that future generations\nwill acknowledge our struggle to ensure the\ndevelopment of humankind. In order to achieve this,\nwe must reaffirm our unity and promote multilaterism\nto enable our common Organization to tackle the\nchallenges of peace, security and social and economic\nprogress.\nThe latest developments in the international\nsituation have demonstrated the extent to which the\nUnited Nations is still the unique framework for\nconsultation and concerted action in the management\nof world affairs. Strengthening the role and capacities\nof the United Nations is therefore more than ever\nessential in order to provide fair, lasting and equitable\nsolutions to issues of major importance. My delegation\nappreciates the efforts to reform the United Nations\nand revitalize the work of the General Assembly.\nIn this regard, we support the recommendation of\nthe Secretary-General concerning the setting up of a\nhigh-level panel to propose ways to strengthen the\nUnited Nations by reforming its institutions.\nAll these steps to help improve the effectiveness\nof the Organization must of course be underpinned by a\ngenuine reform of the Security Council so as to make\nits membership more representative. This will make it\npossible to enhance its transparency and give all States,\nlarge and small, the opportunity to find a voice there\nand thus make their due contribution to the building of\na renewed world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is my distinct honour,\non behalf of the Prime Minister, the Government and\nthe people of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, to\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at this, its fifty-\neighth session. We share in the celebration of the\nelection of a distinguished son of the Caribbean to steer\nthe course of this body for the next year. My delegation\npledges its full support to you and to the other\nmembers of the Bureau in the performance of that\nchallenging task. I also take this opportunity to\ncongratulate your predecessor, from the Czech\nRepublic, for his outstanding leadership of the fifty-\nseventh session. In addition, I should like to greet and\npay tribute to the Secretary-General, who continues to\nserve with great distinction, honour and exceptional\ncourage. My delegation salutes the Secretary-General\nfor the tremendous amount of work he has undertaken\nsince we last convened this body.\nI also wish to pause at this time to pay tribute to\nMr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, the late Special\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for Iraq, and to\nall other United Nations staff members who were killed\nor wounded in the deadly bombings of the United\nNations headquarters in Baghdad on 19 August and 22\nSeptember 2003. We feel that loss most deeply. For us,\nthe United Nations is paramount in ensuring the rule of\nlaw and justice in an increasingly complex world. An\nattack on the United Nations is an attack on the\nprinciples that bind us together as an international\ncommunity. We must stand firm against efforts to\nundermine those principles. There is no finer tribute to\nthose who lost their lives than to say today: Now, more\nthan ever before, we need the United Nations.\nSuch events remind us that the world is changing\ndramatically. It is imperative that we, as an\nOrganization, be able to respond to those changes\nquickly and appropriately. The Bahamas welcomes the\nongoing efforts to revitalize the General Assembly and\nto reform the Security Council. It is essential that those\nprincipal bodies be able to function effectively if we\nare to have any credibility and if we are to attain our\ngoals of maintaining international peace, security,\njustice and development.\nAs we are all too well aware, the process of\nreform of the Security Council has stalled, as we\n6\n\nremain deadlocked over critical issues. The time has\ncome for us to take hard decisions and to agree to a\npractical programme of reform that takes fully into\naccount the need for more representative membership\nas well as the need for a more democratic and\ntransparent Council. My delegation has raised those\nissues in a number of bilateral discussions with other\nconcerned States, and we look forward to working with\nthe presidency and with other delegations as we strive\nto rationalize the work of the entire Organization,\nwhile making it more transparent and accountable.\nWhile the problems in our own part of the world\nmay not have received as much international attention\nas have conflicts in other parts of the world, their\nresolution is of paramount importance to us. The\nCaribbean is our home, and we will spare no effort to\nprotect it against those who seek to destabilize the\nregion. The illegal transit of drugs, of weapons and of\nhuman beings is an affront to us and a serious\nchallenge to our national and regional security.\nThe Bahamas is grateful for the support that the\nregion has obtained from the international community\nin addressing these areas, but reminds Members that\nwe need to continue to be vigilant. We urge the\nAssembly to enhance its cooperation with the\nOrganization of American States (OAS), as that\nregional body strives to find solutions to difficult\nproblems involving territorial disputes between its\nmember States and as it seeks to promote human rights\nand to consolidate the foundations of democracy in a\nnumber of those States. In that context, we welcome\nthe OAS Special Mission for Strengthening Democracy\nin Haiti as a demonstration of the region\u2019s commitment\nto this field.\nThe Bahamas is strongly committed to the further\nstrengthening of international efforts to prevent,\ncombat and eliminate terrorism in all its ugly forms,\nand supports the work of the Ad Hoc Committee on the\nelaboration of a draft comprehensive convention on\ninternational terrorism. We are continuously reviewing\nour national legislation in order to strengthen it in\nthose areas, with particular emphasis on cracking down\non the financing of terrorism. Even now, a terrorism\nbill is before our Parliament. It will further strengthen\nthe laws that limit the ability of those who would\ncommit such acts to obtain monies to fund their\nactivities. The commitment of the Bahamas in this fight\nis unyielding.\nThe fight against the forces that would seek to\nundermine the rule of law in order to achieve political\nobjectives has forced each country to review its\ncommitment to freedom within and outside its borders\nand to determine how to protect the freedom that our\ncitizens so dearly cherish.\nLast year, in our address to the Assembly, the\nBahamas reminded this body that, in our quest for\nsecurity, we must not undermine the very values we\nwant to protect, preserve and defend. But it is clear that\nour conventions and established and respected\ntraditions are being challenged before our very eyes,\nand we must be careful to guard against this while\nensuring that all of us are safe.\nThe Caribbean as a whole is perhaps more\nsensitive than any other region to these issues of\nchange and the implications for the way of life that we\nenjoy, characterized as it is by an abiding respect for\nthe privacy of the individual. It should be remembered\nthat most of us in the region are small island\ndeveloping States, which are especially vulnerable in\nsecurity and economic issues. But, at the same time,\nour peoples are fiercely proud of our independence and\nthe traditions of freedom connected therewith.\nNowhere is the paradox of the pressure on our\nnow independent status more sensitive and apparent\nthan in the exercise of a presumptive legal authority by\na body of powerful, but faceless, un-elected\nbureaucrats, being advanced from some of the\ndeveloped world\u2019s multilateral bodies, which, in the\nview of many, threaten to re-impose the status of\ndependence, without calling it so by name, and thereby\nundermining our economies.\nIn that connection, the Bahamas is particularly\nconcerned, along with its regional neighbours, about\nthe threats to its way of life, in particular as it is\nunderpinned by the legitimate wealth creation in its\nfinancial services sector. There are those who argue\nthat the financial services sectors in our region\nundermine economic development and wealth creation\nin developed States, but we maintain that the evidence\nshows that the wealth accumulation facilitated by the\nfinancial services sectors in the region assists in the\nfurther development and economic growth of the\ndeveloped world. Our country is committed to fair and\nequitable trade in services on a level playing field with\nestablished rules, without ever-changing goal posts.\n7\n\nOver the next year, we shall endeavour to bring\nthis matter more clearly into focus by calling, in this\nand other assemblies, for the convening of a global\nforum on the pressures being applied to small and\nvulnerable States in ways that threaten the\nindependence of these countries and, which some\nargue, is unlawful interference in the internal affairs of\na nation-State. It is imperative that any rule-making\nforum on these issues be open to all Member States of\nthis body. Similarly, all rules emanating therefrom must\nbe equitably applied.\nAnd so, as we bring these matters to the attention\nof the world, we repeat the obvious. The fight against\ninternational terrorism must be a major focal point of\nthe Assembly, as should other matters such as the fight\nagainst HIV/AIDS, the protection of the environment\nand the sustainable development of our fragile\necosystems.\nThe Bahamas is committed to fighting on all of\nthese fronts. It is especially concerned about the future\nof the world\u2019s children and young people, as\nHIV/AIDS threatens to undermine decades and\ncenturies of progress in healthcare and in developing\nhealthy populations that facilitate economic growth\nthroughout the world. The Bahamas is a leader in the\nfight against HIV/AIDS in the region. We urge the\ncontinued and unrelenting fight against the disease, to\nrescue the world\u2019s developing nations from the clutches\nof this most recent scourge. It must take all of the\npolitical will and financial power of the world\u2019s nations\nto ensure that the scourge is brought under control and\nthen eliminated.\nThe Bahamas welcomes the outcome of the\nspecial session of the General Assembly on children,\nheld from 8 to 10 May 2002. We look forward to\nparticipating in the consideration of the follow-up to its\noutcome at this session. It is of critical importance that\nwe reaffirm our commitment to implementing the\nprovisions of the outcome document, \u201cBuilding a world\nfit for children\u201d, in the four priority areas of health,\neducation, protection of children from abuse,\nexploitation and violence, and combating HIV/AIDS.\nOur country and its people are especially concerned,\neven as I speak, about the safety and security, both\nphysical and economic, of children everywhere, but in\nparticular children in the Bahamas today, and about the\nneed to foster an atmosphere of love and care so that\nthey may grow into their rightful places in the adult\nworld.\nThe Bahamas, as do many of the small island\ndeveloping States, depends heavily on the environment,\nwhich is the natural beauty of the land, the sea and\nmarine life. Tourism is our lifeblood. For the region,\nthe natural environment is the primary source of\nsustenance and, therefore, we cannot allow our\nenvironment to be destroyed. Doing so threatens our\nvery survival. We are, therefore, acutely aware of the\nchallenges small island developing States face within\nthe context of achieving sustainable development. The\nsustainable development of our country therefore\nremains of critical importance to the Government and\nthus, we, as a matter of the highest priority, continue to\ntake steps to preserve and protect our environment.\nWe are also committed to working with all the\nother small island developing States and the other\nmembers of this Organization, civil society and all\nother concerned stakeholders, including non-\ngovernmental organizations, to ensure that the\nBarbados Programme of Action is fully implemented.\nIn that regard, the Bahamas welcomes the convening of\nthe international meeting to review the Barbados\nProgramme of Action, which is to take place in\nMauritius in 2004, and we are proud to host the\ninterregional preparatory meeting in Nassau, which\nwill be held prior to that, from 26 to 30 January 2004.\nIt is our hope that the renewed commitment to this\ninternational meeting by all Member States will take us\na step closer to honouring our commitment to the\nJohannesburg Plan of Implementation.\nIt is an inescapable fact that there can be no\nsocial or economic development without security. For\nmany of us in the Caribbean in particular, this security\nis being undermined by the activities of those\ntrafficking in illegal drugs and weapons. By virtue of\nits geographical position, the Bahamas continues to be\nan unwitting transit point for illegal activities,\nincluding the illicit trade in narcotic drugs and\npsychotropic substances. What is often overlooked by\nthose who are the consuming countries is that the\nBahamas neither produces these substances, nor does it\nproduce guns, nor is it the final destination for them.\nHowever, as a trans-shipment point, the Bahamas\nis suffering from a plethora of illegal activities\nassociated with this trade, including the deadly nexus\nbetween illicit drugs and the illicit trade in small arms\nand light weapons. These weapons, which are illegal in\nthe Bahamas, are contributing to an increase in violent\n8\n\ncrime in my country and they are undermining the\neconomic and social fabric of our nation.\nWe, therefore, welcome the convening of the first\nBiennial Meeting of States to consider the\nImplementation of the 2001 Programme of Action on\nSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, held\nin July of this year. At the same time, we call on\ndeveloped countries to take the same extraordinary\nmeasures they use in seeking to stop drug trafficking\ninto their countries, to stop illegal small arms from\nreaching our shores from their countries.\nWe believe that the Charter constitutes a viable\nand firm foundation on which the Organization can\nbalance and achieve its objectives \u2014 to maintain\ninternational peace and security and promote economic\nand social progress. I wish to reaffirm the Bahamas\u2019\ncommitment to the principles enshrined in that\nuniversal document, which will stand as a guiding\nbeacon as we continue to chart a rocky, yet crucial,\ncourse towards peace, security and sustainable\ndevelopment for all of the world\u2019s inhabitants. While\nprogress may seem meagre, we must not be swayed\nfrom our course, and we must remain confident that the\nbenefits of our activities and efforts will redound to\nfuture generations. Now more than ever, the world\nneeds the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOnce again,\nI am delighted to have this opportunity to address this\nrepresentative audience. At the outset, however, I\nshould like to wish the fifty-eighth session of the\nGeneral Assembly fruitful work \u2014 work to\nsuccessfully harmonize the actions of peoples and\nStates; work on behalf of peace, security and progress.\nThose purposes were set out in the Charter of the\nUnited Nations by our predecessors, but, as we can see,\nthey are still relevant. Even now, they provide a solid,\nlong-term foundation for the activities of the United\nNations. And, although the structure and the functions\nof the Organization took shape in an international\nenvironment fundamentally different from ours, time\nhas only reaffirmed their universal importance. Today,\nthe instruments of the United Nations are not merely in\ndemand; they are, as life itself has shown, simply\nirreplaceable in crucial situations.\nThat has been made abundantly clear by the\nfollowing important fact: despite sharp differences\nconcerning how to resolve the Iraq crisis, the situation\nis ultimately returning to the legal sphere of the United\nNations. Russia\u2019s position in that regard is consistent\nand clear. Only direct United Nations participation in\nIraq\u2019s reconstruction will enable Iraq\u2019s people to decide\ntheir future. And only with active and \u2014 I want to stress\nthis \u2014 practical United Nations assistance in Iraq\u2019s\neconomic and civil transformation will Iraq assume a\ntruly new and worthy place in the world community.\nIt is clear that, in recent years, the United Nations\nhas increasingly been obliged to carry out\nfundamentally new tasks and to tackle threats that are\ndifferent from, but just as serious as, those it faced\nbefore. Three years ago, at the 2000 Millennium\nSummit, I said here that the common enemy of the\nUnited Nations was terrorism. Was Russia\u2019s voice\nheeded then? Did everyone understand the seriousness\nof the threat, and were our joint actions adequate? The\nevents of 11 September proved that, unfortunately, they\nwere not.\nTo us in Russia, however, the style of the\nmurderers who committed terrorist acts in Moscow, in\nChechnya and elsewhere in Russia and in New York, as\nwell as against United Nations staff in Baghdad, has\nlong been painfully familiar. That style is identical\neverywhere, and the fact that the inciters of terror are\neasily recognizable \u2014 with regard to both the events of\nAugust this year and the terrorist attacks of previous\nyears \u2014 only attests to the global nature of this threat.\nIt is true that now we are listening to one another.\nAnd we understand that the United Nations must\nbecome \u2014 and is indeed becoming \u2014 the basis for a\nglobal anti-terrorist coalition. Here, I wish to take\nparticular note of the Security Council\u2019s Counter-\nTerrorism Committee. Terrorism is a challenge to the\nplanet\u2019s security and to its economic future. Therefore,\nthe Committee must become a real and practical\ninstrument for effectively fighting the terrorist threat.\nI should like to focus in particular on the\nhumanitarian activities of the United Nations. That area\nconsumes the lion\u2019s share of the Organization\u2019s energy,\ntime and resources, but it does not always appear in the\nheadlines, nor is it always familiar to the citizens of the\nmore prosperous States. But it is precisely that area of\nUnited Nations work that is so fundamental and\nirreplaceable. The United Nations is helping millions\nof destitute people throughout the world \u2014 victims of\nhunger, of disease and of conflict \u2014 to survive and not\nto lose hope. That work is exceptionally important; it\nlends indisputable political and moral authority to the\nentire Organization. And it is here that the\ninterrelationship between the moral and political content\nof international activities is particularly evident.\nI should like to take this opportunity to thank all\nstaff members of the United Nations, all non-\ngovernmental organizations and, of course, the many\nvolunteers who are participating in this noble work.\nBecause we understand how valuable the\nOrganization\u2019s humanitarian mission is, Russia views it\nas a major political endeavour. We are already\ncontributing to this work, and we are committed to\nincreasing our contribution. Over the past three years,\nRussia has forgiven a total of $27.2 billion in debt of\n5\n \ndeveloping countries, and we are currently granting\nsignificant tariff preferences to such countries.\nFor the first time in many years, as our country\nhas grown, it has become a donor to the United Nations\nWorld Food Programme. The horrors of starvation are\nwell known to us from our own history. As a result of\nthe civil war of the past century and the forced\ncollectivization of the 1920s and 1930s, millions of\npeople died of starvation in the Volga region, in Northern\nCaucasus and in other parts of our country. Hunger\nbecame a national tragedy for the peoples of Ukraine as\nwell. We consider it our moral and ethical duty to\nexpand our participation in food aid programmes.\nRussia intends to work actively to resolve acute\nenvironmental problems. A milestone will be achieved\nin that area by the World Conference on Climate\nChange, scheduled to convene next week in Russia\u2019s\ncapital, Moscow. We also believe it is essential that a\nglobal system be established to monitor and neutralize\ndangerous infectious diseases, and we consider the\nwork done by the Global Fund to be a real\ndemonstration of international solidarity in fighting the\nspread of AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.\nOf course, the United Nations, like any system\nwith a complex structure, needs to be improved. But\nthe Organization\u2019s past and current problems have never\nbeen problems of only the Organization per se; they have\nalways been created by \u2014 and they continue to reflect \u2014\ncontradictions in the very system of international\nrelations, particularly the system of international law.\nAfter all, politicians, including those represented in the\nUnited Nations, including the Security Council, do not\nalways have at their disposal adequate and effectively\nfunctioning legal instruments \u2014 instruments that would\nenable them to deal effectively with the international and\nregional crises that arise. International law must, of\ncourse, be fluid and living, reflecting the realities of\nthe contemporary world. I believe that many of the\nprocesses that are under way within the United Nations\nalso attest to the constant changes that are taking place\nin the world. Such changes dictate a logic of evolution\nin the United Nations.\nMembers of the Organization know very well\nthat, as a rule, all of the achievements of the United\nNations are shared successes, and that our failures are\nshared miscalculations. Such knowledge, however,\nbrings with it great responsibility. First and foremost,\nwe must be extremely careful about interfering with the\nfabric \u2014 the mechanisms \u2014 of the work of the United\nNations. Clearly, behind any such decision there should\nbe more than general political rhetoric \u2014 mere words\nabout so-called fair policies.\nI am convinced that any attempt to modernize\nUnited Nations instruments must be preceded by\nserious analysis and careful calculation. Such an\napproach should be taken, first and foremost, with\nregard to the principal international legal instruments.\nAfter all, guaranteeing that they remain effective is the\nonly way to avoid a legal vacuum. As long as the\nnorms of international law remain unchanged and\noperative, we must observe them. We must ensure\ncontinuity of security guarantees for States and for the\nworld as a whole.\nWe must analyse United Nations structures and\nmechanisms and try to understand which have proved\neffective and productive, as well as which have done\nthe job they were intended to do and which now remain\nunused. We should remember that much of the\npotential of the United Nations has still to be tapped.\nThere are many resources that we are only now\nlearning how to use.\nI would like in particular to comment on the need\nto enhance the effectiveness of the Security Council. I\nam convinced that, given the deep-rooted nature of the\ncurrent differences of opinion and the importance of\nensuring that the Council remain effective, we must\nwork gradually and very cautiously.\nWe believe that at this stage we should be guided\nabove all by the broadest possible agreement on all\naspects of the expansion of the Council, as well as by\nthe need to ensure that it maintains its current high\nstatus and the legitimacy born of agreed actions. After\nall, the Security Council, as the Charter makes clear,\nacts on behalf of the United Nations. The Security\nCouncil is endowed with a specific mechanism for\nharmonizing political will and for protecting the\nnational interests of a great variety of States, and,\nthrough this, the interests of the entire international\ncommunity.\nIt is true that we often hear that the developed\ncountries bear special responsibility for the destiny of\nthe world. Such leadership, however, entails major\nobligations, primarily to ensure that the interests of the\ninternational community as a whole are reflected.\nBeing a world Power means working together with the\nworld community. Being a truly strong, influential\n6\n \nState means seeing and helping to resolve the problems\nof small and economically weak countries.\nIn that connection, I believe that it would be\nuseful to intensify the work that is being carried out by\nthe United Nations in cooperation with the regional\ninternational structures. That will lead directly towards\nincreased economic prosperity in various parts of the\nworld, and thus contribute to the containment of\npotential threats and the maintenance of a common\nglobal strategic balance.\nWe welcome the emergence of regional centres\nfor coordination and cooperation in a united Europe.\nWe favour the strengthening of integration processes in\nthe Asia-Pacific region. And of course, we support the\nwork of the Commonwealth of Independent States\n(CIS), as well as that of the Collective Security Treaty\nOrganization and the Shanghai Cooperation\nOrganization, whose authority and effectiveness are\ncontinuing to grow.\nRussia is not the only country that is interested in\nregional integration. Our CIS partners have also\ndemonstrated their practical commitment to that same\ngoal. This was reaffirmed during the recent CIS\nsummit. We consider the development of our\ninteraction with the European Union, which is\nmultifaceted in nature, to be important. Likewise, with\nregard to security issues, we attach importance to the\nsearch new forms of cooperation with the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization.\nWe should counter current threats to civilization\nonly by means of collective responses whose legitimacy\nis not in doubt. In this respect, we need a systemic vision\nthat combines political with, when necessary, military\nmeasures. Such measures should be agreed upon in\nadvance, and be sensible and appropriate.\nThe need to improve the peacekeeping\nmechanisms of the United Nations remains on the\nOrganization\u2019s agenda. The United Nations must be\nable to deploy peacekeeping \u2014 and, where necessary,\npeace-enforcement \u2014 operations more quickly and\nefficiently, in strict compliance with the United Nations\nCharter. I should like to note that Russia, which has\nalways supported the peacekeeping functions of the\nOrganization, is prepared to step up its participation in\nsuch operations, both under United Nations auspices\nand in coalition operations authorized by the Security\nCouncil.\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\nand their delivery systems remains a serious challenge\nto the modern world. The most dangerous challenge is\nthe possibility of their falling into the hands of\nterrorists. We know what steps must be taken in order\nto eliminate such threats. These include the further\nuniversalization of the existing non-proliferation\nregimes, the strengthening of international verification\ninstruments and the introduction of safe technologies in\nnuclear energy production. In general, this requires the\nrenunciation by States of excessive arsenals and\nmilitary programmes that could undermine the political\nand military balance and trigger an arms race.\nRussia believes that it is extremely important to\nprevent the militarization of outer space. We believe\nthat a comprehensive agreement should be elaborated\non this issue, and invite all countries possessing\npotential in this area to join our initiative. The Russian\ninitiative to set up, under the auspices of the United\nNations, a global system to counter these new threats has\nalready been supported by the General Assembly. We\npropose the adoption of a new resolution during this\nsession setting out specific further steps in this direction.\nIn conclusion, I should like to recall that the solid\nstructure of the United Nations has enabled it to\nwithstand all of the many crises of the second half of\nthe twentieth century. It has helped to overcome threats\nof global confrontation and, most importantly, helped\nto promote human rights. It has also helped to assert\nthe principles of mutual respect and good-neighbourliness\namong States. The main thrust of the United Nations\napproach is that humankind has no alternative but to\njointly construct a safer, fairer and more prosperous\nworld. That is our duty to succeeding generations. In\nthat important task we can have no better help than\nsuch time-tested instruments as the work of the United\nNations, an Organization that, for half a century, took\ndecisions that were crucial for the entire world.\nRussia is convinced that the United Nations must\nmaintain its central role in international affairs. This is\nparticularly relevant, and particularly important, for\nresolving conflict situations. This is our choice and our\nstrategic position of principle.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to congratulate the President on his election\nas President of this session of the General Assembly.\nWe wish him every success.\nAt the same time, it is a pleasure to greet the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, whose efforts for\npeace and cooperation between nations we highly\nvalue. For that reason, I take this opportunity to\nexpress, on behalf of the people of Bolivia and my\nGovernment, our sorrow and solidarity in the face of\nthe terrorist attacks against the United Nations\nheadquarters in Baghdad, which once again\ndemonstrates intolerance for and lack of understanding\nof a peacekeeping mission, which is the only possible\npath in our search to resolve conflicts.\nThis attempt strengthens our resolve to fight\nwithout giving any quarter against terrorism in any of\nits forms, but, at the same time, it shows us the need to\nsupport the joint efforts of the nations of the world\nwith policies that are debated and adopted at the United\nNations. This Organization and its bodies are a\nfundamental forum where our voice and that of all\ncountries of the world can be heard. For that reason, we\nalso believe that reforms are required to give the\nSecurity Council more flexibility and balance in order\nto guarantee greater participation in the decision-\nmaking process.\nThe terrible episodes that we have recently\nexperienced have forced us once again to reconsider\nthe path that many nations have set for themselves in\ntheir vision for development. It is a dangerous mistake\nto believe that we can coexist in a world of isolated and\nclosed compartments. It is not possible to generate\ngrowth and well-being for a privileged few and expect\nthat the excluded great majority will look on silently\nfrom the fringes of that reality. In our opinion, the only\npossible path to confront the future is the paradigm of\nequity.\nFor over a half century, Bolivia has been opening\ndemocratic and participative spaces for its people. A\nnation such as ours, where 62 per cent of the citizens\nidentify themselves as indigenous, must do away with\nthe social, economic and ethnic exclusion that has been\na historic millstone that our elite refused to eliminate.\nThe process begun by us with the revolution of 1952\nwith its successes and set-backs of greater or lesser\nmagnitude is part of our challenge today. This vision is\nalso essential to defending the human rights of those\ncitizens who have been marginalized throughout the\ncourse of our history.\nFor one year now, under the administration\nheaded by President Sanchez de Lozada, within the\nframework of a pluralistic Congress with a very\nsignificant percentage of indigenous representatives\nand of very different ideological positions, we are\nworking to overcome levels of poverty that are\nthreatening to break down the buttresses of order and\nthe population\u2019s faith in democracy, which has been\nachieved with great sacrifice by the people of Bolivia.\nOur Government has broadened its political base\nby integrating another political party, Nueva Fuerza\n26\n\nRepublicana, into the alliance between the Movimiento\nNacionalista Revolucionario and the Movimiento de la\nIzquierda Revolucionaria in an effort to face an acute\neconomic crisis that has taken the form of a persistent\nrecession, which, fortunately, is beginning to reverse\nitself.\nWe have implemented a programme that\ncombines efforts to increase State revenues through an\nincrease in public investment in order to stimulate the\neconomy and improve private contribution, create jobs\nand decrease social inequality. We have given priority\nto the most vulnerable sectors of our society with\nmeasures such as an annual solidarity bonus for all\ncitizens over age 65 and the consolidation of free\nmedical insurance covering mothers and children under\nthe age of five. This task is linked to achieving the\nMillennium Development Goals, to which we are\ndeeply committed.\nIn February of this year and a few days ago, my\ncountry lived through serious episodes of violence,\nwhich have forced us to reflect. We are aware of the\nfact that the last 21 years of democracy \u2014 the longest\nuninterrupted period in our history \u2014 are at stake as\nwe face the legitimate pressure exercised by the\nmarginalized sectors of our society, who deserve our\nattention. Unfortunately, in spite of the new democratic\nparliamentary participation, we have not yet been able\nto sustain a real and enriching dialogue about our most\nsevere problems. I am convinced that one of our\nprincipal tasks is to generate a fundamental change in\nthe behaviour of political parties and of every\npolitician, but a less radical and more rational attitude\nof the social sectors in their relationship with the State\nis also indispensable.\nWe are going through a very difficult time, when\ncompliance with the law and respect for the authority\nof the State threaten to collapse. Loss of trust in these\nessential elements of democracy is one of the greatest\ndangers to the future of our society, which will only\nachieve its goals if it has a credible and legitimate\nadministration that acts with authority. We are\nassuming our responsibility in this area. It is the only\nway we can be tolerant of the ideas of others. Our aim\nis the urgent search for a true national encounter\nthrough national dialogue, an issue that we are deeply\ncommitted to, despite the difficulties that must be\novercome.\nOne year ago, in this very forum, I said that our\nGovernment would make the fight against corruption a\nState policy. Today I am proud to say that we are\nfulfilling that commitment. We have established the\nSecretariat to Combat Corruption, whose tasks are\ncarried out from within the very core of the State, with\nbroad participation from all levels of society, through\ncitizen networks and mobile brigades. In one year of\nwork, we have made public cases of corruption\ninvolving State authorities. Corrupt civil servants have\nbeen given prison sentences and others are currently on\ntrial for illicit acts. Furthermore, we have expanded the\nprogrammes for better management of public entities.\nWe are launching a reform of the judiciary,\nstrengthening a culture in which the rule of law is\nbased on the concept of justice for all. We are also\npromoting a strategy that will transform political and\nproductive institutions, especially those of the informal\nsector, and promoting governance that is compatible\nwith fair human development opportunities.\nOur commitment to fighting illicit drug\ntrafficking remains unchanged. For our country, this\ntask has meant high social, political and economic\ncosts, paid for with the blood of the Bolivian people.\nThe support of the international community in this\nfight has been an incentive and a security factor.\nHowever, our efforts require further support,\nproportional to the scope of its effect, in Bolivia as\nwell as in those societies where drug consumption\nremains a priority problem to be solved. We shall\ncontinue to honour our commitments, but we shall also\ncontinue to insist that the international community\nfully assume the concept of shared responsibility.\nFor Bolivia, international assistance represents an\ninvaluable support. From this rostrum, I wish to thank\nthe nations and organizations that offer their\ncooperation, but I emphasize the fact that the most\neffective assistance is that which respects the decisions\nand plans of those countries that receive it. Imposing\nrigid and unilateral prescriptions often generates more\nproblems than it solves.\nOur continent, Latin America, has seen its role in\nthe international concert diminished. The continent\nfaces several core problems, one of which is the siege\nof its own democracy by poverty, corruption, inequality\nand a globalization process of which it is part, but that\nhas not always generated positive results for the area.\nIntegration is the only possible solution if we wish to\nface the future with optimism. Bolivia is working\n27\n\ndiligently in this direction, not only because it is a part\nof subregional blocs, such as the Andean Community\nand the Common Market of the South \u2014 of which it is\nan associate member \u2014 but also because it promotes\nthe integration of both regional groups into one South\nAmerican body that will provide greater benefits and\ntargeted influence in the region. As hosts for the\nthirteenth Ibero-American Summit of Heads of State\nand Government, Bolivia is working for the genuine\nstrengthening of that mechanism, which unites the\nheads of State and Government of a group of countries\nwhose cultural, political and economic importance\nthroughout the world is continuously growing.\nIn this context, the decisions that will be made to\nestablish the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas\nmust seek a still uncertain balance for the group of\nmember countries, taking into account the enormous\ngap between the first Power in the world and the\npoorest nations of the continent, in a way that will truly\nbenefit everybody. This will be possible if and when,\nbeyond trade issues, we prioritize the transport and\ncommunications infrastructures, science, the transfer of\ntechnology and education.\nThe difficulties emerging from the worldwide\ndebate on international trade are proof once again of\nthe gap to be closed between rich and poor nations. If\nequity is the foremost exigency of mankind, the only\ntrue and effective response in order to achieve it is a\nfair trade agreement. Poor countries demand access for\nour products to wealthy countries under fair conditions.\nThis urgent claim is linked to a sustained policy of\nsubsidies and protectionism for key production sectors\non the part of the most developed nations. Herein lies\none of the basic causes of poverty and social tensions\nin the least favoured societies.\nThe issue of anti-personnel mines is a very\nsensitive one for Bolivia, not only as a matter of\nprinciple \u2014 inasmuch as these lethal artefacts continue\nto kill or permanently maim people throughout the\nworld \u2014 but also because many such mines have been\nplanted along our borders. We vehemently request the\nGovernments responsible for planting these mines to\ncontinue their removal and destruction until the areas\ninvolved are totally free of mines.\nToday, more than ever, I wish to confirm before\nthis Assembly that Bolivia will never waive its just\nclaim of sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean,\ninasmuch as we were established as an independent\nrepublic with a sea coast. This claim, which we have\nbeen making for over a century, is a product not of\nstubbornness or caprice, but of the lack of economic\nresources and huge geographic obstacles that\nundermine our ability to compete. Our landlocked\ncondition is a deterrent to our growth and the well-\nbeing of our citizens, as proven by the analysis of the\nchallenges faced by all landlocked countries.\nReintegration of our condition as a maritime nation is a\nmatter of justice and we cannot set it aside. We will\ntherefore continue to call for solidarity and support\nfrom the community of nations. Our vocation and our\ndestiny to be integrated with and economically\ncomplemented by our neighbours compels us to exhort\nthe Government and people of Chile to act with a view\nto the future and to repair a historical wrong that has\nanchored Bolivia to the past century.\nWe are living through difficult times, complex\nand full of uncertainty. It is our obligation to stop and\nquestion the validity of many of the premises in which\nwe believe. No question and no form of questioning is\nsuperfluous at a time such as this, in which the search\nfor a clearer and fair horizon is a life or death necessity\nfor our planet.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe delegation of the Republic of Equatorial\nGuinea joins preceding delegations in congratulating\nthe President on his election to preside over the work\nof the fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly of\nthe United Nations. We know that it is a very difficult\ntask, Sir, because it is your task to organize the debates\nof this the greatest deliberative organ of the United\nNations at a time when the Organization   and the\ninternational community   are experiencing a crisis\nunprecedented in its history.\nHowever, Sir, we have confidence in your\npolitical and diplomatic ability and in the maturity and\nprudence of your country in dealing with international\nproblems; thus we are optimistic that our deliberations\nwill meet with the greatest success.\nWe also congratulate Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan on his tireless efforts to ensure that the United\nNations fulfils its mission of peace in the various\narmed conflicts, its humanitarian action in response to\nthe disasters affecting many countries and its efforts to\npromote peace negotiations and multiple forms of\ncooperation in order to achieve sustainable\ndevelopment in the world.\nThe Republic of Equatorial Guinea expresses\nbefore the Assembly its serious concern at the current\ninternational situation, which is manifestly affecting\ninternational peace and security, which the United\nNations was created to safeguard. Indeed, since the end\nof the cold war, which gave rise to hope for a more\nunited, cooperative, integrated and peaceful world of\ngreater solidarity, it has seemed that the principle rules\ngoverning international relations have been steadily\nlosing force, with the risk that each State will act\naccording to its own will.\nThe concepts of democracy, human rights and\ntechnical cooperation and assistance are being misused\nto the detriment of some, and are being exploited to the\nbenefit of others. The concept of democracy, which is\nunderstood as governing according to the will of each\npeople, has today been transformed into a demand\nimposed by certain States in violation of the universal\nprinciple that every State is free to adopt the political\nsystem that best suits it. Furthermore, the principles of\nState sovereignty and non-interference in the internal\naffairs of other States, enshrined in international law,\nhave been violated in recent years under the pretext of\nthe need for humanitarian intervention, which are often\nconducted without United Nations approval.\nThe efforts to establish a new international\neconomic order that ensures cooperation for global\ndevelopment have ended in the division of the world\ninto North and South, and political conditions are now\nbeing imposed on the cooperative assistance that is\n17\n\noffered. Efforts towards the globalization of economic\npolicies have not recognized the weak position of\nunderdeveloped countries, which suffer grave\ndisadvantages in participating and competing in the so-\ncalled globalization of the world. We believe that the\npolicy of globalization needs to include a special\nprogramme for the sustainable development of\ndeveloping countries in order to help them attain the\nlevel of maturity necessary to benefit from such an\nintegration. In all these efforts to achieve international\ncooperation for global development, there are good\nintentions, but the decisive will needed to build a fairer\nand more equitable world has been lacking.\nMeanwhile, the situation of the weakest countries\ndeteriorates, the economic crisis worsens, political\nupheaval spreads and Governments are taking a harsher\nstance to protect their power.\nInternal warfare, mercenaries and terrorism are\ntaking root because, as occurred in the Middle Ages,\nthe people cannot bear hunger and poverty and are\ndriven to civil disobedience. At the same time, the\nUnited Nations is losing its authority because its\ndecision-making organs are not democratic, and its\ncapacity for humanitarian assistance falls short because\nof the proliferation of disasters caused by wars and acts\nof terrorism.\nIn our opinion, and most regrettably, humanity is\nalready dehumanized and the United Nations has lost\nits authority. We must now shoulder the responsibility\nof rebuilding our policies and of morally rebuilding the\nOrganization and restoring its authority. It is the only\nworld body capable of representing humanity with\nauthority and the only one in which we can achieve\nuniversal consensus.\nIt is here that we can fight terrorism and\norganized crime, because everything is listened to and\neverything is discussed in this forum. The use of\nweapons against terrorism could turn us into terrorists\nourselves. Thus my delegation naturally and\nenergetically condemns the terrorist attack against the\nUnited Nations headquarters in Baghdad, which caused\nthe death of the Special Representative of the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, and\nthose of some 30 staff working in the service of peace.\nWe express our deep condolences at the loss of those\nnoble workers in the service of humanity. We therefore\nbelieve that now is the time to adopt strategies so that\nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions will not be\nconfused with any interests other than the peaceful\nsettlement of hostilities.\nAs for my country, Equatorial Guinea is faithful\nto its commitments as a full-fledged Member of the\nUnited Nations and a member of the African Union,\ncommitted to the maintenance of peaceful relations of\nfriendship and cooperation with other countries. We\nrespect the sovereignty, national unity, territorial\nintegrity and inalienable rights of other States within\ntheir borders, and we favour the promotion of the\nsocio-political development of nations.\nIn that connection, Equatorial Guinea is a party to\nall international conventions that protect the political,\neconomic and sociocultural rights of peoples.\nDemocracy, as the consensus of the people, is a reality\nin which our country is immersed, with the coexistence\nof the 13 political parties that constitute it, observing\nthe commitments of the binding national political pact\nbetween the Government and the opposition.\nUndoubtedly, today the formation of a broad-based\nGovernment is the greatest exponent of peace and\npolitical stability that my country has ever known.\nIn order to ensure such internal political\nconsensus and cooperation with other countries and\ninternational organizations, we believe that\ntransparency is absolutely necessary, because it\nbenefits all parties. Equatorial Guinea offers open and\nunrestricted cooperation to everyone, on the basis of\ntransparent action, for everyone's mutual benefit.\nNevertheless, we are aware that our possibilities are\nvery limited as far as acquiring modern technology and\nlaying the foundations for sustained and sustainable\nand development are concerned. Therefore, we request\ninternational cooperation in that regard from friendly\ncountries and from international assistance\norganizations.\nI conclude by expressing the hope that the United\nNations will recover its leadership in promoting the\npeace and development of our world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I am confident that\nhis wisdom, as expressed in the policies of his friendly\ncountry, will promote constructive dialogue among\nMember States. In the final analysis, constructive\ndialogue remains the most valid means of addressing\nthe complex problems currently facing the international\ncommunity.\nIt also gives me great pleasure to express to the\nSecretary-General and his staff our sincere appreciation\nfor the effort they have made and the hardships they\nhave endured in preserving the status of this\nOrganization, and for not submitting to attempts to\nmarginalize it in the international arena. It is with deep\nsorrow that we recall the great loss that the United\nNations in general, and the friendly country of Brazil in\nparticular, suffered as a result of the death of\n8\n\nMr. Sergio Vieira de Mello and his colleagues in the\nattack against the United Nations headquarters in\nBaghdad last month.\nMany leaders and other representatives of the\npeoples of the world have gathered together at this\ninternational forum. That in itself proves beyond any\ndoubt that this edifice of international legitimacy, and\nthe resolutions that are adopted here, remain the most\nacceptable and respectable political recourse available\nto the various countries of the world, be they large or\nsmall, rich or poor. This is the only forum in which it\nwould be extremely difficult to pass an arbitrary or pre-\nemptive war resolution that would result in the deaths\nof innocent civilians and the destruction of their\nproperty.\nOur world today faces daunting challenges that\nthreaten the very foundation of the system of\ninternational peace and security. World leaders are\ntherefore called upon to make a sincere and concerted\neffort and to demonstrate unwavering political will to\ncommit themselves once again to the principles of\ninternational legitimacy. Giving precedence to the logic\nof force, violating the sovereignty of nations and taking\nactions that affect people's future compromise\nlegitimacy and the principle of equality. Such policies\nrepresent a miscarriage of justice and an abrogation of\nthe rule of law. They will open the door to widespread\nchaos in international relations and to crises that might\nbe more dangerous than those we are currently facing.\nMy country believes that the failure to reap the\noptimal benefits of the remarkable scientific and\ntechnological advances that humanity has made in the\npast two decades, coupled with the failure to achieve\nglobalization with a civilized, human face, have\nalienated our peoples and heightened their\napprehensions. It has obstructed the dialogue among\ncivilizations and blocked further interaction with other\ncultures. Attempts by some centres of power in the\nworld to manipulate the profound changes that have\ntaken place in the international balance of power in\npursuit of narrow national interests have added insult\nto injury. Cards have been shuffled and premises have\nbeen challenged. New concepts that are totally alien to\nthe Charter, such as pre-emptive war and unilateral and\nillegitimate use of force, have been invented. In brief,\nthat course of action has turned the clock back  \ncontrary to the superficial claims that new prospects\nwere actually being opened.\nIt is regrettable that in the twenty-first century\nsome think tanks provide decision-makers with\nmisleading or false information on the basis of which\nwars are waged outside the context of international\nlegitimacy and blood is shed. Accusations are made\nthat completely lack credibility, and unbridled claims\nare advanced in deliberate disregard of any logic\ndeveloped by States and peoples throughout their\nhistory.\nOur region   the cradle of the divine religions\nand the storehouse of two thirds of the world's oil\nreserves   has been victimized more than any other,\nsuffering greater injustice, being subjected to more\ndisinformation campaigns and enduring greater use of\nforce than any other region. It has to endure a great\nmany external threats that continually lay waste its\npotential and its material and intellectual resources. No\nsooner had the peoples of the region begun to enjoy\ntheir freedom and independence than they found\nthemselves once again faced with violent and unjust\nchallenges   challenges that are worse than any they\nhave known throughout their history.\nThe scourge of the Israeli occupation and\ncontinued Israeli aggression has been the main reason\nfor the suffering of our region since the concept of\ninternational legitimacy first emerge in the\ninternational community. That is the concept on which\nthe Organization was founded and which it came to\nepitomize. There is a profound paradox that has\nbecome the hallmark of our region. Israel was the first\nState to acquire its legitimacy through a resolution\nadopted by the United Nations, yet Israel was also the\nfirst State to ride roughshod over international\nlegitimacy   and it has continued to do so to the\nextent that Arabs and many others around the world\nfeel as if Israel were a country above the law, one that\nenjoys the same veto power in the Security Council as\nthe United States.\nIt is regrettable that, after decades of occupation,\nbloodshed and contempt for international legitimacy,\nthe representative of Israel has yet to realize that the\nroad to peace lies in Israel's implementation of the 37\nSecurity Council resolutions on the Arab-Israeli\nconflict and the nearly 600 General Assembly\nresolutions on the same subject, all of which have so\nfar remained hostage to Israeli defiance of international\nlaw.\n9\n\nIt behoved the Israeli Foreign Minister to explain\nin his statement to the international community in this\nHall a few days ago the reasons for his country's\nrefusal to implement this enormous number of\nresolutions of international legitimacy on the Middle\nEast, instead of ignoring them, considering them null\nand void, items of the past. Are the Syrians, the\nLebanese and the Palestinians unrealistic in their\ndemands, or are they asking for the impossible when\nthey stress that the only way out of the spiral of\nviolence and bloodshed is through ending the Israeli\noccupation of the Arab territories occupied since June\n1967, through negotiations to pursue a comprehensive,\njust and lasting peace on the basis of implementing\nUnited Nations resolutions and the Arab Summit peace\ninitiative adopted at Beirut in 2002?\nThe nagging core question here is how much\nlonger Israel continue can to mislead some into\nbelieving that it is being victimized while it continues\nto occupy the territory of others by force, lay siege to\nPalestinians, destroy their homes, uproot their trees and\nassassinate them in their occupied land. When did the\nvictims of occupation, settler colonialism and\npopulation transfer become outlaws and terrorists\nwithout a just cause, whose killing by fighter jets and\ntank fire became sanctioned under the pretext of self-\ndefence?\nSome people in Washington have asked Why do\nthey hate us?' Some authors with ulterior motives, or\nself-proclaimed pundits writing for reputable American\nnewspapers or appearing on famous television\nprogrammes, volunteer their answers: They hate us\nbecause we have skyscrapers and noble values.' They\nchoose to ignore that what is hated are the flawed\npolicies, and not the country and its beautiful\nlandmarks and cherished cultural and humanitarian\nvalues.\nThe grave situation in Iraq has become a source\nof serious concern for our people, who are already\nplagued by Israeli occupation and continued threats\nagainst them. The situation is also a major cause of\nconcern for the international community due to the\nthreat it poses to international peace and security. The\ncredibility of our Organization suffered greatly when\nthe United Nations was unable to prevent the war\nagainst Iraq, a war waged outside the context of\ninternational legitimacy.\nFor weeks and months, the Security Council was\ndrawn into bitter strife, debating the war resolution\nprior to the war. The marathon report of the inspectors\ncame out before the inspectors had accomplished the\ntasks entrusted to them. That situation notwithstanding,\nmost of the members of the Council were able to stay\nthe course, upholding international legitimacy and the\nCharter. The war was ultimately waged outside the\nframework of international legitimacy and those\nmembers chose not to its burden.\nAlong with other neighbouring countries, Syria\nremained committed to the principles of international\nlegitimacy and the Charter. In an unprecedented\nd\u00c8marche, our countries unanimously stressed their\ncommon concern that, should this war break out, its\nrepercussions on regional security and international\npeace would be more devastating than the precarious\nsituation prevailing in Iraq at the time.\nThat said, Syria does not base its foreign policy\non hatred, nor do we gloat over the misfortunes of\nothers. We do not redefine our policy in response to\nthreats either. The real challenge, we believe is how to\nextricate Iraq from this predicament and mobilize all\nefforts to win the battle for peace in post-war Iraq.\nOur country is directly concerned with\ndevelopments in Iraq, given our historical and\ngeographic ties and our common national loyalties to\nthe Iraqi people. Syria affirms that finding the way out\nof this predicament does not lie in focusing on\naddressing the lack of security in Iraq, thereby\nincreasing the number of troops and using force to\nbring about security, or on levelling accusations at\nneighbouring countries. The way out lies in an\ninternational commitment to the unity and territorial\nintegrity of Iraq, setting a clear timetable for the\nwithdrawal of the occupying forces from Iraq as soon\nas possible, drafting a constitution accepted by the\nIraqis and establishing a Government that is\nrepresentative of the Iraqi people, provided that the\nUnited Nations plays a pivotal role in Iraq in the\nvarious political, security and economic fields.\nThis session of the Assembly has seen intensive\ndiscussion among the permanent and elected members\nof the Security Council on a new draft resolution on\nIraq. We must draw attention here to the requirement\nthat any draft resolution to be adopted by the Security\nCouncil should allay the misgivings of the Iraqi people\nin all their factions and affiliations. Therefore, the draft\n10\n\nresolution to be adopted by the Security Council must\nbe brought to full maturity, so as to reassure the Iraqi\npeople about their future and to guarantee their\nindependence and sovereignty over their land and\nresources. The members of the Security Council should\nunanimously accept such a resolution, and it must\nenjoy the support of neighbouring States and the\ninternational community.\nMuch has been said lately about the dangers of\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  \npaid by countries that already have different types of\nsuch weapons. Some have even waged a war under the\npretext of eliminating such weapons. As is already\nknown, this danger is not confined to a particular\nregion in the world, but can be found in many other\nregions. What is truly regrettable, however, is that\nsome international quarters selectively choose to level\nfalse accusations against certain Arab and Islamic\nStates, but not against others, while ignoring the Israeli\narsenal of weapons of mass destruction, including\nnuclear, chemical and biological weapons. Also\nignored have been the repeated appeals by all the\ncountries of the region, with the exception of Israel, to\nmake the Middle East a region free of all weapons of\nmass destruction.\nSyria this year translated its words into action by\nsubmitting an integrated draft resolution to the Security\nCouncil, calling for declaring the Middle East a zone\nfree of all weapons of mass destruction. It is not\nsurprising, however, that those who led the media\ncampaign against Syria stood in the way of adoption of\nthe Syrian initiative.\nSyria is aware that its membership in the Security\nCouncil is temporary. However, we appeal to the\ninternational community to continue to support the\nSyrian initiative calling for the elimination of all\nweapons of mass destruction in the Middle East region.\nSyria has condemned terrorism in all its forms\nand manifestations. We have supported the Security\nCouncil's efforts to counter international terrorism\nthroughout the time of our membership of the Council.\nSyria has also acceded to the relevant international\nconventions to combat terrorism, including the Arab\nConvention on the Suppression of Terrorism and the\nConvention of the Organization of the Islamic\nConference on Combating International Terrorism.\nBoth instruments define the crime of terrorism and\ndistinguish between terrorism and the legitimate right\nof people under foreign occupation to resist\noccupation, in accordance with international law and\nthe Charter of the United Nations.\nSyria, which is not pursuing any political agenda,\nbelieves that the international community's success in\nits overall battle against terrorism depends, to a large\nextent, on its success in addressing the root causes of\nterrorism, which are often found in poverty, ignorance\nand injustice. First and foremost, eliminating injustice\nrequires an end to foreign occupation.\nAs a member of the Security Council, Syria has\ncontributed to all the deliberations on the situation in\nAfrica. Syria has also presided over Council meetings\nthat were dedicated in full to finding solutions to the\npredicaments of the friendly people of Africa. On more\nthan one level, the Council has succeed in providing\nassistance to Liberia, the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo, Rwanda, C\u00d9te d'Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau,\nBurundi, Angola and Sierra Leone. My county would\nlike to express its satisfaction at the positive\ndevelopments that have made it possible to find\npeaceful solutions to African questions, which have\nguaranteed the security, stability and territorial\nintegrity of the African States concerned. Syria\nexpresses its total solidarity with the African continent.\nWe call upon industrialized States and others able to do\nso to provide assistance to the countries of that great\ncontinent.\nSyria also expresses its satisfaction with the\nprogress made in the Sudanese peace talks, with the\nsigning of the agreement on security and ceasefire\narrangements, and ultimately with the comprehensive\nagreement that will end the conflict in that fraternal\ncountry in a way that would preserve the Sudan's unity\nand territorial integrity.\nWe call for a total lifting of the embargo imposed\non Cuba for decades outside the context of\ninternational legitimacy.\nWe also welcome the international efforts to\ndefuse tensions on the Korean peninsula, and support\nthe Korean people's legitimate aspirations to unity and\nprosperity.\nActing upon the collective responsibility of\nMember States to promote the role of this international\nOrganization, Syria has actively participated in the\ndeliberations on the reform of the United Nations. In\nthat regard, the Millennium Declaration, which was\n11\n\nadopted three years ago, represented a good basis, all\nthings considered, to bring about that reform. We hope\nthat the reform will continue to be carried out in a\ncomprehensive, transparent and non-selective manner.\nWe believe that, in cooperation with the Secretariat,\nMember States have a primary role to play in the\nconsultations on reform and in the decisions to be\ntaken accordingly.\nIn conclusion, our sense of the daunting\nresponsibility that we must shoulder together as\nmembers of this international Organization should\nprompt us to raise some rhetorical questions. Do we\nhave at our disposal a better option than to enhance the\npurposes and principles of the Charter and to pursue\nthe goal of reforming the Organization for the\nestablishment of a more just and more democratic\ninternational order? Should we not persevere to\nsafeguard the milestone achievements of international\nlaw? Should we not aspire to a system that will not\naccommodate the arrogance of power nor compromise\nour fundamental principles? Should we not seek a\nsystem that pursues fruitful cooperation among States\nand encourages openness and a dialogue among\ncivilizations epitomizing the essence of a creative\nhuman interaction?\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to begin by\ndrawing the General Assembly\u2019s attention to the fact\nthat, despite all its deficiencies and weaknesses, it must\nbe admitted that the United Nations has demonstrated\nits merits and contributions, not only for humanity in\ngeneral but also, in particular, for its Member States.\nThis world body has maintained minimum standards\nthat every State must meet regarding the protection and\npromotion of the human rights of all its citizens. The\nUnited Nations has developed, and strived to\nimplement, international laws binding upon each and\nevery member. It has also instituted and put into\npractice an array of legal instruments that are very\nuseful in preventing and settling conflicts among\nStates, as well as in promoting a framework of\ncooperation among nations.\nI would therefore like to take this opportunity to\nconvey the gratitude and appreciation of my country to\nthe United Nations for the invaluable work it has done\nfor our benefit. The contributions of the Organization\nto our political and economic development are well\nrecorded in our history. Those contributions range from\nits mediating role during the period of our struggle to\npreserve our national independence, from 1945 to\n16\n\n1949, to its active participation in our efforts to employ\nour independence wisely in our pursuit of national\ndevelopment.\nOur national State \u2014 which may not only be the\nmost heterogeneous but also the largest archipelagic\nState in the world \u2014 is built upon racial, ethnic,\nreligious and cultural pluralities. Our people still live\npredominately traditional lives, dispersed along the\nequator throughout over 17,000 islands. The most\ndevastating financial crisis in Indonesia\u2019s history not\nonly ignited conflicts between ethnic groups, but also\nrevived separatist movements in several regions. We\nare doing all we can to contain and defuse those\nseparatist movements. In the process, we have\ndiminished our capacity to strengthen our economic\nrecovery.\nBeginning in 2002, while we were contending\nwith those difficulties, terrorism began to inflict its\nbrutality upon our homeland. We believed for quite\nsome time that international terrorism would spare\nIndonesia because we had a tradition of tolerance for\nhuman differences. However, we must now face the\nreality that Indonesia has become a target of terrorism,\nand as a result has suffered enormous losses in human\nlives. We have been wondering why those terrifying\nacts were carried out. What were the underlying\nreasons, motives and arguments for them? How were\nthey related to international terrorist networks? What\ncourse of action should be adopted to effectively\nprevent, deter and eradicate them?\nWe have adopted a strong set of laws to prevent\nand eradicate the threats posed by terrorism. Equipped\nwith those reinforced legal instruments, we have\ndismantled terrorist cells in the country, and\nprosecutors have brought members of those cells to\njustice. Several of them have already been handed\nsentences that befit their crimes.\nThe people of Indonesia, who are predominantly\nof the Islamic faith, support that national policy. Large\nand active Islamic organizations, such as\nMuhammadiya and Nahdlatul Ulama, as well as the\nIndonesian Ulemas Council and prominent Islamic\nfigures, are one in condemning those terrorist acts. It\nshould be noted that the terrorists \u2014 who are few in\nnumber, but fanatical \u2014 often claim that they are\nfighting in the name of Islam. They must be a mere\nminority, as Islam \u2014 which teaches equality, justice\nand the kinship shared by all humankind \u2014 cannot\npossibly endorse the indiscriminate killing of innocent\nindividuals. As in other Muslim countries, adherents of\nmainstream Islam in Indonesia practice moderation and\nare strongly opposed to violence. Although they are a\nsmall splinter group in the large Indonesian community\nof Muslims, the perpetrators of those terrorist acts\nrepresent a branch of international terrorism. The\nmotives and justifying arguments of their movement\napparently stem from the prolonged unjust attitude\nexhibited by big Powers towards countries whose\ninhabitants profess Islam, particularly as regards\nresolving the Middle East conflict.\nWe should truly be prudent and sensible in the\nface of such a long-outstanding issue. It is difficult to\nrefute the impression that the policy on conflict\nresolution in the Middle East is not only unjust but also\none-sided. Clearly, the Middle East problem is not a\nconflict of religions or of religious adherents, although\nsome religious nuances may be part of the issue.\nWe are very much aware of the background of\nthat situation. Whatever the reasoning espoused by any\none of us, we must all admit that the absence of a just\nattitude, exacerbated by a feeling of being sidelined\nand ignored, in addition to the lack of a formal means\nto channel aspirations, has fostered a climate for\nviolence and made it grow. In our view, those are\nactually both the seeds and roots of a problem that has\na tendency to grow and expand. Among other things,\nthat problem has also even led to devastating and tragic\nacts of terror.\nAt this distinguished forum, I would like to\nappeal to world leaders to open the doors of their hearts\nin dealing with that issue, which is crucial to world\npeace, the welfare of humankind and the destiny of the\nhuman race. I believe we will be able to carry out that\nnoble task if we are prepared to look into the problem\nwith clear hearts and minds. Indeed, we cannot be the\n\u201cmost just\u201d; but it is necessary to have a just mind and\nattitude.\nIt is depressing to observe that we have been very\nslow in understanding the root causes of the problem.\nThe war in the Middle East a few months ago is just\nanother reflection of the situation. The war has created\nmany more problems than it was supposed to solve. I\ndo believe that a great many lessons can be learned\nfrom the Iraq war.\nIn order to prevent, deter or eradicate the problem\nof international terrorism, I should like to propose that\n17\n\nthe countries whose citizens have been the main targets\nof terrorist groups should review their conventional\nanti-terrorism policies, particularly in dealing with the\nArab-Israeli conflict. They should adopt a policy that\nensures that all parties involved are given just and\nequal treatment. Indeed, many eminent Muslims in\nIndonesia believe that once the major Powers behave in\na more just manner and make clear their impartiality in\nthe Middle East, most of the root causes of terrorism\nperpetrated in the name of Islam \u2014 which cannot be\njustified under any circumstance \u2014 will be resolved.\nAs the Head of State of the largest Muslim country in\nthe world, I sincerely invite all world leaders to pay\nparticular attention to that issue.\nLet us prevent the root causes of terrorism from\nspreading and triggering the emergence of other\nunsatisfactory aspirations, including in the social and\neconomic spheres. The failure to reach consensus at the\nrecent meeting of the World Trade Organization and\nthe continued slow progress \u2014 not to say stalemate \u2014\nin the implementation of various social and economic\nglobal agendas will only complicate and proliferate\nexisting global problems.\nWe are all interested in making the world a more\npeaceful, stable, prosperous, just and humane place.\nWere those not the noble objectives explicitly\nstipulated in the Charter of the United Nations at the\ninception of the Organization, in June 1945? We are all\naware that the world has undergone rapid changes.\nTechnology has transformed the world and turned it\ninto an open and almost borderless place. Human life\nand its inherent value system have been developing\nvery fast, and any institutional and procedural regimes\nand instruments require adjustment and improvement.\nForty-three years ago, in 1960, our first President,\nMr. Soekarno, spoke clearly about that issue. In his\naddress to the General Assembly entitled \u201cTo build the\nworld anew\u201d, he referred to the need to reform both the\ninternational order and relations among nations of the\nworld. We now all realize and recognize the truth of his\ncall. We are indeed in need of fundamental reform. If,\nto that end, the performance of the Organization\nrequires improvement to enable it to contribute more\nconstructively to the attainment of a more peaceful,\nstable, just, prosperous and humane world, then we\nmust have the courage to review, revitalize and\nempower its institutions and working methods.\nWe must strengthen international cooperation and\nreinforce regional engagement. In South-East Asia, we\nare continuing to enhance the role of the Association of\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). Next month, at\nthe ASEAN summit that Indonesia will host in Bali, we\nexpect to take concrete steps towards forming an\nASEAN security community that will support and\ncomplement our efforts at becoming an ASEAN\neconomic community. I believe that a stable, peaceful\nand prosperous ASEAN will significantly contribute to\nthe realization of the objectives of the United Nations.\nThere are no easy tasks. But building a better\nregion and a more democratic world is worth all our\npatience and hard work. After all, that is our basic\nresponsibility. From Indonesia\u2019s own experience in\nstriving to become a more fully democratic country, I\nknow how difficult that kind of work can be. We are\ntherefore aware that building a more democratic world\nis even more difficult. Nevertheless, I wish to reiterate\nthat my country remains committed to fulfilling its\ninternational obligations and that we will continue to\nwork with other members of the United Nations to\nbuild the new world we dream of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Allow me to convey the greetings and best\nwishes of His Majesty King Mswati III and Her\nMajesty the Indlovukazi and indeed the entire Swazi\nnation.\nWe are gathered here to chart the way forward\ntowards the creation of a world fit for all of us by the\nturn of the century and beyond. Over the past year, we\nwitnessed dramatic events that brought old and new\nissues to the forefront. The international situation has\nrelapsed into the old state of uncertainty. International\nleadership, be it on the part of the major Powers or the\nUnited Nations, has become vague, as confrontations at\nthe interstate and intra-state levels have increased. Our\ninability to stand collectively against many issues that\nafflict each individual country differently has been\ncited by our detractors as marking the beginning of the\nend of the Organization and multilateralism.\nThe United Nations needs to send a clear message\nto its detractors that it is alive and well, and that it will\nindeed play a major role in the post-cold war era. All\nmust know that the United Nations is a major forum for\nconsultation, coordination and collective decisions on\ncrucial socio-political issues among its Members and\nthat its strength and relevance has never come from\naffirming the designs of a few selected Member\nnations, but instead rests on the collective will of the\ninternational community that emerges from a\nmultilateral process.\nIn our interdependent world, the need to\nstrengthen the multilateral process is now more urgent\nthan ever before, if we are to achieve our common goal\nof a just and humane international order based on\ninternational cooperation and solidarity. This is a\nchallenge that must be squarely and urgently addressed,\nand remedial action must be taken here at the United\nNations. We can stand tall and proud, knowing that two\nyears ago, the response by the United Nations to a new\nand unprecedented level of terrorism was immediate,\nunited and effective. That response was a model for\ninternational unity of purpose and multilateral action; it\nwas a lesson that should not be forgotten as the\nOrganization tackles other problems confronting\nhumanity.\nAt this point, allow me to pay tribute to\nMr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, Special Representative of\nthe Secretary-General, and to the other United Nations\nstaff and support staff who lost their lives in the\nterrible tragedy in Baghdad a few weeks ago. Once\nmore, terrorism has shown its ugly face \u2014 indeed its\nonly face \u2014 and how important it is to support the\nUnited Nations efforts to deal with it.\nDespite the best intentions and efforts of regional\norganizations and the United Nations, a scourge of a\ndifferent nature continues to threaten many parts of the\nworld. I refer here to the threat of internal and inter-\nState conflicts around the world. Events in some parts\nof the world continue to be of grave concern to us all.\nPeople and countries continue to expend valuable\nenergy and resources in fighting each other. The\ninternational community has a responsibility, not only\nto design appropriate strategies for a measured and\nearly response, but also to find ways and means of\naddressing those conflicts\u2019 root cause and managing\nthem to a peaceful resolution.\nThere are positive indications that political\nconflict and turmoil in Africa will be eliminated, and\nthere is hope for building stability and economic\nprogress. In the face of dwindling official development\nassistance and the lack of comparable resources, the\ncreation of the African Union and its New Partnership\nfor Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD) programme are\ncommendable initiatives to bring Africa closer to the\nmainstream of international development, to generate\nsustainable economic growth and to eradicate poverty\nand the spread of disease.\nWhat is needed now are resources and we ask that\nevery effort be made by our developed partners to\nensure that these initiatives achieve a breakthrough for\nAfrican development. Also, the international\ncommunity should concentrate its efforts toward\nmaking development more inclusive and must ensure\nthat particular groups of vulnerable countries, in\nparticular small developing States, are not left out of\nthe global economy and the development process.\nWith the ongoing revitalization of the General\nAssembly and its integrated implementation and\nfollow-up to the outcome of major United Nations\nconferences and summits, we are hopeful that the\naspirations of our countries for sustainable\ndevelopment and peace will be met.\nThe situation in the Middle East continues to be a\nmatter of great concern. We urge both parties to renew\ntheir commitment to the road map for peace and to\nagree on a mechanism for achieving a lasting peace.\nWe are pleased to note that a significant level of\n29\n\nconsensus on the main elements of a settlement has\nemerged. We further urge both parties to take\nadvantage of this and proceed towards negotiations\ninvolving the leadership of Palestine and Israel.\nIt is regrettable that the threat of a nuclear\nholocaust still haunts us \u2014 even to this day \u2014 owing\nto the inability of the international community to work\nout a regime for the total elimination of nuclear\nweapons. Under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-\nTest-Ban Treaty we have made significant gains on the\nissue of nuclear disarmament, but these alone cannot\neliminate the threat of nuclear weapons. The Kingdom\nof Swaziland continues to hold the view that the\ninternational community must effectively address this\nmatter in order to establish a clear timetable to which\nall nuclear Powers must commit.\nIn addition to the struggle to outlaw weapons of\nmass destruction, there is an urgent need to address the\nissue of small arms and light weapons, which have\ncontributed to conflict and insecurity in many of our\ncountries. Their easy accessibility, fuelled by illicit\nbrokering, is a major cause for concern. We appeal to\nall countries to fully implement the recommendations\ncontained in the Programme of Action adopted by the\nUnited Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small\nArms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, held here\nin New York in 2001, with a view to combating such\npractices.\nEconomic growth is essential if we are to meet\nthe Millennium Development Goals, in particular the\nfirst goal of eradicating poverty. In our quest to\ndevelop quietly and peacefully, according to the wishes\nof the Swazi nation, His Majesty King Mswati III\nlaunched, in June this year, the country\u2019s first draft\nconstitution \u2014 a document that has been hailed by\nmany as a good framework for shaping a new\nSwaziland. The Constitutional Drafting Committee has\ntaken the draft to the people for their input, and it is\nour hope that it will be finalized and adopted soon. We\nare grateful to our international partners for providing\nsupport throughout that exercise.\nDespite our best efforts, however, the Kingdom of\nSwaziland is finding it difficult to achieve progress\nbecause of the huge obstacles that we face, the greatest\nof these being the threat to our future by the HIV/AIDS\npandemic. Its devastating impact on Swaziland has\nbeen well documented. No development sector is\nimmune from the consequences of the very high and\nincreasing HIV infection rate among our people, given\nthe enormous strain that it places on our financial and\nhuman resources. We are grateful, however, to the\nGlobal Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria,\nand hopes are now high. Notwithstanding the inherent\ndelays in processing our applications to the Fund, the\narrival of the first disbursements from the Fund in\nAugust has increased hope for thousands among the\naffected and infected population.\nWe are now able to embrace the approved\nmedical-care strategies, including the reduction of\nmother-to-child transmission of the virus and the\nprescription of antiretroviral drugs for those who need\nthem. The recent high-level meeting on HIV/AIDS,\nwhich was held here last week, was of critical\nimportance to Swaziland. We are positive that the\nconclusions reached during that meeting will be critical\nin our endeavour to find solutions to this pandemic.\nAs part of His Majesty\u2019s initiative to promote\nglobal awareness of the pandemic and to raise funds\nthat will help those of our countries that are suffering\nfrom the dreadful consequences of the disease, the\nmuch awaited album by international artists, entitled\n\u201cSongs for Life\u201d, was launched by His Majesty here at\nthe United Nations, in Washington and in Los Angeles\nin June this year. We look forward with great\nconfidence to the success of the album, whose proceeds\nwill go entirely to HIV/AIDS programmes.\nThe food security situation that continues to\naffect the Southern African region is closely linked to\nthe HIV/AIDS pandemic. The Kingdom of Swaziland\nhas been hard hit by food shortages, largely due to the\nfailure of the rains, particularly in the rural areas,\nwhere communities are entirely dependent on farming.\nAs food shortages grip us tighter, we are grateful to the\nUnited Nations and its affiliated agencies for their\neffort to help us to arrest the crisis. As we approach\nthis farming season, it is our prayer that the situation\nwill improve.\nIt could be safely said that the twenty-first\ncentury has had an inauspicious start, with\nglobalization, terrorism, disease and weapons of mass\ndestruction at the forefront of our minds. This places\nall the more responsibility on the United Nations to\nharness the resources and commitment of its Members\nfor the benefit of humankind. In this effort, there is a\ncompelling need to include all the peoples of the world,\n30\n\nas envisaged by our founding fathers and as enshrined\nin the principle of universality. Acknowledging the\nimportance of this principle, the Kingdom of Swaziland\nraises the issue of the inclusion once more of the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan in the activities of the\nUnited Nations and its associated agencies. Our\nprincipled position on this important issue remains\nunchanged.\nThe Republic of China on Taiwan has shown time\nand again its willingness to participate in efforts to\nbring about true global peace, development and\nsecurity, as well as its commitment to utilize resources\nfor the benefit of mankind. We therefore fail to\nunderstand why the people of Taiwan cannot be part of\nthis great family of nations.\nFinally, I would like to thank the President of the\nAssembly for giving me this opportunity to speak\nbefore the Assembly. The Kingdom of Swaziland\nreiterates its conviction that the United Nations system\nremains the best guarantee for international peace and\nsecurity. We pledge to work vigorously with the\nOrganization to ensure its success.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, allow\nme to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\nsession. I am fully convinced that, under your\nleadership, the proceedings of this session will be\ncrowned with success.\nIt is only right that, in addressing the present\naudience, my first thought should go to Mr. Sergio\nVieira de Mello, the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights and Special\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General to Iraq. From\nthis rostrum, I wish to pay homage to his activity and\ncontribution and to express profound sadness over the\nloss of his and other human lives in the cruel terrorist\nattack on the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad.\nThis session is convening at the end of a year full\nof challenges and achievements for the international\ncommunity, and certainly for the United Nations. We\nbelieve that the United Nations has identified the\nmaintenance of peace, security and international stability\nand the protection of human rights as the fundamental\nobjectives of its activity. This is best reflected in the\nMillennium Declaration, which outlines the common\nvision for building a better world without conflict or\npoverty. We share the opinion of Secretary-General\nKofi Annan that the major changes that occurred across\nthe world following the events of 11 September 2003,\nthe phenomenon of international terrorism and the wars\nin Afghanistan and Iraq have emphasized the need to\naddress the major challenges of our times from a new\nperspective and, in this context, to further improve the\nperformance of the United Nations structures.\nIn this spirit, Albania did not hesitate to join the\nUnited States-led coalition against international terrorism.\nAlbania has signed 12 international conventions and\nprotocols in the war against terrorism. It is working\nclosely with its neighbours, other countries at large and\ninternational bodies with a view to eradicating the\npotential sources of various forms of terrorism.\nWe underscore the need for vigilance,\ncoordination and reaction in the face of the threats\ncurrently posed by weapons of mass destruction. These\nweapons   be they chemical, biological or nuclear  \nare even more dangerous in the hands of terrorists. At\nthe same time, we are actively participating in the\npeacekeeping missions in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well\n2\n \nas in Bosnia and Georgia, as a demonstration of our\nwill and commitment to the war on terror and to efforts\nto secure peace and security. We consider that deep-\nrooted democratic changes are important for both\nAfghanistan and Iraq. It is our conviction that the\nability to live in freedom, despite the difficulties of\ntransition, marks a point of no return on the journey\naway from dictatorship and from the terror that\nthreatens others as well.\nAlbanian politics and society have adopted a\nunified approach towards Euro-Atlantic integration,\nwhich is one of our major priorities. Consistent with\nour vital interests, the integration process has all\npopular support. We regard this not merely as a\nmechanical affiliation to the European Union and the\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), but as\nadherence to the standards and values of freedom,\ndemocracy and the free market. Given the brief period\nsince the onset of these changes and the negative heritage\nof the past, we must recognize that Albania has made\nimportant and substantial achievements on the road of\ndemocracy, but this is no reason for complacency.\nWe are aware that it will take far greater effort to\nmove the initiated reforms forward, especially in the\nrealm of the judiciary, the economy and the fight\nagainst crime and corruption, the latter having afflicted\npost-communist societies in general. We are already in\nthe process of negotiation on the Stabilization and\nAssociation Agreement with the European Union. The\nThessaloniki summit once again confirmed the open-\ndoor policy to be pursued towards Albania and the\nother four countries of the Western Balkans.\nSignificant positive steps have also been taken\nconcerning the NATO membership process, specifically\nfollowing the Prague summit. The commitment of\nAlbania, Croatia and Macedonia under the Adriatic 3\nCharter will bring them closer to membership\nstandards. We maintain that our convergence towards\nthe standards of NATO and the European Union today\nand our full-fledged membership tomorrow will benefit\nthe countries of our region, just as it will benefit\nEurope itself and overall peace and security.\nAlbania considers regional cooperation to be a\nprerequisite and encouragement for Euro-Atlantic\nintegration. We believe that the pursuit of dialogue, as\nwell as enhanced cooperation and understanding\namong the Balkan countries, deeply reflect the\naspirations of our citizens and impart a fresh impulse to\nthe integrating processes. The Balkans, which not long\nago were known as a source of conflicts and crises,\nnow reveal a different picture that has changed in a\npositive way, with a significantly moderated political\nclimate prevailing in the area. The region of former\nnationalistic clashes has turned into an area in which\nthe culture of dialogue and good understanding is\nputting down roots. Although the supporters of the\ndivisive and tragic past are still active in politics,\noverall the new political class in the Balkans is looking\nforward to the future and cooperation.\nAlbania and the Albanians are playing an active\nrole in building and strengthening this new spirit. We\nwant and are working to ensure that we establish\nfriendly relations of cooperation with all the countries\nin the region, so that we can move ahead towards our\ncommon European future. The investment our countries\nare making in a Euro-Atlantic future is one of the\nprincipal guarantees that the region will free itself from\nthe bitter past and join the democratic flow of our times.\nAlbania and the Balkans attach special\nimportance to the enhancement of stability and the\nreinforcement of democracy in the areas formerly\nknown as hotbeds. We appreciate the democratic and\nintegrating developments in Kosovo, which do credit to\nthe contribution of the United Nations Interim\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo and the former\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General,\nMr. Steiner. We support the new mission under the\nleadership of Mr. Holkeri and admire the performance\nof society and institutions in Kosovo towards building\na democratic model of coexistence among its citizens.\nStability in Kosovo is very important for stability\nin the region. That is why we have consistently\nbolstered the reforms and the achievements made with\nregard to the establishment and strengthening of the\ndemocratic institutions there. We have denounced acts\nof violence and have encouraged every initiative that\nhelps to ensure respect for the norms of a democratic\nsociety, enforce the rule of law, promote a sustained\nand developed market economy, build democratic\ninstitutions, maintain inter-ethnic harmony and\nfacilitate the return of displaced persons.\nAlbania has urged and supported the efforts to\nstart a dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade on\nmutually beneficial technical issues. We claim that the\npursuit of dialogue is the best way to address problems\nand to create the necessary trust. Albania is of the\nopinion that the future of Kosovo, and hence its final\n3\n \nstatus, is an issue that ought to be decided at a later\nstage, which should not be postponed indefinitely.\nIt is already widely recognized that this status\nwill be determined through the will of the citizens of\nKosovo in cooperation with the international\ncommunity. Compliance with the required standards\nand determination of status are closely related and\ninterdependent issues. The standards ensure the normal\nfunctioning of the local institutions, while the status\nbrings about stability, peace and development in\nKosovo and the region.\nThe positive developments in Macedonia also\ngive rise to hope for the achievement of lasting\nstability. We maintain, however, that the integral\nimplementation of the Ohrid Agreement without delay\nis of crucial importance to the future of Macedonia.\nAlbania denounces the extremists on all sides and\nabides by the spirit of tolerance and inter-ethnic\ncoexistence.\nThe Republic of Albania supports the plans and\ninitiatives aimed at providing a comprehensive and\nlasting solution to the situation in the Middle East. In\nthat context, we consider the road map to be the way\ntowards the settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian\nconflict. Before reaching that settlement, however,\nviolence and terrorist acts should be renounced forever.\nDialogue and the spirit of agreement should be\npromoted until an enforceable final solution is found.\nWe believe that peace in the Middle East is an\nimportant pillar for peace and security the world over.\nThe settlement of the Palestinian issue is essential for\nthe resolution of the crisis in the Middle East and a\ncore element for success in the fight against terrorism.\nThe Albanian State values and believes in an\neven greater role of the United Nations in the\nstrengthening of peace, security and economic and\nsocial development throughout the world. Albania\nsupports reform to make the United Nations an ever\nstronger organization, capable of coping with the\nchallenges of the present and providing timely\nsolutions to issues of concern to all its Members. In\nthat respect, we welcome the objectives the Secretary-\nGeneral has set for the reform of the Organization as a\nwhole and for its specific organs, including the General\nAssembly and the Security Council.\nIn conclusion, allow me to reaffirm Albania's\ncommitment to fulfilling its obligations stemming from\nthe decisions to be taken during the present session of\nthe General Assembly of the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives my delegation\nimmense satisfaction to see Mr. Julian Hunte in the\nhigh office of the presidency, not only because of his\nwide experience and his proven abilities, but also\nbecause Saint Lucia \u2014 a small country like Bhutan \u2014\nhas assumed leadership of the General Assembly at this\ncritical juncture of its history. We are confident that,\nunder his able leadership and guidance, our\ndeliberations on the many important and challenging\nissues that confront our world today will be fruitful.\nLet me also take this opportunity to express our deep\nappreciation to Mr. Jan Kavan for his excellent\nstewardship of the fifty-seventh session. His\npresidency enhanced the esteem of the international\ncommunity both for himself personally and for the\nCzech Republic.\nMy delegation would like to pay a special tribute\nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his\ndynamic leadership and his tireless efforts to revitalize\nthe United Nations and to enable it to assume its\nrightful role at a very challenging time in our history.\nWe have gathered in this magnificent Hall year\nafter year, bound together by a common vision of a\npeaceful, prosperous and just world. The end of the\ncold war renewed our hope to bring to fruition our\ncollective aspirations, enshrined in the Charter of the\nUnited Nations. The historic Millennium Summit\nushered in a sense of optimism that we could bring\nabout a world free from want and fear. Unfortunately,\nthe horrific events of 11 September have shaken the\nvery foundations of our nascent faith in our ability to\ndeliver a new era of peace and prosperity. The situation\nin Iraq is a serious challenge to the international\ncommunity. Three years ago, we stood united and\nconfident about the prospects in the new millennium,\nproviding a ray of hope for millions around the world.\nToday, sadly, we stand as a house divided, uncertain\nabout the future and unsure whether we can rid the\nworld of the vicious circle of conflict, poverty and fear\nthat has plagued humankind for centuries.\nIt is clear that international peace and security\nand the eradication of poverty remain the most pressing\nchallenges confronting the international community.\nWhat must be recognized is the undeniable, but often\noverlooked, fact that those overarching goals are\ninterlinked and cannot be achieved in isolation. There\ncan be no prosperity without peace and security. At the\nsame time, peace and security cannot be sustained if\nbillions are deprived of the basic necessities of life.\nOur collective resolve to combat the menace of\nterrorism must be matched with an equal commitment\n2\n\nto eradicate the scourge of poverty, which afflicts more\nthan half of the world\u2019s population.\nWe welcome the President\u2019s intention to focus the\nAssembly\u2019s efforts on implementation of the outcomes\nof United Nations summits and conferences, including\nthe Millennium Development Goals. The realization of\na new economic order that is inclusive, equitable and\nsustainable is an imperative that must be pursued with\nrenewed focus and resolve. The Millennium\nDeclaration provides a clear set of targets and steps to\nbe undertaken to achieve them. The Monterrey\nConsensus, the Doha Development Agenda and the\nJohannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development\nprovided further impetus towards the attainment of the\nMillennium Development Goals. Yet 33 countries that\ntogether account for 26 per cent of the world\u2019s\npopulation are reported to be off track on more than\nhalf of the Goals. The lack of progress so far is indeed\ndisconcerting.\nWhile emphasizing the need to accelerate the\nimplementation of commitments made by both\ndeveloped and developing countries at various\ninternational conferences, my delegation would like to\nhighlight the critical need for adequate financing\nmechanisms through trade, investment and official\ndevelopment assistance. In particular, my delegation\nhopes that the special needs and vulnerabilities of the\nleast developing countries, of the landlocked\ndeveloping countries and of the small island\ndeveloping States will be comprehensively addressed,\nas called for in the Brussels Programme of Action for\nthe Least Developed Countries, in the Almaty\nDeclaration and in the Barbados Plan of Action,\nrespectively.\nOf the 33 countries that are off track in achieving\nthe Millennium Development Goals, 23 are in sub-\nSaharan Africa, highlighting the need for special\nattention to Africa. My delegation calls on the\ninternational community to lend its full support to the\nimplementation of the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s\nDevelopment. International support is particularly\ncrucial for countries emerging from conflicts, for\nwithout the rehabilitation of social and economic\ninfrastructure, progress in peacemaking cannot be\nsustained. In that context, we hope that the\ninternational community will also provide the\nnecessary support to the peoples of Afghanistan and\nIraq as they endeavour to rebuild their nations under\nthe most trying circumstances.\nEvery Member State has the responsibility to\neradicate poverty and create an enabling environment\nfor peace and security. It is in the mutual interest of all\nnations, small or large, developed or developing, to\ncollectively promote global prosperity and peaceful\ncoexistence.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe brutal attacks on the\nUnited Nations Mission in Baghdad are beyond\ncomprehension. I condemn them in the strongest\npossible terms. The perpetrators of such crimes must be\nbrought to justice. We must renew our efforts to bolster\nrespect for humanitarian principles. It is unacceptable\nthat United Nations personnel are unable to conduct\nhumanitarian relief operations without risking their\nlives. It is unacceptable that United Nations personnel\nare denied access to people in distress.\nOn behalf of the people of Norway, I wish to\nexpress my respect and admiration to all United\nNations workers who are doing what they can to help\nin Iraq and other zones of conflict and danger.\nUnless the security needs in Iraq are met,\nvaluable time on the road to political stability,\ndemocracy and economic and social development will\nbe lost. Without a safe and secure environment, the\nUnited Nations is unable to help Iraq along that road. I\ndeplore the political assassinations of religious and\npolitical leaders in Iraq.\nNow we must focus our attention on what is\nneeded to rebuild Iraq. Norway is participating in\ninternational efforts to stabilize and rebuild Iraq for the\nbenefit of the Iraqi people. Our aim is to help the\npeople of Iraq regain control of their own destiny, to\nhelp them build a future of freedom and justice and a\nlife in peace with their neighbours.\nThe United Nations should play a key role in\nsetting the benchmarks and guiding the political\nprocess towards the early restoration of Iraq\u2019s\nsovereignty and the transfer of power to an Iraqi\ngovernment. A carefully considered timeframe must be\ndrawn up. We must also make sure that the tasks that\nwe decide for the United Nations in Iraq are realistic\nand achievable.\nTerrorism is a dark force, which targets the very\nvalues and norms upon which the United Nations\nCharter is based. An overwhelming majority of\nMember States have joined forces to fight it, and we\nhave taken some important steps together. We need to\nstrengthen the role of the United Nations in multilateral\ndisarmament, arms control and non-proliferation. We\nneed to agree on strong and effective regimes that can\nprovide reliable protection against weapons of mass\ndestruction.\nA week ago, world leaders and the Secretary-\nGeneral sat down in New York at the invitation of\nNorway to discuss ways to fight terrorism and the roots\nof evil. They voiced their dedication to the fight\nagainst terrorism, and their determination to place\nhumanity at the centre of that fight.\nWe want a United Nations that reaches out and\nresponds to the concerns of all Member States. It must\nreach out and respond to the concerns of all\nindividuals, to the needs of men and women alike. We\nneed a world of equal opportunities, where all the\nworld\u2019s human resources \u2014 and not only half of\nthem \u2014 are fully put to use. We have a vision of a\nhumane world where people can live in security and\ndignity, free from poverty and despair. To live up to the\nideals enshrined in the Charter, the United Nations\nmust continue to give priority to human rights and\nfundamental aspects of governance.\nA culture of impunity for mass atrocities is\nincompatible with human dignity and undermines long-\nterm security. The establishment of the International\nCriminal Court is a historic turning point.\nFighting terrorism, strengthening human security,\nworking for development and preventing conflict are\nchallenges that are closely related. In the Millennium\n16\n\nDevelopment Goals, we have pledged to halve the\nproportion of people living in extreme poverty and to\nreduce child mortality by two-thirds. We have pledged\nto halve the proportion of people without access to safe\ndrinking water and basic sanitation.\nNorway currently holds the chairmanship of the\nCommission on Sustainable Development, and we are\ncommitted to achieving real progress. It is crucial that\ndeveloping and developed countries and the private\nsector all contribute. Development must be built on a\nglobal partnership and on shared responsibilities.\nNorway remains committed to the Doha Development\nAgenda. We are confident that strengthening and\nmaking full use of this multilateral framework is the\nway to go. We will work hard to get the negotiations\nback on track.\nMore often than not, the United Nations only\nbecomes engaged in earnest after armed conflict has\nbroken out. The reasons are many, but they are no\nexcuse for the loss of lives, the human misery and the\nsetbacks in development that are too often the high\nprice of collective inaction. Too often the main legacy\nof a civil war is another civil war. Yet there are many\nthings we can do to prevent this from happening.\nWe can act to prevent economic conflict drivers\nsuch as diamonds and other natural resources, from\nfuelling and prolonging conflicts, and we can act to\ncurb the illegal trade in small arms. By fighting\npoverty and promoting peace and development, we are\nmaking the soundest investment possible in Africa. We\nwill assist the African Union and the New Partnership\nfor Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD) in their endeavours\ntowards economic and social development and political\nstability in Africa.\nNorway will continue working for peace and\nstability in the Horn of Africa. The peace process\nbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea is entering a crucial\nphase. We urge both parties to stand by their\ncommitments and not hesitate now that they stand at\nthe threshold of lasting peace.\nIn the Sudan, important progress has just been\nmade. We urge the parties to step up their efforts and\nreach a final settlement.\nOver the last few years, the United Nations has\nmade considerable progress in peacekeeping. The\nfoundations for a new approach have been laid.\nNotable results have been achieved in Kosovo, Sierra\nLeone and Timor-Leste, as well as in reinforcing the\ncapabilities of the Department of Peacekeeping\nOperations and strengthening the United Nations\nStandby Arrangement System.\nThe United Nations Assistance Mission in\nAfghanistan is facing a particularly challenging task.\nTwo years on, much has been achieved, but the\nsituation is still volatile. The safe and secure\nenvironment needed for economic growth and full\nimplementation of the Bonn Agreement is not in place.\nMany people are suffering from food shortages, and are\nin need of assistance. Elections are due next year.\nWomen are not yet properly empowered. Unless we can\nassure nation-wide security, the nation-building process\nin Afghanistan will be at risk. A sustained international\npresence will be necessary for the foreseeable future.\nWith NATO in command of the International\nSecurity Assistance Force (ISAF), Norway as a NATO\nmember has an additional stake in the building of a\npeaceful and prosperous future for the people of\nAfghanistan. We have decided to make Afghanistan\none of our partner countries in development\ncooperation.\nIn Sri Lanka the peace process has reached a\ndecisive juncture. We are hopeful that the parties will\nsoon be able to embark on negotiations towards an\ninterim administration for the North-East Province. It\nis vital that the parties reach agreement and resume\ndirect peace negotiations within the timeframe\nenvisaged.\nDevelopment of the economic infrastructure is\nequally important for all in Sri Lanka. In parallel with\ndealing with the political process, the parties should\ntake care to proceed with the important task of\nreconstruction and development.\nNorway remains firmly committed to the role of\nfacilitator of the peace process between the\nGovernment of Sri Lanka and the LTTE. We call on the\ninternational community to engage in the efforts for\nreconstruction and rehabilitation in Sri Lanka.\nIn Myanmar the Government has recently stated\nits intention to invite the democratic opposition and the\nethnic minorities to take part in the building of a\nnational consensus. A good way to start would be to\nrelease Aung San Suu Kyi immediately and without\nconditions and thereby demonstrate the Government\u2019s\n17\n\nsincere intentions. This might mean the beginning of a\nnew political era in Myanmar. Norway stands ready to\nsupport efforts to make democratization an irreversible\nprocess. We strongly support the role of the United\nNations and believe that the active involvement of\ncountries in the region will be vital to reaching a\nsolution.\nThe year 2003 has been a tragic one for Israelis\nand Palestinians. Their acceptance of the road map for\npeace boded well, but again violence and not politics is\ndetermining the course of development. A political\nsolution is needed, building on a parallel process where\nIsrael takes significant steps to end the occupation, and\nwhere the Palestinian Authority takes determined steps\nto fight terror. The ultimate goal, in which we will not\nlose faith, is that of two States \u2014 Israel and\nPalestine \u2014 living side by side in peace and security.\nNorway urges Israel to do its utmost to ease the\nliving conditions of the Palestinians. In our capacity as\nchairman of the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee for\nassistance to the Palestinian people, Norway remains\ncommitted to rebuilding the Palestinian areas.\nNorway also believes that the parties should avail\nthemselves of the assistance of the international\ncommunity and individual countries through\nappropriate monitoring mechanisms.\nThe past year has been a trying one for the United\nNations. Multilateralism has come under pressure from\nthose who continue to question the primacy of the\nUnited Nations and therefore look elsewhere for\nsolutions.\nThe answer to this challenge is to make the\nUnited Nations more effective and thus more relevant\nin dealing with issues at the top of the international\nagenda. By increasing the relevance of the United\nNations we can increase its authority and legitimacy.\nNorway shares the Secretary-General\u2019s view that\nMember States need to take a hard look at today\u2019s\nUnited Nations institutions and ask whether they are\nadequate for the tasks we have before us.\nThe time has come to advance the issue of reform\nof the Security Council. It is also time to agree on a\nmore relevant agenda for the General Assembly, the\nEconomic and Social Council and the Commission on\nHuman Rights. Norway puts emphasis on reforming the\nwork of the First Committee. We therefore welcome\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s decision to appoint a high-level\npanel to recommend concrete ways in which to\nstrengthen the functioning of the major bodies of the\nUnited Nations and the relationships between them.\nNorway, together with the Nordic countries, has a long-\nstanding commitment to reform. We stand ready to\nassist in bringing the initiatives of the Secretary-\nGeneral to fruition.\nThe aims and ideals of the United Nations are as\nrelevant as ever \u2014 to maintain peace and security, to\nreaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, to establish\nconditions for justice and the international rule of law\nand to promote economic and social development.\nThe world has changed since 1945, but the United\nNations has not changed with it. I urge Member States\nto come together with a renewed sense of unity and\npurpose, so that we can change our Organization in the\ncollective spirit that lies at the core of the Charter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me great\npleasure to deliver this statement on behalf of His\nExcellency Rene Harris, President and Minister for\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Nauru, who had to\ncancel his trip to New York at the last minute due to\npressing matters at home. President Harris has asked\nme to convey to Mr. Julian Hunte warmest\ncongratulations on his assumption of the stewardship of\nthe Assembly. As a small island developing State,\nNauru is extremely proud to be associated with the\nCaribbean Community on Mr. Hunte\u2019s marvellous\nachievement, which gives us hope that we in the\nPacific will also have the opportunity to preside over\nthe Assembly.\nMy delegation would like, through him, to\ncommend His Excellency Mr. Jan Kavan, President of\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session, for\nhis excellent leadership and the great efforts that he\nmade, particularly in tackling the difficult issues that\nhave plagued the revitalization of the General\nAssembly as the premier organ of the United Nations.\nThe President has pledged to continue the good work\nthat has been done in these areas, and he can count on\nNauru\u2019s full cooperation.\nPeace and security \u2014 or, more correctly, the lack\nof it \u2014 is still the main focus of the United Nations 58\nyears after its inception. In the past 24 months, we have\nseen the internationalization of terrorism manifest itself\nout of a cocktail of hatred, desperation and fanaticism\nthat has spread its tentacles from the Middle East into\nthe international arena. It is unconventional,\nclandestine, and indiscriminate with respect to its\nvictims. We are also seeing an increase in the\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction after a\nperiod of relative calm, and this is further exacerbating\nthe situation.\nThe sum of these two nightmarish threats is a\ncause for concern, and States that feel uniquely\nvulnerable to terrorist acts are considering the real\npossibility of terrorists gaining access to weapons of\nmass destruction. That scenario has forced such States\nto develop the antidote of unilateral action primed with\na pre-emptive strike policy.\nWe saw it in action in Afghanistan and, six\nmonths ago in Iraq, just as President Bush said we\nwould if the Security Council failed to walk the talk of\nresolution 1441 (2002), which called for the\ndisarmament by Iraq of its weapons of mass\ndestruction. Nauru is disappointed that President Bush\ndid not refer in his statement last week to the status of\nthe coalition\u2019s search for stockpiles of these weapons,\nand we are puzzled as to why it is hard to find them\nwhen intelligence indicated that the Iraqis could arm\nand unleash them so as to hit the United Kingdom\nwithin 45 minutes.\nMy delegation considers the antidote to which I\nreferred to be the catalyst in the new wave of nuclear\nweapons proliferation, and it is not a coincidence that\nthe countries singled out as part of the \u201caxis of evil\u201d\nare being accused of developing nuclear weapons.\nNauru joins the appeal to the countries concerned to\nobserve their obligations under the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to allow the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency to carry out\ninspections and verify that nuclear weapons are not\nbeing developed.\nIn all of this, we are certain of one thing: that the\nmajor casualty of the current state of affairs is the\ninnocence of the United Nations, which was mortally\nwounded in Baghdad when the lives of 22 dedicated\nUnited Nations servants were lost, including that of the\n22\n\nrevered Sergio Vieira de Mello, and more than 100\nwere injured.\nThe people of Nauru join the United Nations\nfamily in mourning the victims of that tragedy, and our\nheartfelt condolences go to the bereaved families. That\ndespicable act of terror has cast a shadow over the\nsafety and security of United Nations personnel\neverywhere. The clarity of its emblem, which stood for\ntolerance, hope and impartiality and which had acted as\na shield against attack, may have been blurred by its\nsubservient role to the administering force in Iraq.\nIn the light of the facts before us, Nauru fully\nagrees with the assessment made by the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, in his bold and gutsy\nstatement that the Organization has \u201ccome to a fork in\nthe road\u201d and that we are in a moment of time that is\n\u201cno less decisive than 1945 itself, when the United\nNations was founded.\u201d (A/58/PV.7, p. 3)\nNauru fully supports the proposal to establish a\nhigh-level panel of eminent personalities to review\nthreats to peace and security and other global\nchallenges insofar as these may influence or be\nconnected with such threats. Nauru strongly believes in\nmultilateralism as a key tool in resolving contemporary\nproblems in all of their complexity.\nThe Security Council should be at the centre of\nour collective efforts in maintaining peace and\nresolving conflict. At the same time, the Council must\nhave at its disposal the means of making evaluations\nand taking collective action. Most importantly, it must\nhave the will to act quickly and decisively, not only to\nthreats to peace and security, but to genocide and other\nmassive violations of human rights.\nNauru is pleased to see the rapid progression\ntowards making the International Criminal Court\noperational since its Statute came into force in July\n2001. We believe that the objectives of the Court make\nit a useful addition to the international tool kit for the\npreservation of peace, as perpetrators of atrocious acts\nin armed conflict have been put on notice that they will\nbe held accountable for their acts or omissions.\nAs a small island developing State in the Pacific\nOcean, Nauru aligns itself with the statements of the\nleaders of the Pacific nations who have spoken before\nme on the concerns and challenges that we, the small-\nisland-big-ocean developing States are facing, now and\nin the future. Nauru bears all the unique characteristics\nof a small island State, given our small size, in terms of\nboth land area and population, our remoteness and our\nvulnerability to exogenous forces, be they man-made or\nnatural.\nIn 1994, the world community agreed that small\nisland developing States warranted special\nconsideration with regard to their economic and social\ndevelopment because of the unique set of\ncharacteristics that are inherent in each island country,\nand it was to address those unique problems that the\nBarbados Plan of Action was created.\nAs His Royal Highness the Prime Minister of\nTonga stated in his intervention, the road to sustainable\ndevelopment for small island developing States is\nposted with signs of undertakings, as we marched from\nBarbados in 1994 to New York in 1999 for the five-\nyear review, then on to Monterrey in 2002 for the\nInternational Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment, where more signs were posted saying\nthat internal self-help, good governance and trade were\nthe key to poverty alleviation, and that subscription to\nthose cures would provide the way for developed\ncountries to come in and help. Most, if not all, of the\nsmall island developing States have been taking this\nmedicine for a long time, and we have yet to see the\ndoctor. In Johannesburg, a whole chapter was devoted\nto the cause of the small island developing States. In\nApril of this year, the Commission on Sustainable\nDevelopment paved the way for an international\nmeeting to be held in Mauritius in 2004.\nYet despite all these signs of good intentions, the\nreality is that, when small island developing States try\nto see that these decisions or undertakings are reflected\nin other international forums, our proposals in most\ncases are either rejected or rendered impotent after\nintense and difficult negotiations. The Canc\u00fan meeting\nis a good example, as is the recent meeting of\nConvention bodies such as the Eighth Conference of\nthe Parties to the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change in New Delhi in 2002,\nand the Sixth Conference of the Parties to the United\nNations Convention to Combat Desertification, held in\nHavana recently. This undesirable situation needs to be\naddressed if small island developing States are to\nbenefit from the positive outcomes of international\nmeetings or review conferences.\n23\n\nAs we march towards Mauritius, small island\ndeveloping States will have to endure due process in\nthe Second Committee and at the twelfth session of the\nCommission on Sustainable Development in order to\nestablish administrative and financial norms for the\ninternational meeting. My delegation suspects that\nthere will be many bumps and detours on the way, but\nour hope is that, at the end of the road, the outcome\nwill focus on what needs to be done \u2014 when and by\nwhom \u2014 to overcome impediments in the\nimplementation of the Programme of Action.\nIt is not sufficient to rely solely on the Barbados\nProgramme of Action to address all the development\nproblems of small island developing States. To that\nend, Nauru sees the Millennium Development Goals as\nsupplementing the Programme of Action by adding the\nhuman development dimension to the scope of issues\nthat should be addressed and by offering partnership to\ndrive the process.\nHowever, for small island States like Nauru, the\ncomplex reporting requirement of the Goals is adding\nto the burden of reports that we are required to prepare,\nand therefore it is the considered view of my\ndelegation that the United Nations Development\nProgramme should tailor the questionnaire to suit a\ngroup of clients rather than use a one-size-fits-all\napproach. Assistance also should be provided to\ncountries such as Nauru to collect and process the raw\ndata required for the report.\nNauru, like other low-lying small island States,\nsees the Kyoto Protocol as its salvation from sea-level\nrise and climate change, which would devastate our\nalready fragile ecological system, which is essential to\nour livelihood and culture. My delegation understands\nthat the Russian Federation now stands between the\nKyoto Protocol\u2019s coming into force and its continuing\nto languish. If that is the case, then Nauru calls on the\nRussian Federation to do what is universally right and\njust by ratifying the protocol before the meeting of the\nNinth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, to be held\nin Italy in December this year.\nA healthy Pacific Ocean and the sustainable use\nof its natural resources, including highly migratory fish\nstocks, are also critical to our livelihood. We in the\nPacific have walked the talk on these issues through\nthe development of an ocean policy to guide us in the\nmanagement of our part of the Pacific Ocean and to\nform the framework for future regional ocean-related\ninitiatives.\nSecondly, we have adopted a Convention on the\nConservation and Management of Highly Migratory\nFish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean,\nwhich provides a comprehensive regime for the\nmanagement of the region\u2019s highly migratory fish\nstocks, both in our exclusive economic zone and in the\nhigh seas.\nThe trans-shipment of nuclear waste through our\nwaters is of great concern to many island countries\nbecause of the damage it could cause.\nMy delegation has stated during previous debates\nthat it agrees fully with the proposal to reform the\nSecurity Council to bring it into tune with the realities\nof today\u2019s world order. We are disappointed that, after\n10 years of debate, there is still no convergence of\nviews between the two camps on how to move forward.\nTo try to address the expansion along with the\nquestion of the veto would be like riding a dead\nhorse \u2014 we would not go anywhere, which is exactly\nthe situation we are in.\nFurthermore, my delegation believes that we have\ndone all we can do at the representative level, and that\nthe only way we can make progress is to take it to a\nhigher level, so that our political leaders can review\nwhat we have done and make a decision on how to\nmove forward.\nOn the question of reforms to operational policies\nand administrative structures, including budgetary\naspects of the United Nations, my delegation fully\nsupports the actions taken by the Secretary-General in\nthis regard, but it appears that much more has to be\ndone. The areas of review have to be enlarged and\nintensified, if indeed the prediction that the regular\nbudget is going to exceed the $3 billion mark is\ncorrect.\nFinally, concerning reform, my delegation fully\nsupports the view expressed by Australia that the group\nsystem needs modernization. Most of the Pacific small\nisland countries are buried in the Asian group, which\nextends from the Pacific Ocean to the Suez Canal,\nwhile our big brothers, Australia and New Zealand, are\n\u201cOthers\u201d in the Western European group. Outside the\nUnited Nations system, the Pacific is usually grouped\nwith East Asia, in both economic and geopolitical\nzoning. We see no reason why this cannot be the case\n24\n\nat the United Nations, considering that the divide\nbetween Eastern and Western Europe will become\nmeaningless as the two converge.\nNauru, because of biased and incorrect media\nreports over the last five years, now carries a stigma as\na haven for money-laundering through offshore banks\nregistered in Nauru. There have also been reports that\nour Citizen Investment Programme is aiding and\nabetting criminals and terrorists, allowing them free\nmovement by making possible the acquisition of\nNauruan passports.\nThe reluctance of foreign authorities to provide\nproof of allegations of criminal activities by banks\nregistered in Nauru prevented the Government from\ninitiating the mechanism provided for in our legislation\nto release information on offshore banks to foreign\nauthorities. This has put us on a collision course.\nNauru was not surprised when, in 2000, the\nFinancial Action Task Force (FATF) of the\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment (OECD) listed it along with others as a\nnon-cooperating country. The following year, Nauru\u2019s\nstatus was further downgraded, and it was put on the\nlist for \u201ccountermeasures\u201d by members of FATF, not\nbecause our laws were insufficient, but because the\ngoalposts were shifted and our failure involved a lack\nof capacity and capability to supervise the offshore\nbanks registered in Nauru.\nIn December 2002, the United States\nGovernment, in taking up FATF\u2019s call to apply\ncountermeasures against Nauru, announced that Nauru\nwould be designated a \u201cmoney-laundering\u201d country\nunder the provisions of the Patriotic Act. The highest\nlevel of sanctions would be applied, which would\nprohibit all commercial and financial transactions\nbetween any Nauru-registered financial institution and\nthe United States. In May 2003 Nauru was accordingly\ninformed and was given 30 days to show cause as to\nwhy the sanction should not be applied.\nNauru submitted its comments, passed new laws\nin March of this year repealing the registration of\noffshore banks, and included a sunset clause\nterminating the licenses that would come into effect 30\nto 180 days \u2014 as the case may be \u2014 from 27 March\n2003, when the law came into force. The Government\nhas also suspended the Citizen Investment Programme\nwhile it reviews the law, in order to address the\nconcerns expressed by the United States Department of\nState.\nA new anti-money-laundering law was passed in\nMarch, and work is in progress on omnibus legislation\nthat would address the financing of terrorism,\ntransnational organized crime and money-laundering.\nNauru also signed an article 98 agreement with the\nUnited States.\nIn the process, Nauru has lost close to $2 million,\nif not more, in revenue, which is a drop in the ocean to\nOECD members but real money to us, considering that\nit is equivalent to 5 per cent of the Government\u2019s\nannual budget. We are now waiting to learn our fate \u2014\nawaiting the judgement of the United States and the\nFATF, as the two are interlinked.\nTo conclude, Nauru, small as it is, believes that\npower consists in a nation\u2019s capacity to link its will\nwith the purpose of others, to lead by reason and give\nthe gift of cooperation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt\ngives me great pleasure to convey to you, Sir, and to\nyour friendly country, Saint Lucia, our sincere\ncongratulations on your election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-eighth session. I am\nconfident that your great skills and abilities will\nguarantee the success of our proceedings at this\nsession. I also would like to express to your\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, deep appreciation for his\nremarkable stewardship of the fifty-seventh session.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to\nextend to Mr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the\nUnited Nations, our thanks and appreciation for his\ntireless efforts to strengthen the role of our\nOrganization in order to enable it to attain its\nobjectives of achieving peace, security and\ndevelopment in the world.\nSince the opening of the previous Assembly\nsession, the world has witnessed a series of\ndevelopments that have contributed to the further\ndeterioration of global security and stability. Crises and\nconflicts are proliferating, while there has been an\nincrease in poverty and exclusion and in the spread of\ndisease in many parts of the world. Faced with this\narray of challenges, the international community is\ncalled upon to assume its responsibilities and take\nresolute action. All Member States must renew their\ncommitment to the noble principles enshrined in the\nCharter of the United Nations, work together in the\nframework of an international consensus to strengthen\nthe role of our Organization in the maintenance of\npeace and security and find solutions to current\ninternational issues. We are convinced that that is the\nbest way to ensure that the world is governed by the\nprinciples of dialogue, cooperation and consensus.\nThe new challenges facing the international\ncommunity and the necessity of establishing relations\nbased on justice, equity and harmony, demand that we\nunite our efforts to ensure that the United Nations\nremains the framework for our common endeavours to\npreserve peace and security \u2014 the embodiment of\ninternational law, to which all countries must be\ncommitted and which they must implement in a non-\nselective manner, without double standards.\nThese new challenges also require the United\nNations to enhance its efficiency and improve its\nworking methods, taking into account the noble\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter, by strengthening its\nmain organs, particularly the Security Council, which\nmust regain its credibility with regard to the maintenance\nof international peace and security, and by revitalizing\nand enhancing the role of the General Assembly in the\ninterests of peace, security and development.\nIn this regard, we support the Secretary-General\u2019s\ncall to accelerate the introduction of necessary reforms,\nand we stress that Tunisia, which has participated in\nthe past in the debate on these reforms, stands ready to\ncontinue to contribute effectively to international\nefforts aimed at achieving this objective, which is now\nmore urgent than ever.\nWe are convinced that the deterioration of the\nglobal situation requires the international community to\nadopt a comprehensive and multidimensional approach,\nbased on the interdependence of peace and security on\nthe one hand, and development on the other. We\nbelieve that peace and security cannot prevail\nthroughout the world unless the development needs of\nall peoples are addressed. We also recognize that\ndevelopment cannot be achieved in the absence of\nsecurity and peace for all.\nOf course the pursuit of such an objective will\nrequire all members of the international community to\npool their efforts and show greater solidarity so as to\neliminate the root causes of tension and to eradicate\npoverty and deprivation, which are breeding grounds\nfor trouble and instability.\nSince the change of 7 November 1987, Tunisia\nhas called for the adoption of such an approach and has\npresented, at the regional and international levels,\nnumerous initiatives and proposals, whose objective is\nto build the foundation for a world with a greater\ncapacity to attain the goal of peace, security and\ndevelopment and to spread the values of dialogue,\ntolerance and solidarity among all peoples.\n20\n\nIn this context, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali\nof Tunisia called in 1989, from this lofty rostrum, for\nthe conclusion of a pact for peace and progress in the\nframework of the United Nations, drawing together the\ncountries of the North and the South and based on\npeace and justice and the strengthening of cooperation\namong all countries of the world.\nAll the initiatives and proposals put forward by\nthe President of Tunisia since that date have been\nconsistent with that call, as they stem from the\ndetermination of Tunisia and its President to ensure the\neffectiveness of our country\u2019s contribution to\naddressing issues of peace, security and development,\nparticularly in relation to the phenomenon of terrorism\nand the means of combating it and to the\nimplementation of mechanisms for conflict resolution\nin the Arab and African regions.\nIn line with the comprehensive character of the\nTunisian approach, the President of Tunisia has\nconsistently called on the international community to\nhelp developing countries strengthen their economies\nthrough a number of regional and international\ninitiatives such as those related to debt relief, in\nparticular debt recycling for middle-income countries;\nthe transfer of science and technology to developing\ncountries and a call for the convening of a world\nsummit on the information society.\nPresident Ben Ali also called for the\ndissemination of the values of solidarity and\ncompassion as a means of contributing to the\neradication of poverty, marginalization and exclusion\nin all parts of the world \u2014 a call that led to the\nestablishment of the World Solidarity Fund.\nTunisia, which has succeeded in creating a\nsecure, stable and well-balanced society that is\nintegrated into the mainstream of the modern world,\nbelieves that the well-being of humankind is the\nultimate objective and, on the basis of its own national\nexperience, that the fight against extremism and\nterrorism, which constitute a serious threat to the entire\nworld, cannot succeed unless it is comprehensive and\nmultidimensional in nature and takes into account not\nonly the security dimension but also the need to\naddress the root causes of the phenomenon.\nWe therefore underscore the necessity of working\nto develop a common international approach to fighting\nthe phenomenon of extremism and terrorism, taking\ninto account all relevant international conventions.\nIn this context, pending the achievement of the\nnecessary progress in the adoption of a comprehensive\ninternational mechanism to fight terrorism, we would\nlike to reiterate Tunisia\u2019s call for the conclusion of a\ncode of conduct to fight terrorism, to which all\ncountries adhere and which will include the principles\naround which a consensus could be built. Such a code\nof conduct could constitute a common denominator in\ncollectively confronting this phenomenon. An\ninternational conference could be convened to lay the\ngroundwork for such a code of conduct.\nThe wide international support enjoyed by the\nproposal to establish the World Solidarity Fund\ntestifies to the need for such a mechanism, which is\naimed at reducing the suffering, poverty, exclusion and\nmarginalization endured by a great number of peoples\nthroughout the world, particularly in Africa.\nWhile we reiterate our sincere gratitude to\nMember States for their support for this initiative, we\nremain convinced that, as the Fund was set up in\nFebruary 2003 and has become one of the official\nmechanisms of the United Nations system, Member\nStates will spare no effort in speeding up its\noperationalization, thus allowing it to begin its\nactivities as soon as possible and thereby contribute to\nthe achievement of the Millennium Development\nGoals. We therefore urge the international community\nand all relevant actors, including State and private\norganizations, to mobilize the necessary financial\nresources for the Fund so as to allow it to fulfil its\nnoble humanitarian objectives. It is also imperative, in\nthis regard, to speed up the establishment of the\nproposed high-level committee, whose task is to define\nthe strategy of the World Solidarity Fund and to\nmobilize the resources needed for its activities.\nThe widening digital gap between industrialized\nand developing countries requires us to take the\nnecessary practical measures to enable all countries of\nthe world to take advantage of the broad prospects\nprovided by the technological revolution in the field of\ncommunications. In that context, Tunisia called for the\nconvening of a World Summit on the Information\nSociety. We are now intensifying our preparation for\nthe second phase of that Summit, which will be held in\nTunis in November 2005.\nWhile expressing its determination to contribute\neffectively to the first phase, which is due to be held in\nGeneva in December this year, Tunisia will do its\n21\n\nutmost to ensure that the Tunis summit will constitute\nan opportunity to elaborate a common approach, in\norder to contribute to strengthening cooperation\nbetween all members of the international community\nand to consolidate the role of information and\ncommunication technologies in development. We are\nconfident that the member States that chose Tunisia to\nhost the Summit will do their utmost to make the\nsummit a success.\nConvinced of the role of sports in strengthening the\nbonds of friendship, cooperation and rapprochement\nbetween peoples, and taking into account the\nimportance of physical education as an instrument to\nconsolidate the foundations of peace and promote\ndevelopment in the world, Tunisia decided to present to\nthis session of the General Assembly a draft resolution\nproclaiming the year 2004 an international year of\nsports and physical education in the service of peace\nand development. We express the hope that this\nproposal, which has already received the support of the\nAfrican Union and the Organization of the Islamic\nConference, will get wide support from the international\ncommunity and other international sports bodies.\nThe Middle East continues to suffer from a cycle\nof violence and tension. The road map, which Tunisia\nsupported, revived hope for the resumption of the\npeace process. However, that hope was soon faced with\nIsrael\u2019s insistence on imposing the reality of occupation\nand continuous military campaigns against the Palestinian\npeople, including the decision to expel President Yasser\nArafat, despite the Palestinian Authority\u2019s readiness to\nfulfil its commitments in the framework of the road\nmap. In the face of the deteriorating situation, we\nbelieve that the international community, particularly\nthe members of the Quartet, should not allow the will\nof peace to be defeated and should therefore spare no\neffort to enhance the peace process.\nWhile reiterating its attachment to the peace\nprocess and its determination to contribute effectively\nto its success, Tunisia stresses the need to respect the\nlegitimacy of the Palestinian Authority and its\nleadership, chosen freely by the Palestinian people. We\nalso believe that, given the continuing tragic conditions\nof the Palestinian people, it is high time to heed the call\nmade by President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali during the\nExtraordinary Arab Summit held in Cairo in October\n2000 to provide the Palestinian people with\ninternational protection, particularly as that call was\nsupported by many States.\nThe ongoing suffering of the Iraqi people is a\nsource of great concern and profound preoccupation for\nthe international community. While remaining attached\nto the principle of the independence and territorial\nintegrity of Iraq, we wish to emphasize the need for the\ninternational community to join hands and for the\nUnited Nations to assume its central role to ensure that\npeace and stability prevail in that fraternal country,\nthus allowing for the start of reconstruction and the\nreturn to normal life for the Iraqi people.\nIn that regard, Tunisia hopes that the adoption of\nthe first steps, which were welcomed by Security\nCouncil resolution 1500 (2003), will lead as soon as\npossible to restoration of the sovereignty of the Iraqi\npeople. Furthermore, while condemning in the\nstrongest possible terms the terrorist attack against the\nUnited Nations headquarters in Baghdad, we pay a\ntribute to the Secretary-General, who, despite the\ngravity of that painful attack, decided to let the United\nNations continue to pursue its efforts of helping the\nIraqi people overcome their present predicament.\nTunisia attaches great importance to the various\nforms of integration and partnership within the regional\ngroupings it belongs to. In that regard, we avail\nourselves of this opportunity to express our deep\nsatisfaction following the agreement reached between\nsisterly Libya and the United States, Great Britain and\nFrance on the issues relating to the Lockerbie and\nUnion de transports a\u00e9riens incidents, following\nTripoli\u2019s fulfilment of all its commitments under the\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. We have no\ndoubt that, now that the sanctions have been\ncompletely lifted, Libya will fully resume its role in the\nMaghreb and Mediterranean regions, thus contributing\nto reinvigorating the Arab Maghreb Union, which will\nhelp promote more complementarity and integration\nbetween the countries of the region and will\nconsolidate the foundations of security, stability and\nprosperity in the Maghreb, Arab, African and\nMediterranean areas.\nThe settlement of this dispute augurs well, as it\ncoincides with the preparations Tunisia is undertaking to\nhost the first summit of the 5+5 dialogue, to be held in\nDecember 2003, among the countries of the Maghreb and\nthe European countries of the western Mediterranean.\nWe look forward to this event as a step towards\nenhancing partnership between the countries of the\nregion and deepening the values of dialogue, tolerance\nand moderation among the peoples of that region.\n22\n\nConvinced of the need to strengthen common\nArab action and to consolidate the role of the League\nof Arab States to enable it to attain its noble objectives,\nTunisia shall endeavour, during its presidency of the\nnext Arab Summit in 2004, to further strengthen the\nbonds of cooperation, solidarity and complementarity\namong the Arab countries.\nThe most recent African Union Summit, held in\nMaputo in July 2003, marked the beginning of the\nlaunching process of the African Union. The African\nUnion is determined to achieve the objective of\nrevitalizing the African continent and to confront the\nserious challenges it faces. The Union hopes to get the\nnecessary international support in order to achieve its\ngoals.\nUndoubtedly, the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s\nDevelopment (NEPAD), which is bringing a new vision\nfor a serious and constructive partnership with the\nUnited Nations system, its specialized agencies, the\ndeveloped countries and other relevant institutions,\ndeserves the support of the international community.\nSuch support constitutes an incentive for the African\nUnion to attempt to meet legitimate African needs and\naddress all aspects of marginalization in our continent.\nThe difficult global economic environment has\nhad an adverse impact on the economies of the\ndeveloping countries in general and the African\neconomies in particular. Fierce trade competition and\nprotectionist measures, as well as currency fluctuations\nand the exacerbation of the debt burden, constitute\nmajor constraints that have impeded progress of the\ndeveloping countries.\nIn that regard, we emphasize the need for all\ninternational partners to show the political will necessary\nto implement the commitments of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals, as well as the outcomes of major\nUnited Nations conferences and summits, notably the\nInternational Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment held in Monterrey and the World Summit\non Sustainable Development held in Johannesburg, if\nwe are to overcome this difficult situation and provide\nfresh impetus to development efforts.\nThe difficult situation we face today should not\ndiscourage us or weaken our determination to achieve\nthe objectives of peace, security and stability. We must\nshow patience, resolve and perseverance and\ncollectively pledge to strengthen the United Nations\nand make this session a new starting point for our\nOrganization in order to enable it to effectively play its\nrole and respond to our collective aspirations for a\nmore secure and stable world.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session. That is\na significant tribute to you and to Saint Lucia. Estonia,\nlike Saint Lucia, is a small State, and together we can\nadmit that the United Nations is an Organization that\nallows small States to participate on equal footing with\nlarge ones in influencing global processes. I also\ncommend your predecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, for his\naccomplishments in presiding over the fifty-seventh\nsession of the General Assembly. I am particularly\npleased to do so in the light of the similar histories of\nEstonia and the Czech Republic and of our common\nendeavours to join the family of democratic nations,\nthe European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty\nAlliance.\nThe fifty-eighth regular session is the first since\nthe outbreak of the war in Iraq. This year has been a\ndifficult one, both for the United Nations and for the\nentire world. Long and emotional debates in the\nSecurity Council preceded the Iraq crisis. Many think\nthat the war, rising tensions among States and the\ncountry\u2019s post-war reconstruction have tested the\nOrganization\u2019s capabilities, its credibility and its role in\nthe world. I should like to believe, not that the past\nyear has undermined the Organization\u2019s morale, but the\ncontrary. Those ordeals and the Iraq war have served as\na lesson and have deepened our conviction that the\nUnited Nations should be even more decisive and\nefficient in the future than it is today.\nUnfortunately, the crisis in Iraq has affected more\nthan the morale of the United Nations. Although the\nOrganization has been the target of terrorist attacks\nbefore \u2014 such an attack was planned against United\nNations Headquarters many years ago \u2014 the terrorist\nbombings of the United Nations headquarters in Iraq a\ncouple of days ago and on 19 August \u2014 which claimed\nmore than 20 lives \u2014 were unprecedented. Terrorism\nand violence never choose their victims and it is\nsignificant that the United Nations, as an Organization\nfor global peace and stability uniting all States of the\nworld, was targeted.\nI would like to emphasize that Estonia has\nresolutely condemned the terrorist attack on the United\nNations mission in Baghdad. Together with all\nrepresentatives here, the people of Estonia and I are in\ndeep morning over the tragic murder of Sergio Vieira\nde Mello, Special Representative of the Secretary-\nGeneral, and others. I deeply sympathize with their\nrelatives and colleagues.\nA terrorist act against people who are committed\nto assisting the people of Iraq is a painful blow to the\nUnited Nations and a crime against the people of Iraq\nand the international community. However, it cannot\nserve as an impetus for the United Nations to withdraw\nfrom hot spots. Estonia welcomes the statement made\nby Secretary-General Kofi Annan that, despite the\nattacks, the United Nations will continue its activity in\nIraq. Terrorists should not determine the future of Iraq\n8\n\nor make the people of that country and the international\ncommunity withdraw from the goal of building up a\nsovereign, democratic and prosperous Iraq.\nRecent events have even more clearly\ndemonstrated the need for the presence of stabilization\nforces in Iraq. In order to enforce peace and stability in\nthe Persian Gulf region, enhanced cooperation between\ncoalition forces, the United Nations and the\ninternational community is necessary. Despite its small\nsize and moderate resources, Estonia is also actively\ninvolved. In May 2003, the Estonian Parliament\napproved the deployment of a unit of the Estonian\nDefence Forces to peace enforcement operations in\nIraq and Estonian servicemen joined the mission in the\nPersian Gulf region in June. Estonia has acceded to all\n12 United Nations anti-terrorist conventions and is\nactively cooperating with many States and international\norganizations.\nNow I will proceed to a central topic of my\naddress \u2014 the environment and sustainable\ndevelopment. I consider a sustainable approach to the\nenvironment and sustainable development to be one of\nthe most significant commitments, both for the United\nNations and for States. In the long term, the welfare\nand conditions of peoples will depend primarily on our\nability or will to use wisely and sparingly the limited\nresources of our planet and to shape the environment\nwe live in. With respect to the ever-growing population\nof the world, increased production and consumption, as\nwell as the resulting pollution, the pressure of human\nactivity on our living environment is continuously\nbuilding. In the circumstances, environmental\nprotection and ensuring the welfare of mankind and\nwildlife are becoming an ever-more important and\ndifficult task. It is not by chance that the United\nNations proclaimed the year 2003 as the International\nYear of Fresh Water and that the year 2002 focused on\neco-tourism and mountain regions.\nTwenty years ago, the General Assembly adopted\na resolution establishing the World Commission on\nEnvironment and Development to define global\nproblems and to find ways of solving them. Gro\nHarlem Brundtland headed the Commission. The report\nentitled Our Common Future, completed in 1987,\ndefined sustainable development. The main message of\nthe report was that economic growth and increased\nwelfare of the people should not compromise the\nability of future generations and the environment to\nmeet their own needs. Global economic development\nshould take into consideration the tolerance thresholds\nof the environment and the need to preserve natural\nresources.\nSustainable development, as a cohesive\ndevelopment of the socio-economic field and the\nenvironment, has become a priority of most\ndemocracies throughout the world, especially after the\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. As the head of\nthe Estonian delegation to the Conference, I signed\nAgenda 21 and the Framework Conventions on Climate\nChange and Biological Diversity.\nEleven years have passed since the Rio de Janeiro\nConference. Considering developments since then, we\nsee that some progress in global environmental\ncooperation among States has taken place. New goals\nwere set and interim conclusions made at the special\nsession of the General Assembly in New York in 1997\nand at the World Summit on Sustainable Development\nin Johannesburg in 2002. The General Assembly\nsession in 2000 agreed on the Millennium Declaration,\nwith the main goal set as environmental sustainability.\nHowever, we must note that the world\u2019s\npopulation has grown by 1 billion since the Rio de\nJaneiro Conference in 1992. In the 1990s, the world\ngross domestic product grew by an average of 2.6 per\ncent a year. No doubt, sooner or later these processes\nare going to influence the living environment of us all.\nAlthough we cannot as yet define the actual\nrelationship between human activity and the climate of\nour planet, a glimpse into the climate changes of the\nlast decade is worrying. Natural phenomena like El\nNi\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a have had a lasting impact on human\nlife. Floods, droughts, tornadoes and extreme\nfluctuations of temperature have become nearly daily\nrealities on our planet. European States have not\nremained untouched by the climate changes. In 1997,\nfloods devastated Eastern Europe; last summer,\nWestern and Central Europe were hit by a heat wave.\nThese facts should convince us that environmental\nprotection is a matter of common concern for all\nmankind.\nCooperation readiness is extremely important and\nEstonia has done its best to collaborate. We have\nacceded to all essential environmental conventions and\nwish all other States in the world to do the same.\nEstonia ratified the Framework Convention on Climate\nChange on 27 July 1994 and acceded to the Kyoto\n9\n\nProtocol on 17 November 1998. In unison with the\nEuropean Union, Estonia expresses its clear\ndetermination to enforce the Kyoto Protocol as soon as\npossible.\nEstonia is a small State with moderate resources,\nplaying a small role in the world economy and the\nenvironment. Nevertheless, we adhere to the principle,\n\u201cact local, think global\u201d. Environmental protection is\nextremely important. Estonia has a long tradition of\nnature conservation. As early as in 1297, King Erik\nMenved of Denmark banned cutting forests on several\nEstonian islands. In 1995, four years after regaining\nindependence, Estonia adopted its Sustainable\nDevelopment Act. In 2001, at the recommendation of\nthe Committee on Sustainable Development, the\nGovernment of Estonia approved a strategy of\nsustainable development \u2014 Sustainable Estonia 21.\nMore than in any other field, inter-State\ncooperation is important in environmental protection,\nand regional organizations play a substantial role in\nthis regard. The Baltic Sea States have displayed\nremarkable initiative, which other regions of the world\nwould find worth following. The Baltic Sea regional\nsustainable development process was launched in 1996.\nIt is unique in the world \u2014 an Agenda 21 for the Baltic\nSea States \u2014 Baltic 21. The parties to the process\ninclude all Baltic Sea States and the European\nCommission. The process targets the elaboration and\nthe implementation of sustainable development visions\nand an action plan for the entire region and key sectors.\nThe Baltic Sea joins the members of the Council\nof the Baltic Sea States (CBSS). It is especially\nappropriate to speak about the protection of the Baltic\nSea in the International Year of Fresh Water. Currently,\nEstonia holds the CBSS presidency, and the protection\nof the environment, first and foremost of the Baltic\nSea, is among the top priorities of the presidency.\nDuring our presidency, we would like to focus on new\nhazards arising from the intensifying marine traffic on\nthe Baltic Sea. Estonia is targeting its efforts towards\nachieving an agreement between member States to\nreduce the oil-tanker-pollution hazard to a minimum.\nEstonia supports the initiative of the European Union\nto ban the traffic of single-hull tankers on the Baltic\nSea, and is committed to having the Baltic Sea\nclassified as a Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA).\nI would like to conclude by stressing that,\nalthough I have touched only upon terrorism and the\nenvironment, Estonia fully shares all the priorities of\nthe European Union (EU) at the fifty-eighth session of\nthe General Assembly, particularly, the non-\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction,\npeacekeeping, the protection of human rights and\ncombating the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\nThe future of the United Nations is also important\nfor Estonia. The United Nations needs to be improved\nand restructured. Estonia has favoured the overall\nstrengthening of our common Organization and\nwelcomes the efforts of Secretary-General Kofi Annan\nto revitalize the United Nations, primarily the General\nAssembly. In our opinion, reform of the Security\nCouncil should enable the United Nations to participate\nmore efficiently in problem-solving and crisis\nresolution throughout the world.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s recent report on the\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration is a\nsignificant and important document that deserves\ndetailed analysis and serious consideration. Isn\u2019t it time\nfor the United Nations family to support the Secretary-\nGeneral in his concern about the Organization now and\nabout its future? Let us agree \u2014 both the large and the\nsmall Member States \u2014 upon what we would like to\naccomplish and when, and let us move steadily ahead.\nOnly a strong United Nations, with efficient decision-\nmaking mechanisms, can ensure global welfare and\nbalance. Let that be a goal for us.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe United Nations is at a crossroads. The fifty-eighth\nsession of the General Assembly is taking place at a\ncritical time in the history of the Organization.\nHowever, that moment could also be decisive for the\nfuture of the Organization. Recent developments on the\ninternational scene represent a call to action that\ncompels us to review its organization and rules so that\nit may serve all nations.\nYour election, Mr. President, to the presidency of\nthe principal body of the United Nations will contribute\nto the achievement of those objectives. I would also\nlike to pay tribute to Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan\nfor his dedication to the cause of international peace\nand security and for his ongoing desire to achieve the\ncommon good of mankind.\nInternational peace and security continue to be\ndangerously precarious as internal conflicts and\nconfrontations between States proliferate in many\nregions of the world. We believe that the refusal to\n6\n \nimplement obligations imposed upon States under\ninternational law and the violation of the provisions of\nthe Charter are two areas of grave concern to us. Never\nsince its creation has the Organization been confronted\nwith so many situations and divergent views seriously\nthreatening the attainment of its goals. Unity and\ncohesion among the members of the Security Council\nare essential in order to strengthen the credibility of the\nUnited Nations and the confidence of Member States\nand to ensure that organ's effectiveness, as it is the\norgan with primary responsibility for the maintenance\nof international peace and security.\n\nLet me mention the struggle against terrorism,\nwhich no longer hesitates to attack our Organization.\nOn this issue, Madagascar is truly at one with the\ninternational community in its struggle against that\nscourge. Accordingly, we have ratified the 12 existing\ninternational conventions to combat terrorism. We take\nthis opportunity to pay heartfelt tribute to the late\nSergio Vieira de Mello, our Representative in Iraq.\nThe creativity and courage of our Secretary-\nGeneral in shouldering his responsibilities and\ncommitments to peace and security, in a spirit of\nsolidarity, deserve the support of all. We endorse the\nrecommendations contained in his report aimed at\nstrengthening the United Nations. We hope to see\nchanges in our Organization that would place greater\nemphasis on the importance of the General Assembly\nas the principal deliberative and decision-making organ\nand on rendering the Security Council more\nrepresentative and more transparent.\nSuch reforms are necessary in order to protect the\nsovereignty of smaller nations. They are indispensable,\nfor the common interests of the peoples of the world\nshould have no platform other than the General\nAssembly. We support the proposals made by Mr.\nCouchepin, President of the Swiss Federation, to forge\na new vision of security by increasingly involving\nindividuals in the deliberative process.\nA strong United Nations will be able to find\nsolutions for integrating economic and social questions\ninto the framework of the peace and security of peoples.\nThe economic and social situation in the world\nremains a source of great concern. The beneficial\nimpact of global economic growth has circumvented\nour island, as it has done with other countries in Africa.\nIn the course of this past decade, major United Nations\nconferences have pinpointed strategies and established\nobjectives to achieve sustainable human development.\nBut we still need to mobilize the necessary resources to\nimplement, together, the declarations we all adopted  \ndeclarations which kindled so much hope in our\npeoples, who are languishing in dire poverty.\nThe Millennium Declaration set deadlines for a\nnumber of common objectives for all Member States.\nSuch goals are achievable, but they remain to be\nattained. The new form of international cooperation\nbased on partnerships between the public and private\nsectors offers us this opportunity, particularly since this\nis a mutually advantageous relationship.\nThe Economic and Social Council, in the\nDeclaration it adopted on 2 July last, emphasizes the\nimportance of partnerships at the national and\ninternational levels with a view to promoting\ncooperation among various sectors. The Economic and\nSocial Council solemnly committed itself to facilitating\nand supporting the creation of alliances between\nGovernments, donors, non-governmental organizations,\ncivil society, decentralized communities and the private\nsector in order to promote integrated rural\ndevelopment. Our country is very pleased at having\nbeen elected to preside over the United Nations Public-\nPrivate Alliance for Rural Development and at having\nbeen chosen as the first pilot country.\nMadagascar, like most African countries, has not\nbenefited from the world economic expansion. More\nthan 70 per cent of the population of Madagascar still\nlives below the poverty line. Fifty per cent of the\npopulation has no access to drinking water, and, as a\nresult, 50,000 children die annually. I am not going to\npass judgement here, but I an convinced that a\nfundamental dilemma exists: the past does not loom as\nlarge in other parts of the world as it does in Africa. In\nAfrica, the past is part and parcel of the structure of\nsociety and of people's mindsets.\nAt the same time, we are confronted with the\nchallenges of the policies, values, economic trends and\ntechnology of the twenty-first century. Africa is\nsuffering from major gaps in this respect, more than\nother continents. To bridge such gaps is not an easy\nprocess. Whatever the case may be, Africa must take\nup the challenges of the future and undertake the\n7\n \nimplementation of good governance and of a rapid and\nsustainable economic development.\nToday's Madagascar is a different country. It is\naiming to establish a true democracy based on the rule\nof law and on respect for international law. Good\ngovernance, the rule of law, the combat against\ncorruption, decentralization, participation of the\npopulation and the support of the private sector are its\npillars. Restoring the confidence of economic players,\nestablishing conducive and secure conditions for\nbusiness and sharing responsibilities are key, with the\nState playing the role of facilitator. These are the main\nunderpinnings of our economic activities.\nLet us not forget that the key to success is the\nright approach. In order to encourage investments,\nvarious laws have been enacted in order to reduce\nimport taxes and duties on capital goods. At present\nforeign investors can own real estate.\nFurthermore, agreements to protect investments\nhave been signed or are being prepared. We are\nextremely grateful for the efforts undertaken by\nnational and international donors. Personally speaking,\nI know that it is not easy to collect the necessary funds\nfor poor countries when the world economy itself is\nshowing signs of weakness.\nI am convinced that the efforts of African\ncountries designed to improve their cooperation in the\ncontext of the African Union, the New Partnership for\nAfrica's Development, the Common Market for Eastern\nand Southern Africa (COMESA), the Southern African\nDevelopment Community (SADC), the Indian Ocean\nRim and other organizations will lead to the expected\nresults.\nBut this is not enough. Madagascar is opening up,\nand I dare to hope that other countries will also follow\nsuit. But the world itself is not opening up, as was seen\nat Cancun. Why then can we not use as an example the\nEuropean expansion process? This may be difficult and\ncostly, but the outcome is promising and the procedures\nare already known.\nWill the international community and the African\ncountries find a common vision for the future of\nAfrica? Personally, I believe that it is high time that the\nmajor Powers took steps towards a more equitable\npartnership. We receive credits, grants, experts and\nprogrammes, but what do we read in the international\npress every day? That Africa is a forgotten continent.\nUnfortunately, this is true. We are far away from the\nstrategic spheres of the think tanks, of the heads of\nState of the major Powers, and of the chief executive\nofficers of large corporations. In other words, Africa\nremains the victim of marginalization.\nDoes the international community have\nconfidence in the future of Africa? Is it not true that it\nis urgent to develop a different outlook for our\ncontinent?\nWe have this confidence. Our objectives are clear,\nbut our capacities are still low. We need assistance in\nthe area of capacity enhancement in order to attain the\nobjectives we have set for ourselves. We are ready to\nwork tirelessly; we are ready for change, ready for\nopenness. However, we would like to have more\nsupport, greater openness and especially a different\noutlook and a new vision for our own continent in this\nconcert of nations.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me\nbegin by expressing warm congratulations to Mr. Julian\nHunte on his election as President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-eighth session. I can assure him of\nthe full cooperation of the Jordanian delegation to\nensure the fulfilment of his mandate for the benefit of\nall peoples and nations. I should also like to take this\nopportunity to express our thanks and appreciation to\nhis predecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, for his remarkable\nstewardship of the previous session.\nA special tribute is due to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his efforts dedicated to upholding\nthe lofty goals of the Organization. Mr. Annan has been\nquite dynamic in his work to enhance this world body\u2019s\neffectiveness and to revitalize its functions, especially\nin the areas of international peace and security, human\n26\n\nrights and social and economic progress throughout the\nworld.\nI wish to express our heartfelt condolences to the\nSecretary-General as well as to the family of Mr.\nSergio Vieira de Mello and to those of all his\ncolleagues who lost their lives as a result of the\nterrorist bombing of the United Nations headquarters in\nIraq, a barbaric act that we all condemn.\nThe sad collapse of the Oslo process\ndemonstrated that a revival of the Middle East peace\nprocess under the previous terms was no longer a\nviable option. Peace-making in the region requires a\nnew modus operandi, as all transitional arrangements\nhave failed to establish and build mutual confidence\nbetween the two sides and to meet the envisioned\ngoals. Thus, the time has indeed come for a shift in\napproach. Instead of managing the conflict in a way\nthat has led thus far to a perpetuation of the cycle of\nviolence, our focus should be redirected onto the final\nobjectives of the negotiations. Furthermore, it is no\nlonger useful to concentrate only on security aspects\nwithout realizing that the problem is essentially\npolitical in nature and not only a question of security.\nIt was against that backdrop that George W. Bush,\nPresident of the United States, launched in June 2002\nhis vision for peace in the Middle East. On the basis of\nthat initiative, the road map was formulated and\nannounced. Jordan contributed to the development of\nthe road map, which generated a real turnaround in the\nregion\u2019s political landscape. It established a framework\nof mutual obligations, whose aim is to end the Israeli\noccupation and to establish an independent Palestinian\nstate on the basis of relevant United Nations\nresolutions and the Arab peace initiative. The road map\nset forth a specific three-year time frame for the birth\nof a Palestinian State. Furthermore, it provided for the\ncreation of a monitoring and assessment mechanism to\nensure viable implementation according to specific\ntimelines.\nIt was on the basis of that vision that the\nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan welcomed the road map\nwhen it was formally announced by the Quartet. At the\ntime, we expressed the hope that that impetus would\nhelp to restart the peace process on a solid foundation.\nHowever, Jordan also made it clear that the declaration\nin and of itself would be insufficient to create forward\nmovement towards our objectives. What was\nadditionally required was a genuine commitment on the\npart of the United States and the international\ncommunity to implement that vision. True to our\nexpectations, we sensed such a genuine commitment at\nthe two recent Sharm al-Sheikh and Aqaba summits.\nJordan, in the meantime, fully recognizes that\nrecent developments on the ground \u2014 especially the\ncollapse of the ceasefire, or hudna, arrangement\nbetween the Palestinian groups and Israel \u2014 create\nsevere and real risks and threats for the road map.\nNonetheless, we should stay the course with a view to\nimplementing the road map and putting an end to the\noccupation and the tragic killing of civilians on both\nthe Palestinian and Israeli sides. The hard work that we\nare investing in this exercise is worthwhile given the\npotential risk of failure and the absence of political\nopportunity again. Such failure would make for a more\ndangerous and complex scenario than before and would\njeopardize the interests and security of all actors.\nOn behalf of Jordan, I wish to urge from this\nworld podium all stakeholders \u2014 especially the\nmembers of the Quartet \u2014 to pursue their efforts to\nensure scrupulous implementation of the road map,\nwithout any modifications and in a way that guarantees\nby 2005 the establishment of a Palestinian State, with\nJerusalem as its capital, and the termination of the\nIsraeli occupation of all Arab territories occupied in\n1967. All that would be in keeping with the relevant\nUnited Nations resolutions and the Arab peace\ninitiative, which is a key component of the road map\nand provides a framework for peace \u2014 a peace that is\nacceptable to all peoples of the region and fulfils their\nlong-standing aspirations.\nAlong the same lines, we urge acceleration in the\ncreation of an effective political and security\nmonitoring mechanism to be operated by the Quartet.\nThat is essential to ensure strict implementation of, and\ncompliance with, without modifications, the respective\nobligations of both parties as set forth in the road map.\nTo us, such a mechanism is an essential component on\nwhich we must insist, because we consider it to be a\ntrue point of departure that would enable us to take\nadvantage of the historic window of opportunity and\nbring about comprehensive, just and lasting peace in\nthe entire Middle East.\nRegarding suicide attacks, I wish to reiterate that\nJordan took a principled position repudiating and\ncondemning such acts on both moral and political\ngrounds. We maintain that those operations have done\n27\n\nharm to the Palestinian cause and have resulted in the\nerosion of international sympathy for it. Furthermore,\nthey have shifted the global focus away from the core\nquestion of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian\nterritories and the pressing need to end that occupation.\nAlong the same lines, we condemn Israel\u2019s\nextrajudicial killing of Palestinian citizens. Let me\nstress once again that the prevailing atmosphere of\nviolence will only play into the hands of extremists on\nboth sides of the divide. Therefore, it is high time to\nimplement the road map as accepted by all parties and\nto take bold and expeditious steps to place the entire\npeace process back on an irreversible track.\nWe call upon Israel to change its current security\npolicy, which has failed to ensure security for the\nIsraelis. Rather, Israel should move towards restoration\nof confidence with the Palestinian side partner side so\nthat both can focus on the political process by engaging\nin a serious implementation of the road map. To this\nend, Israel must ease the suffering of the Palestinian\npeople by lifting the closures on Palestinian\ncommunities, removing the restrictions imposed on the\nPalestinian leadership and by withdrawing its military\nforces from the cities occupied since September 2000,\nin compliance with Security Council resolution 1402\n(2002).\nIn the same context, my Government condemns\nthe decision taken by the Government of Israel to\nremove, in principle, from the occupied Palestinian\nterritories, the Palestinian President, Yasser Arafat,\nwho was legitimately elected by his people. In our\nview, this decision seriously imperils the peace\nprocess. We call on the Government of Israel to reverse\nits decision, which otherwise will plunge the entire\nregion into a dangerous tunnel.\nJordan condemns the Israeli settlement activities\nthat take the form of unabated construction of\nsettlements on occupied Palestinian land. Israel must\nend these activities, which breach the basic norms of\ninternational law and, not least, impede ongoing efforts\nto put the peace process back on track. We demand that\nthe Government of Israel start dismantling all\nsettlements erected since March 2001. This is, after all,\na binding obligation of Phase I of the road map.\nWe also condemn the separation wall, which\nconsolidates Israeli occupation of Palestinian\nterritories, devours further Palestinian land, aggravates\nthe suffering of the Palestinian population and\nanticipates as a fait accompli, the future shape of the\nPalestinian State. While we demand that Israel cease\nforthwith the construction of the wall, we stress the\nneed to respect the status of the 4 June 1967 line.\nIraq has now entered a new phase during which\nthe brotherly people of that country are facing\nenormous hardships and challenges. The eyes of all\nIraqis are now set on the international community in\nthe hope of receiving every possible assistance that\nwould enable them to lay a solid foundation for\nbuilding a promising future that would include\nreconstructing their country and regaining its status as\nan active member in the Organization and of the\ninternational community.\nWhile we emphasize the need to safeguard the\nunity, territorial integrity and sovereignty of Iraq, to\nensure the withdrawal of the foreign occupation forces\nas quickly as possible and to enable the people of Iraq\nto determine their future by themselves, we welcome\nthe formation of the transitional Governing Council as\na first and important step towards a broad-based Iraqi\nGovernment that represents the full spectrum of the\nIraqi population, to be elected by the people of Iraq as\nexpeditiously as possible on the basis of a constitution\naccepted and endorsed by them. Against this backdrop,\nwe decided to deal positively with the Governing\nCouncil and with all political groups in Iraq. Let me\nelaborate that my Government has accepted the\nassumption by the representatives of the transitional\nIraqi Government of the seat of Iraq in the League of\nArab States on a temporary basis, based on the\nunderstanding that Iraq will subsequently move\ntowards drafting its constitution and holding elections\nleading to the formation of a representative Iraqi\nGovernment.\nWe must also emphasize our condemnation of the\nviolations of human rights and international law\ncommitted by the previous regime in Iraq, especially\nthe crimes of assassination, mass killings and mass\nburials, including the execution of Kuwaiti prisoners\nand detainees.\nAt this juncture, I wish to underline the central\nrole the United Nations must continue to play in Iraq.\nThe United Nations should remain an active player in\nthe forthcoming political process; its role should not be\nrestricted to humanitarian issues only. Our\nOrganization must assume the leading role in\noverseeing the political process in the forthcoming\n28\n\nstage, including the finalization of the drafting of the\nconstitution and supervision of the elections to be held\nin order to form a sovereign Iraqi Government.\nJordan condemns in the strongest possible terms\nthe cowardly terrorist attack against the United Nations\nheadquarters in Baghdad. Despite the immense tragedy\nsuffered by the United Nations, we do have trust in the\nresolve and ability of the United Nations system to\nmaintain its operations and assistance to the Iraqi\npeople.\nAs you are all aware, the Jordanian Embassy\ncomplex in Baghdad was also a target of a vicious\nterrorist attack that claimed many innocent lives.\nNonetheless, that appalling act reinforced our resolve\nto continue to reach out in every possible way to help\nour brothers in Iraq, in order to enable them to\novercome the overwhelming odds they have been\nenduring.\nTerrorism has proved to be a global phenomenon\nthat cuts across national boundaries and is not\nexclusive to a particular region, language, religion or\nrace. It is therefore imperative for all members and\ninstitutions of the world community to combat it and\neradicate it. Let me assure the Assembly that the\nGovernment and people of Jordan are determined to\nconfront this phenomenon which our citizens and\ninstitutions have suffered from for several decades.\nOnce again, let me reiterate our firm commitment to\ncooperate with all countries and international efforts in\nthe joint fight against terrorism.\nWe would like to express our full backing for the\nefforts aimed at achieving meaningful progress in the\ncurrent negotiations in the General Assembly to adopt\na comprehensive convention on combating terrorism\nand a convention on combating nuclear terrorism. We\nhope that these endeavors will prove successful in the\nformulation of a legal and specific definition of the\nconcept of terrorism which would set it apart from the\nrights protected under international law and\ninternational humanitarian law for States, peoples and\nindividuals.\nFor out part, Jordan repudiates all vicious\nfalsehoods and sinister campaigns to smear Arabs and\nMuslims with the label of terrorism. This phenomenon\nis in complete contradiction of the true nature and\nmeaning of the Islamic faith, which is anchored in the\nvalues of justice, tolerance, peaceful coexistence and\nreverence for humankind. Thus, we feel a pressing\nneed to pay due attention to the role that the dialogue\namong civilization plays in consolidating\nunderstanding and coexistence among peoples and\nnations. It also helps in eliminating the causes of\nextremism that emanate from a lack of genuine\nknowledge and comprehension of the essence of\nreligions and cultures that are based on disseminating a\nmessage of peace, understanding and acceptance of\nothers.\nThe political and economic developments\nunfolding in this era of globalization and information\ntechnology prompt us to accelerate the process of\npolitical and economic openness in the developing\ncountries. That will help in the evolution of stronger\nincentives for achieving further progress and stability.\nSuch an environment will be more amenable to\neconomic growth and will generate a stronger\nmomentum to eradicate poverty and human suffering as\nwe strive towards the fulfilment of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals.\nIn that context, democracy assumes a special\nrelevance, especially since it is essentially an inherent\nprocess that evolves from the cultures and specific\ncharacteristics of societies. Therefore, it is virtually\nuntenable to impose this concept on others in\nprescribed forms that might not be in concert with the\ncultural structures of those communities.\nIn Jordan, however, we are committed to pursue\nthe path of democratic reforms and development of the\nnational political process in all its aspects. In fact, that\nissue is quite high on our national agenda, and our\nexpectation is that further progress will be made in the\nenhancement of our democratic institutions.\nBearing this in mind, Jordan will be guided by the\nconclusions outlined in the extremely valuable United\nNations Development Programme report on Arab\nHuman Development. We are grateful to the UNDP and\nits team of Arab experts for their analytical methods in\nidentifying and profiling some pressing challenges\ncurrently facing the Arab world. Jordan views this\npublication with great interest and perceives it from an\nextremely positive perspective, given its merits in\nterms of data, analytical approach and practical and\nspecific objectives as well as its valuable science-based\nconclusions and recommendations.\nOur primary purpose should be how to improve\nthe role and performance of the United Nations in all\nspheres of its operations. More specifically, that should\n29\n\ninclude strengthening its role in the areas of preventive\ndiplomacy, the management of humanitarian crises,\nconflicts and wars, human rights violations, and the\nchallenges associated with globalization and the\ndevelopment of humankind.\nIn that regard, Jordan welcomes the fact that the\nInternational Criminal Court is entering a new phase in\nterms of the election of its Judges and Prosecutor,\nwhich is a further step in the establishment of\ninternational justice and in how violations of\ninternational humanitarian law are treated. As the\nGeneral Assembly is well aware, Jordan had the\nprivilege of working hard to make significant\ncontributions in support of the Court\u2019s creation and of\nthe entry into force of its Statute.\nIn the same vein, Jordan takes pride in the\nelection of Her Majesty Queen Rania Al-Abdullah to\nthe Board of Directors of the Victims\u2019 Trust Fund\nestablished for the victims of crimes falling under the\njurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. The\nFund is expected to have a tangible impact in\nalleviating the anguish of the victims of the most\nhorrifying crimes and of their families.\nWith regard to United Nations peacekeeping\noperations, Jordan continues to attach great importance\nto this area of activity by the United Nations system.\nWe are proud and privileged to participate with other\nMember States in those global operations in areas that\nhave been afflicted by war, conflict and instability.\nHowever, to ensure the effective and complete\nfulfilment of the lofty objectives of the mandate of\neach peacekeeping operation, adequate budgetary funds\nmust be ensured for the operations\u2019 smooth\nfunctioning, including on-time reimbursement of\npayments due to troop-contributing countries.\nIn closing, allow me once again to thank the\nPresident. I wish this session of the General Assembly\nevery success as I pray to Allah, our Lord, to enable us,\none and all, to live up to the responsibilities entrusted\nto us.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIn the early morning of\n11 September 2003, our Foreign Minister Anna Lindh\ndied, murdered in a senseless crime. One of Sweden\u2019s\nmost prominent and respected leaders is gone. We have\nlost a part of our future. She spoke for the oppressed,\nfor the victims of human rights violations. She worked\nfor international peace and justice and for multilateral\ncooperation. The voice of Anna Lindh has been\nsilenced, but her burning conviction echoes with us.\nWe meet at a time when the United Nations is\nfacing difficulties and doubts. The capability of the\nUnited Nations has often been in question. Despite\ncrises and shortcomings, the United Nations has always\nwithstood these tests. The United Nations was\nindispensable in 1945 and it still is.\nGlobal security cannot be achieved by unilateral\naction. Locking ourselves in will not bring peace,\ndevelopment, democracy or respect for human rights.\nWe must work together to define and address emerging\nchallenges for multilateral solutions.\nThe Secretary-General recently said:\n\u201cWe can no longer take it for granted that\nour multilateral institutions are strong enough to\ncope with all the challenges facing them\u201d.\n(A/58/323, para. 4)\nI welcome Kofi Annan\u2019s challenge to us. The Nordic\ncountries stand behind him. The United Nations and\nwe, the Member States, must adapt. Reform is\nnecessary to stay modern, responsive and efficient and\nto retain the trust of global civil society. International\nsolidarity must be in focus when redefining our\ncommon agenda. Attaining the goals of the Millennium\nDeclaration is a shared responsibility.\nThe legitimacy and authority of the Security\nCouncil must be regained. Its composition must better\nreflect the world of today. I believe that an agreement\non enlargement with a number of non-permanent\nmembers could be reached fairly quickly, without\nexcluding the possibility of additional permanent\nmembers at a later stage.\nWe welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s intention of\nestablishing a high-level panel to consider threats to\nour security and the institutional reforms required for\nthe United Nations to respond.\nNorth Korea has withdrawn from the Treaty on\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and\nremains unclear about its intentions. The nuclear\nprogramme in Iran, the possession of nuclear weapons\nby India and Pakistan, and Israel\u2019s refusal to sign the\nNPT continue to cause concern. In several countries,\nnuclear weapons are accorded a growing importance in\nmilitary doctrines. Discussions in the United States\nabout the creation of a new generation of smaller\nnuclear arms are worrying to us. Such weapons would\nnot contribute to a safer world, but risk lowering the\nthreshold for the use of nuclear weapons.\nThe threats from weapons of mass destruction can\nonly be met by multilateral efforts. The negative arms\nspiral must be reversed. The non-proliferation Treaty\nmust be universally complied with. Sweden continues\nto work for this goal, together with its partners in the\nNew Agenda Coalition.\nWe need new ideas on disarmament and non-\nproliferation and on how to strengthen existing\nregimes. To this aim, Sweden has initiated an\nindependent, international commission chaired by Mr.\nHans Blix. Last June, the General Assembly adopted a\nforward-looking resolution on the prevention of armed\n33\n \nconflict. Sweden will continue to work for a\nstrengthening of the capacity of the United Nations\npractical preventive work.\nOur focus must be the security of the individual.\nViolations of human rights can never be accepted. State\nsovereignty also implies responsibility. If Governments\nfail to protect their people, the international community\nmust be prepared to act. In its report The Responsibility\nto Protect, the International Commission on\nIntervention and State Sovereignty points out important\nissues for the international community to take on. How\ncan we make sure that sovereignty and independence\nnever become a license to abuse people? How should\nthe international community live up to its responsibility\nwhen States fail to protect their people?\nWe must make full use of instruments available to\navoid war. The Security Council must be ready to act\non early warning signals on threats of mass violations\nof human rights. Mechanisms to prevent such situations\nmay be intrusive in character and need to be\nstrengthened based on accountability and international\nlaw. As the Secretary-General said in his speech on\nTuesday, the Security Council needs seriously to\ndiscuss the best way to respond to threats of genocide\nor other comparable massive violations of human\nrights. Prevention of genocide will be the topic for the\nStockholm International Forum to be held in my\ncountry in January.\nThere must be an end to impunity. The\nInternational Criminal Court is now operational. The\nCourt will act as a deterrent to perpetrators and a\nuniversal and equal tool for justice.\nTwo years ago, Foreign Minister Anna Lindh was\naccompanied to the General Assembly by her then 11-\nyear-old son David. When he entered the Hall, he\nasked: \u201cMom, where are all the women?\u201d He saw what\nmany of us seem blind to. There are too few women\nhere, as in very many decision-making bodies around\nthe world. Gender equality is about making use of all\nhuman resources.\nWomen are strong, but they are made vulnerable\nthrough legal, economic and social discrimination.\nWomen are made victims of violence in war, of abuse\nat home, of trafficking, of sexual exploitation. For\nthese women, gender equality is a question of life and\ndeath. Women\u2019s equal rights to education, to a\nprofessional career and to participate in politics are not\na threat to us men. The absence of these rights is a\nthreat to the progress of mankind.\nPeace operations require joint efforts to be\nsuccessful. The cooperation between the United\nNations and regional organizations, such as the recent\nexperience in the Democratic Republic of Congo \u2014\nPresident Kabila\u2019s discussion of which the other day\nwe listened to very carefully \u2014 the European Union-\nled police mission in the Western Balkans and the\nmilitary operation in Macedonia, are all examples of\nthis. We will continue developing the cooperation\nbetween the United Nations and the European Union\nand welcome the political declaration on crisis\nmanagement.\nMany painful lessons can be drawn from the\nviolent conflicts in West Africa. Sweden welcomes the\nlarge and broadly based United Nations peacekeeping\nMission in Liberia. The international community must\nsupport the United Nations and the Economic\nCommunity of West African States in finding sustainable\nsolutions for the entire region. The European Union is\ntrying to strengthen such a partnership through the work\nof Hans Dahlgren, its Special Representative to the\nMano River Union countries.\nWomen are crucial to peace and reconciliation. I\nwelcome the fact that gender perspectives are now\nbeing incorporated into mandates and activities of all\npeacekeeping missions. The number of women in peace\noperations at all levels should increase. The\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 1325\n(2000) and the strengthening of the United Nations\ncapacity in this field are vital.\nThe decision to cut poverty by half by 2015 is\nimperative, but we are not doing well enough. The pace\nat which the goal is being realized is far too slow. We\nnow need new financial mechanisms and partnerships.\nIn this spirit, we welcome the initiative presented a few\ndays ago by the President of Brazil.\nOfficial development assistance needs to treble.\nIn Monterrey, the States members of the European\nUnion agreed to increase official development\nassistance. Sweden is increasing its assistance to 0.86\nper cent of its gross domestic product next year.\nPledges must be followed by real cash money. We need\nto give the United Nations predictable, long-term\nfinancing. I entirely agree with what President Chirac\nsaid a few days ago: \u201cFailing that, we will end up with\na pick-and-choose United Nations\u201d. (A/58/PV.7)\n34\n \nThe main responsibility for development is borne\nby every country itself in promoting democracy, good\ngovernance and respect of human rights. Official\ndevelopment assistance will always only be\nsupplementary, as we all know. More important is the\npromotion of open and fair trade rules, the dismantling\nof tariffs and the reduction of subsidies. We expect the\ndeveloped countries to show the way and to bring\nforward the Doha Development Agenda. Indeed, we\nmust all see to it that the setback in the trade\nnegotiations in Canc\u00fan is turned into a new start.\nThe Swedish Government presented a new bill in\nMay this year on a coherent policy for global\ndevelopment. This is our way of translating the\nMillennium Declaration into national policy. We will\nput particular emphasis on the commitment to the\neighth Millennium Development Goal, which is\nspecifically about the obligations of the rich countries.\nThe consequences of climate change affect us all.\nThe deterioration of the Kyoto Protocol must be halted.\nWe need a global system for migration that\nprotects immigrant\u2019s rights and provides security for\npeople who cross borders to study, research or work.\nSweden and Switzerland support the Secretary-General\nin wishing to strengthen the role of migration on the\nUnited Nations agenda, including the establishment of\na global commission on migration and development.\nThe General Assembly has rightly condemned the\nIsraeli decision to deport President Arafat. Both parties\nmust implement their obligations in accordance with\nthe road map. We urge the Palestinian Authority to take\naction to cease the suicide bombings. Israel\u2019s\nextrajudicial killings are contradictory to international\nlaw and must be stopped immediately.\nThe international community must do its utmost\nto assist the parties in the peace process. The road map,\nas Jack Straw pointed out only a few minutes ago,\nshould be implemented immediately with a view to the\nestablishment of a peaceful and democratic Palestinian\nState in 2005. International monitors and observers\nshould be sent to the area and Sweden is willing to take\npart in such a monitoring mechanism.\nSergio Vieira de Mello and many of his\ncolleagues lost their lives in the bombing of the United\nNations headquarters in Baghdad about a month ago, a\nterrible loss for the international community. Sergio\nVieira de Mello personified, better than most, the\nstrength and commitment of the international\ncommunity at its best.\nThe situation in Iraq remains volatile and\ndangerous. We are concerned about the security of the\nIraqi people and of those who are in Iraq to ease their\nsuffering. The bombing in Baghdad was aimed at the\npurposes that the United Nations stands for \u2014 to\nmaintain international peace and security. It will not\nmake us waiver. The United Nations will stay in Iraq.\nThe international community needs the legitimacy of\nthe United Nations as the only authority to be derived\nfrom in helping the Iraqi people recover self-\ngovernment and rebuild their country. The handling of\nthe conflict must remain an exception and not become\na rule.\nThe future of the United Nations now lies in the\nhands of the Member States. If the United Nations\nfails, we all fail. In the statements most referred to so\nfar in this year\u2019s debate, the media have competed in\nfinding differences and disputes, but there is one thing\nthat we all agree on. That is the belief in our United\nNations. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has the world\nbehind him."

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, we\ncongratulate you on your election to the presidency of\nthe fifty-eighth session of the United Nations General\nAssembly. We wish you every success in our shared\nendeavours. You will have our fullest cooperation in\nyour efforts.\nAs we gather here, in the wake of the many\nmomentous events over the past year, it is inevitable\nthat we should ponder some fundamental questions\nabout the role and relevance of the United Nations.\nThe United Nations was charged by its Charter\n\u201cto save succeeding generations from the scourge of\nwar.\u201d The Charter also speaks of our collective\ndetermination \u201cto unite our strength to maintain\ninternational peace and security.\u201d There was an implicit\nconviction that the United Nations would be stronger\nthan the sum of its constituent Member States. Its\nunique legitimacy flows from a universal perception\nthat it pursues a larger purpose than the interests of one\ncountry or a small group of countries.\nThis vision of an enlightened multilateralism has\nnot materialized. There have been difficulties and\ndeficiencies in ensuring a world free from strife, a world\nwithout war. The United Nations has not always been\nsuccessful in preventing conflicts or in resolving them.\nDuring the past year, the United Nations\nencountered new challenges. We saw the extraordinary\ninability of the five permanent members of the Security\nCouncil to agree on action in respect of Iraq, in spite of\ncomplete agreement on basic objectives. Most recently,\nthe brutal terrorist attack on the United Nations Office\nin Baghdad struck a body blow at the United Nations\u2019\nhumanitarian efforts there.\nLooking back at events over recent years, we can\nanalyse the successes and failures of the United\nNations in this or that crisis. But it would be more\npurposeful to reflect on our own commitment to\nmultilateralism, the extent of its applicability in the\nreal world of today, and the manner in which it can be\nexercised through the United Nations. The reality is\nthat an international institution like the United Nations\ncan only be as effective as its Members allow it to be.\nOur reflections on the United Nations should\nfocus on three key aspects:\nFirst, we need to introspect on some of the\nassumptions that have been made over the years\nconcerning the will and reach of the United Nations. In\nthe euphoria after the Cold War, there was a misplaced\nnotion that the United Nations could solve every\nproblem anywhere. Its enthusiasm and proactive stance\non many issues reflected laudable intentions. But we\nsoon realized that the United Nations does not possess\nmagical powers to solve every crisis in all parts of the\nglobe or to change overnight the motivation of leaders\nand communities around the world. //We need to\nclearly recognize, with a sense of realism, the limits to\nwhat the United Nations can achieve, and the changes\nof form and function required for it to play an optimal\nrole in today\u2019s world. We need to clearly recognize,\nwith a sense of realism, the limits to what the United\nNations can achieve, and the changes that it needs to\nmake to its form and function to play an optimal role in\ntoday\u2019s world.\nSecondly, the Iraq issue has inevitably generated\na debate on the functioning and the efficacy of the\nSecurity Council and of the United Nations itself. Over\nthe decades, the United Nations membership has grown\nenormously. The scope of its activities has expanded\ngreatly, with new specialized agencies and new\nprogrammes. But in the political and security\ndimensions of its activities, the United Nations has not\nkept pace with the changes in the world. For the\nSecurity Council to represent genuine multilateralism\nin its decisions and actions, its membership must\nreflect current world realities. Most United Nations\nMembers today recognize the need for an enlarged and\nrestructured Security Council, with more developing\ncountries as permanent and non-permanent members.\nThe permanent members guard their exclusivity. Some\nStates with weak claims want to ensure that others do\nnot enter the Council as permanent members. This\ncombination of complacency and negativism has to be\ncountered with a strong political will. The recent crises\nshould serve as a warning to us that until the Security\nCouncil is reformed and restructured, its decisions\ncannot truly reflect the collective will of the\ncommunity of nations.\nThirdly, even after such reform, the Security\nCouncil would have to develop suitable decision-\nmaking mechanisms that ensure better representation of\nthe collective will of the international community. How\ncan multilateralism be genuinely implemented? A\nsingle veto is an anachronism in today\u2019s world. On the\nother hand, the requirement of unanimity can sabotage\nimperative actions. A simple-majority vote may not be\n15\n \nsufficiently representative for major and serious issues.\nShould we aim for the highest common factor, or\nshould we settle for the lowest common denominator?\nDemocratic countries could use their national\nexperience to provide feasible models for mechanisms\nand determine the extent of support required based on\nthe impact of action to be taken.\nThe Secretary-General has rightly emphasized the\nurgent need for reform of the institutions and processes\nof the United Nations. We encourage his efforts in this\ndirection. We should seek to implement these reforms\nwithin a specified time frame.\nThe Iraq issue continues to present a major\nchallenge to the United Nations. At this point in time,\nit is not very productive to linger on the past. Our\nthoughts and concerns should be about the suffering of\nthe people of Iraq. It is imperative that the people of\nIraq should be empowered to determine their own\nfuture and to rebuild their nation.\nThe immediate priorities are ensuring security\nand stability, restoration of basic facilities and\ninfrastructure and a road map of political processes for\na representative Iraqi Government. It is clear that the\nUnited Nations has a crucial role to play in the process\nof political and economic reconstruction of that\ncountry. This has been acknowledged both by those\nwho had opposed military action and by those who did\nnot seek specific United Nations endorsement for it.\nOne issue on which the United Nations showed\nremarkable unanimity after 11 September was global\nterrorism. Security Council resolutions 1373 (2001)\nand 1456 (2003) were unequivocal in condemning all\nforms of terrorism and in calling for united action\nagainst support, shelter, sponsorship, arming, training\nand financing of terrorism or terrorists.\nUnfortunately, the solidarity that was voiced has\nnot translated into coherent and effective action.\nTerrorist acts continue to shatter our peace, from\nMombasa to Moscow and from Baghdad to Bali. India\nhas had more than its share of terrorism in various\nparts of the country. The global coalition against\nterrorism has registered successes in Afghanistan, but\nhas not been able to extend this elsewhere. Some of its\nmembers are themselves part of the problem. We are\nsometimes led to enter into semantic arguments over\nthe definition of terrorism. The search for root causes\nor imaginary freedom struggles provides alibis for\nkilling innocent men, women and children.\nThere is much that the United Nations can do to\ncarry forward the war against international terrorism.\nThe Counter-Terrorism Committee should develop\nmeasures to ensure compliance by Member States of\ntheir obligations under Security Council resolutions\n1373 (2001) and 1456 (2003). We should have credible\nmultilateral instruments to identify States that\ncontravene these resolutions. Multilateral mechanisms\nmust be created to detect and choke off international\nfinancial flows to terrorists and terrorist organizations.\nA much better international system of\ninformation exchange and intelligence sharing needs to\nbe devised to prevent terrorists from evading capture\nsimply by crossing national borders. No State should\nbe allowed to profess partnership with the global\ncoalition against terror, while continuing to aid, abet\nand sponsor terrorism. To condone such double\nstandards is to contribute to multiplying terrorism.\nYesterday, the President of Pakistan chose this\naugust Assembly to make a public admission for the\nfirst time that Pakistan is sponsoring terrorism in\nJammu and Kashmir. After claiming that there is an\nindigenous struggle in Kashmir, he has offered to\nencourage a general cessation of violence within Kashmir,\nin return for reciprocal obligations and restraints.\nWe totally refuse to let terrorism become a tool of\nblackmail. Just as the world did not negotiate with al\nQaeda or the Taliban, we shall not negotiate with\nterrorism. Were we to do so, we would be betraying the\npeople of Jammu and Kashmir, who defied a most\nferocious campaign of violence and intimidation\nsponsored from across our borders and participated in\nan election, which has been universally hailed as free\nand fair. This was an unequivocal expression of both\ndetermination and self-determination.\nWhen the cross-border terrorism stops, or when\nwe eradicate it, we can have a dialogue with Pakistan\non the other issues between us.\nWhile on this subject, I would also like to point\nout to the President of Pakistan that he should not\nconfuse the legitimate aspiration for equality of nations\nwith outmoded concepts of military parity.\nWe should be particularly concerned at the\nvarious recent revelations about clandestine transfers of\nweapons of mass destruction and their technologies.\nWe face the frightening prospect of these weapons and\ntechnologies falling into the hands of terrorists. Surely\n16\n \nsomething needs to be done about the helplessness of\ninternational regimes in preventing such transactions,\nwhich clearly threaten international security. The same\nregimes expend considerable energy in imposing a\nvariety of discriminatory technology-denial restrictions\non responsible States.\nOur preoccupation with terrorism should not\ndilute our commitment to tackle the non-military\nthreats to human and international security. We have to\nsustain the fight against trafficking in narcotic drugs,\nhuman beings and small arms, the pandemic of\nHIV/AIDS, diseases like malaria and tuberculosis that\nbeset developing countries and the degradation of our\ncommon environment. Food security, energy security\nand health security are important goals.\nThe countries of the North and of the South \u2014\nthe developed, developing and transition economies \u2014\nmust resume their dialogue to build a better world for\nthe present and future generations. For the agenda of\nglobalization, Canc\u00fan was a disappointment.\nSignificant progress was made at Johannesburg\ntowards the realization of sustainable development, but\nthe entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol on climate\nchange remains stalled and the Convention on\nBiological Diversity has not yielded any tangible\nbenefits to the world\u2019s poor.\nInternational economic relations continue to be\ncharacterized by inequities and inequalities.\nGlobalization has helped sections of the international\neconomy, including some developing countries; however,\nlarge communities have been left outside its pale. It has\nengendered economic crises and instability in several\ndeveloping countries and sharply increased poverty.\nPoverty is multidimensional. It extends beyond\nmoney and income to education, health care, skills\nenhancement, political participation at all levels from\nthe local to the global, access to natural resources,\nclean water and air, and advancement of one\u2019s own\nculture and social organization.\nPoverty alleviation requires resources on a far\ngreater scale than now available. Globalization itself\nplaces constraints on Governments of developing\ncountries in raising public resources for poverty\nalleviation. The promise of the climate change and\nbiodiversity treaties to raise significant resources for\ninvestment and technology transfer is as yet unrealized.\nThe resources of multilateral and bilateral development\nagencies are limited by the failure of industrialized\ncountries to enhance development budgets.\nTherefore, if the current regimes of globalization\nand sustainable development are to be expanded \u2014 or\neven to survive \u2014 they must be directly harnessed to\nprovide the necessary resources for poverty alleviation.\nIn fact, all international agreements and initiatives\naffecting developing countries have to be evaluated by\ntheir impact on poverty.\nDeveloping countries need to coordinate their\npositions in international negotiations to promote the\nadoption of regimes which would help alleviate\npoverty. The India-Brazil-South Africa Dialogue\nForum, which was established earlier this year, is an\neffort in this direction.\nWe in the developing countries do not have the\nluxury of time. Political compulsions force us to meet\nthe aspirations of our people quickly, even as we\nsubject ourselves to newer and more rigid international\nstandards and norms. We owe it to our future generations\nto make strong efforts to meet the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals. There is a mutuality of interest in\nthis between the developed and the developing\ncountries. Global interdependence today means that\neconomic disasters in developing countries could\ncreate a backlash in developed countries. We hope the\nworld will act in this spirit of enlightened self-interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the\noutset, allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your\nelection to preside over the Assembly at this session. I\nwould also like to congratulate the outgoing President,\nMr. Jan Kavan, for his work at the head of this\nAssembly at the previous session.\nOn behalf of my Government, we would also like\nto reiterate our gratitude for the efforts of the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, to promote peace\nand multilateralism, and to express our solidarity in\nwake of the criminal attack that claimed the lives of\nseveral staff members of this Organization.\nWe have come from the world\u2019s South to the\nGeneral Assembly with a firm belief that revitalizing\nthis global representative forum is essential for\ninternational law to become once again a rational\ninstrument for resolving conflicts and facing threats.\nRestoring the major political role that the Assembly\nplayed in the early days of the United Nations is key to\nstrengthening security for all citizens of the world.\nIndeed, multilateralism is the cornerstone of this\nOrganization. But the cold war and bipolarity that\ncharacterized the world after the Yalta Conference until\nthe fall of the Berlin Wall undoubtedly shaped the\ninstruments and legislation that were adopted within\nthat framework.\nAny objective look at the international situation\nthat that goes beyond the particular biases of individual\nMembers of the Organization will reveal another\nhallmark of the world today: the technological, military\nand economic supremacy of one country over all the\nrest. We therefore consider it necessary to reaffirm our\ndetermined support for the purposes and principles that\nunderpin the United Nations, so that it can actively\nwork to promote peace and the social and economic\ndevelopment of humanity.\nBut, it bears repeating, we must not limit our\ncommitment to multilateralism to words alone.\nPromoting multilateralism requires a dual strategy.\nFirst, an open mind is needed to objectively grasp the\nfull extent of the new state of affairs. Secondly, we\nneed to reconsider the instruments and rules so to cope\nwith this new reality just as was done during the era of\nbipolar politics in order to save the world from\ndestruction. Multilateralism and security are inseparable\nbut are not the only factors in this new equation.\nThe world is changing against the backdrop of a\nglobalization that is creating unprecedented\nopportunities and risks. The greatest risk is the\nwidening gap between the rich and poor. To divide the\nworld into central and marginal countries is not merely\nan academic exercise or a matter of ideology. Quite the\ncontrary, such definitions reflect a grim reality of\nunprecedented poverty and social exclusion. Our\npriority must be to ensure that globalization works for\nall, and not just for the few. Promoting the\ndevelopment of the marginalized countries is no longer\nsimply a matter of social conscience on the part of the\ncentral countries. It has an impact on their situation and\nsecurity. Hunger, illiteracy, exclusion and ignorance are\nsome of the basic elements that fuel the spread of\ninternational terrorism and cause violent and massive\nnational migration flows, which have cultural, social\nand economic consequences. They also inevitably\nthreaten the security of the central countries.\nEconomic integration and political\nmultilateralism hold the key to safer future world. We\nneed to build global institutions and effective\npartnerships within the framework of fair and open\ntrade and to bolster support for the development of\nthose most in need. If we are to promote collective\nsecurity intelligently, we must understand that security\nis not just a military issue; it depends on political,\neconomic, social and cultural factors as well. These are\nthe key challenges on the current international agenda\nthat the main actors must meet.\nIn this framework, the relations between\ncountries like ours and others in the international\n8\n \ncommunity are affected by a huge and crushing burden\nof debt owed to multilateral financial institutions and\nprivate creditors. We accept our share of responsibility\nfor having adopted policies that caused this\nindebtedness. But we also call on the international\nfinancial institutions \u2014 which contributed to,\nencouraged and promoted the growth of that debt by\ndictating their terms \u2014 to accept their own share of\nresponsibility. It goes without saying that when debt\ngrows to such an extent, not only the debtor but also\nthe creditor bears responsibility. It is therefore\nnecessary to acknowledge the tangible, verifiable and\nrather obvious fact that repaying such a debt entails\ngreat hardships.\nWithout specific international assistance to\nenable indebted countries to restore economic solvency\nand thereby their ability to repay debts and without\nmeasures to foster their growth and their sustainable\ndevelopment by taking concrete steps to promote their\nmarket access and growth of exports, debt repayment\nremains a pipedream. Promoting exports of finished\nproducts based on the natural resources that most\nindebted countries have can lay the foundations for\nsustainable development, without which creditors will\nhave to face their losses without any other realistic\noptions.\nNo one is known to have succeeded in getting\ntheir money back from the dead. To reach the objective\nof making a country viable so it can pay its debts,\nintensified multilateral negotiations are greatly needed\nto eliminate tariff and non-tariff barriers that hinder\naccess of our exports to the markets of the developed\ncountries, which have the largest purchasing capacity.\nIndeed, there continue to be export and production\nsubsidies in the international trade in food products \u2014\nArgentina\u2019s main export item \u2014 as well as tariffs,\nunjustified sanitary measures and trade restrictions that\ndistort the terms of trade in commodities and seriously\nhamper market access for finished products.\nThe failure of the World Trade Organization\nnegotiations in Canc\u00fan should serve as a wake-up call\nto us in this regard and should be remedied by making\nthe greatly sought-after link between business\nopportunities in international trade and the growth of\nindebted countries and their debt-repayment capacity. It\nis paradoxical and even ridiculous that we should be\ncalled upon to repay our debt while we are being\nprevented from trading and selling our products.\nOn the other hand, although it is true that the\nobjectives of the multilateral institutions, such as the\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), include shortening\nthe duration and lessening the imbalance of payments\nof member countries and instilling confidence by\ngiving them opportunities for readjustment, without\ntaking measures that undermine national or\ninternational prosperity, it is also necessary to redesign\nthose multilateral institutions. Redesigning multilateral\nlending agencies should include changing the models\nso that the success or failure of economic policies is\nmeasured in terms of success or failure in the fight for\ndevelopment, equitable distribution, the fight against\npoverty and maintaining adequate levels of employment.\nThis new millennium should banish adjustment\nmodels in which the prosperity of some is based on the\npoverty of others. The dawn of the twenty-first century\nshould mean the end of an age and the beginning of a\nnew collaboration among creditors and debtors.\nIn a nutshell, it is essential to take note of the\nclose connection that exists between security,\nmultilateralism and economics.\nThe defence of human rights occupies a central\nplace in the new agenda of the Argentine Republic. We\nare the children of the mothers and grandmothers of the\nPlaza de Mayo, and we therefore insist on permanently\nsupporting the strengthening of the system for the\nprotection of human rights and the trial and conviction\nof those who violate them. All of this is based on the\noverarching view that respect for persons and their\ndignity arises out of principles preceding the\ndevelopment of law, whose origins can be traced to the\nbeginnings of human history. Respecting diversity and\npluralism and relentlessly fighting impunity have been\nunwavering principles of our country ever since the\ntragedy of recent decades.\nWe strongly advocate a peaceful settlement of\ninternational disputes, particularly in a matter as dear\nto our feelings and interests as our sovereignty dispute\nwith regard to the Malvinas, South Georgia and the South\nSandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas.\nThe United Nations has recognized that this is a\ncolonial situation maintained by the United Kingdom\nand that it must be settled through bilateral\nnegotiations between the Argentine Republic and the\n9\n \nUnited Kingdom. We value the role of the United\nNations Special Committee on Decolonization and\nexpress our fullest willingness to negotiate in order to\nconclusively settle this longstanding dispute, a steady\nobjective of the Argentina Republic. We urge the\nUnited Kingdom to agree to resume bilateral\nnegotiations to resolve this major issue.\nAlso with reference to the Southern regions, we\nundertake to protect the interests of the international\ncommunity in Antarctica, ensuring that the activities\ncarried out there are consistent with the Antarctic\nTreaty and its 1991 Madrid Protocol on Environmental\nProtection. We shall take steps at the relevant forums\nfor the installation of the authorities and the operation\nof the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat at its designated\nseat, Buenos Aires.\nWe express our support and wish for a stable and\nlasting peace in the Middle East based on the\ninalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-\ndetermination and an independent and viable State,\nwhile at the same time recognizing the right of Israel to\nlive at peace with its neighbours within safe and\ninternationally recognized borders.\nWe have spoken of progress and collective\nsecurity as the global challenges of today. We have\nhighlighted the close link that exists between economic\nproblems and security. We firmly condemn all terrorist\nactions. We know what we are talking about. In 1992\nand 1994 we suffered, first hand, our own Twin\nTowers. The attacks on the Israeli Embassy and the\nAMIA Jewish Community Center took the lives of over\n100 of our compatriots. We can bear witness to the\nneed to fight effectively against the new threats posed\nby international terrorism.\nThe vulnerability of all countries in the\ninternational community to this scourge can be reduced\nonly through intelligent, concerted and multilateral\naction sustained over time. The fight against terrorism\nrequires a new rationality. We face an enemy whose\nlogic is to trigger reactions symmetrical to its actions.\nThe worse, the better, is the favoured scenario, and that\nlogic partly accounts for the increasingly spectacular\n\u2014 almost cinematographic \u2014 nature of its operations.\nLegitimate responses and the support of international\npublic opinion are both fundamental to confronting\nthose new forms of violence.\nThis view places the problem of international\nterrorism in a dimension that goes beyond a unilateral\nor military solution. On the contrary, merely\nresponding through the use of force, however\nimpressive such force may be or appear to be, in many\ncases ends with the perpetrators being presented as\nvictims. This closes in a perfect circle the perverse\nlogic to which we have been referring.\nAs we see, in view of the complexity of the\nsituation, it is no longer useful to take shelter in old\nalignments, anachronistic ways of thinking or outdated\nstructures. The new challenges call for different and\ncreative solutions so as not to be left behind by changes\nin the world in the technological, economic, social and\nundoubtedly even cultural fields.\nLet us rise to the challenge of thinking anew for a\nnew world. To combine different ideas and create\npractical means to put them into practice in the service\nof the people we represent is our duty.\n\n\n"

The unanimous election of the smallest State\never to hold that post speaks not only of the confidence\nwhich Member States place in your own ability, but\nalso of their recognition of the critical role which small\nStates play in the multilateral process. We are delighted\nat your elevation to this high office, and we wish to\nassure you that, in carrying out your responsibilities,\nyou will be able to count on the unequivocal support\nnot only of Saint Lucia, but also of the entire\nCaribbean fraternity. I wish also to thank your\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, who very ably guided the\nwork of the fifty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly during a most trying and tumultuous year.\nOn 19 August, the world was again plunged into\nshock and despair as we witnessed the heinous attack\non the United Nations Office in Baghdad and the loss\nof life of United Nations personnel stationed there. A\nsecond attempt this week added to the toll of casualties.\nI extend to the United Nations family, as well as the\ndelegations represented here, whose compatriots were the\nvictims of that violent attack, the deepest condolences of\nthe Government and people of Barbados.\nWe pause especially to pay tribute to Mr. Sergio\nVieira de Mello, an international civil servant and\ndiplomat of the highest calibre. His death comes at a\ntime when the world can least afford it. We join with\nMembers in mourning his passing as we mourn all\nthose who perished at his side in the service of the\npeople of Iraq.\nAmidst the turmoil and carnage that has become a\ndismal feature of the daily life of so many millions in\n12\n\nour global society, this assault on the United Nations\nwas particularly startling in its cruelty and distressing\nin its intention. As our Secretary-General has affirmed:\n\u201cThis was the most deliberate and vicious attack\nagainst the United Nations in its history.\u201d It is the\ncruellest of ironies that such an attack could have been\nconceived and carried out against an Organization in\nwhich we all have a stake, and one which epitomizes\nthe principles and ideals to which we all ascribe, and\nwhose primary purpose is peace.\nThe global environment, over the past year, has\nteetered on the brink of chaos. We have witnessed\nincreased instances of the pursuit of violence and\nretribution as first responses to the resolution of\nconflict, and we have experienced the relegation of\ndiplomacy and multilateralism to afterthoughts.\nSome of the most intractable problems facing the\ninternational community, in the year 2003 and beyond,\nare the divisions, uncertainties and doubts that have\nemerged since the United States-led invasion of Iraq.\nOur duty as members of this family of nations is to\nensure that we remain committed to the United\nNations, as the only organization that can move us past\nthe current cycle of retribution to a path of sustainable\npeace. As we search for adequate collective responses\nto the non-traditional threats to human security, the\ntask ahead will be to bring to bear a comprehensive,\nmultidimensional approach to security, in all its\naspects, and to reiterate the continued relevance of this\nconcept to the global agenda.\nThe challenges to small States in such an\nuncertain environment are numerous and at times\noverwhelming. We lack the financial dexterity to\nrespond to economic crises as swiftly and decisively as\nis necessary. We have no military might and so our\nonly avenue for handling traditional threats to security\nrests squarely within a multilateral framework, which\nresorts to military action only when, despite our best\nefforts, peace cannot be achieved through diplomacy.\nSince the end of the conflicts of European\nempire-building, our region, the Caribbean, has had a\nhistory of peace and stability, which is sustained\nthrough a simple but sure formula: celebration of our\ncommonalities; tolerance of our differences; mutual\nrespect for each other\u2019s sovereignty; and adherence to\nthe principles of democracy, good governance and the\nrule of law. We would wish to commend this formula to\nthose who find the key to peaceful co-existence elusive.\nBarbados remains unwavering in its commitment\nto the precepts of multilateralism, and to the belief that\nno other international institution is better suited or\nequipped to meet the diverse demands for global peace,\nsecurity and development than the United Nations. As\nmembers of this Organization, we are assured that our\nvoice will be heard regardless of our size or economic\npower. Therefore, while we may not have the capacity\nto influence situations by way of exerting military,\neconomic or even political power, we do cherish our\nright to express our opinions about any issue of\nconcern to us, without let or hindrance.\nThe United Nations is not a third party separate\nfrom the Member Governments but is rather the sum of\nits Members; it belongs to them and they share all the\nbenefits, problems and collective responsibilities of\nownership. Barbados shares the view so eloquently\nexpressed by the Secretary-General that: \u201cThe United\nNations exists, not as a static memorial to the aspirations\nof an earlier age, but as a work in progress \u2014 imperfect,\nas all human endeavours must be, but capable of\nadaptation and improvement.\u201d We are all accountable for\nits shortcomings and must all strive for its improvement.\nTo the extent that the United Nations represents\nour collective effort at a mechanism for global\ngovernance, it is amenable to the benefits of good\ngovernance practices. For we believe that good\ngovernance is as important at the international level as\nit is at the national level. It is perhaps the single most\nimportant factor in promoting development, reducing\ninequalities and advancing the cause of peace.\nWe should therefore seize this moment in time to\nrecommit ourselves to making the United Nations more\neffective and efficient. Bold and serious reorganization\ninitiatives, including the revitalization of the General\nAssembly, and the reform of the Security Council are\nurgently needed. We must also find effective coordination\nmodalities to give new impetus to the follow-up to the\nmajor conferences and summits of the last decade,\nwhich, in most instances, have simply been reduced to\nstanding items on the annual agenda of this body and\nrhetoric-filled resolutions reaffirming the status quo.\nWe must resolve, during this session and\nhenceforth, to take concrete actions towards making the\nSecurity Council more representative and transparent and\ntowards ensuring that the General Assembly moves\nbeyond the symbolic politics of passing resolutions to\nthe hard work of negotiating change.\n13\n\nFor it is a source of the greatest continuing concern\nto us that too many of the premier multilateral institutions\n\u2014 which are charged with the fundamental responsibility\nof shaping the rules by which global society is\ngoverned, whether in the area of peace and security, or\ntrade, or finance and development \u2014 are constrained\nby structure and tradition to carry out their mandate in\na manner that is patently devoid of democracy or\ntransparency. Reform must therefore extend beyond the\nconfines of New York to reach deep into the operations\nof the international financial institutions, the World\nTrade Organization, the Organization for Economic\nCooperation and Development, the Financial Action\nTask Force on Money-Laundering and all other bodies\nthat seek to prescribe the norms of behaviour for the\ninternational community without the full participation\nof that community in the decision-making process.\nIf the International Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment had one failing, it was its inability to\nconceive of a new system for financial governance to\nredress the deficiencies and imbalances of the past \u2014 a\nsystem that is durable enough to serve for generations\nto come. In this regard, I wish to reiterate the call made\nat Monterrey by the Prime Minister of Barbados, The\nRight Honourable Owen Arthur, for the creation of a\nrules-based world financial authority to supervise\ntoday\u2019s complex global financial and capital markets\nbetter than the Bretton Woods institutions can, and for\nan international tax organization to oversee global\ncooperation in cross-border tax matters.\nDespite a commitment made by all States at\nMonterrey towards the development of a universal\nframework to facilitate all-inclusive dialogue on\nmatters pertaining to international tax cooperation,\nsufficient progress has not been forthcoming. While we\nare encouraged by and supportive of recent proposals\nto strengthen the United Nations Ad Hoc Group of\nExperts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters,\nthese efforts are insufficient to provide for a truly\nuniversal, transparent and legitimate intergovernmental\nframework to promote cooperation among all States on\ntax matters.\nEqually, Barbados believes that the all-important\nfight against money-laundering must now be waged by\nthe international community as a whole, led by a\ngenuinely representative international body, drawing its\nmembership from all the countries of the world, within\nthe family of the United Nations. While we are most\nappreciative of the vital work that has been done in this\nregard by the Financial Action Task Force, that body\nremains what it has always been, a task force with a\nlimited role, and an even more limited membership of\nonly 31 countries.\nAn important step would be the adoption of an\ninternational convention against money-laundering,\nunder the auspices of the United Nations. Such a\nconvention would establish a genuine international\nconsensus on the issue of money-laundering within the\nuniversal ambit of the United Nations, where the\ninterests and concerns of all Member States would be\nfairly and equally served in a common endeavour\nagainst international crime. The proposed convention\nwould complement the work of the United Nations\nunder the 1988 Convention against Illicit Traffic in\nNarcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, as well\nas the more recent Convention Against Transnational\nOrganized Crime.\nIn this connection, we believe that the greatest\nlesson to emerge from the experience of Cancun is the\nclear understanding that strategies and solutions that\nignore the concerns and needs of the developing world,\nor that fail to analyse the implications of those\nsolutions for the most fragile and vulnerable, are\ndoomed to failure. The special needs of small States\nthat have no capacity whatsoever to distort world trade\nmust be taken fully into account in fashioning the new\nrules of trade liberalization. To do otherwise would be\nto condemn the most vulnerable groups of our global\nfamily to the real threat of marginalization by a\nmultilateral system that is supposed to provide benefits\nfor all. It is vital that focus be restored to the Doha\nDevelopment Agenda and its work programme on\nsmall economies.\nNext year marks the tenth anniversary of the\nGlobal Conference on the Sustainable Development of\nSmall Island Developing States. Out of that conference\nemerged the Barbados Programme of Action, which\ntoday still remains the essential blueprint for the\nsustainable development aspirations of all small island\ndeveloping States (SIDS). As de facto custodian of the\nname attached to the SIDS process, Barbados accords\ngreat importance to the convening of an international\nmeeting next year in Mauritius to review the\nimplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action.\nWe are convinced that the vulnerability and\nsustainable development challenges of SIDS, as\nexpressed in the Barbados Programme of Action, in\n14\n\nAgenda 21, the Millennium Declaration and the\nJohannesburg Plan of Implementation are now better\nunderstood by the international community. According\nto estimates, since 1994 small island developing States\nthemselves have carried out approximately 70 per cent\nof the required actions and measures contained in the\nBarbados Programme of Action. The Mauritius review\nwill present an important opportunity for us to take\nstock of new and emerging challenges and identify\nadditional resources to advance implementation.\nThe World Summit on the Information Society is\nconceived as a high-level dialogue leading to achieving\na new kind of society, characterized by universal access to\nand use of information for the creation, accumulation and\ndissemination of knowledge. It implies the use of\ntraditional and new technologies, especially information\nand communication technologies, as an essential tool\nfor the enhancement of services and the promotion of\ndialogue among diverse cultures towards the attainment\nof a more peaceful, prosperous and just world. We\nsupport the principle that the new information society\nmust serve the best interests of all nations and peoples.\nIt must seek through the available technology to\nempower the most vulnerable sectors of society and\neradicate existing disparities within and among States.\nThe issue relating to the passage through the\nCaribbean Sea of ships bearing nuclear material is still\nunresolved. We are, from time to time, presented with\nstudies and analyses that seek to assure us of the safety\nof the ships and their cargo. Despite these assurances,\nwe all know that there is no guarantee that international\nterrorism will continue to ignore such a significant\ntarget or that an unthinkable accident would not occur.\nA major explosion on board one of these ships\ntraversing our region would threaten the survival of\nsurrounding States. The most acceptable solution to the\nproblem is cessation of the trans-shipment of nuclear\nmaterial through the Caribbean Sea, since, on this\nissue, any risk is too high.\nIn your address, Mr. President, upon the opening\nof the General Assembly, you called for action rather\nthan inaction. This moment in global affairs will\nrequire courage and determination as we face the\nenormous challenges awaiting us. We may not be\nexpected to complete the task, but then, neither are we\nat liberty to abstain from it.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI congratulate Mr. Hunte on his election as\nPresident of this Assembly. As the Foreign Minister of\nSt. Lucia, a member of the Latin American and\nCaribbean community, he can be especially assured of\nthe full cooperation of the delegation of Chile.\nThe events of 11 September 2001, the crisis in\nIraq, the conflict in the Middle East and the attack on\nthe United Nations in Baghdad all pose enormous\nchallenges for the international community. Tensions\n31\n\nhave arisen over the way in which we have responded\nto some of these crises, but opportunities have also\nbeen created for joint action in new areas. We must\nconfront these challenges with seriousness of purpose\nand a collective approach.\nThe Secretary-General has expressed his concern\nat the differing perceptions of the new and old threats\nand the urgent need to develop a programme of\nsecurity aimed at building a common destiny. The\nUnited Nations will be what its Member States wish it\nto be. The success of the Organization will be the\nsuccess of its Members and its failure will be the\nresponsibility of none other than its Member States.\nThe United Nations can and must play a central role in\nbuilding a common destiny based on universally shared\nprinciples and values. The renewal of the United\nNations is therefore an urgent task that must be\napproached from a lofty political and ethical\nperspective and not from the bureaucratic standpoint\nthat has led to stagnation, empty rhetoric and\nfrustration of the desire for change.\nAccording to our Charter, faith in human rights is\na core value of every society and culture. It is essential\nfor us vigorously to promote its universality. We note\nwith concern how the progress made by mankind in\npromoting these values is accompanied by reversals\nthat frustrate the sense of ethics that we wish to impart\nto the global community.\nThe work of the United Nations must continue to\nbe a guarantee for the promotion and protection of\nhuman rights and for the strengthening of a culture that\nguides the conscience of each individual, each people\nand each nation. Democracy is consistent with the\npurposes and principles of this Organization.\nIn our region, we have made progress towards the\ninculcation of these values. The historic Santiago\nCommitment to Democracy of 1991 culminated in the\nadoption of the Inter-American Democratic Charter and\nhas been complemented by the Declaration of Santiago\non Democracy and Public Trust: A New Commitment\nto Good Governance for the Americas, which was\nadopted at the thirty-third General Assembly of the\nOrganization of American States, held in Chile in June\nthis year. In that instrument, we reaffirmed the vital\nrole of multilateral cooperation in promoting\ndemocratic governance. This effort is an example of\nhow international cooperation can help to strengthen\nthe universal value of democracy.\nChile\u2019s commitment to democracy goes beyond\nour region. We and other countries are part of the\nCommunity of Democracies, an initiative aimed at\npromoting and strengthening this system of coexistence\nthroughout the world. We hope to work in the United\nNations in pursuit of these objectives.\nInternational peace and security continue to be\nkey concerns of our Organization. The sacrifice of the\nBrazilian and Latin American Sergio Vieira de Mello,\nthe Special Representative of the Secretary-General in\nBaghdad, and of his colleagues reaffirms our\ncommitment to working on behalf of peace.\nThe United Nations must play a more substantive\nrole in the future of Iraq. We must work to ensure the\nrapid restoration of sovereignty to the Iraqi people so\nthat they can freely build their future. Chile stands\nready to continue to work in the Security Council with\nan approach that will permit progress to be made\ntowards the consensus that is needed to improve the\nconditions of security and to establish a clear timetable\nfor political transition in that country.\nSecurity must guarantee people a life free from\nthreats. Human security thus emerges as a distinctive\nfeature and a prerequisite for a world without fear. We\nshare the ideas of the Secretary-General for the\nelaboration of a programme of common security that\nwill permit us to overcome the differences that have\narisen in dealing with the increasing fears of our global\ncommunity.\nGlobalization has created new opportunities for the\npeoples of the world, but it has also created imbalances as\na result of unequal access to the advantages that it offers.\nThe equity perspective must therefore be a key\ncomponent of this programme of security.\nDevelopment in the globalized world can no longer be\nsustained only in terms of technological innovation and\neconomic growth. Progress must be aimed at ensuring\nthat technological development is placed at the service\nof integration and collective prosperity.\nIn this spirit, we look forward to broad\nparticipation in the Global Biotechnology Forum, to be\nheld in the Chilean city of Concepci n in March 2004,\nand to an outcome that will help to further strengthen\ninternational cooperation in one of the most dynamic\nfields of science and technology.\nOur political and economic multilateral institutions\nwere created in a different historical period. We must now\n32\n\ndemonstrate our capacity to adapt them to better respond\nto the challenges of the twenty-first century. Our main\nconcern today must be how to overcome our immobility\nand embark upon a process of renewal. The method used\nthus far has not yielded the desired results. It is therefore\nnecessary to explore new alternatives.\nWe warmly welcome the initiative of the\nSecretary-General to establish a group of eminent\npersonalities to elaborate a proposal for submission to\nthe Organization. It is essential to address the\nweaknesses of the General Assembly, the Security\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council. We\nmust also reflect on what new functions could be\nentrusted to the Trusteeship Council. We must\nstrengthen the dialogue between these organs and\nextend it to other international organizations, including\nthe Bretton Woods institutions, the World Trade\nOrganization and regional organizations. In order to go\nforward in this process of renewal, we must be able to\nutilize the full potential of the Charter, which has not\nbeen fully exploited.\nThe Security Council has recently gone through a\ncritical period. We have witnessed the difficulty it has\nhad in discharging the responsibilities entrusted by the\nCharter to this vital organ for the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. We are in favour of its\nrevitalization, in order that an appropriate balance can\nbe achieved between representativity and effectiveness.\nReform must give consideration to the addition of\nnew members, both permanent and non-permanent, and\ninclude a review of the veto. This process can be\ncomplemented by mechanisms that will allow, within\nthe framework of the Charter, more active participation\nby countries that are not members of the Council.\nIt is also necessary more effectively to involve the\nprincipal organs in the consideration of issues affecting\ninternational peace and security. This must be done in a\ncoordinated manner through the effective application of\nthe Charter, as provided for in Article 15 thereof.\nIt is necessary, too, more actively to involve\nregional organizations and arrangements in efforts to\nmaintain peace and security by applying Chapter VIII\nof the Charter. The region of the Americas has an\ninstitutional structure and various coordination\nmechanisms that can be used to contribute to the\nfulfilment of the purposes of the United Nations. The\nexperience of the Organization of American States is\npertinent in this regard.\nThe General Assembly must undertake a process\nof revitalization in order to be able to play its role\neffectively as the principal deliberative, normative and\nrepresentative organ of the United Nations.\nThe Assembly has a multiplicity of items on its\nagenda and has adopted many resolutions, most of\nwhich remain unimplemented, thereby affecting the\neffectiveness and credibility of the system as a whole.\nWe must have the political will to implement our\ndecisions. In short, we must strengthen the capacity of\nthe Assembly to assume political leadership. We must\nalso promote the establishment of regional agendas that\nfacilitate agreements and global consensus.\nThe United Nations must play a key role in the\npromotion of equitable development by increasing the\nOrganization\u2019s capacity to influence the design and\nimplementation of national and international public\npolicies in the economic and social spheres.\nThe process of revitalization of the Economic and\nSocial Council must be aimed at repositioning that\norgan. This will require the streamlining of its agenda,\nmethods of work and membership, and the\nstrengthening of its relationship with the Security\nCouncil, as provided for in Article 65 of the Charter,\nthrough its assumption of a role in the prevention and\ncontainment of threats originating in social problems.\nWe must seek to ensure that the search for\nconsensus does not prevent this forum from reaching\nthe necessary substantive agreements required for the\nachievement of the purposes and principles of the\nUnited Nations.\nChile, from the southern part of the world, will\ncontinue to shoulder its responsibility to make a\ncontribution to the international community.\nThe United Nations is a unique and indispensable\nforum for building a world of peace and development\nfor all. Its core values must inspire efforts for a renewal\nthat will permit the Organization, in the building of our\ncommon destiny, to rise to the challenges of the\ncentury upon which we have just embarked.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I also wish to extend my sincere gratitude\nto your worthy predecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, for his\ndedicated and committed tenure as president.\nI commend the resolute leadership of our\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, during these\nchallenging and uncertain times. It is a timely reminder\nof the dedication and commitment to the Charter\nrequired of us all as Member States.\nTonga wishes to extend its deepest sympathy and\ncondolences to the Secretary-General, the Organization\nand all affected delegations for the tragic loss of life in\nthe attacks of 19 August and this past week on the\nUnited Nations compound in Baghdad. We recall the\ncourage of Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello and too many\nothers before him, who have fallen in the line of duty\nwhile embodying the United Nations commitment to,\nand ultimate sacrifice for, a peaceful and better world.\nFor its part, my Government will carefully study and\nexamine the Convention on the Safety of United\nNations and Associated Personnel.\nAttacks such as that of 11 September 2001 and\nthose that befell the United Nations compound in\nBaghdad will continue to serve as stirring reminders to\nus all of the need for ever present vigilance and\nstrength to combat terrorism.\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001)\ncontinues to be the beacon that guides the activities of\nmy Government to develop and enhance appropriate\nmeasures in order to strengthen our compliance. Tonga\ncontinues to support the work of the Counter-Terrorism\nCommittee (CTC) and has, to date, submitted all the\nnecessary country reports requested of it. I am grateful\nto the CTC and the Security Council for their patience.\nAfter careful study of the United Nations\nconventions on terrorism, Tonga is now a party to all\n12 instruments, but merely becoming parties to these\ninstruments will not suffice. Concrete steps will\ncontinue to be needed for small countries like mine to\nfully and meaningfully implement those obligations.\nWe have strengthened our legislative framework and\ntaken other measures in order to give domestic effect to\nsuch obligations. We continue to participate in national\nand regional activities designed to assist countries such\nas Tonga implement viable counter-terrorism measures.\nThe ongoing assistance of our traditional development\npartners and other organizations such as the\nCommonwealth and the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF)\nSecretariat have been a boon in this regard.\nLast year, I referred to the signposts that line the\ndevelopmental path: the Millennium Summit, Doha,\nMonterrey and Johannesburg. Together with the\n11\n\noutcomes of other United Nations summit and\nconferences, they have inspired hope and vision for our\ncollective developmental aspirations. While recent\nevents in Cancun might not be encouraging, they have\nserved to emphasize that implementing those signposts\nwill be critical and decisive.\nThat is a timely reminder, as small island\ndeveloping States (SIDS) proceed towards implementing\nchapter VII of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation.\nThat chapter refers specifically, among other things, to\nthe ten-year review of the Barbados Programme of\nAction that is to take place in Mauritius in 2004.\nIndeed, Sir, under your presidency in particular,\nTonga hopes that this is one signpost that will give further\nimpetus to the achievements in Johannesburg last year, as\nwell as to the national efforts and endeavours of SIDS in\nachieving sustainable development. We will continue to\nrefine our priority and capacity needs to take greater\nadvantage of available financial and technological\nsupport. An example of that is our attempt to improve\nour air transport services and international aviation\nlinks to combat what has been described as the\ntyranny of distance' in our region, by becoming the\nmost recent party to the Multilateral Agreement on the\nLiberalization of International Air Transport.\nRegional activities which bear upon our\nsustainable development efforts include the Japan-\nPacific Islands Forum Leaders Meeting (PALM)\nSummit 2003 between Pacific Islands Forum member\nStates, including Tonga, and Japan, where mutual\ndevelopmental issues are discussed and considered. I\ncommend Japan for its ongoing commitment to Tonga\nand the region through that process, and I look forward\nto the fruitful results of the Okinawa Initiative.\nI also commend the initiative and recent visit to\nthe Pacific this year of President Chirac of France. It\nwas an encouraging sign and created a solid foundation\nfor further dialogue and future partnership on\ndevelopmental issues. I look forward to participating in\nthe next summit meeting in Paris.\nAs a developing ocean State, we remain interested\nin ongoing developments in oceans affairs and the law of\nthe sea. As I have mentioned earlier, Tonga has become\nparty to all United Nations conventions on terrorism\nincluding those that are maritime-related.\nWe continue to value the work and decisions this\nyear of the States Parties to the United Nations\nConvention on the Law of the Sea, the International\nSeabed Authority and the work and role of the United\nNations Informal Consultative Process at its fourth\nmeeting.\nI am pleased that the second informal meeting of\nStates Parties to the United Nations Fish Stocks\nAgreement recently resulted in a framework to enable\nthe concrete implementation of Part VII of the\nAgreement with particular attention to small island\ndeveloping States and their aspirations for fisheries. In\nthat respect, we urge other Member States to become a\nparty to that important Agreement\nAs emphasized during the special high-level\nmeeting on Monday, 22 September, HIV/AIDS remains\na devastating developmental and public health\nchallenge for us all, particularly for small and remote\nisland communities. Tonga welcomes the work of the\nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria\nand the funding it has recently approved to assist Tonga\nand other countries in the region. That complements\nour own national strategies and programmes to combat\nthose scourges.\nEarlier this year, my Government took the\nnecessary legislative, administrative and preventive\nmeasures to protect against the spread of Severe Acute\nRespiratory Syndrome (SARS). I commend the untiring\nwork of the World Health Organization (WHO) in its\ncommitted efforts to address and combat that public\nhealth threat. I also commend the recent adoption by\nthe WHO Assembly of the Framework Convention on\nTobacco Control which, as of yesterday, has Tonga as\none of its signatories.\nI was pleased to have been requested by the\nGovernment of the Solomon Islands and by other PIF\nForeign Ministers to contribute Tongan troops and\npolice personnel to the Regional Assistance Mission to\nthe Solomon Islands (RAMSI) to restore law and order.\nRAMSI has enabled the Government to address urgent\nand varied concerns such as formulating new measures\nto deal with the enormous economic and developmental\nchallenges they now face.\nThat endeavour, endorsed by the 16 Pacific\nIslands Forum member States, is testament to what can\nbe done by a region to bring about peace in its part of\nthe world. Each Pacific Islands Forum member State\nhas contributed to RAMSI in accordance with its own\ncapacity. Taken together with Australian and New\nZealand resources and command, it is producing\n12\n\npleasing results. It is not the first such regional effort in\nthe field of security. Small might too readily be\nconsidered by some to be beautiful, but we, too, play\nour role in many fields of cooperation.\nTonga continues to fully support the work of the\nSecurity Council and the call for the full\nimplementation of its resolutions to ensure lasting\npeace in arenas of conflict. In the Middle East, the\npeaceful and lasting coexistence of two States living\nside by side within secure and recognized borders will\ncontinue to be elusive until the cycle of violence ends\nand there is a return to constructive dialogue.\nIraq is a sharp backdrop for the United Nations.\nOne of the lessons of 11 September 2001 and Iraq is\nnot just that our Organization is in need of reform but\nthat reform is urgently and desperately required. As I\nstated in my Millennium General Assembly address\nthree years ago, the Security Council needs reform.\nOtherwise we shall be dealing with today's realities by\nmeans of mechanisms of yesteryear. I continue to\nsupport the call for reforming the Council by\nexpanding the number of permanent and non-\npermanent members. In like terms, I support the call of\nthe Assembly President for a proactive and action-\noriented General Assembly. Let us hope that between\nthis session of the General Assembly and the next,\nsomething concrete emerges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI\nshould like to congratulate you, Sir, upon your election\nas President of the General Assembly, and to wish you\nevery success in the performance of your duties.\nDespite the anxiety that we feel in the face of the\nterrorism that is affecting so many countries, we\nreaffirm our commitment to fight that scourge until we\nhave defeated it. Colombia reaffirms its faith in\nmultilateralism as the most effective system through\nwhich to seek peace, security and human, economic\nand social development. The United Nations is\nirreplaceable, even if, for the good of the humanity, its\nstructure and procedures must be constantly updated so\nas to increase the efficiency of its anti-terrorism\nactivities.\nThe United Nations itself recently suffered a\nterrorist attack, an act that resulted in the death of\nSergio Vieira de Mello, a tireless campaigner for the\ncoexistence of peoples. We deeply regret the loss of\nthose who have sacrificed their lives as they worked to\nput an end to terrorism. Our obligation to reciprocate is\nall the greater as a result of the solidarity expressed by\nthe United Nations towards Colombia.\nA year ago in the General Assembly I set out my\ndemocratic security policy, developed to free the\nColombian people from terrorism. That policy is\ndesigned to protect the rights of all citizens, regardless\nof their social or economic status, political ideas or\nreligious beliefs. The policy affords equal protection to\nbusiness and union leaders as well as Government and\nopposition politicians. It is based on the dream of a\npluralist nation that shares in an ongoing constructive\ndebate in a spirit of brotherhood and without hatred.\nIn an area of Colombia covering almost 1.2\nmillion square kilometres, about 400,000 of them\nconsisting of jungle, terrorists have taken advantage of\nthe absence of a State presence in many places. A year\nago, out of a total of 1,100 municipalities, 170 did not\nhave a police presence. That number has been reduced\nto 151, and we hope to extend coverage to all the\nmunicipalities within a few weeks. Hundreds of smaller\ntowns, however, lack a police force. We now have\nsoldiers and marines \u2014 known as soldiers of the\npeople \u2014 in 439 municipalities, under a programme\nthat allows them to carry out their military service in\ntheir home town. The results thus far have been\npositive, and when the soldiers have completed their\nactive duty, we hope to rely on them as permanent law-\nenforcement leaders.\nSuch efforts, together with others that we have\nundertaken in similar areas, must continue so that the\nGovernment can rid the country of terrorism.\nI would like to share with the Assembly some of\nthe achievements of my Administration during the first\nnine months of this year. The murder rate has\ndecreased by 22 per cent when compared with the same\nperiod in 2002 \u2014 down from 21,253 to 16,531. The\ntotal of 1,485 kidnappings represents a reduction of\n34.7 per cent over the same period last year; the\nnumber of victims of illegal road blocks decreased by\n49 per cent, and the number of operations to rescue\nkidnapped people increased by 22.8 per cent. But what\ncountry could accept 1,485 kidnappings in nine\nmonths?\nThe number of massacres and the number of their\nvictims have decreased by 35 per cent and 41 per cent\nrespectively. We will be able to claim victory only\nwhen we have completely eliminated these attacks.\nEvery terrorist act brings suffering to the whole nation.\nFARC carried out the car bombing of the club El\nNogal, used a bomb in a boat in the rural town of\nPuerto Rico and exploded a truck bomb in the small\ntown of Chita. These bombings together killed 47\npeople and injured 233. And just a few hours ago, in\nFlorencia, another bomb has left 12 dead and wounded\n46.\nThe number of union members assassinated has\ndeclined from 120 to 36. Several of those responsible\nare now in jail, as a result of our determination to fight\nimpunity. Sixty teachers were murdered in 2002. This\nyear, 24 such cases have been reported. The number of\njournalists murdered has dropped from 9 to 5.\nThe decrease in overall crime is significant, but\nthe numbers are still staggering. No country could feel\nsafe under such circumstances. I reaffirm our\ndemocratic desire to protect, in particular, our teachers,\nunion leaders and journalists.\n9\n\nI acknowledge with great sorrow that the number\nof indigenous people murdered has increased from 72\nto 75. Illegal self-defence groups were responsible for\n33 of those cases, with various guerrilla groups being\nresponsible for the remainder.\nDuring the first six months of 2003, 73,586 cases\nof forced displacement were reported. This represents a\ndecrease of 66 per cent. We are beginning successfully\nto return families to where they came from. I reaffirm\nour commitment to fight to protect the indigenous\ncommunities and to put an end to forced displacement.\nOf the 246 mayors who in August 2002 were in\nexile from their municipalities as a result of threats,\n191 have now returned, thanks to the improved security\nsituation. The progress we have made in regard to the\nprotection of our citizens encourages us to continue\nmaking efforts in that direction.\nBetween 7 August 2002 and 7 August 2003,\n2,544 members of illegal self-defence groups were\ncaptured, which represents an increase of 146 per cent.\nThe number of those killed in combat by the armed\nforces has increased by 38.7 per cent, the number of\nguerrillas captured has increased by 126.3 per cent and\nthe number of those killed in combat has increased by\n78 per cent.\nBecause of my pure democratic conviction, I\nreaffirm our commitment to human rights. We have\nextended the stay of the Office of the United Nations\nCommissioner in Bogota. We agree with many of its\nrecommendations. We have no doubt about seeking\ntheir implementation, and we will discuss the cases on\nwhich we disagree.\nOur requirement for the soldiers and the police is\nefficiency and respect for human rights. We encourage\nand care for our armed forces, as we demonstrated\nrecently with the improvement of our social security\nsystem. However, we will not hesitate to send to jail\nthose who break the law.\nThe sacrifice of our soldiers and policemen has\nbeen enormous. This year, because of anti-personnel\nmines alone, 109 soldiers have been killed and 334\nhave been wounded, many of them mutilated for life.\nIf we request international support, it is because\nwe are open to international monitoring. We respect the\nhuman rights organizations and their workers who\nproceed seriously and we respect their criticism and\nconstructive suggestions. Those organizations\ncontribute to improving democratic conditions. That is\nwhy we agree with the Human Rights Watch report on\nthe recruitment of children by terrorist groups. We\nreserve the right, however, to disagree with false\nreports which distort our efforts to consolidate a\ndemocratic concept of security.\nAs the United Nations has acknowledged, we\nhave made substantial progress in destroying illicit\ndrugs. We have eradicated 70 per cent of illicit crops,\nand we will not stop until we rid our country of that\nserious scourge. We have authorized the extradition of\n94 persons for drug-trafficking crimes.\nWe have hired 5,400 families as forest rangers, as\npart of our goal to recruit 50,000 families. They receive\neconomic compensation to replace illicit crops for the\npurpose of replanting and taking care of the rainforest.\nA more effective law designed to confiscate illicit\ndrug wealth has allowed for the increase in the number\nof rulings in one year from 5 to 68.\nIn Colombia\u2019s current situation, terrorism, illicit\ndrugs, violence and insecurity are really the same\nthing. We plead for a commitment from the world so\nthat we are able to completely defeat drugs. We\nimplore the world not to harbour our terrorists, to help\nus confiscate their goods and to open their doors only\nto help peace processes.\nOur country is a State based on law. We want to\novercome terrorism and be able to look to the\ninternational community with the certainty that we\nhave acted in strict compliance with the law. In order to\nfight impunity, we have incorporated the accusatory\npenal system and oral procedure, which will begin in\n2005.\nAt the present time we are introducing a\nconstitutional change to allow the armed forces to\nproceed with specialized personnel, in cases of\nterrorism, to carry out raids, conduct property searches\nand undertake interceptions. Those actions will be\nconducted with democratic safeguards, allowing for an\nindependent attorney to intervene quickly. The\nattorney\u2019s office and Congress will be informed. The\nproposed measures are infinitely less rigorous than the\ncurrent laws of democracies that do not have the high\nlevels of terrorism that we have in Colombia.\n10\n\nThis Government found approximately 30,000\npeople who belong to illegal terrorist organizations,\ndefined in this way because of the nature of their\nactions. Consideration and reflection on that figure\ndictates the need to continue with a strong authoritarian\npolicy and of opening avenues for negotiation once\nhostilities have ceased.\nI welcome the efforts made by the Secretary-\nGeneral this past year to seek paths to peace with the\nFARC. The Government supports his good offices,\nwhich, until now, have been unsuccessful because of\nthe lack of willingness on the part of the terrorists.\nThat group has kidnapped hundreds of Colombians and\nsome foreign citizens, most of whom are kept in\nconcentration camps that recall the Nazi era. I reaffirm\nto the Secretary-General my commitment to find a\nsolution, to be recommended by him, to free the\nhostages, under conditions that are in keeping with\nlegal norms and that do not intensify violence.\nSince the last Colombian Government, we have\nsought, through Cuba, on the one hand, and several\nadditional Governments on the other, a peace process\nwith the National Liberation Army (ELN). We have\nmade every effort, which, to date, has been futile. The\nleaders of that group who are in jail have received the\nbest treatment possible. On 30 June, through a\nfacilitation commission, I offered to examine an ELN\nprisoner release proposal, in exchange for their\nrenunciation of armed activity and their dedication to\nhelp achieve peace. I did not get a positive response,\nbut I will continue to insist on this.\nThe ELN is holding seven foreign citizens whom\nit should release, in keeping with its promise to cease\nits crimes during the current electoral process.\nSince the last Government, we have also sought a\npeace process with the illegal paramilitary groups, with\nthe mediation of the Catholic Church. The condition is\nthe same \u2014 the cessation of hostilities. Groups of those\norganizations, which represent 10,000 or more people,\nhave expressed the willingness to demobilize. The\nGovernment is making progress in that process.\nDuring my Administration, 2,250 members of\nterrorist groups have been demobilized; 70 per cent of\nthem belong to the FARC, 18 per cent to the ELN and\n12 per cent to illegal paramilitary groups. To\nreintegrate members of the various groups into civilian\nlife, Colombia requires a judicial framework that\nrealistically defines how to achieve justice, repair\ndamage to the community and ensure peace. The\nalternative sentence proposal, submitted by the\nGovernment for congressional consideration, sets forth\na legal and transparent procedure that will allow for\nprogress towards a negotiated peace solution with the\nillegal paramilitary groups, the FARC and the ELN.\nI understand the concern raised by offering\ndiminished sentences for grave crimes. But, in a\ncontext of 30,000 terrorists, it must also be understood\nthat a definitive peace is the best justice for a nation in\nwhich several generations have never gone through a\nsingle day without experiencing an act of terrorism.\nThe proposal has prompted national and\ninternational controversy. We are looking for the\nbroadest possible consensus. We invite everyone to\nexamine the various options and to achieve, through\nthe process of amendments, the best final text.\nWe have no doubt about defeating terrorism.\nHowever, there are times that call for adjusting the\nequation between justice and peace in order to reach a\nconsolidated peace.\nWe agree with what was expressed by Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan, who has proposed an excellent\nbalance between the need for justice and the need to\nsave innocent lives. To protect our communities, we\nneed to pursue terrorists relentlessly and not miss\nopportunities to obtain peace agreements with them,\nprovided that, through their actions, they convince the\nColombian people and the world of their good faith and\ntheir desire for rectification.\nOur problem is an international threat. If\nColombia does not destroy illegal drugs, illegal drugs\nwill destroy the Amazon Basin. If Colombia does not\nstop terrorism, it will jeopardize the democracies of the\nregion. The President of Ecuador, Lucio Guti\u00e9rrez, and\nthe Rio Group, have understood that. The Rio Group\nendorsed the proposal that the United Nations continue\nto make efforts for negotiations with the Colombian\nterrorists, or, if that is not possible, to seek alternatives\nto overcome the problem.\nOur rule of law calls for a social commitment.\nPoverty and inequality have worsened as a result of\nterrorism. We are making progress with limited\nresources in applying the seven tools for equality: an\neducational revolution, expanded social protection, an\neconomy based on the principle of solidarity, rural\nsocial management, management of public services,\n\n\nbuilding a country of owners and improving the quality\nof urban life.\nAs examples of this, we have created new\ncapacity for 500,000 children in schools, but we still\nhave 1.5 million children who do not have access to\nprimary education. Microcredit has increased by 50 per\ncent, but we are still far from being a country of\nowners. The social task is arduous, but with our\ncharacteristic determination we will overcome every\nobstacle in order to build a just society.\nSecurity is the most important human right of the\npoor, who need our policy to be successful so that there\ncan be peace, confidence, investment, employment and\nequity.\nAmidst tragedies, the Colombian democracy is\nvigorous. On 25 October, our citizens will decide\nwhether to accept a referendum to defeat corruption\nand to strengthen social investment. And the following\nday the people will elect 30 governors from among 133\ncandidates; 914 mayors from among 3,441 candidates;\n398 deputies from 373 lists composed of 2,723\ncandidates; approximately 9,000 municipal council\nmembers from 6,105 lists with 56,590 candidates; and\nlocal administrative boards from 3,156 lists with\n13,387 candidates. Today, we live in a pluralistic and\nenthusiastic democracy, despite the challenge of\nterrorism.\nIt would be a tragedy if the civilized world does\nnot unite its efforts once and for all to defeat terrorism\nand to support the democracies that are fighting against\nit. We need the unity of all democratic people in order\nto defeat terror.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish to\nbegin by congratulating the President, on his election\nas President of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\nsession and wish him every success with his work. I\nalso wish to thank his predecessor, President Kavan,\nfor the dedication with which he presided over the\nfifty-seventh session of the General Assembly.\nI also wish to endorse the statements made by the\nItalian presidency on behalf of the European Union.\nThis year is a special one for Germany\u2019s work\nwithin the United Nations. History is both a reminder\nand a guide for us. Thirty years ago, on 18 September\n1973, the United Nations welcomed Germany back into\nthe fold of the family of nations. My predecessor,\nFederal Chancellor Willy Brandt, paved the way for\nthat move. His standing as an anti-fascist inspired\nconfidence for Germany. His passionate commitment to\ninternationalism went far beyond the policy of d\u00e9tente\nin the then East-West conflict.\nIn 1980 he made an urgent appeal to the\ncommunity of States with a report entitled \u201cNorth-\nSouth, A Programme for Survival\u201d. He wrote:\n\u201cThe globalization of the dangers resulting from\nwars, chaos and self-destruction calls for a\ndomestic policy that goes far beyond national\nborders.\u201d\nWe are strongly committed to this task, and I\nthink that we Germans are not the only ones who are\ncommitted to it, because, as I said, history is our guide.\nIt guides us towards intensive international\ncooperation, of course under the auspices of the United\nNations, that we must strengthen through courageous\nreforms. It guides us towards a universal order based\non the rule of law and human dignity, on good,\nresponsible governance and prosperity that is truly\nshared by all people. It also guides us towards security\nand peace through comprehensive prevention. We must\nact resolutely by pursuing an effective multilateral\nstrategy wherever peace is threatened and human rights\nare violated. But we must act just as resolutely to\nprevent conflict and create stable structures so that\npeople can lead their lives in freedom and tolerance\nwith one another.\nThirty years ago, Germany was a country with\nlimited sovereignty, divided by the Iron Curtain. Today,\nGermany is a sovereign nation, a civil Power in the\nheart of a united Europe. We live in a common area of\nfreedom, the rule of law, prosperity and social\nresponsibility. This goes to show that development\ntowards justice and peace is indeed possible and we\nshall not cease to support endeavours to that end\nanywhere in the world, be it in the Middle East, in\nAfrica or in any other crisis area. Bearing in mind our\nown history, we are indeed assuming responsibility for\na cooperative policy of peace. This we do by\nemploying economic, political and humanitarian\nmeans.\nBut we are also assuming military responsibility,\nshoulder to shoulder with our partners in NATO and\nthe European Union, where there is absolutely no other\nway to secure peace and protect human beings. Today,\nmore than 9,000 members of the German armed forces\nand police are deployed on international peace\nmissions. Our top priority is our commitment to peace\nin Afghanistan. Germany is willing to maintain its\ncommitment there in the long term and we are ready to\nincrease it beyond its present scope. The basis for such\ncommitment is the Charter of the United Nations.\nIn the Unification Treaty, Germany vowed that it\nwould only deploy its armed forces within the\nframework of this Charter. The Charter provides us\nwith \u201cthe necessary building blocks to ensure that our\ncommon humanity is an inclusive one, built on values\nsuch as tolerance and dignity\u201d. These were the words\nof Sergio Vieira de Mello, who on 19 August 2003 fell\nvictim to an underhanded criminal attack in Baghdad.\nHe was killed along with 22 others, including many\nmembers of the United Nations staff working for the\npeople of Iraq and their hopes of a better future.\nWe are deeply affected by their deaths and must\nhonour them by taking on their legacy. Our response\nmust be to strengthen the role and commitment of the\nUnited Nations in Iraq. Only the United Nations can\nguarantee the legitimacy required to enable the people\nof Iraq to speedily rebuild their country under an\nindependent, representative Government. Germany\nstands ready to support such a process. We are ready to\n24\n\nprovide humanitarian, technical and economic\nassistance and could also train Iraqi security personnel.\nInternational terrorism, failing States and the\ndangers posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction all threaten our joint security. The obvious\nquestion is: What must be done to truly enhance\nsecurity? We must capture the terrorists and their\nmasters and destroy their infrastructure. There can be\nno doubt that we must prevent any further proliferation\nof nuclear weapons. We must strengthen the\ninspections regimes and pursue a policy of controlled\ndisarmament.\nBut as we know from history, as well as our own\nexperience, to follow any strategy focused narrowly on\nthe military and the police would be a recipe for\nfailure. Rather, what is needed is to address the root\ncauses of terrorism and insecurity. To combat\nfanaticism, we must ensure social and material as well\nas cultural security. That can only be achieved on the\nbasis of a broad concept of security. If we want to\noutlaw infamy we must put an end to lawlessness. That\nis the core task, indeed, of the international courts of\njustice and especially the International Criminal Court.\nIn order to win hearts and minds for freedom,\npeace and an open society, we must help people to\nacquire a greater stake in society, build better lives for\nthem and provide them with a secure environment.\nAfghanistan is a good example of this. There, the\ninternational community succeeded in liberating the\nAfghan people from the scourge of the Taliban and\nal Qaeda.\nAt the same time, the Petersberg Conference on\nAfghanistan, held in Bonn under the auspices of the\nUnited Nations, created a political framework for\nrebuilding the country. This process needs our\ncontinued support. There must also be sustained\ninternational commitment to the task of strengthening\nsecurity. In the long run, the fight against terrorism can\nbe won only if people see that it produces tangible\nbenefits in their everyday lives. They need to\nexperience at first hand that being once again part of\nthe international community means not only greater\nfreedom and more security, but also entails better\ndevelopment opportunities and a greater stake in\nsociety.\nThere is no doubt that we have already made\nmajor strides towards realizing our common goals\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter. More\ncountries than ever before now have democratic\nGovernments. Our concerted efforts have enabled more\npeople than ever before to put poverty behind them.\nBut we must note that the gap between the world\u2019s rich\nand poor has still not been closed and the fight against\nhunger, injustice and oppression is still far from won.\nFor this reason, eradicating poverty remains an\nimperative of our policy for peace and stability.\nThere has been a drastic reduction in the number\nof wars fought between States. In the Balkans, for\nexample, resolute action by NATO and the United\nNations enabled us to put an end to certain wars and\nprevent others from breaking out in the first place.\nNevertheless, our world has become \u2014 and not just\nsince the barbaric terrorist attacks in New York and\nWashington or indeed Bali, Casablanca, Moscow or\nDjerba \u2014 a dramatically more insecure place. New\nthreats that no country in the world can tackle\neffectively on its own, make international cooperation\nmore vital than ever before. Such threats also require\nnew strategies and that is why we are all called upon to\nreview whether the instruments available to the United\nNations are still appropriate for tackling these new\nchallenges. We all have a responsibility to ensure that\npeople and their rights are also protected in situations\nother than inter-State wars. They must be protected\nfrom genocide and the consequences of random\nviolence as well. A political commitment to\ncomprehensive prevention must further strengthen the\nUnited Nations monopoly on the use of force as well as\nthe institutions of international law.\nWithin the United Nations we need to muster the\nstrength to launch overdue institutional reforms. My\nGovernment fully and wholeheartedly supports the\nproposals made by the Secretary-General. We must\nagree how to ensure in the future an even better\nallocation of abilities, skills and scarce resources. I\nalso share the view of the Secretary-General that the\nlegitimacy of the Security Council depends on how\nwell it represents all nations and all regions. It is true\nthat the Council must be reformed and enlarged. First\nand foremost, it must also include more representatives\nof the developing countries. Let me reiterate that in the\ncontext of such reform Germany is ready to assume\ngreater responsibility.\nThe world of the twenty-first century offers us, its\ninhabitants, ample scope for change, for better or\nworse. Given the wealth of opportunities and the\nimmense dangers ahead, we have no choice but to\n25\n\nstrive for greater international partnership and expand\nand strengthen multilateralism. We will only be able to\nmake our world a more secure place if we can also\nmake it more fair and equitable. It was for that very\npurpose, after all, that the international community\ncreated the United Nations. That is its mandate. Let us\njoin together to make the United Nations even stronger.\nLet us make sure that it can fulfil its mandate to\nmaintain international peace and security and that it\ncan achieve greater justice for all.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset,\nallow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to\npreside over the work of this session of the General\nAssembly. We are confident that you will draw on all\nyour experience and wisdom to conduct successfully\nthe work of this Assembly. I assure you of all the\nsupport and cooperation of my delegation and wish you\nsuccess in your task.\nI would also like to congratulate the former\nPresident, Mr. Jan Kavan, for the exceptional way in\nwhich he presided over the work of the fifty-seventh\nsession.\nI speak today with a mixture of happiness and\nsorrow. I am happy to address the Assembly for the\nfirst time in this plenary in my capacity as Prime\nMinister of my young country, after more than two\ndecades of having sought understanding and support\nfor the cause of my people and having often lobbied for\nsupport in the corridors of this building. I am also\ndeeply saddened, however, for having lost, just over a\nmonth ago, an old friend \u2014 Mr. Sergio Vieira\nde Mello \u2014 an innocent victim of intolerance,\nextremism and terrorism. I wish to pay tribute to his\nmemory and to all those who have served the United\nNations and lost their lives in Baghdad and other\nturbulent regions of the world.\nIt was under the guidance of Secretary-General\nKofi Annan, represented in Timor-Leste by\nMr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, that exactly one year ago\nthe Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste became the\n191st Member of this Organization. The President of\nthe Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste,\nMr. Xanana Gusm\u00e3o, and I bore witness to that historic\nact.\nSince then, our country has experienced\nsignificant progress in the consolidation of our nascent\ndemocracy. My Government has presided over the\nstrengthening of national cohesion and has given\npriority to the unequivocal affirmation of the Republic\nas a democratic State founded on the rule of law by\ntaking normative measures in governance to implement\nthe provisions of a modern Constitution drafted by the\nTimorese and adopted by an Assembly democratically\nelected by the people.\nOpen governance is one of the programmes of my\nGovernment. Based on the principles of good\ngovernance, inclusion, participation of the individual\nand collective responsibility, open governance was\ninitiated in January this year. It consists of bringing the\nGovernment to the people in the remote areas of the\ncountry to hear first hand their priorities, problems and\nneeds, as well as to clarify to the people the national\ndevelopment plan, the Government programme,\navailable resources and the challenges ahead. It also\nseeks to instil a greater sense of responsibility in the\npeople and to make them better understand the need for\ntheir participation in the reconstruction of the country\nvis-\u00e0-vis the implementation of the national plan, the\nmethods of achieving the objectives of economic\ngrowth and of the reduction and eradication of poverty.\nIn relation to the legislative process, we have\nprioritized the adoption of laws for the foundation of\n6\n\nthe State, above all in order to avoid taking\ndiscretionary and subjective measures that are without\nlegal foundation. Hence, more than 30 decrees and\nlaws have been adopted by the Government for\napproval by the National Parliament. In this manner,\nwe will create an institutional culture of democracy,\ngiving basis to a democratic State founded on the rule\nof law and the principle of good governance.\nThe challenges are enormous, however. Of the\n900 schools destroyed in 1999, around 700 have been\nrehabilitated and more than 30 new schools\nconstructed. Despite this, 25 per cent of our children\nremain without access to education.\nIn the tertiary sector, we have a national\nuniversity with more than 7,000 students. Hundreds of\ncandidates are frustrated that their expectations of\ngraduating from the national university have not been\nmet. We now have a proliferation of institutions of\nhigher learning that are not officially recognized by the\nGovernment. To deal with this situation, the\nGovernment has assumed the responsibility of\npreparing rules.\nIn health care, similar challenges are being faced.\nMuch of the infrastructure has been rehabilitated and\nmore is being built, but the people want more\nassistance and means of support. They ask for more\ndoctors, more nurses, more midwives, more\nambulances and health centres closer to their villages.\nA national health policy has been adopted by the\nGovernment. We hope soon to be able to reduce the\ndifficulties in this area with the cooperation of the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and the Republic of Cuba\nin the provision of doctors to operate in the rural areas.\nIn agriculture, more than 60 per cent of the\nirrigation system has been repaired and new systems\nhave been built. It is important now to instruct farmers\nin the best methods of use for their systems and to\nmake them responsible for the maintenance of those\nsystems while the remainder is being repaired.\nIn infrastructure, in general, the repairs and\nmaintenance have been slow and difficult. There are\n6,000 kilometres of roads to be rehabilitated and\nmaintained, and our people are demanding the opening\nof many others. Many bridges need to be rebuilt,\ncompleted or built outright.\nWe also are facing problems in the electrical\nsector, which is in deficit. We have re-established\nelectricity production in all districts and in 55 of the 65\nsub-districts. Dili, the capital, has power 24 hours a\nday. In the meantime, it is the policy of my\nGovernment to identify and develop alternative sources\nof energy that are more accessible and sustainable.\nCurrently, we are conducting a feasibility study of such\nresources, in particular in the area of hydropower.\nAccess to running water for consumption is very\nlimited. However, it is undeniable that the number of\npeople with access to running water is increasing daily,\nmore so than in 1999.\nIn the area of telecommunications, we are\nimplementing an ambitious project overseen by Timor-\nLeste Telecom through a concession in the build-\noperate-transfer system.\nAt the end of this year, all district capitals will\nhave at their disposal fixed and mobile telephones, for\nboth domestic and international purposes. With the\ncompletion and installation of the telecommunications\nsystem, we will also create the technical conditions\nnecessary for the development of television and radio,\ndelivering the best service in the media sector, which is\nfree, vibrant and responsible.\nThe process of reconstruction is taking place in\nan environment of peace and stability. However, areas\nthat are key for guaranteeing the sustainability and\ncredibility of the entire process, such as the judicial\nsystem, defence and security, will continue to require\nsubstantial assistance and support for some time to\ncome.\nIn other sectors of the Administration, we need\nqualified people to assist in the development of the\ncapacity of the Timorese, in particular in the\nconsolidation of the financial and banking systems,\nborder control, legislative drafting and the definition of\na national policy, promotion of investment and\ntechnology transfer.\nWith this in mind, I would like to reiterate that, in\norder to guarantee the sustainability of the entire\nprocess and to meet two major aspirations \u2013 that of our\npeople for peace, democracy and development, and that\nof the international community to continue to promote\nTimor-Leste as a success story, we must not forget to\nsay the following.\nTo our people, we would say \u2014 as we have been\ndoing \u2014 that they should be more patient. Above all,\n7\n\nwe must demand their participation and that they\nshoulder their responsibilities.\nWe ask the international community for\nconsistency, continued dynamic partnership and\nsupport.\nTo the General Assembly in particular, we ask\nthat it endorse the Economic and Social Council\u2019s\ndecision to include Timor-Leste in the list of least\ndeveloped countries.\nIn keeping with its history of struggling for\nhuman dignity, my country has ratified a number of\nimportant international human rights treaties. We are\naware that the ratification of these international\ninstruments creates legal obligations, and the Timorese\nState will do its utmost to implement its commitments\nunder those instruments.\nWith regard to external relations, we continue to\ndevelop ties of friendship and cooperation with our\nneighbours, namely, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia,\nJapan, South Korea and New Zealand, and in particular\nwith our two closest neighbours, Indonesia and\nAustralia.\nAs Prime Minister, I have made official or\nworking visits to Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines,\nIndonesia, Thailand, New Zealand, Mozambique,\nAngola, Portugal and the People\u2019s Republic of China.\nAt the beginning of this month, a meeting of the\nJoint Indonesia-Timor-Leste Ministerial Commission\nwas held with a view to resolving a number of residual\nissues of recent years, as well as to promoting new\ncooperation in the areas of commerce, investment,\ndevelopment, education, health and security. The\nmeeting had a positive outcome. We hope to finalize\nthe demarcation of our land boundary this year in order\nto begin negotiations on our maritime boundaries.\nBoundaries, whether land or sea, define the territory of\na country. Within a territory, one can exercise powers\nof sovereignty or jurisdiction. For this reason, Timor-\nLeste, having as its neighbours two large and friendly\ncountries \u2014 Indonesia and Australia \u2014 hopes to see its\nborders with both countries demarcated or delimited by\nthe end of my Government\u2019s mandate, so that all the\nresources belonging to the people of Timor-Leste can\nbe exploited in a free and sovereign manner, for the\nbenefit of present and future generations of Timorese.\nThe relationship between Timor-Leste and its\nneighbours is developing in a constructive and dynamic\nmanner at the bilateral, trilateral and multilateral\nlevels.\nTimor-Leste enjoys special observer status in the\nPacific Forum and has participated as a guest in the\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN).\nTimor-Leste is a fully fledged member of the\nCommunity of Portuguese-Speaking Countries; the\nAfrican, Caribbean and Pacific-European Union; the\nWorld Bank; the International Monetary Fund; the\nAsian Development Bank; and various specialized\nUnited Nations agencies.\nThe fight against terrorism, organized crime and\ntrafficking in human beings, drugs and illegal arms is\nat the top of the agenda, regionally and in Timor-Leste.\nWe will make every effort to contribute to the\neradication of these ills, which are turning into a real\nepidemic with the development of new technology.\nTimor-Leste is a country of South-east Asia\nwhich is linked to the Pacific by geography, history and\nculture. Our people are proud to be part of this great\ngeographical region of Asia and Oceania \u2014 rich in\nhistory, culture and civilization, and comprising more\nthan one fifth of humanity. We are deeply grateful to all\nour Asian brothers \u2014 Japan, the People\u2019s Republic of\nChina, the Republic of Korea, the Philippines, India,\nMalaysia, Singapore and Thailand \u2014 who have\nresponded without fail to our appeal for assistance, on\na major or modest scale, depending on the capacity and\nexperience of each country. We are grateful to all of\nthem.\nI have just concluded a visit to the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China. Within weeks, Timor-Leste will\nreceive the Prime Minister of Malaysia,\nMr. Mahathir Mohamad. In December, we will be\nhonoured with a visit from the Prime Minister of the\nKingdom of Thailand.\nWe continue to strengthen our relationships with\nother countries in South-east Asia, in particular Brunei\nDarussalam, Cambodia, Laos and Viet Nam.\nWe deem it regrettable that the process of\ndialogue and national reconciliation in Myanmar is at a\nstandstill. Timor-Leste associates itself with the\nconcerns and disappointments of our friends in\nASEAN, and we join our voice with those of others in\nthe international community to appeal for the\nimmediate release of Mrs. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and\nof all others who are being detained, and for the\n8\n\nresumption of talks and of the process of reconciliation\nand democratization.\nMy Government takes note of the commitments\nundertaken by General Khin Nyunt, Prime Minister of\nthe Union of Myanmar, in his speech of 30 August\n2003. We would like to express our deep concern at the\nabandonment by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of\nKorea of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) and its stated intention to\nproduce nuclear weapons. The Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea has three countries as its neighbours\nthat over the years have demonstrated friendship and\nsolidarity. None of those three countries presents any\nthreat to its security or sovereignty, thus the production\nof nuclear weapons cannot be justified.\nTimor-Leste is a small country with a small\npopulation. Nonetheless, it has coastlines on two\noceans and is linked to two continents. Historically, we\nwere for five centuries the only Portuguese colony in\nthe region, and, during a quarter century, a territory\noccupied by Indonesia. More than 90 per cent of the\npopulation of my country is Catholic, and there are also\ntwo minority religious groups \u2014 Protestants and\nMuslims.\nHistory determined that we would be different.\nOur geographical situation conferred on us conditions\nfor converging and relating. We remain different and,\nwithin that difference, we find our identity and sense of\nopenness and tolerance. We know that we have\nsomething to give, but we also have much to receive.\nI am a Muslim of Arab descent and the Prime\nMinister of a country with a Catholic majority. Our tiny\nMuslim community lives in peace and tranquillity,\nintegrated into society in general without losing its\nidentity and without feeling alienated or discriminated\nagainst. The Timorese Catholic leadership has been\nexemplary in preaching respect and tolerance in\nrelation to all religious faiths, constantly searching for\ndialogue, cooperation, participation and mutual respect.\nMy country does not intend to put itself forward\nas a model of tolerance, mutual respect and coexistence\nbetween religions. I am speaking about our experience\nonly to say that in this world of hate, violence,\nintolerance and extremism, there are some oases of\ntolerance, peace and tranquillity that deserve to be the\nsource of new energy.\nFanatics and extremists have existed throughout\nhistory and no region or civilization in the world can\nclaim exclusive rights to virtue or truth. In this\nglobalized world, there is no place for racial or\ncultural, much less religious, superiority. Extremists\nand terrorists have always existed. The fundamental\ndifference is that the terrorists of today benefit from\nglobalization and make use of modern technology as a\nmeans of achieving their objectives.\nIt is rhetoric, and unacceptable, to define different\ncivilizations and religions as a target. The fundamental\nreason for violence in the world is inequality in\ndevelopment and, in particular, the injustice of the\ninternational economic order. The target of extremists\nand Islamic terrorists is not the West, its culture and\ndominant religions. Rather, it should be stated that the\nWest is a target as a consequence of the global order.\nWe are witnessing a new reality. The agenda of\nthe extremists is primarily the toppling of moderate and\nelite regimes and the imposition of theocratic systems\nin which the universal values embraced by a\ndemocratic State are called into question, as they\ncontradict their views. Such an agenda would mean a\nreturn to the Middle Ages, with the Islamic extremists\ndetermining the fate of their citizens.\nThe fight against extremism, fanaticism and\nterrorism must be waged on all fronts. One is the\nmilitary front, where action must be seriously thought\nthrough and always implemented with great caution\nand clear-sightedness. The other fronts include the\npolitical, economic and social. The fight against\npoverty and exclusion must be integrated into our\nglobal strategy in the war against terrorism.\nMy Government congratulates the people of Iraq\non the end of one of the bloodiest dictatorships in\nhistory. The people of Timor-Leste know only too well\nthe significance of a dictatorship. In order to be free of\nit, we sacrificed hundreds of thousands of our children\nin decades of unequal struggle.\nDuring our struggle for independence and\ndemocracy, we always believed that our efforts should\nbe focused on re-establishing international legality in\nour country, ensuring that the United Nations take\nresponsibility and demanding that the international\ncommunity respect the Charter and United Nations\nresolutions on Timor-Leste.\n9\n\nMy Government defends the concept that the\ncentral role of the United Nations must be respected by\nall countries, in particular those with the means and\nresources to strengthen the role of our Organization.\nWith regard to the situation in Iraq, it is urgent\nthat international legality be re-established in that\ncountry. The only legitimate means of transferring\nsovereignty to the people of Iraq is to hand over power\nto their democratically elected representatives.\nWe believe that the Arab League must be a\nprivileged partner of the United Nations in the process\nof transition and reconstruction in Iraq. As it is a\nregional organization representing more than 200\nmillion people who mostly profess the same religion,\nspeak the same language and are of the same cultural\nand historical origin, it must not be ignored or\nbypassed when its own interests and that of the region\nare at stake.\nMy country is a good example of the kind of a\npartnership that can develop when the United Nations\nand its obvious natural role in the resolution of\nconflicts and the mobilization of international\nconsensus is recognized. Each process is unique and\nhas its own dimensions and characteristics, but our\npositive experience can be repeated in other places, and\ncan serve as a reference point for Iraq.\nI would like to comment on two issues related to\nthe Middle East, beginning with Palestine. We express\nour deep disappointment that the peace process has\nregressed and that violence has escalated in that part of\nthe world. We feel encouraged by the presentation of\nthe road map, and hope that it can assist in accelerating\nthe peace process.\nWe reaffirm our support for the road map and for\nthe right of the people of Palestine to self-\ndetermination, independence and the establishment of\nan independent and sovereign State. We appeal to all\nthe parties in that bloody conflict to cease all forms of\nviolence, to resume dialogue and rigorously to respect\nthe road map as agreed to with the Quartet.\nWith respect to Western Sahara, the Arab and\nMuslim people of that former Spanish Territory\ncontinue to wait patiently for the holding of a\nreferendum on self-determination, as agreed to by all\nparties in 1994. We appeal to the General Assembly,\nthe Secretary-General, the Security Council, the Arab\nLeague and the African Union to encourage both\nparties to return to direct dialogue with a view to\nestablishing a definitive date for the holding of the\nreferendum on self-determination in the territory of\nWestern Sahara.\nMy Government is closely following the situation\nin Guinea-Bissau. While deploring the military coup\nthat toppled the elected President, we are relieved that\nthere was no bloodshed or loss of life. My Government\nsupports the holding of new elections with a view to\nthe restoration of a constitutional democratic order, if\npossible within the framework of the United Nations\nand the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries,\nto achieve the necessary support for the bringing of\npeace, stable government and economic recovery.\nWe regret the breakdown in talks during the most\nrecent round of the World Trade Organization\nMinisterial Conference held in Cancun. The\nindustrialized nations must understand that the\ninternational trade systems must be rectified. It is\nneither ethical nor moral for the rich countries to\npreach democracy, human rights and the dogma of a\nfree market, while practising protectionist policies that\ncondemn hundreds of millions of human beings to\nperpetual poverty and dependency. It is less than\nethical when they teach the rules of the free market\nwhile subsidizing their farmers with billions of dollars,\nmaking the products of our countries, which have a\ngreater comparative advantage, increasingly less\ncompetitive.\nTimor-Leste has benefited from international\nsolidarity, and we are grateful for that. But we cannot\nremain silent in the face of injustices and anti-\neconomic policies that impoverish the rest of the\nworld. We appeal for the renegotiation of debt and for\ndebt relief for the poor and indebted countries. But we\nalso believe that debt relief must be proportional to the\nmeasures taken by each country in adopting strategies\nfor sustainable development and focusing on the\neradication of poverty. This means increased\nexpenditure on public health and education, reduced\nmilitary expenditure, the strengthening of democratic\ninstitutions, the promotion of human rights and the\nindependence of the judiciary. Those are conditions\nthat are indispensable for peace and prosperity.\nIn conclusion, I would like to touch on the theme\nof reform of the United Nations. The creation of this\ninstitution was the result of the collective experience of\nhumankind, victim of the greatest scourge in history.\n10\n\nWe congratulate the founders on their vision, but we\nare conscious that the institution reflects the reality of\nthat period. In 1945 there were merely 51 Members,\nand it was viewed as a club for the rich and powerful, a\n\u201cwhite man\u2019s club\u201d. But the United Nations today is a\ntruly global institution, with 191 Members.\nThe recent experience of Iraq provoked a new\ndebate on the need for the structural reform of our\ninstitution, beginning with the Security Council, which\nis increasingly being called upon to provide opinions\nand to intervene in many regions of the world. We\nsupport an increase in the number of permanent\nmembers of the Security Council to reflect the current\ndemographic reality and the new world balance.\nMany people are frequently asking themselves,\nand asking out loud, a few questions, such as \u201cIs it fair\nfor the Western Group to have three permanent seats in\nthe Security Council, while Asia has only one and\nAfrica and Latin America have none? Is it possible that\nIndia, the largest democracy in the world, with more\nthan one billion inhabitants, does not have the same\nstatus as others? Is it possible that Brazil, with the\nworld\u2019s ninth largest economy and Latin America\u2019s\nlargest, a crossroads of races and civilizations \u2014 Ibero-\nLatin American, African and indigenous people \u2014\ndoes not have status as a permanent member of the\nSecurity Council?\u201d Throughout its history, Brazil has\nshown prudence and balance in the conduct of its\nforeign politics, an active and constructive engagement\nat the regional and international level and always a\nvoice of moderation and dialogue.\nThere are certain procedures that may have been\nunderstandable during the cold war period. But today\nthe way must be made for principles of democratic\ndecision-making that are acceptable and universally\npracticed. We must question these paradigms.\nWe also believe that the term of the mandate for\nnon-permanent members must be reduced to between\nsix months and one year. That will give the 191\nmembers of our Organization the opportunity to serve\nin this organ. Besides, a shorter period will allow the\nless privileged to feel the desire to invest their human\nand financial resources to serve on the Security\nCouncil.\nThe reform and the democratization of a number\nof organs of our Organization are necessary and urgent.\nThe errors and failures of the past, when the Security\nCouncil was powerless and indifferent to human\ntragedy, should compel us all to have the courage to\naccept a fair share of the decision-making that affects\nus all.\nLet the big, rich and powerful know that humility\nis the greatest virtue. Leadership means knowing how\nto dialogue, persuade and build alliances and\nconsensus. There are challenges ahead. There are many\nthreats. The resources of 191 countries are represented\nin this huge Organization. To respond to these\nchallenges and threats, we must unite and build bridges\nof consensus and active cooperation.\nAllow me to conclude by saying that the future\nbelongs to the optimists. We are here today because we\nfavour optimism. That is why the struggle must\ncontinue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffPeru has no doubt that multilateralism is the best\ninstrument for confronting global challenges, as well as\nfor guaranteeing peace and international security. For\nthat reason, the United Nations is indispensable. All\nMember States must have the conviction to strengthen\nit, to contribute to its institutional regeneration and to\nreform it. With a reformed United Nations, we will\ncontinue our struggle against poverty; we will maintain\nthe world development agenda; we will assure\ndemocracy; and we will fight decisively against drug\ntrafficking and international terrorism.\nThe terrorist attacks taking place in different\nareas of the world and the threats to peace in several\nregions create an international climate of instability\nand insecurity that calls for urgent solutions. Terrorism\nconspires against the democracies of the world.\nTerrorism conspires against the health of the world\neconomy. Terrorism contributes to making the poor\neven poorer. Peru strongly condemns the terrorist\nattack on the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad\nand wishes to pay sincere tribute to all the victims, in\nparticular to Sergio Vieira de Mello, Special\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General.\nWe cannot accept terrorism as a political tool. In\nour case, the 20 years of violence bequeathed by the\nSendero Luminoso is a hard lesson to cope with.\nAccording to the final report of the Truth and\nReconciliation Commission, recently submitted to my\nGovernment, thousands of lives were lost and more\nthan $30 billion in losses were reported. This report is\n13\n\nthe result of a resolute political decision of our\nGovernment to make sure that Peru never again has to\nface irrational acts of terror.\nTruth must also be a means to prevent impunity\nand to lead us to reconciliation with justice. My\nGovernment is firmly struggling against impunity. That\nis why we consider that the fugitives who fled Peru\nwhen the corrupt regime of the past decade was\noverthrown should answer to justice for the gravity of\nthe crimes they committed. We will insure these people\na fair trial and all the guarantees of due process, within\nthe framework of the Inter-American Convention on\nHuman Rights and Peruvian law.\nThat is why we hope that our requests for\nextradition will be taken into account. Democratic\nStates have the responsibility to avoid impunity. In this\nregard, the Peruvian State wishes in this Assembly to\nthank the 20 friendly countries that have announced\ntheir decision to detain anyone on the list of\nextraditables if they enter their territories.\nPoverty, social exclusion and fundamentalist\nideologies are among the causes of the current crises.\nThe hopes of our countries to be part of an inclusive\nglobalization are not bearing fruit. Despite some\nachievements at the national level, there is a wide\nchasm to bridge if we are to build such an inclusive\nglobalization. For example, in the case of Peru, despite\nan unfavourable international environment the\neconomy grew by 5.2 per cent last year, one of the\nhighest rates in Latin America. Inflation was below 1\nper cent, international reserves rose to their highest\nlevel yet, and exports reached unprecedented figures.\nHowever, we must concede that all these\nindicators are not enough to make the common people\nfeel the benefits of such macroeconomic achievements\nin their own pockets. Today, it is necessary for the\nglobal economy to reach an annual average growth of 7\nto 8 per cent if we wish to reduce poverty and to create\nemployment. If we in the developing world,\nparticularly in Latin America, grow by 6 or 7 per cent,\nit will barely be enough to recover the per capita\nincome of 1970. We have to achieve adequate growth\nas soon as possible. The poor cannot wait another 15\nyears for their economies to grow in a sustained\nmanner that will reduce poverty.\nDemocratic governance in Latin America is at\nrisk. There is no doubt that there is a correlation\nbetween the health of the world economy, social\ninclusion and democratic governance. World leaders\ncannot close their eyes. There is no possible\ngovernance without a reduction of poverty. We must be\ncreative and courageous in order to ensure that Wall\nStreet's macroeconomic requirements meet the\nexpectations of Main Street.\nLast year before this Assembly, I highlighted the\nneed to defend democracy from market turbulence by\ncreating innovative financial mechanisms. We said that\nthe time had come to build a new global consensus to\nreaffirm democracy and re-evaluate development with\nsocial equity. Since then, Peru has been working on a\nseries of initiatives in this regard. Last May, 19\ndemocracies of Latin America and the Caribbean,\nmembers of the Rio Group   over which I have the\nhonour to preside   approved a key document that we\ncall the Cusco Consensus. This document comprises\nfour Peruvian initiatives on innovative financial\nmechanisms that allow us to finance democratic\ngovernance in the region; to increase public investment\nin roads, hospitals and schools; to create jobs; and to\nsupplement private investment.\nIn relation to one of these proposals, last August,\njointly with the President of Brazil, Luiz In\u00b7cio Lula da\nSilva, we decided to work together on the\nestablishment of the South American Infrastructure\nAuthority project, which will operate as a fiduciary\nagency to facilitate the financing of investment projects\nfor the integration of South America. I am sure that\nthat experience can be duplicated in other parts of the\nworld.\nLikewise, we have signed a memorandum of\nunderstanding on physical and economic integration to\nset into motion three axes of development\nintegration   in Peru, Bolivia, Brazil and Ecuador  \non the road to South America's integration.\nAccordingly, Peru signed an agreement that will lead to\nthe creation of a free trade zone with MERCOSUR.\nFrom this international forum, we would like reiterate\nthat those efforts and achievements in the area of\nintegration constitute decisive steps on the path\ntowards building a South American community of\nnations. However, I wish to point out that, beyond the\ndecisions that two or more countries of the subregion\nmay take, it will be essential for the international\ncommunity to commit itself to the initiatives emanating\nfrom an exercise in collective reflection.\n14\n\nDeveloping nations are concerned about the\nalarming increase in external vulnerabilities resulting\nfrom instability in financial flows and their impact on\ninvestment levels and economic growth in our region.\nThose countries also perceive the presence of\nprotectionism in the area of trade, in particular on the\npart of certain industrialized nations. I would like to be\nfrank in this connection: we ask developed countries\nnot to demand that we open our markets while they\nprotect their products with billions of dollars in\nsubsidies every year, especially in the agricultural\nsector. Our countries can no longer withstand\nasymmetrical relations in the area of trade. The time\nhas come to build a two-way business highway that is\nmore transparent and predictable. We are being asked\nto open up our markets in the agricultural sector while\nthere are still countries that are investing billions of\ndollars every day to subsidize their own products. Do\nnot ask us to practice something that you do not\npractice yourselves. Our countries are aware of the fact\nthat we have to be competitive, but we must build that\ntwo-way commercial highway.\nPeru is especially concerned about the negative\nresults of the recently held ministerial conference of\nthe World Trade Organization in Cancun, which,\ndespite some progress, was unable to reach consensus.\nThere is a continuing desire for multilateralism and\nfree trade in Peru. We therefore trust that there will be\na return to negotiation in the next few months so as to\nrealize the goals set out at Doha, which placed\ndevelopment foursquare on the agenda of the WTO.\nWe have an obligation to build a more just, secure\nand humane world. That is why today I ask the United\nNations and our great friend of peace, Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan, to exercise their great authority\nand prestige to promote within the World Bank, the\nInternational Monetary Fund, the Inter-American\nDevelopment Bank and the member countries of the\nGroup of 8 a wide debate on the innovative financial\nmechanisms that will make it possible to finance\ndemocratic governance in the region; increase public\ninvestment in schools, hospitals and roads; generate\njobs and promote private investment. That is the only\nway by which globalization can be inclusive, and by\nwhich governance can be strengthened. May God bless\npeace in the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt\nis my pleasure to congratulate you, Sir, on your\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-eighth session. We trust that you will guide the\ndeliberations of this session with great efficiency, skill\nand wisdom. I also pay tribute to your predecessor,\nMr. Jan Kavan, President of the General Assembly at\nits fifty-seventh session, for having successfully led the\ndeliberations of that session.\nIn addition, we should like to express our\nappreciation for the tireless efforts of the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, and for his commitment to\nthe Charter of the United Nations with a view to\nenhancing international peace and security.\nAfter the 1980s, Israel began unilaterally to\ndelineate borders through the Seven Star Settlement\nPlan, initiated by Mr. Sharon when he was Housing\nMinister. The plan involves building Israeli settlements\nalong the Green Line   the line of the old armistice  \nin order to obliterate the Line, which separates the\nterritories occupied in 1967. Israel has used agreements\nas an opportunity to build more settlements, which now\ntotal 187 in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.\nThe holy city, Jerusalem, has been subjected to an\nextensive Judaization campaign with a view to\nimplementing the Greater Jerusalem plan to increase\nthe number of settlers within Palestinian areas. Under\nthat plan, land has been confiscated and a wall isolating\nJerusalem from neighbouring areas is being built.\nIsraeli settlers have occupied Palestinian homes in\nmany Palestinian neighbourhoods. In Jerusalem, Israel\nhas confiscated 70 kilometres of land in order to build\nbypass roads in the West Bank under the pretext of\nredeployment. Therefore, Israel has taken the first steps\nin implementing a plan aimed at establishing cantons,\nwhich, Mr. Sharon had planned long ago to isolate\nPalestinian cities and villages by building settlements\nand bypass roads to prevent any geographic contiguity\namong population centres in Palestinian areas.\nThe building of the wall is part of the Israeli\npolicy of imposing a fait accompli, of exploiting\nsecurity conditions to attain certain objectives by\ncreating bantustans and enclaves and by isolating\nPalestinian villages from their surroundings, including\nseparating such villages from Jerusalem. Thus the\nseparation wall has isolated the cities of Eizariya and\nAbu Dis on all sides. All entry and exit into and out of\nthese two cities is through Israeli military checkpoints.\nWe condemn you, Israel, for such actions.\nAn article in the 10 August 2003 edition of\nHaaretz reads:\nThe Palestinian children who will be the\nnext generation are being raised under extremely\ndifficult circumstances in comparison with those\nwho preceded them. They see only the ugly face\nof Israel; therefore, they will be consumed by\nblind hatred and a desperate desire for revenge.'\nAnother article in the same newspaper this month\nnotes:\nIsrael lays the blame on Arafat, after it\nforced him to win the chairmanship of the\nPalestinian Authority by democratic means in\naccordance with the Oslo Agreement, ignoring\nthe fact that it must, first and foremost, do its part\nto alleviate the tension by giving up the occupied\nterritories.'\nThe article continues:\nCan Israel ignore the regrettable fact that\nthe European Union was among the majority that\nsupported the General Assembly resolution?\nIsrael's diplomatic defeat at the United Nations is\nthe inordinate price that Israel paid as a result of a\nstupid decision by its Government   a decision\nthat was no more than a declaration of its\nintentions. Its hope to eliminate Mr. Arafat is a\nstark embodiment of Israel's inclination to shirk\nresponsibility and then to blame fictitious\ndevelopments on the Palestinian side for the\nproblem. Instead of taking the necessary action to\ncalm the situation, Israel uses the working plans\nof its adversary as a pretext and then, should it\nfall short of meeting its goals, complains that\nthere is no party to negotiate with on the other\nside.'\n30\n\nFirst of all, Israel must contribute its share to\nsettling the dispute   that is, it should make every\npossible effort to defuse the tension. According to\nHaaretz, there is a Palestinian ceasefire proposal, but\nthe Israeli Government has refused thus far to respond\npositively to the offer. It continues to repeat its\nhackneyed position that an agreement is not possible\nwhile Arafat is in power and as long as the Authority\nfails to dismantle the terrorist organizations. Israel\nimposes those conditions without making any change\nin the general conditions surrounding the conflict.\nHaaretz continues to say that the world has despaired\nand wrung its hands in frustration. The Israelis do not\nexpress condolences when our sons are killed; they do\nnot denounce such killings, nor do they even establish\nany contacts.\nBefore the road map was announced, the\nPalestinian Authority had been called upon to\nundertake certain reforms, such as drafting a\nconstitution, creating the post of premier and\ntransferring certain powers from the President of the\nPalestinian State and the Chairman of the Palestinian\nAuthority to the Prime Minister. Chairman Arafat made\nmany concessions to assist the Palestinian Government\nin carrying out its duties. The Government of Israel\nmade several attempts, under various pretexts, to delay\nthe declaration of the road map: first, it was holding the\nIsraeli elections at the beginning of the year; then it\nwas establishing the Cabinet; then it was waiting for\nthe Iraq war. Finally, when Israel hesitantly accepted\nthe road map, it rejected 14 of its provisions.\nAt the Sharm al-Shaikh Summit and at the Aqaba\nSummit of 6 June, the representative of the Palestinian\nAuthority   who at that time was Prime Minister\nMahmoud Abbas   committed himself to\nimplementing the road map, pledging to meet its\nrequirements before President Bush of the United\nStates, King Abdullah of Jordan, the King of Bahrain,\nand President Mubarak of Egypt. He announced the\nPalestinian Authority's commitment to a ceasefire and\nits readiness to recognize Israel within secure borders.\nHowever, in his statement Mr. Sharon refused to\nmention Israel's commitment under the road map to the\nvision of two States   the establishment of an\nindependent Palestinian State that is viable and\nsovereign, living side by side with Israel in peace and\nsecurity, as expressed by President Bush. Mr. Sharon\ndid not accept the immediate cessation of all acts of\nviolence against the Palestinians. All that Mr. Sharon\nsaid were a few words regarding a Palestinian State\nwithout any mention of an independent, viable and\nsovereign State of Palestine. Nor did he declare an\nimmediate cessation of Israel's acts of violence.\nDespite that, the Palestinian Authority, together\nwith all other resistance factions, declared a ceasefire\non 26 June. That ceasefire was to remain in place for\nthree months. Regrettably, Israel continued its terrorist\npractices, and the Israeli army of occupation\nassassinated 86 Palestinians. To sabotage the declared\nceasefire, Israel assassinated the political leaders of the\nresistance factions. The situation then slipped into\ntension and confrontation, one month after the\nceasefire had been announced.\nInternational reports state that the majority of\nPalestinians in the occupied territories now depend to\nsome extent on food rations. In May of this year, the\nWorld Bank reported that the volume of international\ncontributions to the Palestinian territories had grown:\nsince the beginning of the Palestinian intifada, external\ncontributions accounted for more than $1 billion of the\nbudget of the Palestinian Authority. They have\ntherefore provided sustenance to more than half a\nmillion people   the families of the employees of the\nPalestinian Authority. Those contributions staved off\nan enormous, acute humanitarian crisis. Donors who\nhoped for reconciliation had no choice but to make\ncontributions because the Palestinian Authority's\nnetwork of services collapsed and the living conditions\nof Palestinian citizens deteriorated. It is not strange,\nthen, that the Palestinians persevere through\ninternational assistance.\nHowever, this generosity on the part of the\ninternational community ultimately profited the Israeli\nenemy. International support provided a protective\nnetwork through which Israel was able to afford an\nexpensive occupation of the West Bank. Israel controls\nthe areas militarily for free, without assuming any\nresponsibility for the lives of the citizens there.\nFighting terrorism is an arduous task. However,\nwe do not see anyone keenly seeking the root causes of\nor motivations for terrorism, nor even concerned about\nthe international isolation that Israel is suffering\nbecause of its practice of State terrorism. It is as if the\nstifling Israeli economic crisis were a predestined,\ndivinely ordained phenomenon. In the search for the\nculprits, Arabs and the resistance are held to be the\ncause of the crisis.\n31\n\nThere was a real chance for the United States to\nembrace all the peoples of the world, not only through\nthe compassion of those peoples for the people of the\nUnited States but also through the unified effort to\nfight terrorism. The United Nations should have seized\nthat opportunity through a programme objectively and\nreasonably implemented, not by using cannons or\nfighter jets or by mobilizing huge forces to destroy a\nhated regime. The real reason for that was well known\npolitical and economic ambitions. The world was\noutraged at the military action, but it stood idly by,\nobserving the consequences of the misuse of force.\nThe United States Administration expressed its\nkeen interest in implementing the road map and\nestablishing an independent Palestinian State.\nRegrettably, it did not, as a sponsor of peace, address\nthe crisis with the required effort and effectiveness. It\nis not enough to stress the vision of President Bush or\nthe commitment of his Administration to such a vision,\nwhile continuing to employ a policy of double\nstandards. That Administration continues to blame and\nwarn the Palestinian Authority. It continues to urge the\nAuthority to combat the resistance, which they can see\nonly as terrorism against the Israeli occupation, despite\nthe fact that all international norms stress the right of\noccupied and colonized people to self-determination by\nwhatever means. The United States Administration\noverlooks the Israeli leader's terroristic practices and\nIsrael's failure to implement its commitments in\naccordance with the road map.\nThe shortcomings of the United States role reflect\nnegatively on the peace process. They obstruct the\nprocess and make success very difficult, such as by\nrefusing to deal with President Arafat, the legitimate,\nelected President of the Palestinians. Mr. Arafat is the\nonly leader who has shown conviction and flexibility\nwith respect to the peace process. As a result of that,\nMr. Arafat shared the Nobel Peace Prize with\nMr. Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated by dirty\nhands in Israel in order to prevent the continuation of\nthe peace process, spreading anxiety and doubts among\nPalestinian and Israeli citizens alike.\nThe Arab side accepted the initiative of His\nHighness Crown Prince Abdullah Bin Abdul-Aziz for\nthe establishment of comprehensive peace with Israel\nafter its total withdrawal from all the occupied Arab\nterritories. The Crown Prince carried that initiative to\nWashington, D.C., in his historic meeting with\nPresident Bush in April 2002. The initiative was based\non the agreed terms of reference for the road map,\nalong with the resolutions of international legitimacy,\nthe Madrid terms of reference and the principle of land\nfor peace.\nIn conclusion, peace in itself is not an objective\nfor Israel. That will be true as long as Israel continues\nto receive all forms of assistance from major Powers\ntrying to maintain their strategic interests in the Middle\nEast region, and opts to settle issues militarily, outside\nthe framework of the United Nations and the\nresolutions of the Security Council.\nIsrael has laid siege to the Palestinian people. It\nhas paralysed the apparatus of the Palestinian\nAuthority, preventing it from operating. The Israeli\narmy assumed responsibility for security. But how did\nit do that? By killing, assassination and destruction.\nWhat is required first is the withdrawal of the Israeli\nforces from the occupied territories to the borders of 28\nSeptember 2002.\nThe Security Council should adopt the road map\nand work to implement it through the Quartet. The\nsiege against the Palestinian people and their elected\nPresident Yasser Arafat must be lifted. The United\nStates must cooperate positively and effectively to\nfacilitate the task of the Quartet and to warn Israel of\nthe consequences of obstructing its tasks. Deploying\ninternational forces into a buffer zone created between\nthe two sides will facilitate implementation of the road\nmap and the Palestinian Authority's task of maintaining\nsecurity in the area from which the Israeli forces will\nwithdraw. Those forces will receive complete\ncooperation from the citizens of Palestine."

Let me also pay tribute\nto his predecessor, Mr Jan Kavan of the Czech\nRepublic, for his excellent work during the fifty-\nseventh session of the General Assembly.\nOur appreciation also goes to the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his dedicated and\nsteadfast leadership of the United Nations during these\ntrying times. We commend him for his tireless efforts\nto make the United Nations more effective and\nresponsive to the demands of its Members.\nIn recent months, some have questioned the\nrelevance and utility of the United Nations. For\n28\n\nSeychelles, the United Nations remains a unique,\nindispensable and universal multilateral institution\nwhere global issues affecting the entire international\ncommunity can be debated and addressed. We believe\nthat, despite its shortcomings, there is no other\ninstitution that is better equipped and better suited to\nmeet the diverse demands for justice, peace, security,\ndevelopment and international cooperation or to ensure\nthat the voices of its Members are heard, irrespective of\ntheir size or economic power. We hereby reaffirm our\nfaith in the principles and purposes of the United\nNations in addressing the wide range of challenges\nconfronting the international community in the\nglobalized and interdependent world we are living in at\nthe dawn of the twenty-first century.\nWe acknowledge the fact, however, that the\nUnited Nations system needs to be reformed and\nmodernized. We support the ongoing initiative to\nrevitalize the General Assembly to make it more\neffective and efficient. Our Assembly ought to be\nrestored to its rightful place at the centre stage of\nmeaningful deliberations on problems and issues\ncommon to all of its Members. We ought to strive to\nensure that debate in our Assembly is translated into\naction. In this respect, my delegation calls for the\nestablishment of a follow-up mechanism to monitor\nand implement decisions and resolutions taken by the\nGeneral Assembly, as well as those of the major United\nNations conferences of the past decade.\nThe reform process will be inadequate if the\ntransformation of the Security Council into a\ndemocratic and representative organ, reflecting its\nuniversal character and present-day realities, is not\nachieved. My delegation supports an increase in both\npermanent and non-permanent members to include\ndeveloping countries from Africa, Asia and Latin\nAmerica. After 10 years of debate, it is imperative that\nwe bridge positions and make progress. What is\nrequired is political will by all the parties concerned\nwith a view to arriving at an acceptable solution.\nWe support the decision of the Secretary-General\nto establish a high-level panel of eminent persons on\nthe reform question. We hope they will provide\ninspiration and fresh ideas for the way forward.\nMy delegation holds the view that development\nought to be central to the renewed United Nations\nagenda. The reform process should focus on\nreinforcing the role of the United Nations system in the\ncommitment to international cooperation for\ndevelopment. There should be closer collaboration and\ncoordination between the United Nations system and\nthe international financial institutions in elaborating\nnovel frameworks to address development funding. The\nongoing dialogue between the Economic and Social\nCouncil and the Bretton Woods institutions should be\nvigorously pursued.\nWe welcome the dialogue between the leaders of\nthe Group of Eight and their counterparts from the\ndeveloping world. Those consultations should be a\nplatform to engage the industrialized countries of the\nNorth in fulfilling their commitments to the outcomes\nof the major conferences, in particular the Millennium\nSummit, the Doha Development Round, the Monterrey\nConsensus and the Johannesburg Plan of Action. Our\ndevelopment partners should realize that the\nimplementation of their commitments is vital if we, the\ndeveloping countries, are to achieve sustainable\ndevelopment. Their words must, indeed, be matched\nwith deeds. The allocation of the agreed target of 0.7\nper cent of their gross domestic product for\ninternational development should be an achievable\nobjective.\nThis dialogue should also provide an opportunity\nfor us to candidly discuss issues that are of common\ninterest and concern. Problems requiring urgent\nattention, such as HIV/AIDS, poverty, the root causes\nof terrorism, the debt burden, refugees, trade terms,\ntrafficking in humans, climate change and\nenvironmental degradation, to name just a few, should\nbe addressed as part and parcel of shared international\nresponsibilities.\nThe situation of small island developing Sates\nwill feature high on the international agenda next\nAugust when Mauritius hosts the International Meeting\nfor the 10-year review of the Barbados Programme of\nAction. It will be a timely occasion to reaffirm the\nspecial characteristics, vulnerabilities and concerns of\nsmall island developing States and to consider their\nprospects for sustainable development. It will be an\noccasion to remind the international community to pay\ngreater attention to the social, economic and\nenvironmental vulnerabilities faced by small island\ndeveloping States.\nThe Mauritius review will present the opportunity\nto assess implementation progress to date and establish\nthe appropriate framework for further partnership and\n29\n\ncooperation in achieving the sustainable development\naspirations of small island developing States. We will\nneed the required resources to advance implementation.\nWe therefore appeal to our development partners for\ntheir fullest support in the review process and the\nimplementation of the outcome of the Mauritius\nInternational Meeting.\nMy delegation notes with concern the breakdown\nof negotiations at the recent World Trade Organization\nministerial conference in Canc\u00fan. Small developing\ncountries have no capacity whatsoever to distort world\ntrade. It is therefore imperative that their\nvulnerabilities and special needs be taken fully in\naccount. Seychelles urges the international community\nto heed the call for special and differential treatment to\nbe accorded to developing countries, in particular small\nisland States, that have structural disadvantages. This is\ncrucial to the integration of our countries into the\nmultilateral trading system so that we can achieve our\ndevelopment objectives. Concessions to small,\nvulnerable developing economies should include the\ncritical areas of market access and trade preferences.\nThe second pillar of my country\u2019s economy \u2014\ntuna fisheries \u2014 faces a real threat. There will be\nconsiderable social and economic consequences for us\nif the preferential treatment on which the industry was\nbuilt is to be abandoned. After all, the trade regime is\nmeant to provide benefits for all, not to condemn the\nmost fragile and vulnerable groups of the international\nfamily to marginalization and economic strangulation.\nA subject of preoccupation to my delegation is\nthe adverse impact of climate change. Studies, as well\nas experience, have revealed that extreme changes are\ntaking place in the climate patterns of the Western\nIndian Ocean region. Over recent years my country has\nexperienced unusual periods of drought and torrential\nrainfall, the latter causing floods, landslides, the\ndestruction of agricultural crops and infrastructure and\neven loss of life. It is estimated the 75 per cent of the\ncorals in our archipelago have been bleached due to an\nincrease in sea surface temperatures.\nGlobal warming is not an issue of our making.\nSmall island nations like mine are not responsible for\nit, yet we have to bear the consequences. This growing\nthreat calls for renewed concerted international action,\nas it is affecting the whole planet. All nations must take\nsteps to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The\nindustrialized countries have the prime responsibility\nand must be the first to take action. We urge them to be\naccountable under the Kyoto commitments and to\nratify the treaty, as this is the only appropriate\nmultilateral framework that can address and respond to\nthis phenomenal challenge facing all nations on earth.\nLast year the General Assembly endorsed the\nNew Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD),\nas the framework for development for the continent.\nInternational support for the implementation of this\nhome-grown initiative is essential. We appreciate the\npledges of support by the G-8 by means of their Africa\nAction Plan. We hope that this will soon evolve into\nthe realization of concrete projects and programmes.\nMy delegation is of the view that there should be\nprovision in the NEPAD development agenda to take\ninto account the peculiar problems and specificities of\nthe eight island nations that constitute the African\nfamily.\nThe 19 August attack on the United Nations\ncompound in Baghdad serves as the latest reminder to\nall of us of the central importance of being vigilant and\nprepared to combat terrorism. Seychelles reiterates its\ncondemnation of terrorism in all its manifestations.\nWe are in the process of finalizing our accession\nto the 12 United Nations conventions and protocols on\nterrorism. We are actively cooperating with the\nCounter-Terrorism Committee in the implementation of\nthe obligations of Security Council resolution 1373\n(2001).\nComplying with the obligations of this Security\nCouncil resolution is a daunting task for a very small\ncountry like mine, with extremely limited capacity to\ndeal with the relevant requirements. We will do our\nshare as part of our responsibility, but to succeed we\nneed technical and financial assistance. There is also\nthe need to ensure that the capacities of small States\nare enhanced through sharing of intelligence\ninformation, training of personnel, and the provision of\nappropriate technology and equipment, for example, to\ndeal with and handle the new challenges we have to\nconfront. We hope the international community will be\nattentive and responsive to our predicament.\nThe conflict in the Middle East has brought about\ntoo much suffering and destruction. My delegation\nsupports the road map for peace and calls on all parties\nto the conflict to embark on genuine and substantive\ndialogue and negotiations in the interest of durable\n30\n\npeace in the region. We reaffirm our belief in the rights\nof the Palestinian people to their own independent\nState, with clearly defined borders. We welcome all\nefforts in facilitating the search for an enduring\nsolution to the conflict.\nAs regards the situation in Iraq, my delegation\nhopes that full sovereignty will be restored to the Iraqis\nas soon as possible, and that a credible and widely\naccepted political road map will be drawn up and\nimplemented. We believe that the United Nations\nshould have a central role to play in the process.\nWhen Assembly President Julian Hunte assumed\noffice, he appealed for an action-orientated and\nproactive General Assembly. I give him the assurance\nthat, albeit in a modest manner, he will receive the full-\nhearted support of the Seychelles delegation for a\nproductive and fruitful session."

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe United\nNations is a great and good idea, born of human\nsuffering and the universal desire for a better world.\nDespite the many difficult challenges it has faced\nthroughout more than half a century of its history, it\nhas always had an important role to play. It has\nsucceeded because it has been able to adapt and\nbecause, on meeting new obstacles, it has found a modus\noperandi to achieve its objectives, although not always to\nthe desired extent. Particularly worthy of mention are its\nachievements in peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance\nand the development of international law and the\nuniversal values that international law upholds.\nThe role that the United Nations has played to\ndate is clear proof of the fact that not every issue\nfacing the international community can be resolved\nunilaterally, or even bilaterally. In a time of growing\nglobal interdependence there are more and more\nproblems that countries cannot solve alone, or even in\ncooperation with a smaller number of other countries.\nThe multilateralism of the United Nations must\ntherefore not be built on values that promote the short-\nterm benefit of individual countries or interest groups.\nInstead, it must be grounded in the awareness that no\none can be satisfied in the long term if we are\nsurrounded by people living in destitution and without\neven the basic necessities of human dignity. Values\ngrounded in that awareness must become an inseparable\ncomponent of relations between countries as the global\ninterdependence of the human race increases.\nThat increasing global interdependence is also\nevidenced in the sphere of security, the most\nfundamental pillar of human welfare. Economic, inter-\nethnic and religious tensions are no longer limited to\nsingle States or regions, but can now have potentially\n2\n\nglobal effects. The most drastic warning of that became\nclear in the terrorist attacks on the United States. The\nIraqi crisis and other areas in turmoil offer further\nwarnings in that respect. There is no doubt that we can\nonly effectively fight international terrorism and the\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction through\nthe broad cooperation of many countries. The United\nNations played a central role in building an\ninternational coalition against terrorism, and it must\ncontinue to play that role.\nAs we fight against the universal evil of\nterrorism, we must ensure that our eyes remain focused\non upholding the great gains of our civilization. Human\nrights take pride of place among those achievements.\nSometimes we cannot avoid the Hobbesian dilemma\nbetween security and freedom. Still, we must be aware\nthat the sacrifice of freedom for security frequently\nresults in achieving neither. We must therefore ensure\nthat international commitments to respect human rights\nare upheld.\nThe international community has taken an\nimportant step in the protection of human rights with\nthe creation of the International Criminal Court. It is\nour sincere hope that the most serious crimes against\nhumanity will not go unpunished and that the Court\nwill succeed in putting an end to such crimes through\nits independent operation.\nOver the past year, the international community's\nfocus has been on Iraq. At first the course of events\nwith regard to Iraq revealed the limitations of\nmultilateral cooperation and decision-making. Those\nevents now illustrate the limits of engaging unilaterally,\ngiven the immense challenges in the area of\ninternational security and the inherent limits of\nunilateralism itself. The complexity of the post-conflict\nreconstruction and revitalization of Iraq demands the\nwidest possible support from the international\ncommunity and Iraqis themselves. The United Nations\nis the only body capable of serving as the embodiment\nof such support. Its role in Iraq must become more\nactive while retaining its autonomy. Only a strong\nUnited Nations with a broadly defined mandate will be\nable to fulfil the role we require of it, namely, to serve\nas a factor for stability in Iraq and in the entire region.\nPerforming that role would be the best means of paying\ntribute to the representatives of the United Nations who\ntragically lost their lives in Iraq, including Sergio\nVieira de Mello and his colleagues. They will live on in\nour memories as well as in our actions.\nWe should not allow the focus on the most visible\ncrises and on the fight against terrorism to lead to the\nneglect of other dangers to global peace and security. A\nsingle example of that would be the areas of Africa that\nrequire assistance in both ending conflicts and tackling\nthe root causes of such unrest. Even Afghanistan,\nwhere so recently all eyes were focused, has faded\nfrom our minds. Yet there is a clear danger that the\nchronic instability of that country could revert to\ndevastating civil war. Nor can we neglect the region of\nSouth-Eastern Europe, which posed one of the most\nserious threats to global peace and security throughout\nthe 1990s. South-Eastern Europe is now peaceful.\nHowever, the success or failure of its post-conflict\nstabilization is still dependent on the active\ninvolvement of the international community. We must\ntherefore devote sufficient attention to political and\nsocial consolidation in that region.\nThe world cannot respond to the Iraqi crisis by\nreducing that issue to one of military security, or even\nby engaging in the increasing militarization of\ninternational security. We must focus on the source of\nthreats to international security. We must work hard\ntowards responsible and sound development that does\nnot widen the gap between rich and poor. We must\nmove beyond a developmental pattern that worsens\ndifferences and tensions. Instead we have to ensure\nsound prospects for all, including those in the so-called\nthird world. In the same vein, we must have\ninternational trade rules that enable less developed\ncountries to use their resources to the maximum\nbenefit. The collapse of negotiations in Cancun should\nbe taken seriously. Developed countries should respond\nby accepting more of the requirements put forward by\ndeveloping countries. The Millennium Declaration and\nits Millennium Development Goals are an important\nresponse to those challenges. We must therefore\ncontribute what we can to achieving those objectives.\nI would like, at this point, to make special\nmention of the fight against HIV/AIDS. I warmly\nwelcome the special session of the General Assembly\ndedicated to that issue.\nThe objective increase in global interdependence\nrequires a strengthened role for the global\nOrganization. To that end, we must revitalize the\nUnited Nations and adapt it to meet new challenges.\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan has accomplished a\ngreat deal thus far in the area of rationalizing United\nNations operations and increasing efficiency. We\n3\n\ncongratulate him on those achievements and will\nsupport him in his continued efforts to that end. We\nalso welcome wholeheartedly his intention to establish\na high-level panel of eminent persons to look at current\nchallenges to peace and security and to review the\nfunctioning of the major bodies of the United Nations\nwith a view to recommending ways of strengthening\nthe Organization.\nA number of questions and proposals relating to\nthe revitalization and reform of the General Assembly\nhave already been identified, and they have the support\nof the majority of Member States, including Slovenia.\nThey now need to be put into practice. Let me also\nreaffirm Slovenia's belief that the Security Council\nmust be enlarged to include representation for the\ncountries that have the most responsibility for\nmaintaining international peace and security. At the\nsame time, there must be adequate representation for\nthe rest of the international community in order to give\nthe Council a satisfactory level of legitimacy.\nPutting aside the changes required in the\nfunctioning of the United Nations, it should be pointed\nout that many misconceptions about the United Nations\nstem from a lack of information about the Organization.\nOn the basis of the experience it has gained to date, the\nUnited Nations may do well to consider expanding its\nown global network of universities. Such institutions\nwould be subordinate to national legislation and would\noffer a high quality education in the spirit of the United\nNations. Such a policy would have numerous benefits.\nStudents would learn a great deal about the United\nNations, while the United Nations would be\ncontributing to increasing the level of education, as\nwell as disseminating its core values.\nGlobalization has opened our eyes to the vital\nrealization that the whole human race is interdependent\nin its very essence. We must respond to the new\nchallenges of globalization by strengthening our efforts\nto ensure that the values that the United Nations has done\nso much to develop are also globalized: international\npeace and security, respect for human rights, solidarity\nand environmental protection. The United Nations\nmust continue to play a leading role in that all-\nimportant process. To that end, it is our responsibility\nto make the United Nations capable of enacting those\nvalues   and hence its admirable purpose   thereby\nmaking the world a better place in which to live.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like first of all\nto express my sincere gratitude to Mr. Jan Kavan for\nhis work as President of the General Assembly at its\nprevious session. We appreciate the knowledge and\nskilful leadership of the current President, Mr. Julian R.\nHunte of Saint Lucia, and wish him a year of\nconstructive dialogue and cooperation.\nThis year was one of shocking news and human\ntragedy. We lost a noble man and a distinguished\ndiplomat, our friend Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, and\nmany others who happened to be on duty at the United\nNations premises on that tragic day in Baghdad. More\nrecently, we paid a final tribute to Ms. Anna Lindh, the\nlate Swedish Foreign Minister and our good friend,\nwho fell victim to another act of human insanity. We\ngrieve for those lost, but we also remember their work\nand unfinished missions.\nIraq is one such example of unfinished business.\nThe restoration of sovereignty and the implementation\nof a political process leading to the establishment of a\nfully representative Government through democratic\nelections is our primary goal. State-building, however,\nis not an overnight process. Only through coordinated\neffort and close international cooperation can we\nexpect to rebuild a free and peaceful Iraq. The United\nNations, with its unique experience and legitimacy, is\nessential to efforts to help the Iraqi people recover their\nsovereignty. In Iraq, the first signs of recovery are\nalready visible, as demonstrated by the appointment of\na Governing Council and the formation of a\npreparatory constitutional committee. These positive\ndevelopments should be supported and encouraged.\nThus we look forward to the forthcoming Madrid\nconference, which will address many issues important\nto Iraq\u2019s future. International support is indispensable,\nand sometimes even critical, to people coping with the\nlegacy of a fallen dictatorship.\nThe current setbacks in the conflict between\nIsrael and the Palestinians must not prevent the\nimplementation of the road map. The vision of two\nStates living side by side in peace and prosperity\nremains the only viable option.\nThe real strength of our power as an international\ncommunity continues to lie in our resolve to deal\ncollectively with critical issues. The recent report of\nthe Secretary-General posed hard questions. We need\nto find consensus on the conceptual and political\nframework for the operation of the United Nations in\n15\n\nthe coming decades. Lithuania firmly supports the\nUnited Nations as it pursues the goals enshrined in the\nUnited Nations Charter. We share the view that the\nmultilateral institutions must be updated and\nreinforced. It is absolutely essential that the United\nNations and its principal organs be seen as relevant and\neffective. Lithuania is ready to contribute to the goal of\nbuilding an international order based on effective\nmultilateral institutions and on the fundamental goals\nof the United Nations Charter.\nLasting peace is our collective responsibility. The\nSecurity Council must be able to take a leadership role\nin maintaining international peace and security. Thus\nLithuania supports substantial reform to ensure a better\nand more equitable representation in both categories,\npermanent and non-permanent, through the inclusion of\nGermany and Japan, as well as certain other leading\ncountries from other regions.\nLithuania welcomes the intention of the\nSecretary-General to establish a high-level panel of\neminent personalities to address responses to current\nchallenges. The European Convention, which prepared\nthe draft European Constitution, is a good example of\nhow such fundamental policy questions could be dealt\nwith.\nRegrettably, terrorism and the proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction and their means of\ndelivery continue to be on the list of our chief security\nconcerns. The Thessaloniki European Council\nDeclaration on the Non-Proliferation of Weapons of\nMass Destruction, and the European Union\u2019s (EU)\nbasic principles and action plan against the\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction are well-\ndefined responses. Lithuania associates itself with them\nand will contribute to their implementation. I should\nalso like to recall the Hague Code of Conduct Against\nBallistic Missile Proliferation, which is yet another\nresult of multilateral efforts and is worthy of global\nuniversalization.\nGlobal stability also requires regional efforts. In\nthis context, I would like to note with satisfaction that\nnext year Lithuania and other Central and Eastern\nEuropean countries will join the EU and NATO, thus\nexpanding the zone of stability and democracy in\nEurope. Moreover, our accession will have an\nimportant positive effect on the nations at the new\nborders of the EU and NATO. Lithuania is determined\nto continue its good-neighbourly policies and to\ndevelop closer relations with its new EU neighbours. I\nshould also like to draw attention to Baltic-Caucasus\nregional cooperation, which is already developing a\nnumber of successful initiatives.\nWe are witnessing the willingness to adopt more\neffective measures to combat terrorism and weapons of\nmass destruction. Invariably, more conventional\nchallenges can be dealt with by transparency and\nconfidence-building activities. As a new State party to\nthe Ottawa Convention, Lithuania is committed to\ncontributing practically to its implementation and\npromotion. We feel that it is increasingly important to\nfacilitate regional dialogue and action that contributes\nto the abolition of anti-personnel mines and the\nclearing up of old unexploded ordnance. We have\nalready started working with interested parties in that\nrespect.\nDemocracy, the rule of law and respect for human\nrights and fundamental freedoms are undoubtedly the\nmost important in our system of values. In view of the\nprocess of globalization, securing this system is a great\nchallenge. Such global afflictions as poverty, hunger,\nunsustainable development, disastrous massive\npandemics and grave violations of human rights raise\nbefore us the vital task of standing together in order to\nsecure the future of our children.\nStable conditions for peace cannot be created\nwithout addressing poverty and eradicating social\nexclusion. We should, therefore, put all our efforts\ntowards achieving the goals that we agreed to in the\nMillennium Declaration. Lithuania, as a future member\nof the European Union, is also assuming its\nresponsibilities as an emerging donor in this regard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me great pleasure to convey to you,\nSir, and to your friendly country, Saint Lucia, our\ncongratulations on your election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly. I would like to express my\nappreciation to you personally and my full confidence\nin your ability to effectively conduct the work of the\nAssembly at this session.\nI would also like to express our gratitude to your\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, who led the work of the\nAssembly at its last session with wisdom and expertise.\nI also wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute\nto the Secretary-General and to express the gratitude of\nthe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for his continuous and\ntireless efforts to establish peace and security in the\nworld, strengthen the role of the Organization, increase\nits efficiency, preserve its credibility and enhance its\neffectiveness.\nIt is saddening and distressful that this session is\nconvening while the echo of the horrendous attack\nagainst the United Nations offices in Baghdad that took\nthe life, among others, of one of its prominent and\ntowering figures, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello is still\nresonating in our hearts. I avail myself of this\nopportunity to convey to the Secretary-General, to the\nstaff of the Secretariat and to the families of the\nvictims of this tragic incident my sincere and deepest\ncondolences. I would also like to express the hope that\nneither this incident nor the most recent one that took\nplace a few days ago will impede the efforts aimed at\npromoting the role of the United Nations in\nconsolidating stability and prosperity in Iraq.\nThe hideous attack on the United Nations offices\nin Baghdad represents a challenge that can be dealt\nwith and contained, and the necessary security\nconditions to minimize such occurrences in the future\ncan be established. However, our Organization is, at\nthis juncture, facing other challenges that are more\nserious than what happened in Baghdad, challenges\nrelated to its raison d''tre and to the principles and\nfoundations stipulated in its Charter. These principles\nwere not heeded and the responsibility for this is ours.\nThis has in many instances impeded its effectiveness\nand credibility.\nNevertheless, its ability to exist and perform and\nthe contributions it has provided and continues to\nprovide in various humanitarian, cultural and social\nfields through its specialized agencies are sufficient to\nencourage support for the Organization and provide it\nwith every assistance it needs.\nIn the comprehensive speech he gave at the outset\nof this session, the Secretary-General referred with\nclarity and transparency to the growing trend towards\nunilateral action outside the realm of international\nlegitimacy in dealing with current problems such as\nterrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction. This expanding trend to resort to unilateral\naction on the basis of the right to self-defence could\nundermine the principle of collective security on which\nthe Charter was founded. We stressed this in the\nMillennium Declaration that was issued by the General\nAssembly three years ago.\nNevertheless, we have to admit that not\nconfronting such actions effectively and with\nseriousness and steadfastness when faced with dangers\nand threats such as those that emanated from the\n21\n\nregime of Saddam Hussein, have led, it seems, to\nconfusion. This confusion has provided the advocates\nof collective action and the defenders of unilateral\naction with parallel arguments that each group is now\nusing against the other. Whoever wants to criticize the\npolicy of unilateral action will find no difficulty\nproving that such a policy could only exacerbate and\nincrease problems.\nOn the other hand, those who criticize the\ninternational community for being lax in acting\ncollectively to confront such problems that threaten\nsecurity and stability will also come up with arguments\nto prove that such reluctance and negligence in facing\nchallenges is behind the eruption of the major crises of\nour contemporary history.\nIt was therefore natural that, due to such\ndivergence in views, a situation was reached wherein\nthe focus turned to debate and theorization rather than\nto dealing directly with current problems and deciding\non practical measures to resolve them. This is exactly\nwhat happened with respect to Iraq immediately before\nthe war.\nInternational terrorism, in all its manifestations\nand forms, represents a very dangerous challenge to\nour international Organization and to the international\ncommunity at large. It deserves our condemnation\nwhich must be resolute, categorical and unequivocal.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has expressed this\nposition at different forums and international\ngatherings.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which has\nsuffered and continues to suffer from acts of terror, has\nlaunched a relentless war against terrorism, enacted\nregulations that punish perpetrators, inciters and\nsympathizers with terrorist activities and has\nintroduced counter-terrorism as one of the main\nsubjects in the curricula of its schools. It has also taken\na series of measures to close any loopholes in the way\ncharities collect money, in order to prevent funds from\nbeing diverted for unlawful purposes.\nHowever, regardless of its effectiveness, the\ninternational effort directed against terrorism will not\neradicate this phenomenon without addressing its root\ncauses and the reasons for its spread.\nThe Palestinian issue, which has become a\nconstant item on the agenda of all the sessions of the\nGeneral Assembly over the past five decades, continues\nto be a cause of instability and turmoil in the Middle\nEast region, whose nations yearn for peace, prosperity\nand development. I don't think I need to go into the\ndetails of this issue, of which you are completely\naware, but we should remember Israel's persistence in\nits provocative policies and practices, which focus on\nrepression, persecution, political assassinations,\nsettlers' issues and the ominous fence. This is an\napproach that has subverted all initiatives and\nproposals aimed at solving the Palestinian issue,\nincluding the Arab peace initiative and the road map.\nThe solutions that were presented on the\nPalestinian issue were harmed mostly by the Security\nCouncil's contradictions, especially among its\npermanent members, in dealing with resolutions in this\nregard. We see resolutions being adopted but remaining\nmere ink on paper, and when the time comes for their\nresolutions on implementation, the veto power is\ninvoked to abort implementation.\nThe only way out of this vicious circle, from our\nperspective, is for the permanent members to pledge\nnot to use the veto power when dealing with\nresolutions or measures aimed at implementing the\nsubstance of resolutions previously adopted. This\nmatter may be one of the issues that the reform team\nproposed by the Secretary-General should consider in\norder to invigorate the role of the United Nations in\nhandling current issues and challenges.\nThe people of Iraq look to our Organization to\nend the confusion, anarchy and chaos that resulted\nfrom the collapse of the previous regime. The major\nproblem facing Iraq now is the absence of a clear\nvision as for the future of Iraq and the fact that Iraq\ncannot control its own destiny. Iraq faces a grave and\ncomplicated internal situation, coupled with a delicate\nand sensitive geographical location.\nIt is therefore of utmost necessity that we set a\nclear timetable that would assure the Iraqis that they\nare close to restoring their sovereignty and\nindependence through an accelerated political process\nlinked to specific commitments, whether with regard to\nconsolidating the power of the transitional Iraqi\nGovernment or drafting a new Iraqi constitution that\nwould pave the way for the formation of a legitimate\nnational Iraqi Government under which all citizens\nwould enjoy equal rights and responsibilities.\nBased on this premise, my country views the\nTransitional Governing Council in Iraq as representing\n22\n\na positive step paving the way towards this goal. While\nwe give utmost importance to the role of the United\nNations in Iraq, we are hopeful that any debate on Iraq\nwill focus on determining its needs and finding\neffective means to respond to them, including\ncontributions by all Member States to this noble effort,\nnamely the stability of Iraq.\nThat must be done speedily, efficiently and in a\nway that would conform with the needs of Iraq. Iraq is\na country of pivotal importance, geographically and\nhistorically, in our region. It possesses natural and\nhuman resources that qualify it to take a prominent role\nin the international community. All it needs from us is\nan initial push to allow it to regain its sovereignty,\nstability and growth.\nThe manifestations of the proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction are a cause of great\nconcern and tension in the Middle East. This means\nthat we must declare the Middle East and the Arab Gulf\nregion a zone free from weapons of mass destruction.\nWith regard to the need to increase the\neffectiveness and universality of the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and its system of\nsafeguards, monitoring and inspection, we also believe\nthat certain standards and controls must be put in place\nto assure progress in all fields of the elimination of\nweapons of mass destruction. Based on this, we call\nupon all countries that have yet to join the Non-\nProliferation Treaty (NPT) to take the necessary steps\nto do so, especially Israel, and to submit their nuclear\nsites and installations to the international safeguards\nregime.\nThe international situation looks again as it used\nto be during the time of polarisation, including\nincreasing tensions, crises and divisions that have\nparalyzed the Security Council. Despite the fact that\nwe have entered the third millennium, we still lack the\nneeded commitment and collective political will to\ntranslate our commitments into reality. International\npeace and security are still but a hope and an aspiration\nfor many people and countries. Comprehensive\ndevelopment is still a dream for many and a distant\nobjective we all hope to achieve.\nIn the Middle East, where countries suffer from\nthese symptoms, we see in the ideas presented by\nPresident Bush, for the promotion of development in\nthe Middle East many positive signs, which\ncollectively present a model for fruitful cooperation\nbetween rich nations and developing countries.\nIn the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, His Royal\nHighness the Crown Prince presented an initiative\naimed at reforming the situation in the Arab region in\nthe economic sphere, with structural reforms as well as\nexpansion of political participation at its core. If the\nregion succeeds in benefiting from these two\ninitiatives, its future will be promising.\nThe fact that there are still chronic issues on the\nagenda of our Organization, like the Palestinian\nproblem, issues of comprehensive development and the\nemergence of issues like Iraq makes it incumbent upon\nus to embark on two parallel tracks: credibility in\nupholding the principles of the Charter, and seriousness\nin implementing United Nations resolutions. We must\nnot substitute futile and senseless arguments which\nwould be useless to us all for practical solutions.\nOur deeply rooted belief in of the important role\nthat the United Nations can play in dealing with crises\nand its efforts to avoid the horrors of war and to\nprovide means for international cooperation make us\nmore determined than ever to support this Organization\nand consolidate its constructive role. We want the\nUnited Nations to take a greater role in handling crises\nbefore they occur through the implementation of what\nis known as preventive diplomacy rather than through\npre-emptive wars, in order to preserve stability and\nmaintain international peace and security.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI have the honour to make\nthe following statement on behalf of His Excellency\nMr. Erkki Tuomioja, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\nFinland.\nMultilateralism and the United Nations have gone\nthrough a trying time since the last session of the\nGeneral Assembly began. At the same time that\nmultilateralism has been challenged by unilateral\nactions, it has been proved that multilateralism and\nmultilateral cooperation \u2014 as well as the United\nNations \u2014 are needed, perhaps more than ever before.\nThe discussions at the World Trade Organization\nMinisterial Meeting in Canc\u00fan also point to the need\nfor open and broad discussions on preserving a\nmultilateral trading system based on mutually agreed\nrules.\nInternational cooperation is needed in crisis\nmanagement and prevention, in disarmament and arms\ncontrol, in promoting human rights and international\nlaw in general, in enhancing sustainable development,\nin strengthening global governance with regard to\nenvironmental issues and in creating coherence and\ncooperation on economic and social issues, among\nother things. In order to do this, a more efficient and\neffective United Nations is needed. The United Nations\nsystem must deliver solutions to increasingly\ncomplicated challenges, be it Iraq, the Middle East,\ncoherence between trade and development, or financing\nfor development. Through their political will, Member\nStates should give the United Nations the support it\nrequires in order for it to be a true actor in world\naffairs. We need to be more efficient and more result-\noriented.\nThe development and strengthening of the United\nNations pose a major challenge at this particular\njuncture. United Nations structures \u2014 the Security\nCouncil included \u2014 require reform, and the whole\nOrganization requires better resources. This is a\nprerequisite also for a comprehensive implementation\nof the Millennium Declaration, which forms a\ndemanding agenda for the United Nations for years to\ncome.\nDespite different emphases and definitions given\nto freedom of action or joint actions, all the\nprerequisites exist for strengthening multilateral\ncooperation. As a member of the European Union,\nFinland is involved in the discussion on the\nsignificance of multilateralism and on the terms for\npromoting global security. This, too, should be one of\nthe main topics in this session of the Assembly.\nIn addition to what was said in the Italy\u2019s\nstatement on behalf of the European Union, I should\nlike to focus on two issues that require multilateral\ncooperation in particular: the issue of harnessing\nglobalization and that of weapons of mass destruction.\nThe biggest challenges in the future will be those\nto international peace and security, which become\nbroader and broader in their scope, and the\nglobalization process, as well as managing these two\ntogether through multilateral cooperation.\nGlobalization affects everyone. Some can benefit\nfrom it. Some become more marginalized by it.\nGlobalization stems from a countless number of\ndecisions made in the private sector and beneath or\noutside public institutions. But we must be able to\ninfluence, through the United Nations and other\ninternational organizations, corporate and public sector\ndecisions that direct globalization. There are many\nongoing processes that try to make globalization more\ninclusive and allow everybody to share its benefits.\nThe Finnish Government, together with the\nTanzanian Government, is launching the Helsinki\nProcess on globalization and democracy. Ultimately,\nthe global governance pursued by the Helsinki Process\nis characterized by the democratization of international\n20\n\nrelations, by the way that globalization and its by-\nproducts can be managed through more equal\nparticipation in deciding on international rules and\nnorms. One of the key tasks of the process will be to\ndevise and develop new solutions for global problems.\nWe will also focus on the global economic agenda and\non human security.\nThe international players in globalization include,\nin addition to States and multinational companies, the\ncontinually growing network of non-governmental\norganizations. Many of those organizations take a\ncritical or negative stand on globalization, but do not\nhesitate to adopt procedures that are characteristic of\nglobalization or to build networks across national\nborders. Out of a vast array of organizations, I could\nname two that are perceived as opposite: the World\nEconomic Forum and the World Social Forum. Both,\nhowever, are concerned with the same challenges in the\nsame world. One of the aims of the Helsinki Process is\nto bring these two processes closer to each other.\nA global approach to international peace and\nsecurity and a multilateral security system based on\ncooperation are largely axiomatic principles for\nFinland and for our partners in the European Union.\nBut security problems linked to globalization, and\nsolutions to them, threaten to divide the international\ncommunity. Peace is much more than the absence of\nwar nowadays. Development and peace are inseparably\nintertwined, and both of them are being affected by\nglobalization.\nAnother major issue that requires multilateral\ncooperation is weapons of mass destruction and\nprevention of their proliferation.\nEffective global governance requires universally\nagreed norms and rules setting standards for behaviour\nto be followed by all States as well as by non-State\nactors. Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\nand their means of delivery is clearly an issue that\naffects the international community as a whole. No\nState can ignore these dangers. Today more than ever,\nwe need to step up our collective efforts to halt the\nproliferation worldwide. The most effective way to\naddress global security threats is the multilateral\nsystem of binding international agreements. The\nexisting system of treaties, built over the decades,\nneeds to be strengthened, not weakened. We need to\nreinforce our commitment to the prohibition of\nchemical and biological weapons and to the prevention\nof the spread of nuclear weapons, with the objective of\ntheir total elimination.\nPromoting adherence to multilateral treaties and\nobligations is not enough. It is equally important to\nensure that commitments are fully implemented. The\ninternational community cannot tolerate precedents of\nnon-compliance with the legal undertakings, which\nwould put at stake the whole non-proliferation regime.\nIn cases where States have difficulties in\nimplementing treaty obligations due to lack of legal or\ntechnical verification expertise, appropriate support\nand assistance should be offered by the relevant\norganizations and participating States.\nThe Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty remains the\ncornerstone of our efforts to curb the spread of nuclear\nweapons. In our view, the Comprehensive Nuclear-\nTest-Ban Treaty constitutes an essential and\nirreplaceable building block for containing the\nproliferation of nuclear weapons, thus contributing to\nnuclear disarmament. Finland attaches great\nimportance to its entry into force. We urge all States\nthat have not yet done so to sign and ratify it as soon as\npossible.\nIn combating the spread of weapons of mass\ndestruction, new initiatives and new approaches are\ncalled for. In order to complement international\ninstruments, we need fresh perspectives on how to\nconfront the problem of weapons of mass destruction.\nFinland welcomes new efforts, open to all, such as the\nG-8 Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons\nand Materials of Mass Destruction.\nThe United Nations and in particular the Security\nCouncil have the primary responsibility for\nmaintaining international peace and security. Finland is\nin favour of enhancing the role of the United Nations in\nissues related to the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction. We agree with the Secretary-General that\nthe United Nations and the Security Council should\nlook at the enforcement of regimes against weapons of\nmass destruction. The United Nations has valuable\nexpertise and experience in verification. Finland\nbelieves that this verification and inspection\ncompetence should be maintained.\nBy focusing on weapons of mass destruction, I do\nnot want to suggest that small arms are any less\ndangerous. They need due and growing attention by the\ninternational community. In some countries and in\n21\n\nsome crises small arms are a means of massive\ndestruction and a major cause of loss of life, mostly of\ncivilians.\nThe multilateral institutions should respond to\nnew challenges. Being multilateral is not sufficient in\nitself. In the work of the General Assembly Finland\nunderlines the importance of setting clear priorities,\ntackling the issues that are most relevant in today\u2019s\nsecurity environment. People throughout the world\nmight find it difficult to understand the Organization\u2019s\ntrying to resolve the problems of yesterday\u2019s world.\nBefore concluding, let me express my\nGovernment\u2019s deep satisfaction with the fact that the\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) has become a\nreality and is operational. The ICC is the cornerstone of\nefforts to enhance respect for international\nhumanitarian law and human rights. We remain\ncommitted to ensuring the Court\u2019s success and appeal\nto States which have not yet ratified the Rome Statute\nto become parties to it.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me, Sir, to\nexpress my confidence that, under your able leadership,\nthe general debate of the General Assembly at its fifty-\neighth session will be successful and fruitful.\nAt the turn of the millennium, the international\ncommunity is living through changes of epic\nproportions. The process of transition to a new world\norder is facing unprecedented global threats: inter-\nethnic and inter-confessional conflicts; international\nterrorism and organized crime; natural, man-made and\nhumanitarian disasters; diseases and epidemics; and\nenergy and environmental problems.\nThese threats are in addition to globalization\nprocesses. All States now share in not only economic,\ntechnological, information and management issues, but\nalso must face the numerous problems looming over\nhumankind like a dark cloud.\nWe in Kazakhstan believe that the time has come\nfor the entire international community to join together\nto ensure broad and effective cooperation to address\nglobal threats. Today, it is becoming increasingly evident\nthat States' involvement in globalization processes is an\nimportant factor in their economic prosperity.\nIt is our conviction that there is no alternative to\nKazakhstan's political and economic openness. In the\npast four years, our country has had one of the fastest\neconomic growth rates in the world. Kazakhstan is\nleading the Commonwealth of Independent States\n(CIS) in main economic indicators. As a country with a\nmarket economy, Kazakhstan is an integral part of the\nglobal economy and an active participant in the\nglobalization process. Its early admission to the World\nTrade Organization (WTO) is a top priority for\nKazakhstan.\nOur country's efforts to create a comprehensive\nsecurity system in Asia are well known. The process of\nthe Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building\nMeasures in Asia, initiated by President Nursultan\nNazarbaev, serves this purpose and also provides for\nactive cooperation between regional States in such an\nimportant area as the combating of international\nterrorism. Further support for this process by the\nUnited Nations and all of our partners will undoubtedly\ngo a long way towards creating a climate of trust and\ngood-neighbourly relations on the Asian continent.\nWe are firmly committed to strengthening\nregional integration. Kazakhstan is actively involved in\nwork within the Eurasian Economic Community. We\nhave great expectations regarding the creation of a\nsingle economic space in the territories of four CIS\ncountries. A significant contribution to counter-\nterrorism efforts and trade and economic cooperation in\nthe Eurasian region could be made by the Shanghai\nCooperation Organization. We are taking steps to\ndevelop cooperation with the Central Asian States. We\nintend to further promote the activities of the Economic\nCooperation Organization.\nKazakhstan backs United Nations action to\nstrengthen the efforts of the international community in\nsupport of the dialogue between civilizations and\nreligions. Kazakhstan, a unique State in terms of\nreligious tolerance and inter-ethnic harmony, convened\na congress of representatives of world religions and\nconfessions, which, in the unanimous opinion of its\nparticipants, revealed a considerable peacemaking\ncapacity of our country.\nAn unprecedented attack against the United\nNations office in Baghdad in August was the cruellest\nand largest-scale terrorist act in the entire history of\nour Organization. Together with the rest of the\ninternational community, Kazakhstan pays a special\ntribute to the late Sergio Vieira de Mello, the United\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights and\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General for\nIraq, and his colleagues.\nIn our view, it is imperative to ensure that efforts\nto restore peace and stability in Iraq are carried out\nwithin the legal framework of the United Nations. The\npost-war reconstruction of the country and assistance\nto the Iraqi population should be provided only under\nthe umbrella of the United Nations. Kazakhstan has\nalready made a practical contribution to this process by\ndeploying in Iraq a group of its military officers.\nThe Iraqi crisis has become a serious test for the\nUnited Nations and has highlighted the urgent need to\ncarry out the institutional reform of the Organization.\n26\n \nKazakhstan reaffirms its commitment to the\nconcept of a multipolar world as a political philosophy\nof modern international relations. At the same time, we\ndo not reject unipolarity if its means joining together\nthe efforts of all States in the world in a bid to avert\nglobal threats.\nGiven its authority, universal character and\nunique experience, the United Nations continues to\nplay an indispensable coordinating role in all global\naffairs. Its effectiveness, however, is dependent on our\nwill, and we should, through joint efforts, reform the\nOrganization with a view to democratizing international\nrelations. In this context, it is essential to strengthen the\nrole of the Security Council in the settlement of crisis\nsituations and to provide it with appropriate mandates\nand means for conflict-prevention. We call for making\nit a more representative body by co-opting five new\nmembers, including Germany and Japan, as well as, on\nthe basis of rotation, African, Asian and Latin American\nStates. In order to facilitate consensus, which is greatly\nneeded, new Security Council members might exercise\nthe veto power, with certain exceptions, subject to\nfurther discussion in the high-level panel which the\nSecretary-General intends to establish. We believe that\nit will also be necessary to increase the number of non-\npermanent members, with due account being taken of\nthe interests of the Asian region.\nIn our view, coordination between the United\nNations and regional organizations should be\nreinvigorated. In this context, Kazakhstan proposes to\nestablish a permanent council of regional organizations\nunder the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-\nGeneral.\nIt is time to combine, in practical terms, the\nefforts of the United Nations, the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions, the WTO and other leading economic and\nfinancial organizations to address poverty and social\ndevelopment. Kazakhstan believes that close attention\nshould be paid to the proposal to establish an economic\nand social security council.\nKazakhstan supports the Secretary-General's\nproposal   to which I referred earlier   to establish a\nhigh-level panel to examine current challenges to peace\nand security and to strengthen the United Nations system.\nWe believe that issues of environmental\nprotection in the framework of sustainable\ndevelopment should be considered as a key item on the\nUnited Nations agenda. In this context, President\nNazarbaev's proposal, made last year in Johannesburg,\nto create a United Nations register of global\nenvironmental problems is especially relevant. Such a\nregister would provide an opportunity to ensure a\ncontinuous exchange of information among United\nNations Member States about trends in the global\nenvironmental situation, which is extremely important\nfor the prevention of natural disasters. With regard to\nenvironmental issues, I would like, from this rostrum,\nonce again to urge the international community to pay\ndue attention to the search for practical solutions to the\nproblems of the Aral Sea and the Semipalatinsk region.\nThe current surge of terrorist acts throughout the\nworld has made clear the transnational nature of\nterrorism. We must recognize that terrorism is well\norganized, financially self-sufficient and bolstered by\npowerful ideological dictums that are poisoning the\nconsciousness of an ever-greater number of people.\nAgainst that background, the strengthening of the\ninternational legal framework of counter-terrorist\ncooperation is especially relevant. Kazakhstan supports\nthe adoption, without further delay, of a comprehensive\nconvention against international terrorism.\nKazakhstan, which has drug routes running\nthrough its territory, calls for joint efforts by States to\neliminate the evil of drug trafficking, which seriously\nerodes international security. Increasing drug production\nin Afghanistan demands special attention. In order to\neffectively counter the existing drug threat, it is\nnecessary to apply an integrated approach on the basis\nof an agreed international strategy with the United\nNations Office on Drugs and Crime playing a\ncoordinating role.\nKazakhstan has put forward an initiative\nregarding the establishment in Almaty of a Central\nAsian preventive diplomacy and conflict management\ncentre and calls for its support. Such an institution\nwould strengthen the United Nations activities in the\nregion, which should be in the interests of all countries\nconcerned.\nAs a State that has voluntarily renounced its\nnuclear heritage, Kazakhstan is concerned about the\ncontinued proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\nThe desire of a number of countries and some extremist\norganizations to possess nuclear weapons and other\ntypes of weapons of mass destruction poses a serious\nthreat to global security. The well-known British writer\nAldous Huxley was prophetic when he said:\n27\n \nTechnological progress has merely provided us\nwith more efficient means of going backwards.'\nLet us face the facts: today, the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Nuclear-\nTest-Ban Treaty do not work in practice. The main\nreason for this state of affairs is weakened international\ncontrol.\nThere are already 39 States in the world capable\nof producing a nuclear bomb or a nuclear device and at\nleast 8 countries with significant nuclear capacity. In\naddition, there are at least another 4 countries whose\nnon-nuclear status is highly questionable.\nThe United Nations and its institutions should\nhave the last word in solving the problem of nuclear\nnon-proliferation. There is actually one way out:\ntighten control and improve transparency with regard\nto weapons development and testing.\nExisting international agreements in this area\nshould be adapted to new realities. We can no longer\naccept the fact that the international community lacks\neffective means to discipline States violating non-\nproliferation regimes. Here we witness the absence of a\nsingle standard: some countries are punished by\nmilitary force, while others are simply urged to give up\ntheir nuclear programmes.\nKazakhstan has welcomed the initiative of the\nGroup of Eight regarding a global partnership against\nthe proliferation of nuclear materials and weapons of\nmass destruction, and it hopes for fruitful cooperation\non the issue with that group of States.\nOur country considers it important to implement\nthe Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and\nEradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light\nWeapons in All Its Aspects.\nThe International Ministerial Conference on\nTransit Transport Cooperation, held in August in\nAlmaty, has become a turning point in the efforts to\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. The\nAlmaty Declaration and the Programme of Action\nadopted as an outcome of the Conference have laid a\nsolid foundation for global partnership designed to put\nin place effective transit transport systems. Occupying\na vast stretch of land in Eurasia, Kazakhstan is keenly\ninterested in the practical implementation of the goals\nin these documents so that it can better tap its own\ntransport potential.\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate\nKazakhstan's commitment to the United Nations\nreform process in order to ensure a safer and more just\nworld order. I fully share the Secretary-General's sense\nof urgency when it comes to structural changes within\nthe United Nations. Indeed, history would be\nunforgiving to us if we were to squander an\nopportunity to reform our Organization.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe people of Tuvalu,\non whose behalf I have the honour to speak, wish me\nfirst of all to convey their warmest greetings to the\nfifty-eighth session of the General Assembly. We\nexpress congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your\nelection. Coming from a small island country as well,\nwe hold your election in high regard and wish you\nsuccess in your presidency. We also commend the\noutgoing President, Mr. Jan Kavan, for his excellent\nleadership in the General Assembly this past year.\nA year ago, we reflected on the events of 11\nSeptember 2001. On the eve of this session, we were\nhorrified yet again by the brutal terrorist attacks on the\nUnited Nations in Iraq, which killed some of the\nOrganization's finest, including its Special Envoy, Mr.\nSergio Vieira de Mello. Tuvalu strongly condemns\nthose acts and has joined in the great number of\ncondolences to the Secretary-General, to his staff and\nto the families of the victims.\nThe recent wave of terror attacks and the havoc\nthey have created worldwide have instilled a sense of\nfear and uncertainty. They have not only proved the\nexistence of forces bent on destroying the very\nfoundation of the United Nations, they have also\nunderscored the urgency with which we must\ncollectively combat those forces. As a small island\ndeveloping country, Tuvalu's greatest fear is that, in the\nwake of such events, developed countries will lack the\nresolve to address as well the developmental and\nenvironmental issues that are so fundamental to lasting\ninternational peace and security.\nIn Tuvalu, and the Pacific in general, our\nisolation, fragmentation and lack of infrastructure and\nmanpower leave us vulnerable to terrorism. This\nthreatens our security, especially the security of our\ntraditional and cultural practices upon which our very\nexistence depends. Likewise, this also threatens the\nsecurity of the world. We are therefore grateful for the\nanti-terrorism efforts of the United Nations in\ncooperation with the Pacific Islands Forum and through\ndirect contact with national authorities.\nFor our part, I am pleased to say that Tuvalu is\ncommitted to acceding to the United Nations\nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime and\nits three protocols, as well as United Nations\nconventions against terrorism, including the\nConvention on the Safety of United Nations and\nAssociated Personnel. In this spirit, we are also\ncommitted to regional security arrangements, as set out\nby the Pacific Islands Forum.\nBut to fulfil our international obligations on anti-\nterrorism, we need technical and financial assistance.\nMore importantly, capacity-building through\nappropriate education and human development, for\nwhich we seek the support of the international\ncommunity, is vitally important to strengthen our\nresilience in the face of such vulnerabilities.\nConflict prevention is vital to national, regional\nand world peace. Tuvalu shares the view that conflicts\nare best resolved through dialogue and mutual\nunderstanding of the root causes. The United Nations\nmust continue to address the underlying causes of\nconflicts and be the common forum where nations\nresolve their differences. Attempts to resolve conflicts\nby unilateral means outside the United Nations\ninevitably result in ongoing mistrust and instability.\nThe stakes are too high to allow this to happen. We\nmust continue to engage in constructive dialogue.\nLet me briefly speak on a related matter. Each\nyear, highly radioactive and toxic material passes\nthrough the Pacific by ship on its way to and from\nnorth Asia and Europe. It is known that some of the\nmaterials are weapons-grade. We are concerned about\n22\n\nthese shipments because of the massive threat they\npose to the Pacific Ocean   a vital source of our\nlivelihoods and economic development. We would like\nthese shipments to cease for the sake of the inhabitants\nof the islands and stability of the broader Pacific basin.\nWe believe the United Nations has a very\nimportant peacekeeping role to play, and are therefore\ngrateful for the progress made by the United Nations in\nrestoring peace in Bougainville, Papua New Guinea.\nWe hope that the United Nations will continue its\nsupport there, to ensure meaningful opportunities and\npeace for the people of Bougainville.\nTuvalu noted, however, the manner in which the\nUnited Nations has handled the conflict in the Solomon\nIslands. As a small island and a least developed\ncountry, similarly susceptible to instability, we strongly\nfeel that the United Nations must better respond to\nMember States' concerns, irrespective of political\naffiliations. The United Nations is a body for all\nnations, and all nations should be afforded the\nassistance required of it.\nIn the same spirit, Tuvalu places significant\nimportance on the need to treat everybody equally, as\nenshrined in the Charter. Accordingly, Tuvalu believes\nthat to deny representation at the United Nations to the\n23 million people of the Republic of China on Taiwan,\nwho are active and responsible participants in world\naffairs, especially in trade, commerce and international\ndevelopment, is unjust and morally wrong. Their\nsignificant contributions to technology and their own\nneed for access to international support to combat the\nchallenges of terrorism and health epidemics such as\nHIV/AIDS and severe acute respiratory syndrome\n(SARS) cannot be continually ignored.\nIn our view the United Nations, which prides\nitself on the protection of fundamental human rights,\nincluding the right to self-determination, and which\nupholds the dignity and worth of the human being,\ncannot continue to turn a blind eye to ignore the\nobvious realities of the situation. Just as the people of\nTaiwan have so responsibly contributed to international\ndevelopment, they also need the support of the\ninternational community. Their continuing isolation\ncould potentially give rise to serious conflicts.\nTuvalu would therefore like to call on this august\nbody to seriously and urgently consider the issue of\nmembership of the Republic of China on Taiwan in the\nUnited Nations and its agencies.\nOn 1 October, Tuvalu will mark the twenty-fifth\nanniversary of its independence. On reflection, we are\ngrateful for the support of the international community,\nparticularly from Tuvalu's traditional development and\nregional partners over the past quarter century. Guided\nby the principles of good governance, respect for the\nrule of law and human rights, democracy and self-\ndetermination, to which we are deeply committed, and\nwith the help of such support, Tuvalu has been able to\nprosper and enjoy a peaceful and equal coexistence\nwith the rest of the world. Our future survival as a\nnation is founded on these basic United Nations values.\nDespite relative stability, we live in constant fear\nof the adverse impact of climate change. For a coral-\natoll nation, sea level rise and more severe weather\nevents loom as a growing threat to our entire\npopulation. The threat is real and serious, and we liken\nit to a slow and insidious form of terrorism against us.\nIn this respect, Tuvalu is actively participating in\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange and the Kyoto Protocol, and we are extremely\ngrateful to all the nations that have joined us in\nresolving this threat. Nevertheless, we are deeply\ndismayed that key industrialized nations do not share\nour concern. Climate change affects all nations.\nThis is not just a problem for small island States\nlike our own. We believe that all nations must take\npositive steps to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.\nBut we also believe that the industrialized world must\nact first. It is the emissions from the past that are\ncreating the problems of today. Steps must be taken to\naccount for and redress the emissions of the past. We\nimplore all nations to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, as this\nis the only appropriate process that will bring about\neffective collective action to resolve this growing\nthreat.\nAs Tuvalu moves into the twenty-first century, we\nare also challenged by the many changes that are taking\nplace in the world, especially those brought about by\nglobalization. Never before have we faced such\ncomplex challenges. Yet, for Tuvalu and others like us,\nwhile we witness every day the forces of trade,\ncommunications and travel creating a single global\ncommunity, the problems of poverty, marginalization\nand environmental decline continue to plague many\nparts of the world.\nThe recent breakdown in discussions on\ninternational trade in Cancun, Mexico, clearly shows\n23\n\nthat we live in a very complex world. If nothing else,\nthe Cancun meeting was a significant step forward for\nthe voice of the developing world. No longer are the\ndeveloping nations willing to accept the rhetoric of\nthose who want to impose a trade regime that tends to\nfavour the wealthy and marginalize the poor.\nTuvalu and many island States are in a\nparticularly weak position to take advantage of the\nopportunities presented by globalization. There is a\ngenuine need to better recognize the special case of\nsmall island developing States and of their need to\nparticipate in a more equitable globalized world.\nSustainable development, particularly for the\nmost disadvantaged and vulnerable States, especially\nfor small island least developed countries is crucial. Of\ncourse, we recognize that the primary responsibility for\nsustainable development rests with each country, on its\nown terms. However, as a poorly resourced small\nisland least developed countries, even the best efforts\nto escape the cycle of poverty and marginalization are\ndoomed without the support of the international\ncommunity, civil society and the private sector.\nTuvalu and those like us are encouraged by the\ncommitment of the international community to\naddressing poverty and development challenges, as\ncontained in the Millennium Development Goals,\nMillennium Declaration and other various United\nNations development frameworks. But these will\nremain mere rhetoric unless they translate into real\ndevelopment that can make a difference on the ground.\nIn that regard, proper and effective\nimplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action\nfor the Sustainable Development of Small Island\nDeveloping States is crucial for the development of\ncountries like Tuvalu. To that end, conducting a full\nand comprehensive review of the implementation of\nthe Barbados Programme of Action in the lead up to\nthe International Meeting in Mauritius next year is\nimperative. We kindly request the United Nations\nSecretariat to undertake this analysis as a matter of\nhigh priority so that we can learn from the past and\nmove forward in a more positive way.\nThat said, however, the overall decline in official\ndevelopment assistance in real terms is cause for\nserious concern. Despite pledges at the Monterrey\nConference, major industrialized nations are not\nfulfilling the minimum target of 0.7 per cent of their\ngross national product. For small island States, that\nreluctance translates into lower economic growth, as\nwell as into widening the gap between the least\ndeveloped countries and the industrialized nations.\nTuvalu therefore appeals to the donor countries to\nmake serious efforts to meet the United Nations\nminimum official development assistance target to\nenable the least developed countries to attain a better\nquality of life for all their peoples.\nIn conclusion, for atoll island States like Tuvalu,\nefforts aimed at sustainable development, peace and\nsecurity will be meaningless unless the issue of climate\nchange is addressed with urgency. As has been warned\nby the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change in\nits Third Assessment Report, the threat of global\nwarming and rising sea levels is serious business.\nAddressing these threats requires a global effort by\nboth industrialized and developing countries, consistent\nwith the objectives of, and the commitments made in,\nthe Framework Convention on Climate Change.\nAgain, Tuvalu's interest in enforcing the Kyoto\nProtocol is not self-serving. The consequences of not\nurgently enforcing Kyoto will be felt everywhere\naround the world. Tuvalu appeals to the countries that\ncan make the difference to ratify the Kyoto Protocol as\na matter of urgency. As we in Tuvalu celebrate our\nSilver Jubilee anniversary, and as we look forward into\nthe future, it is our hope that out of this great Hall there\nwill emerge better understanding and good will, to\nfurther solidify the foundation upon which the long-\nlasting security and survival of Tuvalu and many others\nis built and for peace in the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffPlease allow me to convey\nmy delegation\u2019s warmest congratulations to\nMr. Julian Hunte on his election to the high office of\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\nsession. I am sure that his vast experience on the\ninternational scene will be brought to bear on the work\nof this session, and help direct it with ease to a\nsuccessful conclusion. The fifty-eighth session\npromises to be rich in substance, and may also prove to\nbe a watershed in our bid to make the United Nations\nresponsive to the needs of the peoples of the world in\nthe new millennium. I wish to assure the President of\nmy delegation\u2019s fullest cooperation in the discharge of\nhis onerous responsibilities.\nIn the same vein, let me also congratulate the out-\ngoing President, Mr. Jan Kavan, for his laudable efforts\nduring the fifty-seventh session. The dynamic\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, also deserves\ncommendation for another productive year of service to\nthe Organization, a year that was fraught with\ndifficulties and incredible challenges. Thanks to his\nleadership, we have, by and large, been able to weather\nthe storm.\nWe were all devastated, however, by the bombing\nof the offices of the United Nations in Baghdad, which\nclaimed the lives of so many people. May it never\nrecur \u2014 please God \u2014 but it shows that we must\nremain united in our resolve to fight terrorism. Let me\nseize this opportunity to express once again to\nMr. Kofi Annan and his staff, as well as to the relatives\nof the victims, the heartfelt condolences of the\npeople of The Gambia. We pay homage to\nMr. Sergio Vieira de Mello and his colleagues, who lost\ntheir lives, and we mourn the tragic loss of a highly-\nacclaimed international civil servant at the hands of\nterrorists. In wishing the injured a speedy recovery, we\npray that the souls of all those who died rest in perfect\npeace. My delegation strongly urges that that cowardly\nact should in no way weaken the resolve of the United\nNations in fulfilling its obligations to the people of\nIraq.\nResolution 1373 (2001) was adopted unanimously\nby the Security Council following the attacks of\n11 September, and the majority of Member States,\nincluding my own, have embarked on implementing its\nsalient provisions. We have ratified the major\ninternational instruments on terrorism and,\nfurthermore, have enacted domestic legislation to\nimplement them. Let me state that, in spite of our\nmodest achievements in that regard, international\ncooperation and technical assistance remain critical to\nthe success of our future implementation efforts.\nThe Counter-Terrorism Committee\u2019s assistance\nunit must strengthen the coordination of its technical\nassistance portfolio in order to have greater impact. In\nthat regard, we welcome the commitment of the G-8 to\nprovide capacity-building and technical assistance to\npriority countries. The translation of declarations of\ncommitment into concrete action is the only guarantee\nof making meaningful headway to counter terrorism.\nApart from the recent terrorist attacks against the\nUnited Nations in Baghdad, other such incidents in\nIndonesia, Kenya, the Russian Federation, Morocco\nand Saudi Arabia, coming in the wake of the attacks of\n11 September, are reminders of the enormity of the\ntasks ahead.\nThe fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly\nhas been convened at a time when our approaches to\nthe management of global issues have come under\nsharp scrutiny. Those issues are the unfinished business\nof the preceding millennium. The United Nations \u2014\nthe premier, overarching venue for multilateralism \u2014\ncannot but be the only vehicle through which the\nworld\u2019s peace and security problems can be solved.\nThe recent events in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere\nonly serve to underscore the need for the nations of the\nworld to strengthen, not weaken, multilateralism. We\nshall never achieve global peace, security and\nprosperity without working together in a forum such as\nthe one provided by the United Nations, a forum that is\nall-inclusive and which permits each and every\nnation \u2014 big or small, rich or poor \u2014 to expound on\nmatters of concern to them. The ideals and principles\nthat were the basis of the founding of the Organization\nare as relevant today as they were 58 years ago. Let us\ntherefore demonstrate our commitment to\nmultilateralism by always turning to the United\n33\n\nNations. My delegation therefore urges all Member\nStates to maintain confidence in the United Nations\nand to have recourse to the Organization for the\npeaceful resolution of conflicts and the settlement of\ndisputes.\nWhile terrorism poses a real threat to\ninternational peace and security, other violent conflicts\ncontinue to rage around the world, leaving death,\ndestruction and desolation in their wake. The situation\nin the Mano River Union region remains volatile as I\nspeak. Even though former President Charles Taylor of\nLiberia has left the scene, as was required of him, and\nthere appears to be some laudable progress towards\nreinvigorating the democratic process in that country,\nwe should be under no illusion as to the extreme\nfragility of the situation in Liberia, and indeed within\nthe West African subregion. We commend all the\nparties that recently signed the Peace Agreement in\nAccra, Ghana, for their determination and patience, and\nurge them to do all in their power to stay the course.\nThat would also have a salutary effect on the situation\nin neighbouring Sierra Leone, where we note with\nsatisfaction the consolidation of the peace process.\nHowever, the problem of conflicts in West Africa\ncontinues to be compounded by the illicit flow of small\narms and light weapons, as well as by roving bands of\nmercenaries. International efforts could serve the\nregion best by developing comprehensive disarmament,\ndemobilization and rehabilitation programmes that\ntarget militias and that are region-specific rather than\ncountry-specific. We must endeavour to address the\nissue of the illicit trade in small arms and light\nweapons with greater determination. An arrangement\nsimilar to the Kimberley Process in blood diamonds is\nwhat is urgently required to effectively stem the illicit\nflow of small arms and light weapons. My Government\nstrongly supports any measure that would treat as\naccomplices to war crimes and crimes against\nhumanity illegal brokers who knowingly supply arms\nand weapons to militias and other insurgents in West\nAfrica. Conflict zones elsewhere in Africa that tell a\nsimilar story should also be assisted in that manner.\nWe warmly congratulate our brothers in Sudan on\nthe recent signing of the Naivasha peace accord, which\npromises to bring the long-drawn fratricidal conflict in\nthat country to an end.\nMeanwhile, my Government continues to play its\npart in the search for solutions to the problems of peace\nand security in Africa. We participate actively within\nthe context of the initiatives of the Economic\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) to\ncontribute to the subregion\u2019s collective efforts in that\narea. My Government, under the wise leadership of\nPresident Jammeh, has in the past contributed, and will\ncontribute in the future, to subregional efforts to keep\nthe peace in West Africa. We have continuously\nparticipated in the United Nations Mission in Sierra\nLeone (UNAMSIL) since its inception. We stand ready\nto contribute our own modest share to any other United\nNations peacekeeping operations designed for the\nWest Africa subregion, as we are doing now under the\nECOWAS Military Mission in Liberia (ECOMIL). In\nthat regard, we welcome the adoption of Security\nCouncil resolution 1509 (2003), establishing the United\nNations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL).\nI just made mention of the unfinished business of\nthe preceding millennium. Those are thematic issues of\npolitical exclusion, disenfranchisement, economic\nexclusion and abject poverty. All affect the greater\nmajority of humankind. They also give rise to all the\nurgent situations that the world is faced with today \u2014\nsituations of conflict and civil strife; in short, of the\nabsence of peace.\nA peculiar situation of exclusion was created by\nGeneral Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI) on\n25 October 1971, which relates, through its direct\neffects, to Taiwan. From 1949 to 1971, the Republic of\nChina (Taiwan) was a bona fide member of the United\nNations, recognized by the comity of nations. If the\nRepublic of China (Taiwan) could be a member of the\nUnited Nations then, why could it not be a member\nnow? The General Assembly adopted resolution 2758\n(XXVI), which addressed only the question of the\nrepresentation of the People\u2019s Republic of China at the\nUnited Nations and related organizations. It did not\ndecide that Taiwan was, or should be, a part of the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China. Nor did it confer on the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China the right to represent the\nRepublic of China (Taiwan) or the 23 million\nTaiwanese people in the United Nations and related\norganizations. Resolution 2758 (XXVI) has since been\nmisused to justify the exclusion of Taiwan from the\nUnited Nations. That runs counter to the claim by the\nGovernment of the People\u2019s Republic of China that it\nrepresents the interests of all Chinese, not to mention\nthose Taiwanese who are in the Republic of China\n(Taiwan). If we are to comprehensively deal with the\n34\n\nproblems engendered by exclusion in whatever form it\ntakes, I call on the international community to revisit\nthat issue urgently.\nMy Government appreciates the special attention\nthat Guinea-Bissau has received from the Security\nCouncil, especially through the Council\u2019s Ad Hoc\nWorking Group on Conflict Prevention and Resolution\nin Africa. We also commend the remarkable efforts of\nthe Economic and Social Council\u2019s Ad Hoc Advisory\nGroup on Guinea-Bissau. As Chairperson of the Group\nof Friends of Guinea-Bissau, my Government\nacknowledges the groundswell of support and good\nwill that Guinea-Bissau enjoys from the Organization.\nUnfortunately, that has not yet been adequately\ntranslated into material and financial forms of\nassistance, which the people of that country so\ndesperately need. The recent developments in Guinea-\nBissau should be seen not so much as a constraint, but\nrather as an opportunity to re-engage the international\ncommunity, in partnership with the people of Guinea-\nBissau, in the resolution of their problems of\ngovernance and development. Now that concerted\nefforts are being made by all the major actors to agree\non transitional arrangements for the preparation of\nparliamentary and presidential elections in the not-too-\ndistant future, we call on the rest of the international\ncommunity to provide the support necessary to\nstabilize the situation and keep the process on course to\na successful outcome.\nProblems of security and peace in my part of the\nworld have not in any way diminished our concerns\nover similar problems elsewhere. The people of Iraq\nand Afghanistan need urgent international assistance to\nshore up security, re-establish the rule of law and\nembark on an effective programme of reconstruction.\nMy Government welcomes the adoption of resolution\n1500 (2003), in the hope that the establishment of the\nGoverning Council of Iraq will lead towards a real\npolitical transition for the Iraqi people. While a speedy\nend to the occupation of Iraq is both desirable and\nurgent, as clearly underscored in resolution 1472\n(2003), outstanding issues emanating from Iraq\u2019s\noccupation of Kuwait should be comprehensively dealt\nwith once and for all.\nWe continue to follow closely the situation in the\nMiddle East, and we deplore yet again the recent spate\nof vicious attacks and counter-attacks between Israelis\nand Palestinians, thus negating hope for an early\nsettlement within the framework of the road map. Trust\nand confidence-building measures must be reinforced\nand made to attend to every stage of the\nimplementation of the road map, if the peace process is\nto endure. Suicide bombings that target innocent\ncivilians must be stopped. The occupation of Arab\nlands must come to an end. In reiterating our position\non the Arab-Israeli conflict, we call for the creation of\nan independent Palestinian State living in peace\nalongside the State of Israel.\nMy Government firmly supports the initiatives\nbeing taken to reduce tensions between India and\nPakistan, two great friends of The Gambia. We urge\nthem both to reduce the arms build-up on their\nrespective sides of the border and to strive harder to\nreach a mutually acceptable solution to their\ndifferences, in particular with regard to the issue of\nKashmir. Similarly, we reiterate our support for a\npeaceful reunification on the Korean peninsula.\nHuman security is not threatened by conflicts\nalone. The scourge of HIV/AIDS continues to be\nelusive, and now poses a serious threat to the viability\nof some societies in Africa. The HIV/AIDS pandemic\nhas slowly evolved from a health and humanitarian\nissue to a development and security problem. The\npandemic has compounded the problems African\ncountries face in the fight against other scourges, such\nas malaria and tuberculosis. It is gratifying to note\nhowever, that the international community is sensitized\nto that fact and that initiatives such as the Global Fund\nto Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria have been put\nin place. Consequently, more money, resources and\nattention must be given to research and development.\nContributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,\nTuberculosis and Malaria have slackened, and\ndeveloping countries are paying a colossal price in\nhuman and material terms. The initiative of the Global\nAlliance for Vaccines and Immunization equally\nrequires adequate funding.\nThe pursuit of justice and the international rule of\nlaw have never been as pressing as it is today. My\nGovernment strongly supports the International\nCriminal Court as it embarks on its crucial mandate of\ndelivering justice. We hail its progress so far, and I\nwould like to seize this opportunity to call on all to\ncooperate with the Court in order that, together all\naround the world, we can say no to the culture of\nimpunity.\n35\n\nWhile still on the subject of justice, let me\nreiterate my Government\u2019s view that the sanctions\nbeing imposed on Cuba should now be lifted. They are\ncounter-productive anyway. Cuba is a peace-loving\nmember of the international community whose people\ndo not deserve the punishment that has been meted out\nto them for almost four decades now.\nLet me now turn to development issues. In\nAfrica, our efforts to achieve sustainable development\ncontinue to be seriously undermined by a variety of\nfactors, prominent among which are conflicts,\nstructural weaknesses, natural disasters and disease.\nFor the international system to successfully address\nthose factors of underdevelopment, more serious\nattention must be paid to the implementation of the\nBrussels Programme of Action for the Least Developed\nCountries for the Decade 2001-2010, and more\nattention must be focused on the attainment of the\nMillennium Development Goals. We must also give\neffect to the commitments made at Doha, Monterrey\nand Johannesburg.\nThere is no shortage of blueprints for\ndevelopment. What is in short supply, and what needs\nto be urgently mobilized, are resources. So far, there is\nstill a big gap between commitment and action.\nAfrica\u2019s development partners must make good on their\npledges to support Africa\u2019s development. My\ndelegation welcomes the Africa Action Plan of the G-8,\nthe African Growth and Opportunity Act of the United\nStates of America and the \u201cEverything But Arms\u201d\ninitiative of the European Union, all of which commit\ntheir sponsors to well-defined forms of support for\nAfrica\u2019s development.\nThere are, however, many barriers to the\nimplementation of those initiatives, which are caused\nby certain protectionist policies pursued by our\npartners, as well as other policy and structural\nconstraints. The problem of farm subsidies just will not\ngo away. Agricultural economies in our part of the\nworld must be allowed to compete if the global trading\nsystem is to function in favour of the eradication of\npoverty. The debt issue is far from being resolved and\nthe procedures for accessing the benefits of the Highly\nIndebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative (HIPC) are too\ncumbersome for many poor countries to follow. The\nonly realistic approach to the debt problem as a major\nimpediment to development is to cancel it\nunconditionally for HIPC countries and for low-income\ncountries under stress.\nWe have just ended at Canc\u00fan another attempt at\nnegotiations on world trade. My delegation deeply\nregrets the failure of the talks, as well as the fact that\nthe developed world could not see eye to eye with the\nGroup of 21 on the issue of subsidies. It is in our\ncollective interest to dismantle global trade barriers and\nallow markets to expand, for incomes to rise in the\ndeveloping world and poverty to be reduced. Stronger\nearning power in the developing world would stimulate\nworld trade in ways that would be most beneficial to\nrich countries. My delegation calls on all concerned to\nensure that we return to the negotiating table as soon as\npossible, and with greater determination on both sides,\nto reach a just and fair agreement on all the issues\ninvolved.\nOfficial development assistance (ODA) still falls\nshort of the internationally agreed target of 0.7 per cent\nof gross domestic product. We commend the countries\nwhose ODA has risen to that level, in particular\nDenmark, Norway, the Netherlands and Sweden.\nMy delegation urges all of Africa\u2019s development\npartners to address those issues with sincerity and\ncommitment, with a view to meaningfully assisting in\nkick-starting the sustainable human development\nprocess in African countries.\nIt is gratifying to note that the Human\nDevelopment Report 2003 is devoted to the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals. In that way, the fight against\npoverty is kept high on the international community\u2019s\nagenda, because we still have a very long way to go.\nFor instance, as stated in the report,\n\u201cRegionally, at the current pace Sub-Saharan\nAfrica would not reach the Goals for poverty\nuntil 2147 and for child mortality until 2165. And\nfor HIV/AIDS and hunger, trends in the region\nare heading up \u2014 not down.\u201d (Human\nDevelopment Report 2003, p. 2)\nIt is indeed true that sub-Saharan Africa is being\nleft behind. That state of affairs is alarming and, as the\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has\nrightly stated, the Millennium Development Goals will\nnot be realized with a business-as-usual approach. The\nparadox, in our view, is the fact that, while the means\nto attain the Goals are available, it would appear that\nthe political will to do so is lacking. Let me again\nquote from the Human Development Report 2003.\n36\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s world has greater resources and\nknow-how than ever before to tackle the\nchallenges of infectious disease, low productivity,\nlack of clean energy and transport and lack of\nbasic services such as clean water, sanitation,\nschools and health care. The issue is how best to\napply these resources and know-how to benefit\nthe poorest people.\u201d (ibid, p. 3)\nIn The Gambia, my Government\u2019s focus is on the\nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals. The\nstrategy we have designed to that end is detailed in our\npoverty reduction strategy paper. In a resource-\nstrapped economy such as The Gambia\u2019s, getting all\nthe relevant indicators to perform well towards poverty\nreduction is a daunting challenge. It is, however, a\nchallenge my Government is prepared to take up. Our\nspecial focus is on the empowerment of our people, and\nwe seek to do so by giving priority to our education,\nhealth and agricultural sectors, as well as by building\ncapacity among our women, who are the architects of\nstable and strong nations. That strategy has so far\nyielded dividends, as evidenced by my country\u2019s\nshowing on UNDP\u2019s Human Development Report\n2003.\nIn the education sector our goal is to achieve full\nenrolment well before the Millennium Declaration\u2019s\ntarget year of 2015. As of now, we have taken the gross\nenrolment rate from 44 per cent, eight years ago, to\nover 90 per cent today. We have, at the same time,\nincreased non-formal, adult and distance education\nprogrammes throughout the country. The net result has\nbeen a dramatic drop in illiteracy nationwide.\nTransition rates from primary to secondary levels have\nbeen significantly improved, from 12 per cent, 15 years\nago, to over 77 per cent today. Six years ago there were\nhardly any tertiary level institutions to speak of. Today\nthey abound, and include the new University of The\nGambia. That has been made possible by the visionary\nleadership provided by Al Hadji Yahya A.J.J. Jammeh,\nPresident of the Republic of Gambia.\nRecognizing the important role women play in\nthe family, in the community and in the nation, my\nGovernment has sought to pay special attention to the\nempowerment of our women through education,\ntraining and special income-generating projects. In\norder to increase opportunities for the girl child in the\neducational system, we have created a trust fund,\nentitled \u201cThe President\u2019s Empowerment of Girls\nEducation Project\u201d, to provide full scholarships to girls\nwho would otherwise not be able to go to school for\nlack of resources. That and other measures geared\ntowards assisting women have helped to close the\ngender gap in education in Gambia.\nEmpowering the rural dweller is another priority\nof my Government. We seek to do so through measures\nthat lead to an increase in access to resources,\ninfrastructure and services, as well as to knowledge\nand skills. Most villages now have a primary school,\nand clusters of villages share secondary education\nfacilities.\nOur efforts have also been geared towards the\nimprovement of the health of our people. Significantly\nimproved child health care, especially through an\nextensive and comprehensive immunization\nprogramme, has contributed immensely towards a\nconsiderable reduction in infant mortality in the last\nfew years. Infant mortality rates have been reduced by\none third. Primary health care programmes have been\nstrengthened across the board. Overall, access to health\nfacilities and services have equally been greatly\nimproved, with the construction of hospitals, health\ncentres, clinics and dispensaries throughout the\ncountry.\nFor all these achievements, however, we are\nhumbled by the challenges that still remain. The\nprevalence of diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria\nand a host of respiratory illnesses, is part of an\nunfinished agenda. Malaria, in particular, remains a\nmajor problem. It is the leading cause of mortality and\na major cause of morbidity among pregnant women,\ncontributing to anaemia and low birth weight. Today,\nwith the cooperation of a Cuban medical and health\nteam, The Gambia is number one in Africa as far as its\nmalaria control programme is concerned, according to\nthe World Health Organization.\nIn the area of agriculture, our objective is to\nachieve a total transformation of the sector. Our\npriority is to reduce the drudgery of production and\nincrease productivity through a systematic programme\nof mechanization. Added to this is our bid to reduce\nour dependence on rain-fed methods of production, in\nfavour of greater irrigation, using the abundant water\nresources that the Gambia River and its tributaries\nprovide. A third plank of our programme of\nempowerment in the agriculture sector is to diversify\nactivities away from the traditional crops by placing\ngreater emphasis on food production as well as on\n37\n\nother non-traditional crops for export. Finally, with all\nof these objectives already well on the road to success,\nwe are beginning to increase market access, both\nlocally and abroad, for our producers.\nAttaining the Millennium Development Goals\nwill depend to a large extent on how well poor\ncountries perform in the areas I have just referred to. It\nwould also depend on how far they themselves are\nempowered, and made capable of performing, through\nthe requisite support measures from the international\ncommunity. The United Nations system as a whole can\nbe mobilized further to broker such support for poor\ncountries, and especially for those among them that\nshow promise and positive signs of progress.\nMy Government has been increasing its efforts to\ndeepen democracy and strengthening good governance\nin The Gambia. To that end, our intent is to\ncontinuously bring improvements to the performance\nof all arms of government. Our multiparty democratic\nsystem forms the backbone of our political\ndispensation. We continue to conduct free and fair\nelections at all levels of popular representation. Our\ncourts operate independently. We have encouraged the\nmass media to grow and expand, with increasingly\nhigher levels of private participation. The international\ncommunity must have been satisfied with our efforts\nand achievements in this domain, since the World\nEconomic Forum, meeting in South Africa, decided to\nclassify The Gambia third in Africa, for its\nperformance on good governance. We are indeed\nhonoured by this recognition, and feel encouraged in\nour resolve to do even better.\nAdvances in information and communication\ntechnology have come to make our world a truly global\nvillage. This is indeed remarkable. However, we must\nnot lose sight of the fact that even in this area there is a\ngreat deal of catching up to be done by the developing\nworld. Global initiatives geared towards bridging the\ndigital divide between the developed and developing\nworlds should be pursued with unrelenting vigour.\nScientific and technological research must be\nconducted in support of the essence of life. In the\ncourse of this year, we have heard several claims as to\nthe successful cloning of human embryos. These\nclaims, whether genuine or not, are indeed a wake-up\ncall for all of humanity. The international community\nmust close ranks to address them in a manner that\nensures that no one is allowed, for whatever reason, to\ntinker with science and technology in ways that may\nupset or threaten nature\u2019s fragile balance.\nThe phenomenon of illegal, unregulated and\nunreported fishing remains a challenge to coastal\nAfrican States such as The Gambia. It has generated\nenormous concern at the international level, as is\nevident from the adoption of various international\ninstruments to combat it. My delegation would like to\nexpress its gratitude to the Governments of Japan and\nLuxembourg and the Food and Agriculture\nOrganization for the assistance that they provide to our\nfisheries sector, and to fully endorse the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s recommendation that technical and financial\nassistance to developing countries for the conservation\nand management of fisheries resources should be\nprovided in a comprehensive manner. We call for\ngreater assistance and cooperation in our efforts to\npromote sustainable practices in the fisheries sector of\nour economies.\nOn the crucial topic of United Nations reform, my\ndelegation welcomes the efforts aimed at the\nrevitalization of the General Assembly and the reform\nof the Security Council. After more than a decade, little\nprogress has been made in our attempts to reform the\nSecurity Council so that it is truly reflective of the\nrealities of the international system in the twenty-first\ncentury. My Government reiterates its stance \u2014 indeed\nthe stance of the entire African region \u2014 that the\ncomposition of the Security Council has to be\nrevamped and democratized. Membership of the\nCouncil must be expanded, with Africa occupying at\nleast two permanent seats and five non-permanent\nseats. We therefore wholeheartedly support the timely\nproposal of the Secretary-General to establish a high-\nlevel panel of eminent personalities to make concrete\nrecommendations, inter alia, on the reforms of the\nOrganization.\nAs we move into the business of the fifty-eighth\nsession of the General Assembly, my delegation prays\nthat the Almighty Allah crowns our endeavours with\nsuccess. We pray that this session proves to be the\nturning point in our efforts to render the United\nNations more relevant, more effective and truly all-\ninclusive. We pray that at this session, any doubts as to\nthe utility of the United Nations to each and every one\nof us be put to rest once and for all. We pray that by the\nclose of this session, we shall all have emerged secure\nin our conviction that only through fuller recourse to\nthe United Nations can we expect to have our global\n38\n\nproblems of conflict, peace and security and, indeed,\ndevelopment, frontally addressed, fully contained and\ncompletely resolved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffBefore addressing the pressing issues before the\ninternational community and expressing our position\non the issues that have been discussed here, I would\nlike to begin by referring to the concrete example of\nmy own country.\nOn 6 January 2003, the people and Government\nof El Salvador received an official communication\nfrom the Secretary-General informing us of the\ncompletion of the verification function of the United\nNations vis-\u00e0-vis the Peace Agreement that ended 13\nyears of war in our country. Eleven years have elapsed\nsince that historic Peace Agreement put an end to an\narmed conflict that had been destroying our country for\nover a decade.\nBefore the war we were a poor country. Sixty-per\ncent of our fellow citizens lived under the poverty line.\nOur country has also been dealt a harsh blow by nature.\nEvery generation of Salvadorans has had to rebuild\ntheir lives due to the fact that, throughout our history,\nthere has never been a twenty-five-year period without\nthe occurrence of a natural disaster of enormous\nproportions. We are also an overpopulated country,\nwith over 6 million inhabitants sharing 21,000 square\nkilometres. That makes us one of the most densely\npopulated countries of the American continent. Being\ncompletely dependant on agriculture, fluctuations in\nthe prices of coffee and sugar have always determined\nour prospects for development.\nA little over a decade ago we stood no chance of\nmeeting our financial commitments. Our debts far\nexceeded our ability to pay. Poor, small, overpopulated,\nindebted, dependent upon agriculture, afflicted by\nnatural disasters and immersed in a widespread armed\nconflict, El Salvador appeared not to have a future\nbarely 12 years ago. Violence, coupled with the harsh\nrealities of underdevelopment, appeared to have\ndoomed us to a vicious circle devoid of hope.\nWe are a different country today. We view the\nfuture with confidence, for we have discovered our\ncapacities. In just 12 years we have reduced poverty by\nhalf, from 60 per cent of our population, in 1991, to 33\nper cent today. Over 30 per cent of our population had\nbeen living in extreme poverty. Today only half as\nmany, 15 per cent, live in that distressing situation. Our\nefforts have had a direct impact on the standard of\nliving of all of our citizens. Twelve years ago 25 per\ncent of Salvadorans did not know how to read or write.\nThat figure is only 13 per cent today. The child\nmortality rate, which had been at 45 per thousand\nbirths, stands at 25 per thousand today.\nWe have accomplished all that by dedicating\nourselves to the most pressing needs of our people. In\norder to connect our most isolated towns, we have built\none kilometre of road every day for the last four years.\nWe have also built three schools every day in the same\nperiod, so as to educate our poorest children. Similarly,\n11\n\nwe have built 106 houses every day for low-income\nfamilies. And every five days we have built a new\nhealth centre.\nHaving once been completely dependent on\nagriculture, today we rank number 3, out of 24 Latin\nAmerican countries, in terms of export growth. During\nthe difficult decade of the 1990s we managed to grow\nat a much faster rate than our region at large. We have\nnow become the second-ranking country in Latin\nAmerica in economic growth.\nDespite the immense burden posed by\nreconstruction after the earthquakes of 2001, year after\nyear we have reduced our budget deficit, bringing it to\nunder 1 per cent in 2004. This has allowed us to control\ninflation, lowering it from 30 per cent to 2 per cent this\nyear, and thus to avoid a decline in family income. We\nhave zero risk of devaluation and today, after having\nseen interest rates of 30 per cent, we have the lowest\nbank interest rates of our region \u2014 6.8 per cent. For 11\nyears now, we have had no fluctuation in exchange\nrates, allowing us to acquire a rate of investment that is\nmatched in Latin America only by Chile, Mexico and\nmy country.\nThe living conditions of Salvadorans have\nchanged considerably. Rates of unemployment have\nfallen from 13 per cent to 6.8 per cent. Having had\nonly 250,000 telephone lines in 1992, we now have 1.6\nmillion. It is less expensive to make a telephone call\nfrom El Salvador to United Nations Headquarters than\nit is from Headquarters to El Salvador. In just over a\ndecade, the number of automobiles has grown by a\nfactor of four. We have managed to increase the supply\nof drinking water and electrification in rural areas by\n50 per cent. We have achieved peace. We have devoted\nour energies to economic development and our\nresources to the poorest among us.\nI have elaborated on developments in my country\nin recent years because it seems to me that we in El\nSalvador have discovered an effective way not only of\nresolving violent conflict, but also of combating\npoverty. Such means, which the international\ncommunity is seeking to confront the complexities of\nour world, are based on universally valid principles.\nThus, to understand the case of El Salvador is to\nunderstand new possibilities for other nations and\nsolutions to other problems.\nThe two most important challenges for a nation\nare learning how to live and understanding why we are\nalive. The former is an entirely practical matter,\nrequiring knowledge of the workings of the modern\nworld \u2014 how it works and what opportunities are\navailable to a poor country in a world that is rapidly\nevolving. The second is an entirely abstract matter, but\nit is all the more important for that, because only when\nwe are clear about the meaning of our shared lives can\nwe develop a sense of purpose that allows us to\nchannel the energies of a community towards a national\nobjective.\nIt is a paradox rich in significance that we\nSalvadorans, in order to find our commitment to the\nfuture, had to delve into the traditions that gave us our\nidentity in the past. When we found ourselves in the\ndead end of war, we had to rethink our destiny. In spite\nof our suffering, we had all the resources we needed to\nmove ahead: talent, energy, experience, faith and will.\nWe had the prudence to avoid future dangers and the\ncourage to confront present challenges.\nThe basic principle on which we have built our\ncountry is that every Salvadoran has access to the truth.\nIn every part of our land, it is possible for every\nSalvadoran to speak out, to express himself or herself\nwithout any constraint based on status. It is on the basis\nof the views of our compatriots that we have built the\nnew El Salvador. We decided that, if this were to\nbecome a reality, three principles were needed:\nfreedom, justice and the inalienable right to life. The\nconcrete manifestations of these values are democracy,\neconomic freedom and the rule of law. This applies not\nonly to El Salvador and Salvadorans, but equally to all\nthe inhabitants of our world. Every human being has\naccess to the truth. It is in the human capacity for\nreason that we find our moral potential. That is why we\nmust be free.\nAt a time when we wonder about the role of the\nUnited Nations, we must recall that the Organization\nwas born to ensure those fundamental rights. This\nforum cannot be paralysed in debates when freeing a\nnation from tyranny is at issue. We must all act in the\nface of oppression. Terrorism is a negation of all the\nvalues we share. We need a consensus on the values\nthat unite us and a renewed will for action.\nWe can debate interminably here the issue of Iraq\nand the current circumstances of the Iraqi people, but\nwhat brooks no debate is the fact that this forum has\nnot acted in a way commensurate with the demands of\nan increasingly complex world. The United Nations\n12\n\nmust be rethought and restructured so that it can meet\nthe objectives for which it was created.\nWe Salvadorans speak with the solidity that we\nhave gained from having fully shouldered our\nresponsibilities towards the international community.\nWe are participants in the reconstruction of Iraq. We\nspeak with the legitimacy of having been ourselves the\nbattleground of the last conflict of the cold war and we\nunderstand how the mediation of the international\ncommunity can help to find a solution to a conflict and\ngive hope to a desperate nation.\nIn conclusion, we wish to express our sorrow at\nthe death of United Nations staff members in Baghdad.\nWe reaffirm the right of all nations to have a voice in\nthis forum. The absence of the Republic of China in the\ndeliberations of this forum represents a rejection of the\nlegitimate aspirations of a nation that should speak in\nits own voice, just as we do, in this body and the\ncommunity of nations.\nThe liberator of the Americas summarized, in\nwords far more eloquent than mine, the values that\nmust inspire this forum and our discussions here. He\nsaid:\n\u201cPeoples, no one can take possession of\nyour sovereignty, unless it be violently and\nillegitimately. Flee that country where one person\nalone seeks to exercise all powers. That will be a\ncountry of slaves.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me begin by\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your assumption of the\npresidency of the fifty-eighth session of the General\nAssembly. Allow me also to express our heartfelt\nappreciation to Mr. Jan Kavan for his outstanding\nleadership during the previous session. I would also\nlike to pay tribute to Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello and\nthe United Nations staff members who fell victim to\ncowardly and blind rage in Baghdad. The dreadful\nterrorist attack perpetrated against those messengers of\npeace once again highlighted the danger we face in\nmany corners of the world.\nIn recent years, the United Nations and the entire\nworld community have come up against challenges that\nthreaten the very basis of the Organization and our\ncollective efforts towards global peace and security.\nInternational terrorism, a threat with a global\ndimension, affects each and every one of us. However,\nit has become evident that many of the new\ndemocracies are particularly vulnerable to that threat.\nScarce material resources and the lack of qualified\npersonnel undermine their efforts, highlighting the\nneed for further intensified global cooperation.\nGeorgia is no exception when it comes to threats\nposed by international terrorism. However, despite\nexisting difficulties, and with the active support and\nassistance of our partners, especially the United States,\nwe have made substantial progress. Georgia\nsuccessfully completed its anti-criminal and anti-\nterrorist operation in the Pankisi Gorge. We have freed\nthat territory from illegal armed groups and have seized\na considerable number of arms and ammunition. I can\nunequivocally state today that the Pankisi Gorge, which\n9\n\nhas been freed of every illegally armed person, no\nlonger poses any threat to Georgia or its neighbours.\nHowever, unless the root cause of the Pankisi Gorge\nproblem is settled, namely, the conflict in Chechnya,\nwe cannot consider the problem eliminated. The lesson\nto be drawn from this experience is that the fight\nagainst terrorism, in all its complexity, will be\nsuccessful only if carried out through concerted\ninternational efforts. A single quick-fix operation can\ncause the problem to resurface at a later stage.\nMany of the speakers who spoke before me\nhighlighted the importance of tackling the threat of\ninternational terrorism in all its aspects. We cannot but\nshare that notion. Protracted problems, and in\nparticular unresolved conflicts that result in the\ncreation of uncontrolled territories, have become a\nbreeding ground for terrorism. It is only a matter of\ntime until we witness greater ties being forged between\nseparatist leaders and terrorists.\nA vivid example of that is the conflict in\nAbkhazia, Georgia. That territory, which is under the\ncontrol of a separatist regime, has turned into a safe\nhaven for criminals, traffickers in drugs and human\nbeings, illegal arms dealers and terrorist groups. The\nnotorious Shamil Basayev, who was recently included\non the Counter-Terrorism Committee\u2019s terrorist list, has\nre-established himself as a friend of the separatist\nauthorities and is maintaining active links with the\nterrorist groups in Abkhazia. In the near future, we will\nprovide the Counter-Terrorism Committee with\nrelevant information on individuals involved in\nterrorist activities in that region of Georgia.\nThe record of the United Nations in reaching a\ncomprehensive settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia,\nGeorgia, has been less than satisfactory. After more\nthan 10 years of United Nations involvement, we have\nnot come even a single step closer to a settlement.\nBlatant violations of human rights and ethnic cleansing\nof the Georgian population in Abkhazia continue\nunabated. Despite numerous calls, we have failed to\ncorrect even the fundamental flaws in the entire United\nNations-led peace process.\nWe welcome the fact that, since the last session of\nthe General Assembly, the Geneva process has gained a\nnew dimension. We are hopeful that that will give new\nimpetus to the peace process. I would like to stress that\nthis relatively new development is still fragile and that\nit should be aimed at achieving results, and not at the\nprocess itself. We would also like to underline the\nimportance of the recently held summit of the\nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which\nreinforced the previous decisions of CIS heads of\nStates putting forth restrictive regulations on political\nand economic cooperation and contact with Abkhazia,\nGeorgia.\nHowever, despite those positive steps, very little\nhas changed on the ground. In that regard, I am\nthinking in particular of the illegal unilateral actions\nundertaken by representatives of the Russian side, and\nespecially by leaders of regional authorities, that\nsignificantly damage the peace process. The railway\nlink between Sochi and Sukhumi is still operating\nunhindered. Despite our appeals at the last session of\nthe General Assembly, the wholesale granting of\nRussian citizenship to the Abkhaz population has never\nslowed. Russian passports issued to the inhabitants of\nthe secessionist region have already fallen into hands\nof terrorists, who are making the best use of free\npassage in and out of Russia through the Abkhaz and\nOssetian sections of the Georgian-Russian border,\nwhere our neighbour unilaterally imposes a visa-free\nregime.\nThe illegal acquisition of property \u2014 including\npossessions of internally displaced persons \u2014 in\nAbkhazia, Georgia, by State bodies, legal entities and\nindividuals continues. Needless to say, such acts are\nbeing carried out in flagrant violation of international\nlaw and represent an infringement of Georgia\u2019s\nsovereignty. They run counter to the Georgian law that\ndeclares any transaction with the separatist regime null\nand void.\nThe illegal presence of the Russian military base\nin Gudauta is yet another element that is exacerbating\nthe situation in Abkhazia. Georgia insists that the\ncommitment undertaken in accordance with the Treaty\non Conventional Armed Forces in Europe concerning\nthe removal of that base be implemented expeditiously\nand transparently.\nBut there must still be hope \u2014 hope that we will\nnot again fail the 300,000 internally displaced persons\nand refugees, whose patience is running thin. Efforts\nmust be redoubled to persuade the Abkhaz side to\naccept the so-called Boden Document, on the\ndistribution of constitutional competences between\nTbilisi and Sokhumi, as a basis for political\nnegotiations.\n10\n\nWe have repeatedly noted the failure of the\npeacekeeping forces of the Commonwealth of\nIndependent States to provide security for returnees. In\nfact, those forces \u2014 which do not even have a United\nNations mandate \u2014 have done no more than sustain the\nstatus quo, virtually functioning as border guards\nbetween Abkhazia and the rest of Georgia. We cannot\nhope for any improvement in the situation unless the\nUnited Nations takes upon itself the launching, in an\ninternationalized format, of a full-scale peacekeeping\noperation in Abkhazia. It is through an increased role\non the part of the United Nations and through the will\nof the international community that the unheeding\nAbkhaz separatists can be forced to compromise.\nFailing that, the Government of Georgia will have no\nother choice but to request the Security Council to\nresort to the measures envisaged under Chapter VII of\nthe United Nations Charter.\nThe Secretary-General and many other world\nleaders have duly recognized that the United Nations is\npassing though one of the most critical phases of its\nhistory. New global realities have made it clear that\nimmediate measures ought to be undertaken if we want\nto ensure the sustainability of the United Nations and\nto strengthen the confidence of Member States in the\nOrganization.\nIn his statement before the forty-seventh session\nof the General Assembly, in 1992, President\nShevardnadze of Georgia stated:\n\u201cThere is no need to fear reforms when\nreforms are so necessary, especially, in our view,\nin the two interrelated fields of peacekeeping and\nnation-building in the newly independent States.\u201d\n(A/47/PV.12, p.36)\nThose sentiments have been duly echoed during the\ncurrent Assembly session. We should be courageous\nenough to recognize that reform of the United Nations\nis essential for the interests of each of us, as well as for\nour collective good.\nIt is our belief that Member States can rally\naround the Secretary-General in his call for the creation\nof a high-level panel of eminent personalities charged\nwith a multitude of tasks aimed at reforming the United\nNations. I reaffirm Georgia\u2019s support for expansion of\nthe Security Council. We join the calls to grant\nGermany and Japan permanent seats on the Council\nand to increase the number of non-permanent members.\nMoreover, the decision-making process within the\nCouncil should be made more transparent and\ndemocratic to ensure that the adoption of necessary\nresolutions does not fall prey to special, narrow\ninterests.\nAs we continue to collectively witness changing\nglobal realities, the Government of Georgia welcomes\nthe increasing role of regional structures in achieving\nthe fundamental objectives set forth by the United\nNations. The efforts of European and Euro-Atlantic\nstructures in the Balkans is just one successful example\nin that regard. Another vivid example is Afghanistan,\nwhere NATO has taken a leading role in the peace-\nbuilding operation. That organization\u2019s role will\nincrease further as a result of its recent expansion.\nSecurity issues have become a serious concern for such\nregional organizations as the Black Sea Economic\nCooperation Organization and the GUUAM\nParticipating States \u2014 Georgia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan,\nAzerbaijan and Republic of Moldova. Here, we should\nlike to appeal to Member States for support for the\nGUUAM\u2019s efforts to be granted observer status in the\nGeneral Assembly.\nThe Millennium Summit and the decisions taken\nthere remain, in our view, one of the most significant\nachievements of the United Nations. The consensus\nachieved both at the Monterrey and the Johannesburg\nSummits are road maps for the implementation of the\nMillennium Development Goals. The Government of\nGeorgia supports the objectives and strategies set forth\nin both outcome documents, considering it imperative\nthat the international community remain on course.\nGlobalization is becoming an everyday reality.\nAdvances in modern technologies are making that\nprocess irreversible. However, it is up to the United\nNations to take a more active role in guaranteeing\nequitable distribution of resources among all nations of\nthe world. It is through increased cooperation, through\nthe streamlining of actions within the United Nations\nand its bodies, and through the establishment of new\npartnerships that the Organization must prevail in\nachieving global sustainable development.\nDespite rapidly changing global realities, one\nthing remains constant: there is a greater need and a\ngreater demand for the United Nations. We remain\nhopeful that common sense and a common vision of the\nfuture will prevail in this unique international body.\nFor our part, we are prepared to do our utmost towards\nthat end.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMy\nGovernment is pleased that the General Assembly\u2019s\npresidency at its fifty-eighth regular session is in the\ncapable hands of my distinguished colleague, the\nForeign Minister of Saint Lucia, Senator Julian Hunte,\nwhose election bears witness to the importance that this\nOrganization holds, not just for the Government of\nSaint Lucia, but also for the Governments and people\nof the Caribbean Community. I trust that as he tackles\nthe critical United Nations agenda over the coming\nyear he will incorporate into his work the lessons of\nour successes as a Caribbean Community. As with his\npredecessor, whose steady leadership was tested during\na year of unprecedented challenges, he, too, can count\non my Government\u2019s continued support.\nI take this opportunity to pay tribute to\nSergio Vieira de Mello, Special Representative of the\nSecretary-General, other staff of the United Nations\nand the citizens of Iraq who lost their lives or sustained\ninjuries in the tragedy of Baghdad last August. We\n15\n\nshare the sorrow of the Secretary-General and his staff,\nand extend our profound condolences to the bereaved\nfamilies.\nI intend to focus our attention on the critical\nimportance of strategic partnership. Lest my statement\nbe misconstrued, I hasten to assure the Assembly from\nthe outset that my Government is neither oblivious nor\nindifferent to the multitude of concerns and problems\nthat attend and threaten our quest for international\npeace and security. I will be pleased to share my\nGovernment\u2019s perspective on them later. But allow me\nfirst to share with the Assembly our national\nphilosophy and policy as they relate to improving the\nhuman condition.\n\u201cHow does one do that?\u201d you ask. Improving the\nhuman condition is achieved by working towards\nhuman security. Notwithstanding the recriminations\nand blame, at the core of the failed World Trade\nOrganization round in Mexico earlier this month was\nthe issue of human security. Clearly, countries want\nguarantees as Governments struggle to meet the needs\nof their citizens. For my Government, human security\nmeans that each citizen has the right to liberty,\neducation, employment, an improved standard of living\nand economic development. We believe that human\nsecurity is a comprehensive and holistic concept that\nencompasses all aspects of the human condition.\nObviously, there is much that we in the Caribbean\ncan and must still learn from the rest of the world. But,\nequally, there are many valuable lessons that the rest of\nthe world can draw from our experiences and successes\nin the Caribbean. In many areas, the Caribbean is a\ntestament to the practicality and efficacy of functional\ncooperation, and of how, despite the many issues that\ndivide us, we continue to work together on matters\ncommon to us. Be it at the subregional level of the\nOrganization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) or\nwithin the broader Caribbean Community\n(CARICOM), the progress we have made in forging\nconsensus and in building common institutions to\naddress our shared problems allows us to be able to\nshare best practices with the United Nations and\ndemonstrate how, by working together through\ncooperative partnerships, each of us can achieve more.\nFor nearly four decades, for example, the\nUniversity of the West Indies has cultivated many\ndistinguished academics and other notables. Today, it\nstands as a beacon of hope for our young people in\ntheir quest for quality higher education. To its credit,\nthe University continues to work with several\ninternationally recognized institutions and agencies in\nthe areas of peace and security, health care and\nscientific research, to name but a few. The Caribbean\nExaminations Council has responded adequately and\nwith requisite standards of excellence to the growing\neducation needs of the English-speaking Caribbean.\nWhen our students complete their education, they stand\nshoulder to shoulder with their counterparts around the\nworld. It is not my intention to boast, but for us it is a\nmatter of national and regional pride. Further, as the\nAssembly\u2019s President is aware, many of our countries\nhave adopted policies that allow nationals of other\nmember States to travel to and work in their countries\nwithout the hassle of visa requirements and work\npermits. Although we are divided by the sea, the\nbridges of commitment and recognition of our common\nchallenges and the benefits of shared approaches are\nbringing us ever closer together.\nThe Caribbean Development Bank and the\nEastern Caribbean Central Bank are models of how\nfinancial responsibility and cooperation with and\namong member Governments in executing fiscal and\nmonetary policies can facilitate stability, underpin\naccountability and engender progress. For decades, the\nEastern Caribbean dollar, the currency of the countries\nof the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, has\nremained the bedrock of monetary stability. We are\nalso especially proud of the success of the OECS Court\nof Appeal, which has worked effectively and dutifully\nin dispensing justice throughout the territories over\nwhich it exercises jurisdiction. Further, the prudent and\npositive steps toward a Caribbean Single Market and\nEconomy (CSME), provide evidence of the\ndetermination of Caribbean Governments to cooperate\nin almost all endeavours to advance the human security\nof our citizens. These are but a few examples of\nfunctional cooperation. In every case, member\ncountries are better off because they work together\nrather than unilaterally.\nWe continue to incorporate in our national\npolicies many of the agreed principles of sustainable\ndevelopment. Additionally, our regional campaign to\nfight the spread of HIV/AIDS and treat its victims has\nwitnessed encouraging results under the Pan-Caribbean\nPartnership against HIV/AIDS. My Government wishes\nto commend the World Bank and the William J. Clinton\nPresidential Foundation for their pledges of support for\n16\n\nour work in this regard. We hope that our cooperation\nefforts will be a model for future partnerships in our\nregion and beyond.\nI promised earlier that I would share my\nGovernment\u2019s perspective on some of the decisive\nissues that confront us internationally. I preface my\nremarks with a reminder that just over a decade earlier\nwe stood on the threshold of a new era of opportunity.\nWe celebrated the collapse of major ideological\nconflicts, which previously held us captive, even, I\ndare say, on the brink of nuclear Armageddon. As one\nleader remarked, nations and peoples quietly harboured\ndreams that the last decade of the twentieth century and\nthe advent of the twenty-first century would herald new\nopportunities to address and redress asymmetrical\nissues that had frustrated our collective aspirations and\nindividual potential. None of us, I am sure, would\nlikely admit that we may have squandered such\nprospects. However, a little more than a decade later,\nideological rifts seem to have been replaced by\npolitical chasms and new dangers.\nConsequently, we must re-evaluate our concept of\nsecurity. The Organization of American States, in its\nmeeting of foreign ministers last year in Barbados,\ntook the bold and timely step of redefining security\nwithin its hemisphere. Security, the foreign ministers\ndeclared, is diverse in scope and multidimensional in\nnature, requiring multifaceted approaches to address\npolitical, economic, social and environmental issues.\nThis concept clearly recognizes that we cannot separate\nnational, regional and international security issues from\npolitical, economic and social stability and their\nsecurity implications.\nWe in the Caribbean recognize that, whereas\nglobalization is a viable instrument of growth and\nprosperity for some, it has become the vehicle of ruin\nand despair for many of the already poor people around\nthe world. While countries that prosper praise\nglobalization and free trade, countries that suffer see\nthemselves as no more than the guinea pigs, the passive\nobjects of globalization, with very little hope of\nadvancing human security for their poor citizens.\nHow do we encourage our citizens to have faith\nin a system that punishes their legitimate efforts? How\ncan we tell the poor farmers in the developing world,\nstruggling to eke out an existence, to hold out hope\nwhen farmers in rich countries are subsidized and\nrewarded for overproduction? How do we ask our\ncitizens in small vulnerable economies to sacrifice and\nadopt free trade wholesale, while larger, more\ndeveloped economies devise new ways to deny them\ncrucial market access. Unless we address such\ninequities, there will always be resentment and\nmistrust. We must therefore work together to level\nthese bumps on the road to development. Also, we\nmust rob the uncivil forces of the arguments they use to\nfeed and exploit the anger and despair of the poor and\ndispossessed.\nI turn now to the United Nations. In our view, the\nUnited Nations remains central to international peace\nand human security. The myriad challenges facing us\ntoday require collective action and partnership. I hasten\nto add that, although the United Nations still lacks\nimportant elements of transparency and democracy in\nthe operations of the Security Council, it nevertheless\nrepresents the most practical framework our nations\nhave to address regional and international concerns in a\nholistic manner.\nI trust that, when the dust of discontent settles,\nwe will appreciate that no country can act alone in\npursuit of international peace, development and human\nsecurity. My Government calls on the United Nations\nmembership to embrace a bold vision and commitment\nto fighting the pull of isolation and the lure of\neconomic and financial engineering. Our reality today\nencompasses the struggles to find positive and\nsustainable methods for advancing our citizens\u2019\ndevelopment against uncivil forces or rogue ideologies\nworking relentlessly to undermine them.\nMy Government calls on the United Nations and\nMember Governments to further subscribe to and\npromote partnership by fulfilling the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals. The Millennium Goals are\nessential steps to improving the human condition. They\nare also a reliable basis for addressing many of the\ninequities of globalization. We urge Member States to\nwork to meet these goals. We can relent only when the\nother half of the world\u2019s population ceases to live in\nabject poverty, when larger sectors of the world\u2019s\npopulation can find work, and when all parents are able\nto send their children to school.\nDespite its exclusion from this international\nfraternity of nations, the Republic of China on Taiwan\nremains a valuable partner for peace and development\nwith fullest respect for international law. We trust that\nits contributions and its citizens\u2019 right to adequate\n17\n\nrepresentation can be guaranteed in the best interest of\nbrotherhood so that all people can live in peace and\nenjoy the fruits of prosperity through partnership.\nSaint Kitts and Nevis therefore urges the\nUnited Nations to avail itself of every possibility to\nfacilitate a sustainable resolution of the impasse that\nhampers Taiwan\u2019s efforts to engage in international\ndialogue and contribute to the common interests of\nmankind.\nLet me end by reaffirming my Government\u2019s\ncommitment to multilateralism and to strategic\npartnership.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow\nme to convey to this Assembly the heartfelt greetings\nof the Government and people of the Republic of\nVanuatu. I should like first of all to sincerely\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the\nPresidency of the fifty-eight session of the General\nAssembly. You have assumed the Presidency at an\nextremely difficult, unsettled and complex time. A\nseries of regrettable events have imperilled the political\nand ideological authority which is the universal\nfoundation of the United Nations ability to work for the\nmaintenance of peace and security in the world. Given\nthe enormity of the challenges that now face us, my\ndelegation \u2014 and I personally \u2014 would like to\nsolemnly assure you of our support and full\ncooperation.\nThe job of the Secretary-General is one of the\nmost difficult jobs, in particular when the very\nfounding principles of the Organization are being\ncompromised or simply discarded in favour of the\ninterest of some Members. The Government of Vanuatu\nadmires the outstanding authority and clear-sightedness\nas well as the diplomatic qualities of Mr. Kofi Annan,\nthe Secretary-General of the United Nations. His\nwisdom and his persistence have enabled Member\nStates to step up their efforts to make the work of the\nUnited Nations more effective and better adapted to the\nmaintenance of peace throughout the world, while\nkeeping the focus on development priorities such as, in\nparticular, the small economies of island States such as\nVanuatu.\nQuite frankly, we are participating in this meeting\nsomewhat confused about the future of our\nOrganization, since a minority of Powers are\ninfluencing the system to advance their own interests\nand to the detriment of the principles and mandates\nwhich are the prerogatives of the United Nations. The\nUnited Nations mission, inter alia, is to work for\npeaceful coexistence among peoples and nations. But\nthe United Nations is being thwarted because of the\nunilateral initiatives of certain Powers. This is the\nresponsibility of its Members, and this situation has to\nbe addressed in order to restore the central role of the\nUnited Nations in conflict settlement.\nWe cannot conceive of any unilateral action in the\nfuture without the risk of paralysing the Organization\nitself. The decline of order and justice and the various\nconflicts that are occurring throughout the world are\nparticularly disquieting. If the international system\ncontinues to be influenced by certain Powers, the\nfuture will remain uncertain, notwithstanding the\nindividual efforts made by Member States and despite\nthe countless resolutions adopted by this Assembly.\nIn recent years, the international geopolitical\nenvironment has been dramatically shaken.\nIrresponsible actions have unleashed much hatred and\n4\n\nbitterness, which jeopardizes world peace and\nharmony. The fundamental principles that justified the\nexistence of the United Nations are now being called\ninto question and we are duty-bound explicitly and\nclearly to redefine the new objectives and to strengthen\nthe founding principles of the United Nations.\nMany tragic events have occurred and countless\ninnocent lives have been destroyed. These are the facts\nof the world today. I would like to take this opportunity\nto pay tribute to the members of the Secretariat who\ntragically lost their lives in the line of duty and to\nconvey condolences to the United Nations Secretariat\nas well as to the families of the victims of that brutal\nand horrendous act. That barbaric and inhuman act of\nviolence saddens us all. I join with previous speakers\nin condemning that brutal act.\nUnfortunately, some of us have contributed to the\ncurrent situation. A brief overview of past events\ndefinitely shows that various world conflicts, wars,\nfamines, droughts, epidemics, poverty and\nenvironmental degradation are on the increase. Many\ndeveloping countries are facing a variety of\ndevelopment difficulties, such as the increase in\nunemployment that contributes to the degradation of\nsocieties. In many cases, the destruction of social and\ncultural progress, caused by globalization and\nmodernization, has increased feelings of hatred and\nbitterness. The main outlines for future development\nhave been mapped out but the success of the\nimplementation of this remains dependant on political\nwill, particularly the financial commitments of the\nindustrialized countries. However, I am still optimistic\nand I trust in your wisdom, Mr. President, to guide us\nto a better future.\nWhile counter-terrorism and normalization in\nsome countries are on the agenda, we should not divert\nour attention from the development issues that can\nundermine the future of developing countries.\nConsiderable resources will be devoted to security\nquestions, when only a tiny share of this amount would\nbe enough to meet the needs of the developing\ncountries.\nThe environment is another area of concern. We\nsupport previous statements by representatives of the\nisland States of the Pacific, and we continue to\nencourage countries that have not yet done so to ratify\nthe Kyoto Protocol as soon as possible.\nHow can we explain to our peoples that certain\ninternational obligations are priorities only for the\nsmall States, whereas the super-Powers seem hardly to\nbe concerned about them, or are even hostile to them,\nand yet do not hesitate to impose a series of conditions\nwhich contribute to the underdevelopment of small\nStates and which we could describe as political and\neconomic interference?\nThe unilateral imposition and maintenance of the\nban on the sale of products containing kava in Europe\nis an example of this discriminatory attitude. The\nEuropean countries involved do not seem to take\naccount of the scientific studies establishing the\nabsence of any link between kava and kidney disease, a\nlink suggested by the health authorities of some\nEuropean countries.\nThe threat of economic sanctions by the\nOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment (OECD) against tax havens in the\nPacific, while excepting European jurisdictions, leaves\nno alternative than to accept the conditions imposed\nwithout any consideration of the economies concerned.\nSince our acceptance in principle of the OECD\nconditions we have received no indication from that\norganization of any quid pro quo that it can provide in\nthe case of economic loss.\nDespite the opposition of the Pacific region to the\ntransportation of nuclear waste in the waters of our\nregion, certain Powers show a complete lack of respect\nfor the sovereignty of the small islands States of the\nPacific. It is not only a question of the environment and\nof protecting our natural resources against any disaster;\nit is much more a question of ethics. In other words, we\nregret the complete lack of respect for the small island\nStates of the Pacific as fully fledged members of the\ninternational community.\nIt is generally recognized today that trade is the\nengine of development. However, like other countries\nof similar size, Vanuatu is facing certain tariff and non-\ntariff restrictions which are causing our agricultural\nproducts to be inaccessible to, in particular, markets\nthat are often described as free.\nBringing national laws into line with international\nconventions carries costs that are often\ndisproportionate for the small countries. In almost all\ncases, national resource constraints, financial as well as\ntechnical, are ignored, whereas they must be taken into\n5\n\naccount for the success of any programme of action\nresulting from international commitments.\nWe must not lose sight of the basic principle of\nthe right to self-determination. We reiterate that the\ncredibility of the United Nations rests on following up\nthe implementation of any reform aimed at recognizing\nthe right of peoples to self-determination, in the\ncontext of respect for others and for the United Nations\nCharter. We therefore applaud the efforts by the\nGovernment of Indonesia to open and maintain\ndialogue with the various social and minority\nconstituents, as well as those in West Papua, in respect\nfor human rights and freedom of expression.\nWe welcome the positive role and efforts of\nAustralia and New Zealand, after an unprecedented\ndecision by the countries of the region, to restore and\nmaintain order, security and peace in the region, and in\nparticular in the Solomon Islands.\nWe applaud the French President, Mr. Jacques\nChirac, for having initiated a summit meeting of heads\nof State and Government of the South Pacific region,\nheld last July, in order to strengthen our cooperation.\nI trust in your wisdom, Mr. President, to make\nsure that all the theories expounded in the Assembly\nare followed by concrete, practical action. We have a\nduty to work collectively through the multilateral\ninstitutions to help resolve and overcome the\ndifficulties and challenges that face us. In order to do\nthat, we need to constantly review the very structure of\nthe United Nations. The various unilateral initiatives\nhave highlighted the limits of the current structure\nwhich have caused a weakening of the multilateral\napproach. Many super-Powers are unwilling to share\neven a part of their authority within the United Nations\nand seem to prefer the status quo. The principles of\ndemocratization and transparency advocated by most\nMembers must be taken into account in the\nreorganization and in the Organization\u2019s decision-\nmaking process.\nMy delegation supports changing the permanent\nmembership of the Security Council to include Japan\nand a representative of the African continent, of the\nMiddle East and of the Alliance of Small Island States.\nThis reform would give the Organization greater\ntransparency, restore confidence in it and improve\ninternational cooperation. My delegation strongly\nsupports the proposals made, and in particular the\nnomination of a group of leaders representing the\nvarious regions and the main categories of economies\nin order to launch this important proposal. This long\nawaited review will finally come about.\nWe need to take this great opportunity to renew\nand strengthen the United Nations in order to give it\nthe qualities it needs to meet the challenges of our\ntime. Strengthening the cohesion and unity of our great\ncommunity of nations will be a daunting challenge, one\nwhich we are prepared to meet, while offering our\ncomplete and unconditional support.\nWe have aired our concerns in order to stress the\ninjustices and contradictions in the current situation,\nbut we assure the Organization of our support and our\ncommitment to seeing the Organization revitalized,\ncapable of meeting the aspirations of all its Members,\nwhether large or small, rich or poor, strong or weak.\nThe contradictions of principle, mounting\nterrorism, human suffering, and the emergence of\nconflicts in regions that are normally peaceful,\ncombined with the injustices of globalization, are all\ningredients for a future catastrophe.\nIn conclusion, my delegation remains convinced\nthat only a reinvigorated United Nations can contribute\nin a lasting manner to world peace and security.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like to congratulate\nHis Excellency, the Foreign Minister of Saint Lucia,\nupon his assumption of the Presidency of the General\nAssembly, and wish him much success.\nUntil just one month ago, every person in this hall\nand every Member of this Organization joined us in the\nhope that the Middle East peace process might finally\nbe back on track, and that a resolution of the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict might be on the horizon. The\nestablishment of a new Palestinian Government\npromised an end to terror and a new beginning.\nThis glimmer of hope was darkened on 19 August\nby the extremists who blew up a bus full of Jewish\nfamilies on their way home from prayers at the Western\nWall, the holiest site in the Jewish religion. Twenty-\nthree people, young and old, mothers and babies in\ntheir cradles, were slaughtered in that attack. That\nattack was carried out by Hamas, a terrorist\norganization, which, under the road map, should have\nbeen dismantled by the Palestinian Authority. Failure\nto dismantle Hamas and other extremist organizations\nhas brought our diplomatic efforts to a standstill.\nRather than acting to fulfil its obligation, the\nPalestinian Authority has chosen the route of inaction,\nand complicity in terror.\nWe cannot allow this to continue. We must restore\nhope that we can build a better future for our children.\nThe infrastructure of terror must be dismantled so that\nwe can put our peace efforts back on track. There is no\ntime other than now. There is no other way.\nFor many years it was thought that terrorism in\nthe Middle East was Israel\u2019s problem, not the world\u2019s.\nToday, the world knows otherwise. Today, it is not only\nIsrael that mourns the loss of its loved ones, including\nwomen and children and babies, at the hands of the\nterrorists. Sadly, we have been joined by peoples from\nacross the globe \u2014 from Mombassa to Casablanca and\nfrom Moscow to Bali. Even the United Nations, which\nfor so many has been a symbol of peace and goodwill,\nis not immune.\n28\n \nGathered here today in New York, just two short\nyears after 11 September, the community of nations\nknows that those who seek to advance their political\nagendas through killing innocents are ready to strike at\nanyone or anything that represents the values of\nfreedom and human life.\nTerrorism has declared war on us all. Israel has\noften stood alone in this battle. A country that has\nsuffered more than any other from terrorism, we have\nalways understood the danger it poses to democracy\nand freedom everywhere, even when others refused to\nsee this, and condemned us for our actions. We have\nalways understood that terrorism, no matter what cause it\nclaims to serve, seeks only to destroy, rather than to build.\nThere can be no neutrality in the war against\nterrorism and there can be no immunity for those who\nengage in it. Abstaining is not an option. This is not a\nwar of choice. Terrorism will not be eliminated until\nthe world unites against it. Our only choice is to win.\nEvery member of the international community must\ntake concrete and proactive measures to cut off all\nchannels of financial, moral and political support to\nthis common enemy.\nStates Members of this institution that sponsor\nterrorists and give them shelter are accomplices in the\nacts of terror themselves. They must be held\naccountable for their crimes. It is no coincidence that\nStates that sponsor terrorism, like Iran and Syria, are\nalso striving to acquire weapons of mass destruction.\nTheir hostility to freedom and the rule of law puts the\nvery future of humanity in jeopardy.\nI know that many in this place see Yasser Arafat\nas the symbol of the Palestinian struggle. Tragically,\nfor his people and for ours, he is one of the world\u2019s\nicons of terror. In the 10 years since Arafat made a\ncommitment to Israel and the world that he would no\nlonger use terror, 1,126 Israelis have been killed and\nthousands wounded in 19,000 separate Palestinian\nterrorist attacks. In relative numbers, this would be the\nsame as 11,000 French or 56,000 Americans dying\nfrom terrorism in the same period of time.\nThis carnage must stop. Its impact on both\nsocieties is devastating. Yasser Arafat bears direct\nresponsibility for this terrible suffering. He has led his\npeople along the path of terror \u2014 from hijackings to\nsuicide bombings \u2014 for more than 30 years, always\npreferring Israeli pain over Palestinian gain. He has\nbeen \u2014 and he remains \u2014 the greatest obstacle to\npeace between our peoples. For as long as he controls\nthe levers of power, no moderate leadership can\nemerge. To vote for Arafat, like we saw in this\nAssembly just last week, is to vote against the\nPalestinian people. When Arafat wins, terrorism wins,\nand we all lose. Instead of rallying around Arafat, the\ninternational community must rally around the genuine\ninterests of the Palestinian people. They must do so\nnow, before he leads them even further down the path\nof terror and destruction.\nWhen a responsible and empowered Palestinian\nleadership finally emerges \u2014 a leadership ready to join\nthe war on terror \u2014 it will find us a willing partner for\npeace. Israel is committed to the vision for Middle East\npeace laid out by United States President George Bush\non 24 June 2002. Israel will not compromise on the\nsafety of its citizens, but we will go the extra mile, as\nwe have proven before, to bring peace and security to\nboth our peoples.\nWe are ready to work with the Palestinians and\nwith the international community to make this vision a\nreality. For this to happen, the Palestinian leadership\nmust take the moral and strategic decision to abandon\nterrorism once and for all, and make peacemaking\npossible. They must guide their people to build their\nown society, rather than seek to destroy ours. They,\ntoo, must understand that it is not poverty that breeds\nterror but terror that breeds poverty.\nWe cannot stop only at dismantling the\ninfrastructure of terror. We must also build an\ninfrastructure of peace. It is up to political and moral\nleaders everywhere to foster an environment which\nrejects extremism and empowers the peacemakers. This\nis particularly so in the Arab and Muslim world, where\nincitement against Israel closes hearts and minds to the\npossibility of peace.\nLeaders must guide their people away from the\nculture of hate, and replace it with a culture of\ntolerance. Concrete expressions of cooperation and\nexchange must be built in media and government,\neducation, science and business, to reinforce the\nmessage of tolerance and acceptance.\nFor the sake of our collective future, voices of\nmoderation must be heard. For the sake of our\ncollective future, Israel and the Arab nations must learn\nto live together side by side, to overcome our conflicts\njust as the nations of Europe have learned to overcome\ntheirs. Israel is living among its Arab neighbours. We\n29\n \nbelieve in a common future of peace and prosperity\nwith them. My many meetings with Arab leaders over\nthe last few days have encouraged me to believe that\ntogether we can make our region a better place.\nThis culture of peace must permeate not only the\nborders of the Middle East, it must permeate the walls\nof the United Nations as well. In the past, the United\nNations has shown us that it can play a positive role.\nThis Assembly was key to the founding of the State of\nIsrael, 55 years ago. Security Council resolutions 242\n(1967) and 338 (1973) are our guideposts to\nnegotiations and peace.\nTo play such a constructive role in the future, the\nUnited Nations must reform. It must move away from\nthe partisan hostility that has taken over its Middle East\nagenda. For more than three decades, this Assembly\nhas passed every year a litany of resolutions designed\nto discredit Israel, challenge its interests, and promote\nthe will of its greatest enemies.\nIn my hand I am holding a collection of the\ndecisions of the fifty-seventh General Assembly on the\nMiddle East \u2014 175 pages filled not with hope, but with\nthe negative agendas of the past. No other country has\nsuffered such unjustified attack and consistent\ndiscrimination within the United Nations system. The\ntime has come to end this campaign of diplomatic\nincitement. For the sake of Israelis and Palestinians \u2014\nfor the sake of the United Nations and peace itself \u2014 I\ncall on this body to rise above the tired politics of\nyesterday, and adopt a new, courageous agenda for\ntomorrow.\nI call on the General Assembly to abandon the\nautomatic adoption of anti-Israel resolutions and to\nfind ways of making itself relevant once again to the\ninterests of the people it claims to serve. I call on this\nAssembly to fulfil its historic mission and help\npromote what unites us, not what divides us.\nOn the morning of 1 February of this year, Israel\nlost its first astronaut in the Space Shuttle Columbia\ndisaster \u2014 a skilled and courageous pilot whom I knew\npersonally, a child of Holocaust survivors, a national\nhero. Colonel Ilan Ramon embodied the spirit of our\nnation. He was a man of courage and action, dedicated\nto the well-being of his people. Just as he sought to\ncontribute to the advancement of his fellow man, he\nmet his death, together with colleagues from the United\nStates and India, on a scientific mission in the name of\nhumanity as a whole.\nIsrael\u2019s place in such endeavours of international\ncooperation and accomplishment is no coincidence. In\nthe 55 years since the State of Israel was established,\nrecognized and welcomed into the family of nations,\nour achievements in the fields of science and\ntechnology, the arts and literature and agriculture and\nmedicine have come to rank with the best in the world.\nOur international cooperation programme is celebrated\nin over a hundred countries around the globe, sharing\nskills, experience and knowledge for the benefit of\nmillions of people. We extend this hand of friendship\nto all the nations of the world. We welcome our\nimproving relations with Europe, just as we remain\ncommitted to promoting closer ties with the nations of\nAfrica, Asia and the Americas.\nThe Zionist vision of Israel\u2019s founders was to\nbring into the world a State in our ancient homeland to\nserve as a haven from persecution for our people, a\nplace where the Jewish people could fulfil its right to\nself-determination in the modern era and a bastion of\ndemocracy and opportunity for all its citizens. Our\nfounders also made a promise not just to the people of\nIsrael, but also to the people of the Middle East as a\nwhole \u2014 to pursue peace and to work for the common\nadvancement of our region.\nI know personally the profound meaning of this\nhistoric undertaking. I came to Israel as a young\nrefugee from Tunisia. I serve as one of hundreds of\nthousands of immigrants to whom Israel has granted\npromise and protection, freedom and opportunity,\nthrough the values and institutions of democracy.\nI stand here today to reaffirm, before the nations\nof the world, the commitment of my country to peace.\nPeace for the people of Israel is both a moral and\nhistoric imperative. \u201cShalom\u201d \u2014 the word for peace in\nHebrew \u2014 is central to our language and our heritage.\nIt is how we say \u201chello\u201d and it is how we say\n\u201cgoodbye\u201d. It is a name we give to our children. It is\nmy own family name.\nIt was our prophet Isaiah, who brought this\nmessage of peace to the world centuries ago, when he\nsaid: \u201cAnd they shall beat their swords into\nploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks.\nNation shall not lift up sword against Nation, neither\nshall they learn war any more\u201d.\nIsrael\u2019s historic record is clear. Whenever a true\npartner for peace has emerged, he has been met with\nIsrael\u2019s extended hand. This was true when President\n30\n \nAnwar Sadat of Egypt came to Jerusalem in 1977 and it\nwas true when King Hussein of Jordan signed the\nPeace Treaty with us in 1994. The same is true today.\nIsrael stands ready to complete the circle of peace with\nall its neighbours \u2014 real peace, not just peace for the\nheadlines, but peace which brings an end to violence\nand hostility and positive change for the citizens of our\nregion.\nFrom this great rostrum \u2014 a rostrum shared by\nall humanity \u2014 I call on the leaders of Syria and\nLebanon, of Iran and of the Palestinian people to\nabandon once and for all their hostility towards us and\nto join us in building a better future for our children.\nThis evening, I shall return to Jerusalem, the\neternal capital of the Jewish people, to join with them\nin celebrating Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year.\nAccording to our tradition, this is a time when God\ndetermines the fate of each and every individual for the\ncoming year. These are days of reflection and prayer.\nMay all our prayers for peace and for life be answered,\nand may the actions and deeds of all the States and\npeoples represented here in this Hall bring to mankind\npeace and all the blessings that life can offer.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should\nlike to begin by extending to Mr. Julian Hunte sincere\ncongratulations on his election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-eighth session. The\nEritrean delegation is convinced that, under his wise\nguidance, this session will address, with vision and\ncourage, the challenging issues that are confronting the\nworld.\nMy delegation would also like to take this\nopportunity to express appreciation and thanks to his\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-seventh session, for the wisdom\nand skill he displayed in leading the session to a\nsuccessful conclusion. We also pay tribute to the\nSecretary-General, Kofi Annan, for his steadfast\ncommitment to the cause of peace and development \u2014\nthe twin pillars of the United Nations Charter.\nEritrea pays tribute to and thanks the facilitators\nand guarantors of the United Nations Mission in\nEthiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) and its partners, the\ntroop- and observer-contributing countries, as well as\ndonor countries, for the assistance they generously\nextended to ensure the success of the peace process. It\nalso urges them not to be discouraged by the recent\nnegative developments and to continue their assistance,\nwhich is essential for the achievement of peace and\nsecurity in our region.\nEritrea would like to bring to the Assembly\u2019s\nattention the dangerous developments that are\nthreatening to destroy the peace process between\nEritrea and Ethiopia. In a message communicated to\nthe Secretary-General, on 19 September 2003, Ethiopia\nofficially rejected the decision of the Boundary\nCommission and threatened to unleash another war of\naggression against Eritrea if the terms and conditions it\nhad set were not met.\nIt should be recalled that Ethiopia declared war\non Eritrea in 1998 because it claimed ownership of the\nsovereign Eritrean town of Badme. At that time, we\nmade every possible diplomatic effort to prevent an\nunwarranted and unjustifiable war \u2014 prior to and in\nthe aftermath of Ethiopia\u2019s official declaration of war.\nUnfortunately, that sent the wrong signal to Ethiopia\nand prompted the regime in power to pursue \u2014 with\nimpunity \u2014 its policy of belligerence, and to unleash\nsuccessive military offensives that that resulted in a\ngreat loss of life and the destruction of property.\nAfter a cycle of senseless and bloody military\nclashes, reason prevailed, with the signing of the\nAgreement on the Cessation of Hostilities and the\nComprehensive Peace Agreement in Algiers in June\nand December 2000, respectively. A Boundary\nCommission, empowered to be the final arbiter for the\nboundary claims, was subsequently created. The\nCommission announced its final and binding decision\non 13 April 2002. Badme was confirmed by the\nCommission\u2019s decision as being sovereign Eritrean\nterritory.\nIn spite of its treaty obligations to respect and\nduly implement the final and binding decision of the\nBoundary Commission, however, Ethiopia has chosen\nto flout international law and practice. Thus, its\nrejection of the entire decision and its denunciation of\nthe Commission follow a series of major violations of\nthe Algiers Agreements, including the illegal\ndeployment of troops and the building of settlements in\nsovereign Eritrean territory, the aggravation of the\nsuffering of over 60,000 Eritrean citizens, who remain\ndisplaced from their home villages in the temporary\nsecurity zone, and the delay of demarcation because of\nobstructions caused by its tactics to prevent preparatory\nfield work. That has resulted in huge financial cost to\nthe international community.\nAs most Members will have been informed by\nnow, the Ethiopian Prime Minister declared, in a letter\nof 19 September to the Secretary-General, that the\nboundary demarcation process is \u201cin terminal crisis\u201d.\nThe Prime Minister heaped insults on the Boundary\nCommission, dismissed its judgement as \u201ctotally\nillegal, unjust and irresponsible\u201d and called on the\nSecurity Council to set up \u201can alternative mechanism\u201d\nto demarcate the contested parts of the boundary. He\nfurther suggested that UNMEE should pack up and\nleave, and pleaded for international recognition and\nendorsement of Ethiopia\u2019s occupation of sovereign\nEritrean territories.\nEthiopia\u2019s provocative letter represents nothing\nless than an unprecedented assault on the fundamental\nprinciples of international law and the key tenets of the\nAlgiers peace agreements, as well as Security Council\nresolution 1507 (2003). It is full of blatant lies and\ndistortions in its account of the legal principles and\n18\n\nfindings that the Boundary Commission invoked in\ndetermining the location of Badme.\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s letter contrasts sharply with\nthe public statement of his Government when the\nBoundary Commission announced its decision on 13\nApril 2002. At that time, Ethiopia urged the\ninternational community to put intense pressure on\nEritrea to accept and implement the decision of the\nBoundary Commission fully and faithfully. It declared\nfull legal victory and even bragged about its\n\u201csuccessful litigation strategy that hinged on a\nmaximalist approach\u201d of exaggerating its claims to\ninclude territories that never belonged to it. This\nblatant revelation, which is in fact true, was repeated\nby both the Prime Minister and his Minister for Foreign\nAffairs in a report to the Ethiopian Parliament as\nrecently as last month.\nLet me now briefly address some of the issues\nraised in the Ethiopian letter.\nFirst, article 4.2 of the Algiers Peace Agreement\nunambiguously states that:\n\u201ca neutral Boundary Commission composed of\nfive members shall be established with a mandate\nto delimit and demarcate the colonial treaty\nborder based on the pertinent colonial treaties\n(1900, 1902, 1908) and applicable international\nlaw.\u201d\nArticle 4.15 further states:\n\u201cThe parties agree that the delimitation and\ndemarcation determinations of the Commission\nshall be final and binding. Each party shall\nrespect the border so determined, as well as the\nterritorial integrity and sovereignty of the other\nparty\u201d.\nTherefore, Ethiopia cannot thus arbitrarily and\nunilaterally discard these key provisions of the peace\nagreement or urge the Security Council to set up a new\nmechanism.\nSecondly, the Temporary Security Zone was\nnever intended or set up to create a provisional\nboundary. Article 10 of the Cessation of Hostilities\nAgreement specifically states that this will not\nprejudge the final status of the contested areas, which\nwill be determined at the end of the delimitation and\ndemarcation of the boundary. In this regard, it is\ninstructive to note that the Boundary Commission had\nnotified both parties, in its delimitation decision of 13\nApril 2002, to recognize and respect each other\u2019s\nsovereignty and territorial integrity as determined by\nthe delimitation decision pending demarcation on the\nground. The boundary is thus already determined. This\nis reinforced by Security Council resolution 1507\n(2003), which calls on both parties to recognize and\nrespect each other\u2019s territorial integrity and\nsovereignty. Ethiopia\u2019s ludicrous suggestion of\n\u201crecognizing the southern boundary of the Temporary\nSecurity Zone\u201d as the boundary between the two\ncountries\u201d thus represents a flagrant violation of the\nAlgiers Peace Agreements and relevant Security\nCouncil resolutions.\nThirdly, UNMEE\u2019s mandate shall terminate when\nthe delimitation-demarcation process of the border has\nbeen completed, pursuant to article 5 of the Cessation\nof Hostilities Agreement. Ethiopia will again commit a\ngross violation of the Cessation of Hostilities\nAgreement if, as it has intimated in its letter, it requests\nUNMEE to leave before completing its task.\nObviously, Ethiopia\u2019s primary concern is not the\nfinancial burden that UNMEE\u2019s prolonged presence\nwould entail for the international community.\nEthiopia is, in fact, guilty of a litany of\nobstructions and violations that have in the past\nprevented expeditious demarcation. It cannot now shed\ncrocodile tears or preach to the international\ncommunity on ways and means of reducing financial\ncosts. If this is a thinly veiled threat meant to convey to\nus its intentions of unleashing war, our response is that\nEthiopia will be the sole party responsible for\nendangering regional peace and stability.\nAs the main guarantor of the Algiers Peace\nAgreement, the Security Council has legal treaty\nobligations to prevent war. Indeed, in accordance with\narticle 14 of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement,\nthe Security Council should urgently consider\nEthiopia\u2019s flagrant violations of the Algiers Peace\nAgreement and take appropriate measures under\nArticle VII of the Charter of the United Nations.\nFourthly, Ethiopian leaders also argue that\n\u201cthe people of Ethiopia will not accept the\ndecisions of the Boundary Commission [and that]\nEthiopia will be embroiled in a political crisis and\ncivil war if we accept the decision\u201d.\n19\n\nThese hackneyed arguments have been used by\nprevious Ethiopian leaders to justify their wars of\naggression. The truth is that the people of Ethiopia\nhave enjoyed internal harmony only when they were at\npeace with Eritrea. Whenever it has been at war with\nEritrea, Ethiopia has become a source of instability in\nthe region, and its people the victims of recurrent\nfamines and pestilence. Also, such declarations must\nring an alarm bell, because they are similar, if not\nidentical, to statements made by those leaders who\nembroiled Europe in the Second World War.\nIn our view, Ethiopia\u2019s leaders have assumed\ntheir lawlessness and aggressive invasion policy\nbecause they have been emboldened by past patterns of\nunjustifiable tolerance by the international community.\nNo action was taken against Ethiopia when it violated\nthe moratorium on air strikes brokered by the United\nStates and launched its second offensive in February\n1999. No action was taken against Ethiopia when, in\nviolation of the technical arrangements forged by the\nUnited States, the European Union, the United Nations\nand the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and\nconsidered final and binding, it launched its third\noffensive in May 2000. Ethiopia has now reached the\napex of its record of lawlessness, contempt for the rule\nof law, treaty obligations and the Charter of the United\nNations by rejecting the final and binding decision of\nan Arbitration Commission. How long will this culture\nof impunity continue? When is the world going to say,\n\u201cEnough is enough\u201d and invoke article 14 of the\nAlgiers Agreement?\nArticle 14 of the Cessation of Hostilities\nAgreement states clearly, inter alia, that\n\u201cOAU and the United Nations commit themselves\nto guarantee the respect for this commitment of\nthe two parties until the determination of the\ncommon border on the basis of pertinent colonial\ntreaties and applicable international law \u2026 This\nguarantee shall be comprised of:\n\u201c(a) Measures to be taken by the\ninternational community should one or both of\nthe parties violate this commitment, including\nappropriate measures to be taken under Chapter\nVII of the Charter of the United Nations by the\nUnited Nations Security Council\u201d.\nShould not the United Nations and the\ninternational community now take these actions in the\nname of justice and the Charter of the United Nations?\nThe international community has already invested\ntoo much \u2014 in financial and in political terms \u2014 to\nhelp bring about a legal and peaceful resolution of the\ndispute. The political and financial leverage of the\ninternational community, as well as the instruments of\npersuasion at its disposal, are also substantial, as\nEthiopia continues to receive lavish development\nassistance from multilateral and bilateral partners. Yet,\nwhile all the ingredients and safeguards of success are\nthere, the danger of failure of the peace process is now\ndistinct due to the failure of the international\ncommunity to take seriously its obligations under this\nagreement and to take effective preventive measures.\nUnless appropriate action is taken now, before the\nsituation explodes, crisis management will be too late\nand will not be worth the effort.\nIn this spirit, the Eritrean delegation appeals to\nthe General Assembly and to the international\ncommunity to take necessary and timely actions to\nensure that peace and security prevail in our region.\nThe obligations of the international community\nare clear, while the measures at its disposal are\nexpressly spelled out in the Algiers Agreement.\nDespite international guarantees, Ethiopia has\nchosen to blatantly violate international law and its\nsolemnly signed treaty obligations. Since\n19 September, when Ethiopia wilfully crossed a red\nline, it has set in motion an irreversible process to\nscuttle altogether the Agreement on Cessation of\nHostilities between the Government of the Federal\nDemocratic Republic of Ethiopia and the Government\nof the State of Eritrea. That is an affront not only to\nEritrea but also to the international community as a\nwhole, and in particular to the United Nations and the\nSecurity Council.\nIn his report (S/2003/257) to the Security Council\nearlier this year, Secretary-General Kofi Annan\nexpressed his concern that the Eritrea-Ethiopia peace\nprocess was \u201cat a critical stage\u201d. The situation can now\nbe considered explosive, paving the way \u2014 as\nEthiopian leaders seem to wish \u2014 to renewed conflict,\nwith its attendant horrific consequences, unless the\ninternational community acts promptly and decisively.\nThe harmful effects of Ethiopia\u2019s lawlessness will\nnot be limited to Eritrea. They will impinge on the\nlegitimacy and credibility of the United Nations and\nmock its core values, if only because they violate the\nhallowed injunction that States, big and small, need to\n20\n\nobserve the basic principles of international law and\nthe sanctity of legal agreements, and to respect the\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of States.\nIn conclusion, the people of Eritrea and Ethiopia\nhave been denied peace for three decades. That has had\na devastating effect on their economies. They deserve\npeace and development, which are now recognized as\nhuman rights. Yet such peace can be guaranteed only\nby respect for the rule of law, the sanctity of\nagreements and the sovereignty and territorial integrity\nestablished by arbitration decisions made on the basis\nof legal agreements. Eritrea has always been, and will\ncontinue to be, committed to such peace. It is now up\nto the international community, and in particular the\nSecurity Council, to uphold those principles and\nvalues. In essence, Ethiopia is no longer in conflict\nwith Eritrea, but with the Charter, which the Security\nCouncil must uphold as it has done in several similar\ncases.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLast\ncentury bore witness to two terrible world wars, in\nwhich over 80 million human beings perished. It later\nseemed that, due to the lessons learned, the United\nNations Organization was born so that war would never\nagain occur. The Charter, adopted in San Francisco\nnearly 60 years ago, proclaimed the purpose of saving\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war'.\nHowever, after that we suffered wars of aggression and\nconquest, colonial wars, border wars and ethnic wars.\nMany peoples were left with no other choice but war to\ndefend their rights. Moreover, in the last 13 years the\nscourge of war has taken another 6 million lives.\nSixty years ago, the world order proclaimed in\nthe United Nations Charter was sustained through the\nmilitary balance of two super-Powers. A bipolar world\nwas born, which generated clashes, divisions, the cold\nwar and almost a devastating nuclear war. It was not\nthe ideal world, far from it. But since one of those\nsuper-Powers has disappeared, the current world is\nworse and more dangerous.\n\nNow world order cannot be held together in the\nspheres of influence of two similar super-Powers or by\nmutual deterrence. What should it be founded on, then?\nOn the honest and generous recognition by the only\nsuper-Power that, far from disturbing it, should\ncontribute to the creation of a peaceful world, with the\nright to justice and development for all.\nDoes the war in Iraq contribute to that objective?\nNo, it does not. Its outcome is just the opposite of the\nideal of preserving peace, strengthening the role of the\nUnited Nations and enhancing multilateralism and\ninternational cooperation. Unfortunately, the truth is\nthat those most able to prevent and remove threats to\npeace are the ones causing war today.\nShould the Government of the United States\nrecognize this truth that almost everyone in this Hall\nshares? Yes. What humiliation or harm would there be\nto the prestige of this great nation? None. The world\nwould recognize that a remedy benefiting all had come\nabout, after the unleashing of a war supported by just a\nfew, either by shortsightedness or by meanness of\ninterests; after it was proven that the pretexts brandished\nwere not true; and after observing the reaction of a people\nwho, as every invaded and occupied people will do,\nhave begun to fight and will continue to fight for\nrespect for their right to self-determination.\n23\n\nTherefore, must the occupation in Iraq cease?\nYes, and the sooner the better. It is a source of new and\nmore serious problems, not of solutions. Must the\nIraqis be left alone to freely establish their own\nGovernment and institutions and make decisions on\ntheir natural resources? Yes. It is their right, and they\nwill not stop fighting for it.\nMust the Security Council be pressured into\nadopting decisions that would further undermine it\nethically and morally? No. That would eliminate the\nlast possibility to profoundly reform, expand and\ndemocratize the Council. The future of the United\nNations will be determined today in the outcome of the\ninternational crisis generated by the war in Iraq.\nThe most critical danger stalking us today is the\npersistence of a world where what prevails is the law of\nthe jungle, the might of the most powerful, the\nprivileges and extravagance of a handful of countries,\nand the dangers of aggression, underdevelopment and\nhopelessness for the vast majority.\nWill a worldwide dictatorship be imposed on our\npeoples, or will the United Nations and multilateralism\nbe preserved? That is the question. We all agree, I believe,\nthat the role of the United Nations is irrelevant today, or at\nleast is on its way to being so. But some of us say so with\nconcern and would like to strengthen the Organization.\nOthers say so with covert satisfaction and encourage\nthe hope of imposing their designs on the world.\nWe must speak frankly. What role does the\nGeneral Assembly play today? In truth, almost none. It\nis merely a debating forum without any true influence\nor practical role whatsoever.\nAre international relations governed by the\npurposes and principles enshrined in the Charter? No.\nWhy now, when philosophy, the arts and science are\nreaching unprecedented levels, is the superiority of\nsome peoples over others once again proclaimed? And\nwhy are other peoples, who should be treated as\nbrothers and sisters, referred to as living in the dark\ncorners of the planet or on the Euro-Atlantic periphery\nof the North Atlantic Treaty Organization? Why do\nsome among us feel entitled to launch a unilateral war,\ngiven the fact that in the Charter we proclaimed that\nmilitary force would only be used to serve the common\ninterest and that collective measures should be taken to\npreserve peace? Why is there no longer any talk about\nusing peaceful means to settle disputes? Can we\nbelieve that everyone is fostering friendship among our\nnations on the basis of respect for the principle of\nequality of rights and the self-determination of\npeoples? Why then has my people had to suffer, and\ncontinue to suffer, from over four decades of\naggression and economic blockade?\nThe principle of the sovereign equality for all\nStates was established when the Charter was adopted.\nAre we in fact equal? Do all Member States enjoy\nsimilar rights? According to the Charter we do, but\naccording to stark reality we do not. Respect for the\nprinciple of the sovereign equality of States, which\nshould be the cornerstone of contemporary\ninternational relations, will only be established if the\nmost powerful countries accept in real terms that they\nmust respect the rights of others, even if those other\ncountries lack the military might and the economic\npower to defend those rights. Are the mightiest and\nmost developed countries ready to respect the rights of\nothers, even if doing so might perhaps slightly restrain\nthe privileges they enjoy? I am afraid that they are not.\nAre the principles of the non-use or the threat of use\nforce, non-interference in the internal affairs of States,\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes, and respect for the\nterritorial integrity and independence of States actually\nin force? According to the language and the spirit of\nthe Charter, they are. But are they really?\nIt is true that a handful of developed countries has\nbenefited from the current situation over the last few\ndecades. But that time is coming to an end. Those\ncountries are also beginning to become victims of the\nimperial policies of a single super-Power. Should they\nnot take into account, with modesty and common sense,\nthe need to work with the over 130 Third World countries\nthat have been compelled to endure this unjust order and\nthat are ready to attempt to persuade the most powerful\ncountry to put aside its arrogance and to comply with\nits duties as a founder of the United Nations?\nCuba believes that we should not, and cannot,\nrelinquish multilateralism; that we should not, and\ncannot, relinquish the United Nations; and that we\ncannot, and should not, relinquish the struggle for a\nworld of peace, justice, equality and development for\nall. Cuba therefore believes that we must achieve three\nimmediate objectives.\nFirst and foremost, we must put an end to the\noccupation of Iraq, hand over real control to the United\nNations immediately and begin the recovery process to\nre-establish Iraq's sovereignty and put in place a\n24\n\nlegitimate Government decided upon by the Iraqi\npeople. In addition, the scandalous distribution of\nIraq's wealth must cease immediately. That will be\nbeneficial for the United States, whose young people\nare dying in Iraq while waging an unjust and inglorious\nwar. It will be beneficial for Iraq, whose people will be\nable to turn over a new page in their history. It will be\nbeneficial for the United Nations, which has also been\na victim of that war. And it will be beneficial for all of\nour countries, which have had to suffer international\neconomic recession and an increase insecurity that is\nthreatening us all.\nSecondly, we must address without delay the\nissue of truly reforming the United Nations and, above\nall, undertake a far-reaching democratization process.\nThe current situation is already untenable, as\nevidenced, first of all, by the Security Council's\nshameful inability to prevent the war in Iraq and,\nsecondly, by its demand on the Government of Israel to\nrefrain from expelling or murdering the leader of the\nPalestinian people   a people who, in accordance with\na decision the Council itself took over five decades\nago, should long ago have had an independent State.\nThat the Government of the United States has exercised\nits veto power on 26 occasions to protect the crimes of\nIsrael is evidence of the fact that that unjust privilege\nmust be abolished.\nWhat is needed is a reform that goes back to the\nroots of the founding of the United Nations; that\nguarantees effective respect for the Charter; and that\nre-establishes the mechanisms of collective security\nand the rule of international law. Reform should also\nensure the ability of the United Nations to preserve\npeace and to lead the fight for general and complete\ndisarmament, including nuclear disarmament, to which\nmany generations have aspired. Reform should also\nrestore to the United Nations its prerogatives to fight\nfor the socio-economic development and the basic\nrights of all the planet's inhabitants, including the\nrights to food and life. Doing so is more necessary than\never before, given that neo-liberalism has spectacularly\nfailed and that a new opportunity now exists for\nestablishing a new system of international economic\nrelations. We need to rescue the role of the United\nNations and to ensure that all States, large and small,\nrespect the Charter. But we do not need a reform that is\ngoing to founder unceremoniously as part of a\nbureaucratic process of adapting what is left of the\nUnited Nations to the interests and whims of a few, rich\nand mighty countries.\nFinally, we need to return to a discussion of the\nserious economic and social problems currently\naffecting the world. We have to make the battle for the\nright of nearly five billion people to development a\npriority. The Millennium Assembly committed us to\nworking for very modest and insufficient goals. But\neverything has now been forgotten, without even a\ndiscussion. Seventeen million children under the age of\n5 will die this year, not as victims of terrorism but as\nvictims of under-nourishment and preventable diseases.\nWill a realistic debate based on solidarity be held in\nthis Hall to discuss how, in line with the Millennium\nDeclaration, to halve by 2015 the number of people,\ncurrently over 1.2 billion in number, who are suffering\nfrom abject poverty, as well as the number who suffer\nfrom hunger, which is more than 800 million? Will\nthere be any discussion about the nearly 900 million\nilliterate adults? Or will the Millennium Declaration\nalso become a dead letter, as has been the case with the\nKyoto Protocol and the decisions of 10 summits held at\nthe level of head of State?\nDeveloped countries will provide Third World\ncountries with $53 billion in official development\nassistance this year. In return, those countries will\ncharge recipients over $350 billion in foreign debt\ninterest; and our foreign debt will have grown by the\nend of the year. Do creditors by any chance believe that\nthat unjust situation will last forever? Should we, as\ndebtors, resign ourselves to being poor forever? Is that\npicture of injustice and peril confronted by most\ncountries what the founders of the United Nations\nreally dreamed of? No. Like us, the founders also\ndreamed that a better world was possible.\nThose are the questions that, with all due respect,\nwe would like some in the Hall to answer for us. I am\nnot talking about Cuba, which, condemned to die for\nwanting to be free, has had to fight on its own, not only\nthinking about itself but also about all the peoples of\nthe world.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIn 2000, at the dawn of\nthe new millennium, the heads of State and\nGovernment of the Member States met here to reaffirm\ntheir shared goals. Three years later, that international\nconsensus has eroded. Member States perceive threats\ndifferently, and they do not share the same priorities.\nSome States emphasize the fight against terrorism and\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In\nother regions in the world, civil wars, small arms,\npoverty, hunger and AIDS are the main dangers.\n21\n\nCan the international community reach a\nconsensus on the objectives to be attained and the way\nto achieve them? What importance should we give to\nmultilateral cooperation? Has the time not come to\nreview the system of collective security inherited from\nthe Second World War? Could it be that the United\nNations is due for far-reaching reform?\nThe fact that so many heads of State and\nGovernment have responded to the Secretary-General's\ninvitation is a preliminary answer. It is an encouraging\nsign. The Member States look to the United Nations to\nseek solutions. We must seize the opportunity of this\ndebate to reaffirm our commitment to multilateral\ncooperation and the goals of the United Nations.\nLife in society demands a minimum of order,\nrules and solidarity. That also applies to international\nrelations. Switzerland attaches great importance to\nrespect for international law, which explains its\ncommitment to humanitarian law or to the International\nCriminal Court. Without international law, many\ncountries would feel themselves at the mercy of the law\nof the mightiest. The great powers, like the smaller\nones, need a multilateral framework to resolve their\ndifferences.\nThe time has come to rethink the role of the\nUnited Nations. Almost 60 years after the foundation\nof the Organization, the threats have changed, as have\nthe geopolitical realities. Terrorism and the\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction have\ntaken on more threatening dimensions. Civil wars have\nmultiplied. AIDS has become the most deadly\nepidemic in the history of humankind. Poverty is far\nfrom being eradicated.\nSecurity can no longer be addressed in purely\nmilitary terms. We need to review our vision of\nsecurity by focusing greater attention on individuals.\nBy broadening our approach to security and by placing\nfresh emphasis on human security, we can overcome\nsome of the current differences between the North and\nthe South.\nTogether with other countries, Switzerland is\nendeavouring to promote the idea of human security.\nThis year it will commit itself to the issues of the\nproliferation of light weapons and anti-personnel\nmines. We hope the General Assembly will establish a\nworking group to develop an instrument for marking\nand tracing small arms. If the Members of the\nOrganization concur, Switzerland is ready to take the\nchair.\nThe Swiss Government also takes an active\ninterest in the issue of migration. We are working with\nother countries to establish a global commission on\ninternational migration, which will be asked to make\nrecommendations.\nIn order to promote human security, we must also\nkeep the promises made in the field of development. In\nthe Millennium Declaration we have undertaken to\nensure that globalization becomes a positive force for\nall humankind. To that end, we have adopted a series of\nclear objectives, and deadlines to meet them have been\nset. But merely proclaiming goals is not enough; we\nmust now fulfil them. If the rich countries   and my\ncountry is among them   do not keep their promises,\nthey will end up causing poor countries to lose hope.\nIn Cancun, the members of the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO) tried to revive trade liberalization.\nAlthough positions converged somewhat,\ndisagreements persist and there is a risk of lasting\nfailure. That would result in weakened growth at the\nglobal level, to the detriment of all countries. We need\nto give negotiations another chance and, above all,\navoid the lure of protectionism.\nTo affirm a belief in the multilateral system\nshould not blind us to its weak points. The United\nNations needs more thorough reform.\nSwitzerland considers that the role of the United\nNations in the economic and social fields must be\ndefined. We must better take account of the links\nbetween international security and economic\ndevelopment. Relations between the United Nations,\nthe Bretton Woods institutions and WTO should also be\nreconsidered by a group of independent eminent\npersons.\nWe must also focus our attention on the\nfunctioning of the Organization itself. In the General\nAssembly, resolutions that are adopted are too often\nreduced to the lowest common denominator or to a\nlong, vague wish list, with no real impact. The\nAssembly must be revitalized. There is a need to\nreduce the number of agenda items, limit the length of\ntexts and avoid the proliferation of resolutions on\nissues that overlap.\nWith regard to the Security Council, a consensus\nalready exists on the fact that its composition no longer\n22\n\nsufficiently reflects contemporary geopolitical realities.\nSwitzerland supports the idea of enlarging the Council.\nThat could be done without harming its effectiveness as\nlong as the increase in the number of members remains\nwithin reasonable bounds and takes into account the\nvarious regional sensibilities.\nIn the last few years, countries not members of\nthe Council have been given more opportunities to\nparticipate in the Council's work. Switzerland\nwelcomes those efforts. However, the crucial decisions\ntoo often remain confined to the restricted circle of the\nfive permanent members. All members of the Security\nCouncil should be permanently involved in the\ndecision-making process. It is also important to\ninstitutionalize the modalities of participation for the\nother Member States. For example, consultation\nmechanisms with those States most directly affected by\nconflict areas should be strengthened. It should be\nnecessary for non-permanent members of the Council\nto feel a greater responsibility to represent the views of\nthose who elected them.\nThe right of veto is a privilege involving special\nresponsibilities. It should be used only in exceptional\ncircumstances. When a permanent member exercises its\nright of veto, would it not be desirable for it then to\nexplain its action to the General Assembly? That way,\nthat member could make its position better understood\nby the international community.\nAnother goal is to open the United Nations to\ncivil society. Switzerland welcomes the decision of the\nSecretary-General to set up a panel of experts to\nconsider the possible ways to achieve that.\nIt is in this spirit of openness towards civil\nsociety that preparations are being carried out for the\nWorld Summit on the Information Society, due to take\nplace in Geneva in December. More than half of the\nworld's population does not have access to a telephone.\nThe use of Internet is even more limited. The goal of\nthe Summit, a part of the larger framework of the\nMillennium Goals, is to discuss ways to narrow the\ndigital divide between the rich and poor countries. New\ntechnologies must be placed at the service of\ndevelopment, human rights and democracy.\nI invite all Member States to participate actively\nin the Summit. Many heads of State and Government\nhave announced their intention to attend, which gives\nme great pleasure. I must address, above all, my\ncolleagues of the industrialized countries: we must\nshoulder our responsibilities. I appeal to them not to\nmiss that important appointment. We need a North-\nSouth dialogue at the highest level. As I have already\nsaid, we must keep our promises.\nIn recent months, Iraq has made visible some\ninternational tensions. We must now search together to\nfind solutions for the future. We all face the same\ndanger: that of Iraq falling prey to disorder and\ninstability. The United Nations must be given its place\nin Iraq and must receive a clearer mandate from the\nSecurity Council. At the same time, determined\nprogress must be made towards restoring Iraqi\nsovereignty.\nIn its national history, Switzerland has a long\ntradition of harmonious coexistence among its different\ncommunities. We well understand that no single\npolitical model fits all situations. Nevertheless,\nSwitzerland is ready to share its experience and to\nprovide support for the process of drawing up a new\nconstitution in Iraq.\nSwitzerland joined the United Nations as a\nneutral country. That does not prevent it from\ndefending the universal values to which it is attached.\nIn this, Switzerland wishes to collaborate with the\nother Member States, drawing on the strength of the\nOrganization. At this point, I would like to pay tribute\nto the United Nations and all its staff, who have just\nsuffered a deadly attack in Baghdad. Every day,\nthroughout the world, the United Nations and its\nspecialized agencies do irreplaceable work.\nThe Secretary-General has spoken of peace as a\ndream in suspense. I believe that this also applies to the\nother ideals for which the United Nations stands:\njustice, solidarity and respect for human dignity.\nDreams are an essential part of the vision of the United\nNations, but so are action, realism, courage and\nperseverance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThis is the first time that I come the house of the\npeoples of the United Nations. This is also a crucial\ntime in history, as it is for the Organization. A few\nyears ago, the international community met in this Hall\nto restructure the agenda for the new millennium. We\nplaced pressing issues and commonalities on that\nagenda, as well as the vision and goals necessary to\nguide our work. In fact, that agenda became our guide\nto ensure international peace and security, democratic\ngovernance and the joining of efforts to combat the\nmost serious scourges afflicting the peoples of the\nworld. That notwithstanding, a condemnable terrorist\nattack changed the course of our common agenda and\nforced all nations of the world to make adjustments to\nthe priorities that had been set. Security then became\nthe key, most pressing and compelling focus of\ncollective action.\nHonduras rejects and condemns terrorism in all\nits forms and manifestations, regardless of where it\ntakes place and regardless of its material and\nintellectual authors. In that regard, our Organization,\nwherein reside the hopes and desires of all the peoples\nof the world, also suffered the backlash of that new\nthreat that sows terror and suffering. From this rostrum,\nI wish to pay tribute to Sergio Vieira de Mello, a victim\nof injustice and fratricidal hatred.\n4\n\nAware of our responsibilities as a member of the\nUnited Nations, Honduras and the Government over\nwhich I preside have fully assumed their commitment\nto the challenges before us. It is for that reason that\nHonduras today is party to a greater number of\ninternational conventions aimed at guaranteeing the\nsecurity of the inhabitants of the planet. Despite our\nmodest resources, we have responded to Security\nCouncil resolutions by sending a clearly humanitarian\nmission, comprised of a contingent from the Honduran\narmed forces, to Iraq in order to contribute to the\nreconstruction, stability and democratization of a\nfriendly people. In the same spirit, Honduras has\nrenewed its commitment to the United Nations Mission\nfor the Referendum in Western Sahara.\nIn addition, along with our sister republics in\nCentral America, we have worked arduously to develop\na plan to prevent and combat terrorism, as well as a\nplan to fight organized crime in all its manifestations. I\nhave also proposed to the heads of State and\nGovernment of Central America timely initiatives to\nincrease the exchange of information and to establish a\nregional regime for arrests that will keep criminals\nfrom enjoying impunity simply by crossing the borders\nof Central America. I am also pleased to report that we\nCentral Americans have moved forward with an agenda\nto ensure adequate limits and a balance in weapons.\nThat will make it possible for us to invest the resources\nfreed up in priority social areas.\nWe have done all of that without forgetting or\nsetting aside the extraordinary declaration of solidarity\nand commitment that we have all undertaken to\neradicate poverty and hunger. Our commitment and\nfocused efforts have been appropriately reflected in the\nHuman Development Report, which was recently\npresented in the Latin American and Caribbean region\nby the United Nations Development Programme\n(UNDP). My Government and people were extremely\nhonoured to have been selected as the site of that\npresentation. It is clear from the UNDP report that,\ncompared to averages in other countries, Honduras has\nbeen able to considerably reduce inequality vis-\u2021-vis its\neconomic growth. In other words, although relatively\nlow, economic growth in Honduras during the reporting\nperiod was rather equitable. We have also made very\nsignificant progress in social spheres and in the area of\ninstitutional reform, and we have benefited from the\nsupport of the United Nations in that regard.\nWe would like to express our gratitude for our\naccess to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis\nand Malaria, which has made it possible to considerably\nincrease our focus on those diseases to historical levels.\nAgain with the support of the Organization, we\nhave greatly expanded our school lunch programme. In\njust 20 months, from an initial figure of 16 per cent, we\nhave succeeded in reaching 80 per cent of the children\nwho were going to school hungry. That programme is\nbeing carried out with the support of the World Food\nProgramme (WFP). It also serves as a model for a WFP\nprogramme that purchases ingredients for town mayors\nand mothers of families that are then used to distribute\nprepared meals. Meal costs in that programme amount\nto $.09 per meal, which means that it costs $18 to feed\na child during 200 school days.\nWe have also achieved considerable progress in\nthe area of institutional reform, thanks to an agreement\nsigned during the last electoral process by all political\nparties in Honduras, under the aegis of the United\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) office in\nHonduras. At the centre of that agreement is the fact\nthat an independent superior court of justice has been\nestablished. In addition, the main State monitoring\nbody is now more independent, electoral bodies are\nbeing made more professional and other reforms of\ngreat importance for democracy are being carried out\nto strengthen the trust of citizens in their institutions.\nThe UNDP has also been involved in our\nprogramme to reduce corruption. We have established\nan aggressive programme to delegate much of the\nState's procurement to UNDP and other non-\ngovernmental organizations in order to ensure honesty\nand avoid the temptation of corruption.\nMy Government has therefore come to this world\nforum with facts testifying to our desire to follow\nthrough with our commitments to reduce inequality and\nexclusion. However, Honduras is also here in the hope\nthat the slow pace of human development in the world\ncan, because it must, be overcome with increased and\nheightened international solidarity. I therefore appeal\nthat the opportunities and benefits of globalization be\nmade more equitable and just for all peoples and nations.\nIn that regard, I should like to refer to the\nOrganization. The United Nations must increasingly be\nthe meeting place for cultures and civilizations.\nCommon effort is essential to achieve the purposes we\nagreed upon in San Francisco, and which we enshrined\n5\n\nin the Charter. We need a more efficient Organization\nto meet the challenges faced by peoples and to be able\nto channel our differences towards the peaceful causes\nwe have agreed upon.\nUndoubtedly, there are pressing situations that\nrequire our attention. The situation in the Middle East\nis of great concern to us. As in other countries, people\nwhose ancestors came from that part of the world live\npeacefully in our country. They, along with all\nHondurans, want peace to be a reality for the Palestinian\nand Jewish peoples, as well as for others in the region.\nHanging by a thread, peace in the Middle East is\nprecarious. It is our clear duty to strengthen that peace.\nWe are also concerned by clashes on the African\ncontinent and by the hotbeds of tension that occasionally\nflare up in Asia, whose consequences, were they to\ndevelop further, could jeopardize the entire world.\nGood sense must always prevail. It is for that\nreason that we look forward to promising results from\nthe negotiating table. Peace in the world is our peace.\nWe are therefore committed to respecting and\npromoting human rights. While respecting human\nrights, Honduras is also committed to combating the\nvarious scourges besetting our societies.\nToday in Honduras we have a very serious\nproblem with juvenile crime, which has reached\nalarming levels that affect all of our citizens. In that\nregard, I would like to highlight one aspect of that\nviolence. A number of years ago, criminal activity led\nto the tragic deaths of a number of young people under\nthe age of 18. Given that tragic situation, my\nGovernment established a presidential commission for\nthe physical and moral protection of young people. It\nalso ordered an investigation of this phenomenon\nwhose results were published in September 2002. In\naddition, we have set up a special unit to investigate\nthe death of minors, which ensures that such\nreprehensible crimes are punished. In that connection,\nHonduras has adopted the recommendations contained\nin the report of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial,\nsummary or arbitrary executions of the Commission on\nHuman Rights, which has already begun to produce\nvery positive results.\nThe time is ripe to categorically reiterate that the\nState of Honduras does not in any way tolerate, accept\nor promote the killing of children and young people.\nWe have committed a considerable amount of our\nlimited resources to mitigate, and if possible eradicate,\nthis affront to human dignity. It is inconceivable for a\nviolent minority to take hostage and threaten the\npeaceful and honest majority. Organized civil society is\nworking on behalf of the majority of Hondurans in that\neffort, and together we are succeeding in reducing the\nlevel of crime in its various forms.\nIn order to deal with that evil   which is closely\nrelated to other forms of international crime, such as\ndrug trafficking and terrorism, whose causes extend far\nbeyond my homeland   my Government requires\nunderstanding and brotherly support from the\ninternational community. We also require that\nunderstanding and support in order that we can reach\nsatisfactory agreements with the International Monetary\nFund, thereby making possible the comprehensive\nimplementation of the Stockholm Agenda for the\nReconstruction and Transformation of Central America.\nForeign debt relief must not continue to be mere words; it\nmust become a reality. With the resources freed up by\ndebt relief, my Government and the Governments to\nfollow will have on hand extremely valuable capital to\ncontinue to combat poverty, illiteracy and HIV/AIDS\nand to meet other goals of the Millennium agenda.\nCooperation and solidarity is an obligation, not\ncharity. It is an assumed commitment. Honduras hopes\nthat greater and immediate efforts will be made so that\nthe percentages agreed upon for cooperation will\nbecome a reality. We also recognize the fact that\nglobalization, and specifically with regard to increased\ninternational trade, holds out the promise of growth for\nour peoples. We are involved in negotiating a free trade\nagreement with the United States and Canada, and will\ndo the same with the European Union and others next\nyear. However, we would ask more developed countries\nto allow our products access to their markets, which\nnow benefit from outdated protection schemes.\nWe also ask for the elimination of agricultural\nsubsidies, as well as for better benefits for our\nproducers, who today receive only a minimal part of\nthe value of the fruits of their labour. I would like to\nrefer to the case of coffee as an example of the lack of\nequity in the added value of basic goods from our\nregion. The recent crisis in the price of coffee beans\nhas led to the unemployment of 600,000 persons in\nCentral America. Over 80,000 small producers, most of\nwhom are poor people from rural regions, carry out\ncoffee production in Honduras. That is an enormous\nadvantage during times when prices are good, because\nit provides a very efficient mechanism for the social\n6\n\ndistribution of income. However, the contrary is true\nnow that prices are at historical lows.\nSix years ago, in 1997, it was estimated that the\ntotal value of the retail coffee market was $30 billion.\nForty per cent of that amount, which is to say, $12\nbillion, was returned to producers. Today that market\nprice has more than doubled, to $65 billion. However,\nproducers are now getting less than half of what they\nhad been getting, namely, $5.5 billion; which means that\nonly 9 per cent of the final market value goes to\nproducers. I wish to reiterate that it is essential that we\nredistribute the benefits of globalization and that we\nincrease solidarity.\nThat situation is not limited to just one of our\nexport products. The actual terms of trade for our main\nexport products conspire against democratic governance,\nbut the Honduran people require, as I have said, clear\nactions to redistribute the benefits of globalization and\nincrease levels of solidarity.\nInternational peace and security require all our\nefforts. The attitude adopted on conflicts is very\nimportant. Hence, Honduras is taking part in two cases\nbefore the International Court of Justice. In both cases,\nHonduras has come forward in peace to seek justice.\nWe are certain that in the case of El Salvador, there\nwill be a positive outcome to the 1992 ruling of the\nCourt. In the case of Nicaragua, we are also certain that\nthe definition the International Court adopts regarding\nour respective maritime claims will be fully respected.\nHonduras has always faithfully and strictly complied\nwith international rulings. Rest assured, Sir, of our firm\ndetermination to respect in both these cases the\ndecisions of the International Court of Justice.\nI cannot leave this rostrum of universal\nconscience without expressing my congratulations to\nyou, Sir, on your election and wishing you every\nsuccess in your sensitive tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI am greatly honoured to\naddress this distinguished gathering of the world's\nleaders at the United Nations, a truly unique global\norganization that is deeply engaged in the promotion of\nhuman values and international peace and stability.\nI would like to thank Mr. Jan Kavan for his\nimportant contribution in the past year as President of\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session and to\ncongratulate Mr. Julian Robert Hunte on his election to\nthe post of President of the General Assembly at the\nfifty-eighth session. I wish him every success in\nexecuting that function of great responsibility.\nOn behalf of all citizens of the Republic of\nMacedonia, I would like to pay special tribute to the\nUnited Nations and Secretary-General Kofi Annan,\nwho delivered an indeed inspiring speech yesterday, for\ntheir relentless dedication and efforts in pursuing the\nrighteous causes of protecting human rights and\nfreedoms and safeguarding prosperity and security in\nthe world.\nWe certainly remember a great person, Mr. Sergio\nVieira de Mello, who paid the highest price for\npursuing the noble role of the United Nations in Iraq.\nWe fully support the goals of the international\ncommunity in Iraq: the achievement of a free and\nsovereign Iraq governed by the people of Iraq for the\npeople of Iraq. However, that sovereignty must be\nbased on democracy, freedom and peaceful existence\nwith its neighbours. To achieve those goals as quickly\nas possible, the United Nations must play a more\ncomprehensive and active role in the transition back to\nIraqi sovereignty. I would also like to take this\noccasion to express our satisfaction with the work\ncarried out by the coalition forces in helping the Iraqi\npeople to rebuild their country after the decades of\ndisasters of Saddam Hussein's despotic regime.\nReforming the United Nations, particularly the\nSecurity Council, and revitalizing the General\nAssembly are of crucial importance to us all. My\nGovernment firmly believes in the need to pursue those\ngoals in a consistent and more efficient way.\nThe Republic of Macedonia strongly believes the\nUnited Nations involvement in various parts of the\nworld will essentially improve the responses of\ndemocratically oriented Governments and reform-\nminded people and will add to the overall level of\nlegitimacy of their actions. It is obvious that we need to\noffer more vocal support to multilateralism when\ndealing with the substantial issues on the international\nagenda to which we are fully committed: the\neradication of poverty, the fight against the scourge of\nHIV/AIDS around the world, conflict prevention and\nthe protection of the environment, among others.\nThe World Summit on the Information Society, to\nbe held in Geneva this year and in Tunis 2005, along\nwith two other summits held last year on financing for\ndevelopment in Monterrey, Mexico, and sustainable\ndevelopment in Johannesburg, can be regarded, in the\ncontext of globalization and the overall development\nprocess, as landmarks of a new approach in dealing\nwith the challenges of today's world. Within the\naforementioned framework, it is essential fully to\nimplement the Millennium Declaration as a key\ndocument for peace, security, sustainable development\nand prosperity.\nThe most serious contemporary threat to\nhumanity is identified and visible. It is the evil of\nterrorism. The fight against terrorism has been and\nmust remain our highest priority. In this regard, it\nwould be immensely helpful to make a commitment to\nreaching a consensus in relation to the remaining\n7\n\ndisputed points in the process of drafting conventions\non international and nuclear terrorism.\nFacing the challenge of the year 2001, we found a\nway out by signing the Framework Agreement that\nbrought vital democratic processes back to our\ninstitutions and re-established and reaffirmed\ndemocratic procedures for addressing internal problems\nof any kind. Today, I am very proud to say that I come\nhere in the same mood I was in three years ago when I\ntook part in the Millennium Summit   full of\noptimism and truly convinced that, after the hard work\nhad been done, strategic issues of our future had been\nsolved, once and for all, upon a broad political, social\nand interethnic consensus. Progress towards a real and\nauthentic integration of all ethnic communities in the\nState structures is significant and has roots in our\ncenturies-old model and tradition of multiculturalism\nand inter-ethnic coexistence.\nIn order to contribute in a constructive way to\ncreating a more positive picture of the region and\nproductive cooperation among nations, the Republic of\nMacedonia launched numerous regional initiatives in\nthe context of integration into the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization and the European Union. In parallel,\nwhile pursuing very ambitious reform agendas, we\nachieved an internal consensus about our foreign policy\npriorities and realized that we will most successfully\nleave behind the poor legacies of our unfortunate past\nby promoting new substantial links among the people\nwho live in South-East Europe.\nA month ago in Ohrid, we held a very successful\nregional forum on dialogue among civilizations,\nattended by numerous heads of State, other leaders and\nscholars from all over the world, who spoke very\nopenly about the importance of having cultural\ninterchange as a permanent basis for the promotion of\ncontinuous dialogue and cohabitation among peoples\nand States. In the message adopted at the forum, all\nparticipants agreed that a thorough and continuous\ncommitment would be needed by all to genuinely\ntransform our region and to defuse once and for all this\npowder keg of Europe.\nThe Republic of Macedonia has built solid\ncooperation with the United Nations Interim\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and\ndeveloped a network of activities aimed at easing\ncommunications and at liberalizing the movement of\npeople from both sides of the border. The Republic of\nMacedonia welcomes the appointment of Harri Holkeri\nas the new Special Representative of the Secretary-\nGeneral and gives him its full support. We are fully\nsupportive of the implementation of Security Council\nresolution 1244 (1999) and the political position\ndeclared by UNMIK calling for the fulfilment of the\nstandards of democracy and the application of the rule\nof law before the onset of negotiations over the final\nstatus of Kosovo. We express our deep concern over\nthe recent upsurge of inter-ethnic violence in Kosovo,\nwhich only undermines the efforts of the international\ncommunity and the Kosovar people to fulfil the set\nstandards.\nIn the Balkans, we are seeing collaboration and\nmutual respect emerging even between yesterday's\nenemies and opposing factions. We are witnessing the\ngradual but steady reconciliation of the nations. Last\nbut not least, important regional initiatives for free\ntrade, trade facilitation and building infrastructure are\nconnecting businesses and binding people in a\nproductive way, which helps to raise awareness of our\ncommon future.\nMy country, the Republic of Macedonia, is an\nindivisible part of these joint regional efforts to\ntransform our part of the continent into a decent place\nto live in. To that end, we will need the understanding\nand concrete support of the rest of the world\ncommunity, which should not neglect the call of\nprogressive people to join efforts to secure liberty. We\nbelieve that the greatness of countries is dependent not\nupon the size of their armies and the number of\nweapons they possess, but upon the commitment and\ndedication of their citizens to the noble ideas of\nhumanity and the legacy of our civilization. In this\ntremendous task of preserving our common treasury\nand of creating a better world for the generations to\ncome, we are more than willing to participate, because\nwe are all equal to each other, while contributing to the\ncommon aim.\nWe are deeply concerned about the escalation of\nviolence in the Middle East. The parties need to\nrecommit themselves to the road map process, because\nit is the only alternative that can bring security and\nstability to Israelis and Palestinians alike. The\ninternational community must step up its activities at\nthis extremely difficult juncture, ensuring that it\nremains on the path of ending terrorism and occupation\nand of establishing the State of Palestine, living side by\nside with the State of Israel in peace and security.\n8\n\nOn disarmament matters, bearing in mind our\nimmediate concerns over the problem of small arms\nand light weapons, the Republic of Macedonia has\nbeen an advocate of strong international action towards\npreventing, combating and eradicating the illicit trade\nin small arms and light weapons, since these pose a\nserious threat not only to the security and stability of\nmy country, but also to the broader region. We\nwelcome the conclusion of the First Biennial Meeting\nof States to Consider the Implementation of the United\nNations Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and\nEradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light\nWeapons in All its Aspects, held in July 2003, that\nprogress had been made worldwide within barely two\nyears of the adoption of the Programme of Action.\nFor the African countries, the main priority at this\nmoment is the fight against HIV/AIDS, a pandemic\nthat is taking a devastating toll on the African\npopulation. The international community must work\nhand in hand with the African Governments to defeat\nthis deadly disease. Africa must also work very hard to\nachieve the strategic goals of the New Partnership for\nAfrica's Development in the areas of peace and\nsecurity, democracy, good governance, poverty\nreduction and sound economic management.\nI sincerely believe that we will find a common\nlanguage with regard to the issue of how to strengthen\nour Organization and maintain its mission of peace,\nprosperity, economic and social justice and human\nrights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We wish him every success\nas he carries out the lofty and important tasks entrusted\nto him by the Member States of the Organization. His\nelection is a testament to the international community\u2019s\nrecognition of the vibrancy and diplomacy of Saint\nLucia \u2014 the President\u2019s very beautiful country \u2014 in\nworking for the ideals of the United Nations. His\nelection is also a tribute to his skills as a diplomat, and\nan illustration of the fact that all countries are treated\nequally at the United Nations, which I welcome and I\nassure the President of the cooperation of my\ndelegation.\nI am also pleased to convey the gratitude of the\ndelegation of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire to Mr. Jan Kavan, President\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session,\nfor the skill and mastery with which he guided the\nAssembly\u2019s work.\nI take this opportunity to once again express to\nthe Secretary-General, the United Nations and the\nbereaved families the sincere condolences of the people\nof C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire on the tragic death of Mr. Sergio\nVieira de Mello, the Secretary-General\u2019s Special\nRepresentative for Iraq, other United Nations staff\nmembers and all other persons killed or wounded in the\nfight for peace and justice.\nI also take this opportunity to reaffirm the\nappreciation of the people and Government of C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire for the work of Secretary-General Kofi Annan,\nwho works tirelessly for peace in the world and in\nAfrica and who makes every effort to lend his personal\nsupport, as well as that of the Organization, to the\nrestoration of peace in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire was once a model of stability and a\nhaven of peace that enjoyed relative economic\nprosperity. However, for almost a decade it experienced\na hidden crisis that led to the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat of\n24 December 1999, followed on 19 September 2002 by\nanother attempted coup d\u2019\u00e9tat that quickly became an\narmed rebellion. It was backed by foreign elements\nwhose aim was to undermine our republican\ninstitutions and the democratically elected\nGovernment. That crisis did enormous harm to the\npopulation of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and to all who had chosen\nto live in our country and to freely carry out their\nactivities there.\nA round table, held upon the initiative of France,\nbrought together the various political forces of C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire, leading to what is now known as the Linas-\nMarcoussis Agreement. The Agreement \u2014 to which\nthe United Nations gave formal international\nrecognition through Security Council resolution 1464\n(2003), after it had been endorsed by heads of State\nand leaders of international institutions meeting at the\nKl\u00e9ber conference centre in Paris \u2014 provides for,\namong other things, the establishment of a Government\nof national reconciliation headed by a consensus Prime\nMinister with the necessary executive powers to\nimplement the Agreement.\nThe Government of National Reconciliation,\nestablished on 13 March 2003, has made significant\nprogress, including the 3 May 2003 signing of a\ncomprehensive ceasefire agreement between the Forces\narm\u00e9es nationales de C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire (FANCI) and the\nForces nouvelles \u2014 the former armed rebellion; the\nestablishment of a consensus national disarmament,\n21\n\ndemobilization and reintegration (DDR) programme;\nthe normalization of relations between C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\nand its neighbours, including the reopening of rail\nservice from Abidjan to Ouagadougou; the 4 July 2003\njoint declaration by the two parties of an end to\nhostilities; and, above all, the passing of an amnesty\nlaw on 6 August 2003. It should be pointed out that\nthat law does not provide amnesty for common crimes\nand offences, including crimes related to violations of\nhuman rights, which must be investigated.\nWith regard to human rights, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire,\ndespite the severe crisis it is experiencing, has\nconstantly placed respect for the human person at the\ncentre of its concerns. In addition, despite its meagre\nfinancial capacity, it has been tireless in pursuing its\noriginal policy of welcoming refugees, whose numbers\nhave increased due to the crisis in neighbouring\nLiberia. Increased financial support from the\ninternational community is needed to share that heavy\nburden. My country must simultaneously guarantee the\nrepatriation of the many Ivorian refugees in a number\nof neighbouring countries.\nHere, I am pleased to mention that C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\nhas ratified all instruments relative to the protection\nand promotion of human rights and, on 5 August\n2002 \u2014 even before the crisis had occurred \u2014 created\na Ministry devoted exclusively to human rights.\nMoreover, in view of massive human rights violations,\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire formally requested on 5 November 2002\nthat an impartial United Nations fact-finding mission\nbe sent to verify such violations throughout its territory\nin order to combat impunity.\nThus, after having at the same time consulted the\nAfrican Commission on Human and People\u2019s Rights \u2014\nwhose first high-level fact-finding mission had already\nvisited C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire in April 2003, following the\nUnited Nations mission dispatched by the Secretary-\nGeneral at the request of the President of the\nRepublic \u2014 C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, in order to demonstrate its\nfull cooperation with the various mechanisms of the\nCommission on Human and People\u2019s Rights, hastened\nto ensure positive follow-up with proposed dates for\nvisits by the following: the Special Rapporteur of the\nUnited Nations Secretary-General on Internally\nDisplaced Persons and by the Special Rapporteurs of\nthe Commission on Human Rights on Contemporary\nForms of Racism and Racial Discrimination; on\nXenophobia and Related Intolerance; on the Right to\nFreedom of Opinion; on the Human Rights of\nMigrants; and, recently, on the Use of Mercenaries.\nThe fact that it is temporarily impossible for our\nAdministration and for the Special Rapporteurs to\ntravel throughout the territory to verify the facts \u2014\ntogether with the cries of distress of the people in those\nareas \u2014 is a challenge to the international community.\nI must commend the international community\u2019s firm\ncommitment and immense efforts to extricate C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire from this crisis.\nComing back to the progress achieved on the path\nto peace, I am pleased to note the 12 September 2003\nappointment, after long and difficult negotiations, of\nthe Ministers of Defence and of Security, which paves\nthe way for implementation of the national programme\nof disarmament, demobilization and reintegration\n(DDR) established by the Government of National\nReconciliation. To that end, a disarmament committee\nand another committee responsible for reunification\nhave been established. In those ways, the Government\nintends to show its resolve to work for a return to\npeace.\nHowever, despite such encouraging results, we\nmust acknowledge that the path of peace is fraught\nwith pitfalls. The current difficulties prove that the\nprocess of peace and national reconciliation remains\nfragile. Still, the inter-Ivorian dialogue is continuing,\nand all of the forces recognize that the Linas-\nMarcoussis Agreement is the only solution providing a\nway out of the Ivorian crisis.\nIn that connection, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire welcomes the\nfirm commitment of the United States to Liberia in\nsupporting the efforts of the Economic Community of\nWest African States (ECOWAS) to help that fraternal\ncountry exorcise the demons of war and division. In\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, as in Liberia, the DDR programme\nremains of paramount importance to that end. Indeed,\nthe Government attaches particular importance to the\nDDR programme, which, by re-establishing security\nand restoring territorial integrity, will enable C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire to organize transparent and fair elections in\n2005, under international supervision.\nOn behalf of the Ivorian Government, I should\nlike to take advantage of this rostrum once again to\nthank the international community \u2014 particularly the\nheads of State of the ECOWAS countries and the\nPresident and the Government of France \u2014 for its\nunwavering support for the peace effort in C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire.\n22\n\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire remains concerned about the\ninternational situation and the problems afflicting it,\nincluding the current pandemics of HIV/AIDS, malaria\nand tuberculosis; armed conflicts; disarmament;\nterrorism; and comprehensive human development.\nIndeed, we note that, although HIV/AIDS affects 20\nmillion people in Africa \u2014 two thirds of those infected\nworldwide \u2014 malaria continues to have at least an\nequal effect on the continent\u2019s mortality rate. To make\nmatters even worse, tuberculosis is showing signs of a\ndisturbing resurgence.\nThe establishment of the United Nations Global\nFund to fight these three pandemics \u2014 amounting to\n$10.4 million \u2014 therefore provides genuine grounds\nfor encouragement and hope for affected populations,\nparticularly in countries of the third world. However,\nwe hope that the Fund\u2019s endowment will increase and\nthat it will swiftly become operational and more easily\naccessible to countries that are already hard hit by\nthese scourges and that \u2014 ironically enough \u2014 are\nalso the chief theatres of armed conflicts.\nIt is paradoxical to note that such conflicts are\nincreasing in number, frequency and intensity \u2014\nparticularly in Africa \u2014 even as the modes and\nmodalities for their management by the United Nations\nand by regional and subregional organizations are\nbeing strengthened, diversified and improved. C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire therefore congratulates the Organization and\nits dedicated Secretary-General, as well as regional\ncountries and organizations, on the results already\nachieved in Sierra Leone, Guinea-Bissau, C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire, Liberia and the Great Lakes region, to cite\njust the most recent cases. Those results encourage all\nthe parties concerned to persevere in the effort to re-\nestablish and consolidate peace in all these war-torn\nareas.\nConcerning the situations in Iraq and in\nAfghanistan, my country hopes for a swift return to\npeace and security so that their respective peoples \u2014\nwho have suffered much over the past decade \u2014 will\nbe able to devote their efforts to economic and social\nprogress.\nIn the Middle East, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire appeals for\nmoderation on both sides and for compliance with the\nroad map, which is the way back to peace in that part\nof the world.\nIn any event, law must always prevail over\nviolence, and dialogue \u2014 under the aegis of the\ninternational community \u2014 must always be the\nfavoured tool for resolving disputes.\nConflicts are the work of, inter alia, armed gangs,\nthe unemployed, the marginalized and deserters who\nfeed the flourishing market for mercenaries in Africa in\ngeneral and in our subregion in particular.\nMercenarism, together with the proliferation of and\nillicit trade in small arms and light weapons, is a\ndangerous threat to the peace and stability of our\ncountries. Those scourges \u2014 along with terrorism,\nwhich sadly continues to claim its victims \u2014 demand\nspecial attention from the international community.\nThe Assembly must undertake concrete measures\nin the fight against these destabilizing factors in the\nworld, particularly in Africa. The implementation of\nthe Programme of Action of the United Nations\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\nLight Weapons in All Its Aspects \u2014 whose review last\nJuly revealed an increasing universal awareness of the\ndanger of proliferation and the need to take coordinated\nactions to control it \u2014 will be an important step\nforward if we have the necessary political will. The\nmeasures undertaken at the regional and subregional\nlevels \u2014 particularly the ECOWAS Moratorium and\nthe assistance provided by the Programme for\nCoordination and Assistance for Security and\nDevelopment in Africa and by other entities \u2014 are\nelements leading in the right direction.\nLikewise, the Assembly should activate and give\nfresh impetus to regional and international convention\nand encourage the standardization of legislation to\neffectively fight the phenomenon of mercenarism. C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire endorses the proposal to draw up and establish\n\u2014 within the framework of ECOWAS \u2014 a general\nplan for stabilization in the subregion, which, I am\nconvinced, would contribute to a return to lasting peace\nand stability in West Africa.\nPreventive action must also be taken at several\nlevels. At the political and diplomatic level, the\ninternational community should devote greater\nattention to preventive diplomacy, because it is\nessential that the outbreak of conflict be prevented\nthrough an early-warning system. At the economic and\nsocial level, the fight against poverty must be\ncontinued, particularly by integrating the unemployed\nand other marginalized people into economic\nstructures.\n23\n\nAt the cultural level, education for peace,\nexpanding sporting and cultural exchanges, meetings\namong groups of women and young people, at the level\nof each State and among the various countries, can\npromote tolerance and mutual understanding among\npeoples in the context of a dialogue among\ncivilizations.\nThe globalization of the economy may be a factor\nfor progress by favouring competitiveness, bringing to\nthe market the best products at the most competitive\nprices. Sadly, such globalization could also impede the\ndevelopment of poor countries, which suffer from\nfluctuations in the price of their products on the\ninternational market and, moreover, must cope with\nunfair competition imposed by States that subsidize\ntheir export items.\nGiven these mixed results, the recent Ministerial\nConference of the World Trade Organization in Canc\u00fan\nhelped to gauge the magnitude of the ruinous\nconsequences for African farmers of the subsidies\ngiven to producers in the North. By breaking the rules\nof free competition, the industrialized countries have\nenabled the richest producers to thrive while\nimpoverishing those that are struggling for survival.\nThis dire situation should cause us to examine our\nconscience so that together we may seek ways and\nmeans to redress this injustice.\nThere is also an urgent need to take action to\nstabilize commodity prices at a profitable rate.\nIf poor countries are to escape the vicious circle\nof poverty, there must be fair remuneration for the\nwork of their farmers, complemented by an increase in\nofficial development assistance, which should reach 0.7\nper cent of the gross national product of industrialized\ncountries, and by debt cancellation.\nLet us take the opportunity of the present session\nto reflect together on ways to strengthen North-South\ncooperation in the framework of the New Partnership\nfor Africa\u2019s Development. In the framework of South-\nSouth cooperation, the most advanced countries should\nplan to increase trade and technology transfers to\nbenefit less advantaged countries, in support of their\nown efforts.\nWe are concerned about the coordinated follow-\nup to the outcome of the major international\nconferences held under United Nations auspices. The\nfight against poverty cannot be won unless the\nrecommendations adopted in the framework of those\nsummits are implemented. It is no good expanding the\nforums for discussion if the conclusions concerning\nfinancing for development or technology transfer, in\nparticular, cannot be implemented and used on the\nground in a new spirit of genuine solidarity.\nMy country, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, fervently wishes to\nsee the advent of the new spirit of solidarity called for\nby globalization and the interdependence of our States,\nand also supports reform of the United Nations to make\nit democratic and efficient.\nMay we all have the wisdom to ensure that our\nresources and intelligence are put to the service of the\nbuilding of a better world, where peace, solidarity and\njustice reign \u2014 a world that reflects the ideals of the\nCharter of the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I have no doubt that, under his able\nstewardship, we will be able to achieve a great deal\nduring this important session. I should also like to\nthank Mr. Jan Kavan for his dedication and hard work\nduring the last session.\nThe past year has witnessed the fall of a decades-\nlong dictatorship in Iraq. The Iraqi people have\nregained their freedom and are now embarking upon\nthe arduous process of rebuilding their nation.\nHowever, the auspicious political changes brought on\nin Iraq will hold real meaning for the Iraqi people and\nthe regional order only once they are able to enjoy the\nsocial economic benefits of a broadly based functional\ndemocratic Government. To that end, the Republic of\nKorea is now playing its part in the process of\nrehabilitation and reconstruction.\n38\n \nThe situation in today's Iraq is, however, less\nthan promising. The recent surge of terror and chaos\nhas served as a sobering reminder that winning the war\ndoes not necessarily mean winning peace.\nAs the terrorist attack against the United Nations\nheadquarters in Baghdad last month so vividly\ndemonstrated, the prevalence of violence and terrorism\nposes the most pressing challenge that Iraq has to\novercome in building a democratic, peaceful and\nprosperous nation. The Republic of Korea strongly\ncondemns the atrocious act of terrorism against United\nNations personnel who came to Iraq for the sole\npurpose of assisting the Iraqi people.\nWe recommend that the Secretary-General take\nthe necessary steps to ensure the safety and security of\nthe United Nations and its associated personnel, as well\nas international humanitarian workers in Iraq, as they\ncarry out their noble duties.\nDespite the persistence of conflict and turmoil,\nthe international community has continued during the\npast year to make progress in strengthening the\nuniversal values of human rights and democracy. The\nspread of universal values in turn strengthens the\nfoundation for peace and prosperity around the world.\nHowever, a world in which all peoples enjoy their\nfull rights and dignity is far from being a reality. We\nneed to make concerted efforts to promote human\ndignity as the guiding precept of the world community.\nThe Republic of Korea remains firmly committed\nto international efforts to advance democracy around\nthe world. In this vein, Seoul hosted the Second\nMinisterial Conference of the Community of\nDemocracies in November last year, as well as the\nThird Global Forum on Fighting Corruption and\nSafeguarding Integrity in May this year. We will\ncontinue to actively participate in efforts to promote\nhuman rights, the rule of law and good governance.\nThe challenges facing us include fighting poverty\nand achieving sustainable development. Poverty\nundermines human dignity. It provides fertile ground\nfor conflict and dictatorship. The need for international\ncooperation in this area has never been greater.\nIt is therefore tremendously important to achieve\nthe goals set at last year's International Conference on\nFinancing for Development and the World Summit on\nSustainable Development. The international community\nmust exercise collective wisdom to attain tangible results\nin working toward these goals.\nIn recent years, the growing number of people\nmoving freely across borders has alerted us to the\nincreasing threats to public health. As demonstrated by\nthe Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome epidemic,\ninfectious diseases have become a global issue from\nwhich no country is immune. It is timely and fitting\nthat a high-level meeting was held earlier this week on\nthe follow-up to the outcome of the twenty-sixth\nspecial session of the General Assembly on HIV/AIDS.\nIn our common fight against infectious diseases, I\nwould like to call your attention to the International\nVaccine Institute, which has been headquartered in\nSeoul since 1997. This unique international\norganization, devoted to the development of new\nvaccines needed in developing countries, awaits the\nsupport of the international community as it continues\nto expand its activities to promote public health for the\nless privileged of the world.\nOn the global security front, the proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction (WMD) and its\npotentially devastating linkage to terrorism loom as a\ngrave and perilous threat. The global nuclear non-\nproliferation regime based on the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty (NPT) currently faces\nunprecedented challenges.\nHow we deal with these challenges will have a\ndecisive bearing on the future of not only the non-\nproliferation regime, but also the international security\nenvironment as a whole. Recent cases have proven that\nthe existing nuclear non-proliferation regime has\ninherent limitations when it comes to dealing with\ndetermined proliferators.\nWhile reiterating the importance of achieving the\nuniversality of the NPT and strengthening the\nsafeguards system through universal adherence to the\nAdditional Protocol to the Safeguards Agreements of\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), we\nunderscore the need to close the loopholes in the\ncurrent regime.\nIn this regard, we stress the vital role of bilateral,\nmultilateral and regional approaches among countries\nsharing common security interests in the reinforcement\nand supplementing of the NPT. The role of export control\narrangements among potential suppliers of relevant\ncomponents and technologies for WMD is also crucial.\n39\n \nTo that end, my Government hosted a plenary\nmeeting of the Nuclear Suppliers Group last May and\nwill also host a plenary meeting of the Missile\nTechnology Control Regime next year.\nWe further believe that the nuclear-weapon States\ncan do a great service to the cause of non-proliferation\nby complying with their share of the nuclear\ndisarmament obligations under the NPT and by\nworking harder to achieve the early entry into force of\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\nThe security of North-East Asia is currently\nthreatened by the possibility of the proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction. The Democratic People's\nRepublic of Korea's nuclear programme not only poses\na direct challenge to the security of the Korean\npeninsula, but also endangers peace and stability in\nNorth-East Asia and beyond. The Republic of Korea is\nstrongly committed to the denuclearization of the\nKorean peninsula, and our position on the nuclear issue\nin the Democratic People's Republic of Korea remains\nclear and consistent.\nFirst, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea\nmust dismantle its nuclear programme in a complete,\nirreversible and verifiable manner. Secondly, the\nnuclear issue with the Democratic People's Republic of\nKorea must be resolved in a peaceful and diplomatic\nmanner.\nThe heightening of military tension on the Korean\npeninsula will be detrimental to all of the countries in\nthe region. Fifty years after the end of the Korean War,\nour people still feel the pain. We must not allow such a\ntragedy ever to be repeated.\nBy opting to combine efforts to resolve this\nmatter peacefully and diplomatically, the international\ncommunity has shown great wisdom in dealing with\nthis pressing and important matter. These efforts were\nculminated in the six-party talks held in Beijing last\nmonth.\nGiven the complexity of the issue, the multilateral\ntalks were significant, in that all participants were able\nto reach consensus on certain principles that will guide\ntheir future discussions.\nAmong these principles my Government\nwelcomes, in particular, the consensus on the necessity\nof both the de-nuclearization of the peninsula and a\npeaceful resolution through dialogue.\nThe tasks ahead will be to maintain the\nmomentum of dialogue and to refine these agreed\nprinciples in greater detail. There will indeed be\ndifficulties in bridging the differences at future talks.\nTo overcome these obstacles a spirit of cooperation\nmust prevail, and any action that may aggravate the\nsituation must be avoided.\nThe success of the six-party talks would not only\nbring the resolution of the nuclear issue regarding the\nDemocratic People's Republic of Korea, but should\nalso lead to the process of creating a durable peace on\nthe Korean peninsula.\nMore than 10 years after the end of the cold war,\nthe peninsula remains the last theatre of the cold war,\nwith 1.5 million heavily armed troops still pointing\nguns across the demilitarized zone (DMZ) that\nseparates the Republic of Korea in the south and the\nDemocratic People's Republic of Korea in the north. It\nis time for this 50-year stand-off to give way to\nreconciliation and cooperation. This process should be\ncautiously managed and occur peacefully and gradually.\nIn this regard, I would like to draw on lessons\nfrom the history of Europe that could be helpful in\ndefining the future of inter-Korean relations. As we all\nknow, in the century leading up to the Second World\nWar, relations between France and Germany were\ncharacterized by the hostilities and confrontation of\nthree major wars.\nAfter the Second World War, however, the\ncountries of Europe joined forces to help the two rivals\nsettle their differences and to pursue peace and\ncommon prosperity through a network of economic\ninterdependence.\nThanks to the vision of Jean Monnet and Robert\nSchuman, the European Coal and Steel Community\ncame into being and has since developed and expanded\nto become the unprecedented, multilateral institution of\nintegration known today as the European Union.\nTo be sure, the case of the Korean Peninsula is\ndifferent from that of Europe. Nevertheless, as in the\ncase of Europe, I believe that a resolution to the\npolitical conflict between the two sides of Korea could\nbe facilitated by economic interdependence.\nPresident Roh Moo-hyun's policy toward the\nNorth, aptly termed the policy for peace and prosperity,\nis directly aimed at resolving the political confrontation\nbetween the South and North through the deepening of\n40\n \ninter-Korean economic interdependence and with the\ncooperation of the international community.\nHowever, the nuclear programme of the\nDemocratic People's Republic of Korea has emerged as\nthe most serious challenge to the process of\nconsolidating peace and prosperity on the Korean\nPeninsula. We in the Republic of Korea sincerely hope\nthat the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will\nrealize that it simply cannot achieve economic\nprosperity without fully abandoning its intentions to\ndevelop nuclear weapons.\nWe note that all participants at the Beijing six-\nparty talks acknowledged the need to address the\nsecurity concerns of the Democratic People's Republic\nof Korea, and we ask the Democratic People's\nRepublic of Korea to make a wise and far-reaching\ndecision in this regard. We strongly hope that the\nsecurity concerns of the North, along with the nuclear\nissue, will be dealt with in more detail at the next six-\nparty talks.\nOnce the Democratic People's Republic of Korea\nabandons its nuclear weapon programme and seizes the\nopportunity offered by the six-party talks to embark on\na path towards peace and prosperity, my Government\nwill take further steps towards bold inter-Korean\neconomic cooperation.\nThe international community will also provide\nnecessary humanitarian and economic assistance. The\npositive impact of such cooperation and assistance will\nresound not only on the Peninsula but throughout the\nregion and beyond.\nIn conclusion, the abandonment by the Democratic\nPeople's Republic of Korea of its nuclear programme\nthrough the six-party talks and the subsequent start of\nthe peace process on the Korean Peninsula will present\nan unprecedented opportunity to dramatically enhance\ninternational relations in East Asia.\nIn this regard, we look forward to the support of\nall Member States of the United Nations for the success\nof the six-party talks and the establishment of a lasting\npeace on the Korean Peninsula.\nThe United Nations has much work to do in the\ntwenty-first century. The global body is our greatest\nhope in our common efforts to make the world safer\nand more prosperous, for us and for future generations.\nI sincerely hope to see the United Nations renew itself\nand achieve its goals through continuous reform that\nwill make it more effective and democratic. The\nRepublic of Korea pledges its abiding support to the\nwork of the United Nations in its noble mission for\nmankind as a whole.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like to\ncongratulate Mr. Julian Hunte, the Foreign Minister of\nSaint Lucia, on his election as the new President of the\nGeneral Assembly. Singapore is delighted that a fellow\nsmall island State and member of the Forum of Small\nStates holds that office.\nI also join others in paying a tribute to United\nNations personnel who have fallen victim to violence\nor attacks, including a special tribute to the late\nSergio Vieira de Mello. The terrorist attack that caused\nhis death has outraged the entire civilized world.\nSergio dedicated his life, and ultimately gave his life,\nin the service of the United Nations. He is mourned and\nmissed by his many friends around the world. We can\nbest honour his memory by reaffirming our\ncommitment to the ideals that he served.\nThe run-up to the war in Iraq saw a heated debate\nabout the role of the United Nations. The United\nNations is, of course, no stranger to controversy, but\nthat debate was notable for being framed in particularly\nstark terms. The rhetoric was inflamed and inflated. It\nhas been variously asserted, with glee or gloom, that\nthe United Nations was irrelevant or irreplaceable, a\nthreat to national sovereignty, the sole source of\ninternational legitimacy, merely a tool of the remaining\nsuper-Power, or the only way to restrain that super-\nPower. There are indeed serious issues that require\ndebate, but the simplistic manner in which that debate\nwas framed \u2014 in particular the portrayal of a struggle\nbetween unilateralism and multilateralism \u2014 is, in my\nview, unhelpful. Unfortunately, that rhetoric has\nobscured, rather than clarified, the issue. It has\noversimplified the debate and glossed over the more\ncomplex reality. The danger is that we may believe in\nthe rhetoric and arrive at wrong conclusions about the\nrelevance, or irrelevance, of the United Nations. I am\ntherefore joining that debate with some trepidation, and\nI do so only to highlight some of the complexities, in\nthe hope that it will contribute to a more balanced\nappraisal of the United Nations. I shall start by\nrestating some basics.\nIn the 58 years since its formation, the influence\nand role of the United Nations in world affairs has\nalways flowed and ebbed in accordance with shifting\ngeopolitical tides. The role of the United Nations has\nbeen indispensable on some crucial international\nissues; on other occasions the United Nations has had\nno role, or only a marginal role. If that meant that the\nUnited Nations was irrelevant, then it was irrelevant\nlong before the recent war in Iraq. The ability of the\nUnited Nations to act and the kinds of actions it took\nhave always been contingent on how States, and in\n30\n\nparticular the permanent members of the Security\nCouncil, perceived whether the United Nations served\ntheir interests. But the United Nations and the United\nNations system have always endured.\nNeither the variable fortunes nor the survival of\nthe United Nations should surprise anyone. The United\nNations functions in an international system consisting\nof sovereign States. Multilateralism and unilateralism\nwere never mutually exclusive alternatives; they are\ndifferent options in every State\u2019s menu of policy\nchoices. Few States, large or small, would agree to\nentrust their security or other vital national interests\nentirely to a multilateral institution. On the other hand,\nno State, however powerful, can always succeed in\nachieving its objectives without the help of others.\nEvery State will choose the option that serves its\ninterest best.\nFurthermore, the United Nations as a total system\nis bigger than the General Assembly and the Security\nCouncil. As we debate the future of international\norganizations we should not forget that the world has\nnever been more interdependent, and therefore more in\nneed of global governance. The United Nations now\nhas more than 190 Members and has never been closer\nto the ideal of universal participation. There has never\nbeen a period in world history when there have been\nmore international legal regimes and norms regulating\nState behaviour. The Secretariat is the depository for\nover 500 international treaties covering the entire\nspectrum of global activities.\nInternational legal regimes and norms are\nimperfect in their efficiency and observance. Some\ninternational norms are hotly contested. Still, the\nconduct of international relations today does not take\nplace in a vacuum, but within that framework of laws,\nrules, standards and norms. Nevertheless, there is no\nescaping the fact that the maintenance of international\npeace and security is first among the purposes of the\nUnited Nations, and the most contested and\ncontroversial of its roles. It is also the focus of the\ncurrent debate over Iraq. It is here that the rhetorical\nexaggerations I mentioned earlier stand most in the\nway of clear and rational thinking about the strengths\nand limitations of the United Nations.\nTraditional international law recognizes only two\ngrounds for the use of force: self-defence under\nArticle 51 of the Charter and authorization by the\nSecurity Council. That seeming clarity is deceptive.\nEven before the latest Iraq war, traditional\ninterpretations of the Charter had been questioned. The\ndoctrine of self-defence has long been the subject of\nlearned debate. The current controversy over the right\nto pre-emption is only the latest manifestation. The\ndoctrine of humanitarian intervention \u2014 or\n\u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d \u2014 so boldly brought to the\nfore by Secretary-General Kofi Annan, has for several\ndecades challenged the conventional concepts of non-\nintervention and the sovereign equality of States.\nAnother challenge to traditional approaches has\nbeen the threat posed by non-State actors, especially\nthe contemporary menace posed by perpetrators of\ninternational terrorism. The problem posed by rebel\ngroups in civil conflicts is another example.\nIn its efforts to respond to egregious violations of\nhuman rights, starvation, anarchy and chaos, the\nSecurity Council had already stretched both the\nauthority of the United Nations to intervene and the\ndefinition of \u201cthreats to the peace\u201d and \u201caggression\u201d.\nThe war in Iraq was not the first time, and will not be\nthe last time, that the Security Council was unable to\nact. The hope of the late 1980s and early 1990s that the\nend of the cold war would at last enable the Security\nCouncil to discharge its primary responsibility for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security has\nlong been shattered.\nIn retrospect, Iraq\u2019s invasion and annexation of\nKuwait in 1990 represented an unusually clear-cut\nviolation of fundamental Charter principles. That\ngreatly eased the task of securing Security Council\nauthorization for military action.\nBut the consensus on Iraq was short-lived. By\n1994, France and Russia began to call for a road map\nfor the lifting of sanctions. By 1998, the withdrawal of\nthe United Nations Special Commission and Operation\nDesert Fox marked the end of the Security Council\u2019s\nconsensus on Iraq. Thereafter the Security Council\nacted in accordance with a complex balance of\nprinciples and national interests, resulting in\ninconsistent and incoherent decisions. In the oil-for-\nfood debates humanitarian concerns about the\nconsequences of sanctions were mixed with the\ncommercial and business interests of some of the\npermanent members.\nThat did not, however, make the Security Council\nirrelevant. It merely meant that the Council served as a\nforum for managing competing interests, an important\n31\n\nrole that it has played for all its history. After all, while\nSecurity Council resolutions have the force of law, they\nare, at the end of the day, first and foremost political\ndocuments indicating the degree of consensus that can\nbe achieved among its most powerful members at any\none time.\nI do not think that it is self-evident that the 2002-\n2003 clash of interests over Iraq was qualitatively\ndifferent from the differences between the permanent\nmembers during the previous decade. I do not think\nthat the disagreement over Iraq has permanently\ndamaged the United Nations.\nThe 2002-2003 crisis over Iraq in the Security\nCouncil only underscored what we have known all\nalong, namely, that the Security Council can authorize\nintervention only when the permanent members are in\nagreement, and that all States, big and small, will do\nwhat they must to protect their vital national interests.\nThis is not the occasion to revisit old debates over\nwhether the war in Iraq was authorized on the basis of\na continuity of authority from 1990 to 2003. Certainly,\nas resolution 1441 (2002) recognized, Iraq had been in\nmaterial breach of several resolutions. My point is that,\nwhatever its eventual outcome, the intense diplomatic\neffort to secure another explicit resolution for the use\nof force was itself testimony to the importance attached\nby all to the Security Council\u2019s legitimizing role. In\nMay, only weeks after a formal end to major combat\noperations was declared, resolution 1483 (2003) was\nadopted without any dissenting vote, recognizing that\nthe United Nations had a significant role in post-war\nIraq.\nMore balanced views are now beginning to\nemerge, albeit still tainted by the bitterness of the\ndebates in the run-up to the war. It will be some time\nbefore consensus can be reached on the role of the\nUnited Nations in post-war Iraq. Some are loath to\ngrant ex post facto legitimization of military action. At\nthe same time, there is reluctance to cede power won\nwith blood. But the legitimacy that the United Nations\nbrings is unique.\nThe debate on the role of the United Nations will\ncontinue. It can, and should, go on. But that does not\nmean that the United Nations should be in paralysis.\nWe must at the same time press on with our\ncommitment to fulfil the fundamental purposes of the\nUnited Nations, which, as stated in the Charter, are \u201cTo\nmaintain international peace and security\u201d, \u201cTo develop\nfriendly relations among nations\u201d and \u201cTo achieve\ninternational cooperation\u201d.\nThe starting point for that effort must be\nacceptance of the fact that, while the United Nations\nstands for ideals that we must never relinquish, the\nreality is that the United Nations both reflects and\nshapes geopolitics. Underlying the debates in the run-\nup to the war, and still infusing the controversies, is\nacute uneasiness over the distribution of power in the\npost-cold war international system. But can the United\nNations escape that reality? The fact is that the United\nNations can operate only on the basis of a hard-headed\nappreciation of the realities of power. If we allow\nexaggerated rhetoric about the role of the United\nNations to obscure that fact, then we do the United\nNations a disservice.\nThe Charter of the United Nations has remained\nessentially unchanged since 1945. But it has been\ncontinuously interpreted and re-interpreted to meet\nchanging geopolitical circumstances and new\nchallenges, many of which were unforeseen by the\nfounders of the United Nations.\nToday we are again faced with radically new\nthreats, not least of which are the global terrorist\nnetworks that respect neither national boundaries nor\ntraditional international law. Clearly, the United\nNations needs to fashion new and more flexible rules to\ndeal with these new threats. Yet, at the same time, we\nmust continue to ensure that there are adequate\nsafeguards to prevent abuse or a return to the law of the\njungle.\nFinding the right balance between those equally\nurgent imperatives will not be easy. But it is not\nimpossible, if we can find the discipline to debate the\nissues openly and realistically, with a clear\nappreciation of both the limitations and potential of the\nUnited Nations.\nRecent events in Iraq have shown that the United\nStates needs the United Nations. It is also a fact that\nthe United Nations needs the United States. Since there\nis a convergence of interests for the two to cooperate in\norder to achieve our shared interests and objectives, it\nis surely not impossible for us to negotiate and agree\nupon a new paradigm of cooperation between the\nworld\u2019s sole super-Power and the world\u2019s only, and\nindispensable, United Nations.\n32\n\nThe United Nations is not a panacea for all the\nworld\u2019s ills. Neither is the United Nations a global\nvillain. The United Nations is a political institution.\nPolitics, as is often said, is the art of the possible.\nThere is no need, therefore, to succumb to despair or\ncynicism. We should turn the page and move on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI am pleased to take this\nopportunity to address the General Assembly. In the\npast year both Kenya and the United Nations have been\nstruck by terrorism. On behalf of my delegation, I wish\nto convey to the Secretary-General, through you,\nMr. President, our profound condolences following the\nheartless and senseless attack on United Nations\npremises in Baghdad last August. Several United\nNations personnel, including Mr. Sergio Vieira de\nMello, the Secretary-General\u2019s Special Representative\nin Iraq, lost their lives during this attack. Mr. Vieira de\nMello \u2014 an elegant, highly intelligent man \u2014 was a\ncalm voice of reason in a sea of troubles. As an\nassembly of nations, we may have lost his voice, but\nwe should not lose sight of his vision and hopes.\nTerrorism has become a disturbing trend. We who\nlive in Kenya know this all too well, as we do not have\nthe option of ignoring the threat of terror. The people\nof Kenya have been targeted by terrorists on two\nrecent, separate occasions \u2014 in 1998 and in 2002.\nAfter the 2002 attacks in Mombasa, Kenya\u2019s economy\nwas almost brought to its knees because of the various\nunhelpful measures from without that discouraged\ntravel to our country. As a result, we have been doubly\nvictimized. Against this backdrop, Kenya is totally\ncommitted to the fight against terrorism, as we have\nbeen subjected to the loss of innocent lives, untold\nhuman suffering, loss of property and social and\neconomic hardship. We empathize with others,\nincluding the residents of this city and, indeed, the\nAmerican people, who bore the brunt of unprecedented\nterror in the September 2001 attack.\nWe are convinced that this fight can be won only\nby collective action by the community of nations. We\nshould all address terrorism under the rubric of the\nUnited Nations and develop measured, long-term\nstrategies to eliminate terrorism once and for all. Self-\ninterest and unilateral action do not provide a firm\nbasis for a global alliance against terrorism. Only\nprincipled international solidarity will defeat terrorism.\nMy delegation wishes to commend the Secretary-\nGeneral for the efforts made in enhancing the\nutilization of the United Nations Office at Nairobi. I\nnote with satisfaction that construction of additional\nadministration and social facilities at the United\n10\n\nNations Complex at Gigiri has commenced. Further,\nfollowing the elevation of the United Nations Centre\nfor Human Settlements (UN-Habitat) to a fully fledged\nUnited Nations programme, in accordance with\nGeneral Assembly resolution 56/206, it is the desire of\nthe Government of Kenya to see maximum utilization\nof those facilities through the hosting of additional\nmeetings and conferences in Nairobi. This will be a\nclear demonstration of our support for the relevant\nGeneral Assembly resolutions on this issue.\nThe proliferation of small arms and light weapons\nhas contributed to the conflicts raging in many parts of\nAfrica. Kenya has been actively involved in efforts to\naddress this issue and hosts the Nairobi Secretariat on\nSmall Arms and Light Weapons, a regional initiative\ninvolving 10 countries of the Great Lakes region and\nthe Horn of Africa. In addition, at the Biennial Meeting\nof States on small arms and light weapons, held in New\nYork in July 2003, Kenya presented a report on the\nactivities of the Nairobi Secretariat as well as on the\nmeasures undertaken by the Government of Kenya at\nthe national level to curb that menace. In this regard,\nwe call upon the international community to provide\nthe requisite resources in our joint effort to fight the\nproliferation of such arms.\nWars and conflicts continue, and peace, stability\nand socio-economic development remain elusive,\nparticularly in Africa. Kenya therefore continues to\ngive priority to the prevention, management and\npeaceful resolution of conflicts. We have spearheaded\nthe Inter-Government Authority on Development\n(IGAD) peace processes on the conflicts in southern\nSudan and in Somalia. Negotiations on a peaceful\nsolution are ongoing in both Naivasha and Nairobi,\nrespectively.\nIt is with profound satisfaction that we recall the\nhistoric event that occurred on 22 September of this\nyear, when the warring parties in the Sudan signed a\ntruly landmark agreement in Naivasha, Kenya. That\nagreement, which addresses transitional security\narrangements, will no doubt provide the basis for a\nbright and prosperous future for the people of the\nSudan. The parties will reconvene in the next two\nweeks to discuss power sharing, wealth sharing and the\nstatus of the three disputed regions of the Sudan.\nIndeed, the peace process in the Sudan has become\nirreversible.\nI therefore wish to pay tribute to the Government\nof the Sudan, the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Movement\n(SPLM), the Sudanese People\u2019s Liberation Army\n(SPLA), IGAD and the international Partners Forum\nfor their concerted efforts and dedication to the peace\nprocess. This historic event is a concrete example of\nmultilateralism at work. It is indeed a beacon of hope\nand a manifestation of the fact that, with goodwill and\npolitical will, peace is achievable. I am happy to say\nthat not all news emanating from Africa is all about\ndoom and gloom.\nHowever, in order to consolidate and guarantee a\nlong-lasting peace, it is vital for the international\ncommunity to play a greater role in the process. In this\nconnection, I would like to urge the United Nations to\nplay a leadership role in the post-conflict\nreconstruction of the Sudan and to request Member\nStates to support that reconstruction.\nOn the Somali peace process, I am happy to note\nthat there is encouraging progress in the negotiations,\nand we are hopeful that there will be a fruitful\noutcome. Just two weeks ago, representatives adopted\nthe charter, and elections will soon be held. Kenya\ntherefore encourages the parties concerned to\nconsolidate and take advantage of the gains made so\nfar. We emphasize that the peace process should be all-\ninclusive, and we call upon the President of the\nTransitional National Government, Mr. Abdikassim, to\nreturn to the negotiating table in Nairobi and on the\nother faction leaders to accept his participation. By the\nsame token, we call upon our partners and the\ninternational community to continue supporting both\npeace processes.\nWe commend the efforts made by the Economic\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) to\nrestore normalcy in Liberia. While appreciating the\nimportant role the United Nations plays in\nconsolidating peace and stability in the world, Kenya\nadvocates greater United Nations participation in\nAfrican initiatives, such as the peace processes led by\nIGAD and ECOWAS.\nWe are concerned at the continuing deterioration\nof the situation in the Middle East. Kenya notes with\nregret that a lasting solution to the question of\nPalestine remains elusive despite the various initiatives\nundertaken and efforts made to address the problem.\nWe should not lose sight of the objective of\nestablishing a viable Palestinian State, as envisaged in\n\n\nUnited Nations resolutions. Similarly, it should be\nrecalled that, in order to ensure a durable solution to\nthe conflict, it is important to take full account of the\nright of Israel to exist within safe and secure borders.\nWe therefore reiterate our call to the parties to the\nconflict, as well as to the other players involved, to\nexercise restraint and to give priority to dialogue.\nAnother area of concern in the Middle East is\nIraq. The people of that country have yet to find peace\nand stability, without which any hope of national\nreconstruction will be in vain. It is, however,\nencouraging to observe that the international\ncommunity now shares the common view that the\nUnited Nations should play a greater role in rebuilding\nthat country. It is our hope that that consensus will be\ntranslated into action soon.\nFor peace and stability to flourish, good\ngovernance is a necessity. This challenge is one that\nKenya has been able to meet. In December 2002,\nKenya saw a historic moment, when we held general\nelections which were universally recognized as free,\nfair and, indeed, democratic. Every citizen of Kenya\nwas provided an opportunity to have a voice in\ndetermining his or her Government, successful and\nstrong evidence that Africans can and will embrace\ndemocracy and that we, the proud descendants of the\noldest civilizations in history, are ready to determine\nour destiny. I would like to recall the words of a great\nson of Africa, the late Patrice Lumumba:\n\u201cHistory will one day have its say ... Africa will\nwrite its own history, and it will be to the north\nand to the south of the Sahara, a history of glory\nand dignity\u201d.\nWe are prepared as a country, under the\nleadership of President Mwai Kibaki, to play our part\nin promoting development and democracy.\nThe New Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development\n(NEPAD) commands the support of all of us and, if\nimplemented in a holistic manner, it will guarantee\nsustainable development for the African continent.\nNEPAD is a symbol of renewed commitment by the\nregion\u2019s States, and should thus be accorded the\nnecessary support by the international community. We\nappreciate the warm reception accorded to NEPAD by\nboth the United Nations and our development partners.\nWe are committed to the successful implementation of\nthis arrangement. For its part, Kenya, which is a\nmember of the Steering Committee, has established a\nNational NEPAD Secretariat and will host a regional\nsummit on NEPAD for East Africa, the Great Lakes\nand the Horn of Africa next month to take stock of its\nimplementation.\nThe United Nations conferences and summits of\nthe 1990s, particularly the Rio Summit, the Millennium\nSummit, the special session of the General Assembly\non HIV/AIDS, the Monterrey Conference and, finally,\nthe Johannesburg Summit, have equipped us with\nnumerous ideas and commitments to tackle the\nproblems facing the world today. Despite this wealth of\nideas and commitments, we have continued to slip\nbackwards in the fight against poverty, disease,\nilliteracy, environmental degradation and hunger.\nMy message to all of us today is that we must\nrecommit ourselves; let us implement what we have\nagreed on to make the world a better place for all. We\nwelcome the adoption by the Assembly of resolution\n57/270 B on the integrated and coordinated follow-up\nto the implementation of United Nations conferences\nand summits in the economic and social fields. We urge\nall stakeholders identified in this resolution to play\ntheir part to ensure its full and speedy implementation.\nThe majority of African countries are among the\npoorest in the world. The situation has been\ncompounded by the HIV/AIDS pandemic, which has\nravaged the continent and reversed the socio-economic\ngains made since independence. To counter the ravages\nof the pandemic, the Kenya Government has put in\nplace various measures to curb further spread of HIV/\nAIDS. As a result of these efforts, prevalence rates\nhave been significantly reduced in the last four years.\nHowever, much still needs to be done in this area.\nLast month, Kenya hosted the thirteenth\nInternational Conference on AIDS and Sexually-\nTransmitted Diseases. This forum brought together\nover 6,000 delegates from all over the world to discuss\nurgent measures that we all must take to combat the\npandemic. We call upon the international community to\nintensify its efforts in fighting the scourge by, among\nothers things, the provision of adequate financial\nresources, as well as enhanced access to antiretroviral\ndrugs, for those infected.\nWe welcome the recent agreement arrived at in\nthe World Trade Organization (WTO) enabling\ndeveloping countries to import HIV/AIDS generic\ndrugs. We urge developed countries and drug\nmanufacturers to respect the decision of the WTO and\n12\n\nto cooperate with developing countries to facilitate\naccessibility of antiretroviral drugs to all HIV/AIDS\nsufferers.\nKenya regrets the collapse of the WTO\nMinisterial Conference in Canc\u00fan last month.\nHowever, we in the developing world are ready to\ncontinue with negotiations as long as our partners are\nprepared to work with us as equal players.\nIn conclusion, I wish to extend to Assembly\nPresident Mr. Julian Hunte, on behalf of my delegation,\ncongratulations on his unanimous election as President\nof the fifty-eighth regular session of the General\nAssembly.\nThe challenges that I have addressed today have\nno respect for boundaries or sovereignty or, indeed,\nhistorical realities. They represent a collective problem\nfor this Assembly and one that we must face together\nas an international organization. It is my hope that the\nfifty-eighth session of the General Assembly will\naddress with courage the issues before the international\ncommunity. I wish to assure the Assembly President of\nthe full support of the Kenyan delegation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me at the outset,\nSir, to convey to you, on behalf of my delegation, our\nsincere congratulations on your election as the\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\nsession. It is indeed an added pleasure for my\ndelegation to see such a distinguished personality from\na sisterly small island State preside over the Assembly.\nAllow me also to extend my delegation's\nprofound gratitude and appreciation to your\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, former Deputy Prime\nMinister and former Minister of Foreign Affairs of the\nCzech Republic, for the exemplary manner in which he\nsteered the work of the fifty-seventh session.\nI would also like to take this opportunity, on\nbehalf of my delegation, to express our deep\nappreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\nfor his dedication and his untiring work in promoting\nthe noble principles of this Organization. I also\ncongratulate him in particular for the courage and\nforesight with which he proposed last week much-\nneeded reforms to this Organization. I sincerely wish\nhim every success in carrying them forward.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to\nexpress my delegation's sentiments of sadness and\ndeep sorrow at the tremendous loss suffered by the\ninternational community in the recent terrorist\nbombings of the United Nations premises in Baghdad. I\npay a special tribute to the Special Representative of\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, and\nto the other staff members of the Organization who\nmade the ultimate sacrifice in the cause of humanity.\nTerrorism has always menaced the human race in\none form or another. Yet never before have we\nwitnessed acts of terrorism so organized, so frequent\nand so lethal, threatening international peace and\nsecurity in its entirety. The Baghdad bombing and other\nviolent eruptions elsewhere in the world grimly remind\nus that serious threats to world peace and security\nremain, undermining the noble principles that had so\nfar contributed to the survival of the world order and to\nthe sustenance of the values that we upheld. Much has\nbeen done, yet the persistence of such deplorable acts\nsignals our failure to address the fundamental causes of\nthose threats. Bold decisions need to be taken swiftly\nto address them.\nSince my country fell victim to a brutal terrorist\nattack in 1988, we had tried, on many occasions, to\nimpress upon the Assembly the threats to small States\nposed by increased international terrorism. A decade\nand a half later, the threat of terrorism is affecting us\nall, irrespective of our physical size, economic\n25\n\nstrength, political power or military might. For some\nsmall States, the danger is graver, as a terrorist\nonslaught could severely threaten even their\nsovereignty and independence. Therefore, let me\nemphasize the importance of providing support and\nassistance to small States in the implementation of\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001), and of\nstrengthening their institutional capabilities in this\nimportant field.\nWe all should recognize that the strength and\nstability of the international security system or of any\npolitical order is determined by the strength not of its\nstrongest, but of its weakest members.\nMaldives will nevertheless continue to support\nthe war against international terrorism in the spirit of\ncontributing to enhanced international peace and\nsecurity.\nThe structural impediments facing small island\ndeveloping States such as Maldives are numerous. The\ngeophysical characteristics of our island States,\ncombined with their remoteness from major markets,\nhave accentuated our vulnerabilities. Nearly a decade\nago, we met in Barbados to address the environmental\nvulnerabilities and developmental challenges faced by\nsmall island developing States. However, addressing\nthose vulnerabilities and challenges requires a\nmeaningful global partnership, with shared\nresponsibility and commitments at the highest level.\nMy country hopes that Barbados+10, to be held in\nMauritius next year, will provide an impetus for the\ninternational community to renew the commitments to\nconcrete action it made at Barbados 10 years ago.\nThe globalization of the world economy and the\nliberalization of the multilateral trading system are\ncontinuing to marginalize the developing countries,\nespecially the least developed countries. As tariff\nbarriers fall, so does the potential for developing\ncountries to compete effectively in the open market.\nHopes were dashed at Cancun recently, as the\nConference proved disappointing, leaving the\ndeveloping countries still afflicted with problems.\nAbject poverty and disease in the developing\nworld exist at a level that defies comprehension, while\ndeadly diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and\ntuberculosis remain rampant. Development\nopportunities for the least developed countries appear\nbleak. I therefore call for a level playing field for all\ncountries, with preferential treatment for the weak, and,\nin particular, for narrowly based economies such as\nthat of my own country, who find it hard, if not\nimpossible, to sustain their share of the global market.\nMy delegation believes that a greater commitment\nto the implementation of the Brussels Programme of\nAction for the Least Developed Countries is a\nprerequisite if we are to halt and reverse the\ndeteriorating situation of the least developed countries.\nWhile I express my appreciation of the donor\ncommunity's willingness to help those countries\naccelerate their growth and sustain their development,\nand to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, it\nmust be said that the Monterrey pledges remain far\nfrom being realized.\nThe overriding objectives of the Brussels\nProgramme of Action to arrest and reverse the\ncontinued socio-economic marginalization of the least\ndeveloped countries and to improve their participation\nin international trade and their share of foreign\ninvestment and other financial flows will also remain\nbut a dream if official development assistance is not\nincreased and international development assistance is\nnot augmented.\nAs I have stated on many occasions, Maldives is\nnot simply an island nation; it is a nation of many far-\nflung islands covering 90,000 square kilometres of\nocean. Our islands are resource-poor, and the saline\nsoil conditions prohibit most agricultural production.\nTransport and communication costs are exorbitant. The\nscope for economic diversification is very limited. That\nis why we have appealed to the international\ncommunity to take a closer look at our true situation\nbefore the issue of our graduation from least-\ndeveloped-country status is considered by the\nEconomic and Social Council.\nAs I emphasized in my statement to the Assembly\nlast year, the structural weaknesses of our economy\ncould have grave implications for my country's\ndevelopment, should it be deprived of the preferential\naccess to markets and the concessional capital that it\nhas critically relied upon.\nThe Committee for Development Policy (CDP)\nhas fully recognized the special circumstances of small\nStates like Maldives that are environmentally fragile\nand economically vulnerable. The CDP has also, over\nthe years, highlighted those vulnerabilities and the\nsevere costs that small island developing countries will\nhave to endure in the event of their graduation. We\n26\n\nbelieve that, unless these vulnerabilities and costs are\naddressed in a concrete and meaningful manner, the\nconditions for graduation set forth in Assembly\nresolution 46/206, particularly that of smooth\ntransition, will not be met. We are concerned that, if\nsuch issues are not adequately addressed, graduation\nwill reverse the progress that we have made so far.\nAlthough the criteria for inclusion in the list of\nleast developed countries and graduation therefrom\nhave been regularly reviewed and refined, they still fail\nto cover the entire range of structural and other\nhandicaps. We are glad that the CDP is continuing its\nwork on refining the criteria. We also believe that, of\nthe three criteria for graduation, that relating to the\nEconomic Vulnerability Index must be a requirement,\nif we are to ensure that a country will not lapse back\ninto a lower category of development after the fatal day\nof graduation.\nThe United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment profile of Maldives also highlights a\nnumber of circumstances not covered by the criteria.\nThe profile very clearly states that graduation would\nresult in an unsustainable debt burden, even if there is\nsustained growth. The rate of our economic growth has\ndeclined significantly since 1997 and graduation at the\npresent time would therefore amount to a serious\nexogenous shock. This is precisely the situation that we\nare so desperately trying to avoid.\nIn accordance with the decision taken at its 2003\nsubstantive session held at Geneva, the Economic and\nSocial Council will soon consider the issue of the\ngraduation of Maldives from least-developed-country\nstatus. We sincerely hope that we will receive the\nnecessary support and cooperation of all countries with\na view to adopting a comprehensive resolution that\nwould address the issue of graduation in a holistic\nmanner and require an appropriate mechanism to\nensure a smooth transition.\nIn this connection, we would like to express our\nfull support for the call by the CDP to convene an\nexpert group meeting to address the issue of smooth\ntransition. We also expect the International Meeting on\nSmall Island Developing States, scheduled to take\nplace in Mauritius next year, to formulate\nrecommendations to guide policies on the graduation of\nsmall island developing States.\nFollowing the glimmer of hope for the revival of\nthe Middle East peace process, we are again witnessing\nan unprecedented deterioration of the situation in\nPalestine and the Middle East. We strongly condemn\nthe Israeli move to deport President Yasser Arafat from\nthe Palestinian territories, as well as the continued\nIsraeli aggression against the Palestinian people. We\nhave consistently supported the just struggle of the\nPalestinian people to regain their inalienable rights and\nto establish an independent Palestinian State with Al-\nQuds as its capital. We call upon the members of the\nQuartet, particularly the United States, to ensure the\nimplementation of the road map for peace. While we\nsincerely believe that the United Nations has an\nimportant role to play in the peace process, we are also\nconvinced that the United States needs to remain\nactively engaged, as it currently is, in a spirit of\nsincerity, in the search for a just, permanent and lasting\npeace in the region.\nThe international community should maintain the\nhigh priority that it has accorded to disarmament and\narms control efforts, without any discrimination among\nnations or regions, with a view to making the world a\nmore peaceful place. The international community\nmust strengthen and improve the enforcement of the\nnon-proliferation regime. In this context, we believe\nthat the United Nations not only must be at the centre\nof the multilateral process, but must remain the\nprincipal player in grappling with important global\nissues. We believe that, with unity of purpose and in a\nspirit of complementarity, bilateral, regional and\nmultilateral approaches can lead to the resolution of\nthese issues.\nAs the Secretary-General emphasized, the need to\nreform the United Nations to enable it to face the\nchallenges of a changing world remains paramount. We\nare convinced that the United Nations, with its\nuniversal membership, is not only the sole legitimate\nbody responsible for the preservation and maintenance\nof international peace and security but also a unique\nbody, capable of achieving the goal of a better and\nsecure world for humankind. We should never,\ntherefore, allow the United Nations to be marginalized\nor diverted from its role or the principles of the\nCharter. Maldives remains committed, and will do its\nutmost to contribute to strengthening the role of the\nUnited Nations and to making it more efficient and\neffective.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst of all, I\nwish to extend my warmest congratulations to you,\nMr. President, on your election as President of the\nfifty-eighth session of the General Assembly. I am\nconfident that, under your wise leadership, the work of\nthis great Assembly will further strengthen\ninternational cooperation and will thus contribute to the\nmaintenance of peace, stability and security in this\nglobalized world. The international environment today\nremains, no doubt, uncertain, as the world continues to\nconfront constant change and turbulence.\nOn the global stage, at least three key challenges\ncontinue to occupy the attention and remain a priority\nof the international community.\nThe first challenge is the global situation. First,\nthe current situation in Iraq is a serious predicament.\nWhile the war is over, the situation in the country\nremains critical. Peace, security and stability have not\nreturned to Iraq. Although the number of international\ncontingents deployed in Iraq has been increased, the\noverall environment in the country is very fragile and\nhighly unstable. I think that United Nations should\nassume a greater and more responsible role in returning\nnormalcy to the country during the transitional period.\nThe road to normalcy means that Iraq should be\nallowed to govern itself as early as possible, which can\nbe done in several ways, including the holding of free\nand fair elections.\nCambodia strongly condemns the criminal attack\nagainst the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad on\n19 August, and it wishes to pay a tribute to all the\nvictims, especially to Sergio Vieira de Mello, Special\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General. Let us pay our\nrespect to the memory of that great servant of peace.\nWe in Cambodia always remembers his noble actions\nin Cambodia in the early 1990s in the framework of the\nUnited Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia.\nSecondly, regarding the Middle East quagmire, it\nis important that all parties to the conflict, particularly\n14\n\nPalestine and Israel, as well as the international\ncommunity, continue to pursue a peaceful solution to\nthe Middle East conflict on the basis of the agreed road\nmap of the Quartet. At the same time, I believe that it\nis vital for the leaders of both sides of this conflict to\nrenounce the cycle of violence and overcome feelings\nof animosity and myopic interest. Instead, they should\nconsider the broader collective interests of peaceful\ncoexistence, a peaceful life for their peoples and\nstability in the region. There is a need for all sides to\nhave a sense of political realism and shared\ndetermination to make peace possible.\nI believe that today peace in the Middle East will\ncome only when both Palestine and Israel reasonably\nrecognize in every way that they must coexist side by\nside, living in peace and harmony with each other and\nlooking after the interests of one another. Peace,\ntolerance and harmony are the only way forward for\nthe people of Palestine and Israel. In that regard, the\ninternational community must remain fully committed\nto continuing to support the Middle East process to its\nend.\nThirdly, terrorism is still a very serious threat to\nhumanity as a whole. Since the attacks of 11 September\nand the international reaction to fight terrorism,\nterrorists have been strengthening their worldwide\nnetworks. They also continue to kill innocent people\neverywhere in the world. In Asia and in South-East\nAsia, Jemaah Islamiah, which is linked to al Qaeda, has\nbeen responsible for a number of terrorist attacks in the\nregion. The Association of South-East Asian Nations\n(ASEAN) has been actively responding to terrorism by\nstrengthening cooperation at all levels, issuing various\nstatements and taking concrete measures. Nevertheless,\nJemaah Islamiah remains a significant threat to the\nregion today, despite the progress in anti-terrorism\naction thus far.\nFourthly, regarding global poverty, we recall the\nMillennium Summit held in New York and the World\nSummit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg,\nthe International Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment in Monterrey and the recent G-8 Summit\nin Evian, France, where the overriding theme was the\nfight against poverty, which calls for concerted efforts\nfor poverty alleviation and sustainable development.\nHowever, poverty remains a severe problem for the\nworld, particularly the developing countries, with 1.2\nbillion people still surviving on less than one dollar a\nday. Despite clear messages from all those summits,\nespecially from the developing countries, on the need\nto reduce poverty, the actions so far have not been\ndecisive enough.\nI believe that, without concrete measures and the\nprovision of adequate resources, it will be impossible\nfor the least developed countries to overcome the\ncurrent challenges of poverty, aggravated by the speed\nof globalization, which has contributed to the widening\ngap between the haves and the have-nots.\nFighting poverty is not the responsibility of the\nleast developed countries alone. It is the shared\nresponsibility of the international community, in which\nthe developed world has an important role to play.\nPoverty prevails today in many forms and dimensions.\nFor the developed countries to share resources with the\ndeveloping countries is not only an act of generosity, it\nis also a requirement for living together in a world of\npeace, security and harmony. In that regard, I am\nconvinced that the international community must act\ncollectively and in a spirit of responsibility and\nsolidarity to end this alarming situation of poverty by\ntaking concrete steps to reduce it gradually.\nThe second major challenge involves regional\ndevelopments. Regarding the regional situation, there\nhave been many developments. Some have been\npositive; others negative. I wish to note several\nimportant developments since last year. First, the\neighth ASEAN Summit and other related summits in\nPhnom Penh, Cambodia, have successfully advanced\nASEAN integration by moving the region ahead in\nterms of establishing the ASEAN Economic\nCommunity (AEC), deepening cooperation between\nASEAN and China, Japan and the Republic of Korea,\nand strengthening cooperation with India. With those\nfour countries, ASEAN has enhanced close and\nproactive cooperation among a combined population of\nmore than three billion people that has enormous\neconomic potential and opportunities for development\nand growth. In addition, during that ASEAN Summit,\nits leaders also held, for the first time, a summit\ndialogue with Africa through President Thabo Mbeki\nof South Africa, the current Chairman of the New\nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development, NEPAD.\nSecondly, the situation in the Korean peninsula\ncontinues to evolve and give rise to concerns for\ncountries that are directly involved. Cambodia fully\nsupports the peace talks in Beijing and believes that\nonly dialogue and compromise can provide the way out\n15\n\nof the present quandary. Although a number of\noutstanding issues need to be mutually resolved, I think\nit is important for all the parties concerned to reduce\ntension by avoiding hostile actions that would escalate\nthe situation. I believe that one way of enabling the\nsituation on the Korean Peninsula to move ahead\npositively is to negotiate a road map for a nuclear-free\nand secure Korean Peninsula. I believe that, if such a\nplan could go ahead, steps towards the normalization of\nthe situation on the Korean Peninsula could be taken.\nThirdly, I would like to refer to recent\ndevelopments in Cambodia. The situation in Cambodia\nis continuing to improve significantly. The recent\nelections were held in a free, fair and democratic\nenvironment, as many international election observers\nnoted in their statements. This year\u2019s election marks\nanother important milestone in Cambodia\u2019s\ndemocratization, which has been strengthened at the\ngrass-roots level through the successful local elections\nto communal councils last year. At the same time,\nCambodia\u2019s gross domestic product growth continues\nto show positive signs, with an approximate growth\nrate of 6.7 per cent per annum over the past five years,\ndespite natural calamities and the impact of other\nregional and global developments, such as terrorism\nand Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.\nIn addition, the Government\u2019s strategy gives top\npriority to poverty reduction. In March this year, the\nCambodian Prime Minister, Samdech Hun Sen,\nofficially launched the campaign for poverty\nalleviation aimed at reducing the poverty rate by 1.2\nper cent every year. By 2015, the poverty level would\nbe reduced to 19 per cent. In order to achieve that end,\na budget of $1.5 billion has been projected.\nThe third challenge is the reform of the United\nNations. Every year, representatives of every\ndelegation advocate to the Assembly the necessity of\nreforming the Organization, in particular the Security\nCouncil. I, too, believe that without sufficient reform in\nthis world body, the United Nations cannot be an\neffective and efficient global Organization that is able\nto respond collectively to the complex global\nchallenges affecting humanity in the twenty-first\ncentury. The world has witnessed a wave of democracy\nsince the end of the cold war more than a decade ago. I\nbelieve, however, that democratization needs to start\nright here at the United Nations, which should respect\nthe will of the community of nations. Any further\ninaction on the part of the United Nations with regard\nto the call for reform will mean a continuing decline in\nits credibility, as well as increasing loss of confidence\nin this universal institution.\nI believe that one of the key issues of United\nNations reform is the need for the expansion of the\nSecurity Council. Cambodia calls once again for the\nexpansion of the membership of the Security Council\nto include Japan, the Federal Republic of Germany and\nIndia as new permanent members, given the crucial\nrole of these three countries in international political\nand economic affairs today.\nMoreover, the General Assembly, as the highest\nbody of the United Nations, should play a more\nimportant role, in accordance with the Charter, for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\nFurthermore, in the context of United Nations reform, I\nthink that we should look beyond the conventional\nagenda of international peace and security, given that\nthe glaring poverty in the world today is, without\ndoubt, a peace and security issue. I believe that the\nUnited Nations should play a more meaningful role,\nwithin the broad framework of human security, in the\nworld\u2019s collective efforts to fight poverty.\nAs the world marches on, I believe that we must\nperhaps devise new ways to deal with a myriad of\nchallenges that menace the whole of humanity. We will\nhave to close the gap between the poor and the rich and\nbetween the developed and developing countries. We\nmust fight poverty and HIV/AIDS, which are affecting\nmillions of people in the developing countries. We\nneed to tackle together the growing impact of\ntransnational crime. At the same time, we must pay\ngreater attention to hotbeds of tension around the world\nin order to ensure a peaceful and secure world for all.\nFinally, we must continue to ensure that the\nUnited Nations is truly a democratic global institution\nthat reflects the reality of the world today. We need to\nadvance together in peace, security, stability,\ndevelopment and prosperity in building a better place\nfor all peoples on the Earth.\nIn conclusion, I believe the way forward for the\nworld will depend largely on international cooperation\nand the need to share global resources more equitably.\nGrowing interdependence and increasing globalization\nmean that every nation must work collectively in\naddressing the current challenges in the most effective\nway.\n16\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMy delegation\nwishes to congratulate you very warmly, Mr. President,\non your assumption of the presidency of the world\nbody, and to assure you of its unflinching and\ncontinued support for a successful tenure. We would\nalso like to extend our appreciation to your predecessor\nfor successfully directing the affairs of the General\nAssembly during one of the most trying periods in the\nrecent history of the United Nations.\nOn 19 August 2003, the United Nations was\nshocked to its foundations by a fatal bomb attack on its\nheadquarters in Baghdad. On behalf of my President\nand the Government and people of Sierra Leone, I extend\nour deepest condolences to the United Nations Secretary-\nGeneral, the United Nations family and the families of all\nthose who perished in that attack. They died for the cause\nof peace and humanity and for the values and\naspirations that the United Nations symbolizes.\nWe call on all members of the United Nations and\non other nations to spare no measures to respect the\nsanctity of the United Nations, because it is only when\nthat sanctity is respected that the United Nations can\nfulfil its responsibilities to mankind.\nThe majority of the world's poor and deprived\npeople live in Africa, bedevilled by hunger, disease,\nmass illiteracy, ignorance, civil conflict, extreme\npoverty, bad governance, abuses of human rights,\ninadequate educational opportunities, gender\ninequality, environmental hazards, poor transport and\ncommunications facilities and debt. The New\nPartnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD)\nembodies the vision of Africans themselves to rid their\ncontinent of those perils and to enjoy a standard of\nliving befitting the twenty-first century. Those goals\nare also in consonance with the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals of the Millennium Declaration. My\ndelegation believes that the world will be a better,\nhappier, more tolerant and peaceful place if the goals\nof those two impressive declarations are attained.\nWe also believe that to achieve those goals, we\nhave to come down from the lofty platform of rhetoric\nto the practical reality of sincere, honest and sacrificial\npartnership and collaboration between the haves and\nthe have-nots. Tangible result is the acid-test of the\n20\n \nsincerity and honesty of that partnership and\ncollaboration. My delegation wishes to reaffirm Sierra\nLeone's commitment to the pursuance of the goals of\nthose two development blueprints as the most credible\nand realistic channels of, and guidelines for,\naccelerated development.\nBut we, the poor countries, execute those\nlaudable blueprints with great trepidation, because of\nthe devastating effect of the dreadful HIV/AIDS\nepidemic, which, without universal effort, is bound to\ncancel out, and even reverse, all development gains. In\nthe light of that, my delegation proposes that\nantiretroviral drugs be made available as a matter of\nhuman right to everyone everywhere who may need it.\nSierra Leone has in recent years repeatedly\nreiterated its faith in the United Nations as the only\nOrganization that can hold the crisis-ridden world\ntogether. My delegation wishes to reaffirm that faith,\nwhich is built on the conviction that collective action is\nthe strength of the Organization. As we are all aware,\ndeviating from the principle of collective action can\nsubject the United Nations to tremendous strain; it can\neven hamstring the Organization, leaving us a weak\nand divided family. My delegation calls upon all\nnations   big and small, rich and poor   to uphold\nthat principle as the Organization's driving force.\nThe unity of purpose and collective action of the\nUnited Nations are even more imperative in the context\nof the ever-increasing demands placed upon it by the\nnumerous conflicts and humanitarian crises to which it\nhas to respond. The expansion and complexity of those\nchallenges reinforce the need for collaboration and\npartnership with continental and regional organizations\nsuch as the African Union and the Economic Community\nof West African States (ECOWAS) to resolve crises. It is\nthe considered view of my delegation that such\ncollaboration and partnership, designed and financially\nand materially facilitated, can respond to conflicts and\nother crises much more speedily and productively than\ncan a distant and overstretched United Nations alone.\nWe are of the firm conviction that the hundreds of\nthousands of lives that have been lost in the West\nAfrican subregion, especially in Sierra Leone and Liberia,\nwould have been saved if such a functional relationship,\npredicated on proactive conflict prevention, had existed\nbetween the United Nations and ECOWAS.\nTwo of the most worrying challenges to peace are\nterrorism and the proliferation of arms, including\nweapons of mass destruction. We unreservedly deplore\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and we\nreaffirm our commitment to resolving differences and\nconflicts through non-violent means. The proliferation\nof small arms in the West African subregion is of\nspecial concern to Sierra Leone. While a multi-pronged\nstrategy to rid the country of small weapons, including\nan arms-for-development project spearheaded by the\nUnited Nations Development Programme, has yielded\nencouraging and hopeful results, we believe that only a\nconcerted regional approach that includes genuine and\nselfless political will can eliminate that scourge from\nthe region.\nThe Government and people of Sierra Leone have\naccepted the challenge to recover from the scourge of\nthe war and to rejoin the path of development.\nAccordingly, a comprehensive national recovery\nprogramme has been designed to respond to post-\nconflict rehabilitation and reconstruction needs and to\nlay the foundations to address the issues that generated\nthe conflict.\nA priority component of the recovery process is\nthe consolidation of democratic governance.\nPreparations for nation-wide local government\nelections are in the ultimate stages. We attach\nconsiderable significance to those elections, because\nthey will constitute a major step in the process of\ndecentralization, around which the scheme of our\nparticipatory governance is going to revolve.\nIn order to tackle some of the root causes that\ncreated the wedge between the people and successive\nGovernments, which partly caused the conflict, we\nhave embarked on a fundamental governance reform\nprogramme that involves the judiciary, public service,\nhuman rights, accountability and transparency, local\ngovernment and tackling corruption and abuse of power.\nWe have made remarkable progress in the area of\nsecurity, which is the prerequisite for our national\nrevival and development. An international military\nadvisory and training team led by the United Kingdom\nhas provided training that has considerably enhanced\nthe professional competence of our armed forces. With\nthat training has come renewed confidence in the\narmed forces, as indicated by the nationwide\ndeployment of personnel. With support from the\nGovernment of the United Kingdom, our police force\nhas also been trained, restructured and equipped to\ncarry out its responsibilities. But with war anywhere in\n21\n \nthe subregion, Sierra Leone never feels safe and secure.\nThat is why we welcome, with profound appreciation\nto ECOWAS and the United Nations, the initiative to\nput the region on a path to peace.\nWhile welcoming the relief provided by positive\ndevelopments in the Liberian peace process, my\ndelegation feels that we are duty bound to urge the\ninternational community to never again fall into\ncomplacency about conflicts, as it did in the case of\nLiberia.\nMy delegation is very conscious of the heavy\ninvestment of the United Nations and the international\ncommunity, which has yielded the peace Sierra Leone\nnow enjoys. The momentum to consolidate the hard-\nwon peace and embark on a meaningful course of\ndevelopment is our highest priority. That is why we\nwhole-heartedly welcome the Security Council's\nprogramme for the phased withdrawal of the United\nNations Mission in Sierra Leone, which is based on the\ncapacity of our security forces to discharge their\nfunctions and on the overall security environment in\nSierra Leone and the subregion.\nI am happy to report that the re-establishment of\ncivil authority throughout the country has been one of\nour major post-conflict accomplishments. Legal and\njudicial law-enforcement administrations have been\nreactivated in parts of the country that were previously\nunder rebel occupation, and schools and health\nfacilities, along with better social facilities, are being\nrehabilitated and reopened.\nOn the economic front, the certificate of origin\nregime for the export of diamonds is producing\npositive results, as proceeds from the sale of diamonds\ncontinue to rise steadily. New areas of alluvial diamond\ndeposits have been discovered, and prospecting for\nkimberlite deposits continues. Various regulatory\nprocedures, including legislation and expert advice, are\nin the pipeline to curtail illegal exploitation and to\nensure that Sierra Leoneans derive the benefit they\ndeserve from that resource.\nTwo transitional bodies   the Special Court to\ntry those who bear the greatest responsibility for the\nhuman rights excesses in the war, and the Truth and\nReconciliation Commission that was set up for victims\nand perpetrators of abuses to tell their stories, thereby\nlaying the foundation for healing, reconciliation and\nforgiveness   are on course to achieve their\nobjectives.\nThe future of 57,000 ex-combatants is a major\nfactor in the management of the costly peace that is so\nrelished today in Sierra Leone. The process of re-\nabsorbing those people into society as law-abiding,\npeaceful, productive and patriotic citizens has been\nslow, tedious and expensive. But we have had to\nattempt that character transformation exercise as a\nconflict-relapse prevention mechanism. With that\nreorientation, our governance reform programme and\nour sound youth policy, which makes ex-combatants\nand other young people stakeholders in society, the\npossibility of resorting to violence and destruction as\nthe only way to vent grievances and resolve conflict\nhas been reduced.\nOur other area of grave concern is the welfare of\nthe hundreds of thousands of children who missed\nopportunities for education because of the war. The\nmagnitude of the problem is such that we have had to\nform a special commission for war-affected children.\nLet me conclude by reassuring the United Nations\nthat the heavy investment in peace in Sierra Leone has\nnot gone, and will never go, in vain. We are determined\nto do whatever we can to protect and consolidate the\npeace for which we have all sacrificed so much. We\nfully recognize our responsibility as the model of\nsuccess for United Nations peacekeeping. We wish to\ngive the same reassurances to our many friends for\ntheir wonderful contributions in various forms over the\nyears. Those include the British, Chinese, American,\nNigerian and Guinean Governments and the European\nUnion.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst of\nall, I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly and\nto wish great success to the work of the fifty-eighth\nsession under your wise guidance. I also take this\nopportunity to extend deep appreciation to Mr. Jan\nKavan for his insightful leadership of the fifty-seventh\nsession of the General Assembly.\nThis is my second successive participation in the\nwork of the General Assembly. In my statement last\nyear, I supported the resolute actions of the anti-\nterrorist coalition in eliminating the Central Asian\ncentre of international terrorism in Afghanistan, as well\nas the other measures taken by the world community to\naddress global challenges to international peace and\nsecurity.\nAs life has demonstrated, the United Nations\nplays a highly positive role in organizing the common\nstruggle against international terrorism. In this regard,\nthe idea of giving the United Nations the lead role in\nguiding the global anti-terrorist coalition deserves\ngenuine support. One of the primary objectives of my\nstatement last year was to appeal to the United Nations\nto recognize, as a great event in the history of my\ncountry, the two thousand, two hundredth anniversary\nof Kyrgyz Statehood, as an event of international\nstatus.\nThe resolution of the General Assembly on\nKyrgyz Statehood was a powerful force in raising the\nnational spirit of our people. For that, we are sincerely\ngrateful to our Organization. Indeed, whenever any\nproblems emerge at a global level, we turn to the\nUnited Nations and unfailingly get support.\nRecently, there have been heated discussions\nconcerning the role of the United Nations. Some\nhotheads even allege that the United Nations has\nexhausted its potential. I believe that such ideas\ncontradict the interests of the world community,\nalthough on the whole, I see nothing wrong with\ndebates on this theme. Such discussions are\ndemonstrations of democracy, to the development of\nwhich the United Nations has significantly contributed\nworldwide.\nThe development of democracy at a national level\ninvolves differences of opinion and criticism of the\nauthorities. Something similar takes place in the\nframework of the world community. Here, too, a\n2\n\npolarization of opinions is occurring, but in this case it\nis our common offspring \u2014 the United Nations \u2014 that\nis coming under attack. Attempts to jeopardize its role\nare perceived, especially by small countries, as\nundermining that international body which embodies\nthe interests of all mankind. There is a wise saying:\n\u201cSmall countries must have big friends\u201d. The United\nNations is just such a big reliable friend.\nHowever, it is difficult to deny that the work of\nthe United Nations is not yet ideal. Certainly its\nefficiency needs to be enhanced. We understand the\nSecretary-General\u2019s concern for the situation of the\nUnited Nations, and we fully share his assessment of\nthe current world situation.\nIn this regard, the attention paid to the work of\nthis current session of the General Assembly by many\nheads of State is impressive. The statements made by\nMr. George Bush, the President of the United States;\nMr. Vladimir Putin, the President of the Russian\nFederation; Mr. Jacques Chirac, the President of\nFrance; Mr. Gerhard Schroeder, Chancellor of\nGermany, as well as other heads of State, despite\ncertain differences in approach, clearly have shown the\ndesire to have a definite role for the United Nations in\nbuilding the new world order, one that is better in\nkeeping with the aspirations of all people on Earth.\nThe most efficient way of overcoming\ndisagreements in political practice is to search for\ncompromise. We are pleased to note that the technique\nof compromise is playing a positive role in resolving\ndisagreements on such a key issue for the world as the\nsettlement of the problem of Iraq. This is an\nencouraging sign.\nWe would like to stress, again, that any measures\nto improve the United Nations should be based solely\non the idea of improving the work of the Organization.\nThe Kyrgyz Republic is ready to support reasonable\nproposals on this subject, including measures to\nincrease the efficiency of the work of the Security\nCouncil.\nI believe that alongside the search for ways to\nimprove the United Nations, we should concentrate on\nthose specific problems which will need to be resolved\nagain in the foreseeable future. In this regard, we may\nlook at the results of the Millennium Summit, to those\nvital problems that were highlighted at that time in the\ndiscerning report of the Secretary-General of the\nUnited Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan entitled, \u201cWe the\nPeoples\u201d (A/54/2000), and also contained in the\nMillennium Declaration. These last three years have\nhighlighted even more the importance of the issues\nraised at that time.\nSince then, the fight against international\nterrorism was added as one of the major challenges to\ninternational peace and security. The report of\nSecretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan to the present\nsession of the General Assembly focuses the attention\nof Member States on the need to increase their efforts\ntowards implementing the Millennium Declaration.\nThis approach deserves very broad support.\nI believe that only such a universal, global\norganization as the United Nations is able to cope with\nthe challenges faced by the world community. But the\nUnited Nations needs help, and we, through our joint\nefforts, particularly with the support of the big Powers,\ncan accomplish this. If we do not, then we would be\nacting at cross-purposes and could expect a grim result.\nBesides common problems shared by the world\ncommunity, each country has its own specific\nproblems. Kyrgyzstan is determined to resolve its own\nproblems through reliance on its own efforts.\nAddressing this Assembly, I cannot fail to stress the\nconcentration of our efforts on advancing the\ndemocratic process. In particular, last year I put\nforward a national idea entitled, \u201cKyrgyzstan \u2014 a\ncountry of human rights\u201d. For the development of this\nidea, a Democratic Code was elaborated and a Public\nCouncil of Democratic Security was established.\nFollowing the outcome of a national referendum, a new\nConstitution was adopted which more fully reflects the\nlevel of democracy attained as well as new challenges\nto its development. These measures have given a\npowerful stimulus to the progressive movement of our\ncountry towards a democratic system.\nWe also attach great importance to the\nestablishment of fair, open and responsible governance\nand to enhancing the effectiveness of the anti-\ncorruption policy being pursued. This year I\nestablished the National Council on Conscientious\nGovernance to strengthen the work being conducted in\nKyrgyzstan to create an anti-corruption atmosphere in\nour society.\nWe are focusing our main efforts on the fight\nagainst poverty, but the Republic cannot resolve this\nproblem without external assistance. We highly\ncommend the role played by the United Nations in the\n3\n\nfight against poverty, and the measures undertaken by\nour Organization. Again, we appeal to the world\ncommunity and to the developed countries not to\nreduce their efforts in providing assistance to the\ndeveloping countries for the purpose of overcoming\npoverty.\nIn the autumn of 2002, under the aegis of the\nUnited Nations, the Global Mountain Summit was held\nin our capital, Bishkek. The Bishkek Global Mountain\nPlatform adopted at the Summit has, in essence,\nbecome the outcome document of the International\nYear of Mountains, observed by the United Nations.\nThe document has defined key tasks for sustainable\ndevelopment of the mountain regions of our planet. To\naddress them, Switzerland has initiated creation of the\nInternational Partnership for Sustainable Development\nin Mountain Regions. This is only the beginning; we\nhave just set in place the first building blocks for the\nfoundation of an institutionalized home for the\nmountain regions.\nKyrgyzstan hopes to receive assistance from the\nUnited Nations and its family of organizations towards\nthe establishment of an international information and\neducational centre for mountain States, as well as for a\nnetwork for developing mountain States, with its\nsecretariat established in Bishkek. I believe that the\nKyrgyz Republic is the best possible location for this\ncentre since most of our country is mountainous.\nThe United Nations faces an abundance of\nproblems. One of the most important challenges is the\nfight against international terrorism. Other global\nchallenges include political and religious extremism,\nterritorial separatism, drug trafficking and the fight\nagainst fatal illnesses such as HIV/AIDS and others.\nIt is becoming increasingly urgent to prevent the\nspread of weapons of mass destruction. The Kyrgyz\nRepublic supports taking decisive measures in this\nrespect. We believe, however, that force should be used\nonly on the basis of Security Council decisions and in\naccordance with international law so as to prevent\nconflict and discord within the international\ncommunity.\nNot only must global measures be taken in this\nrespect, but efforts must be made at the regional and\nnational levels. One good example of such efforts is the\nwork done by the Shanghai Cooperation Organization,\nwith the lead role being played by Russia and China,\nactively relying on the Central Asian participants.\nIn conclusion, I should like once again to stress\nnot only my full confidence in the United Nations, but\nalso the determination of the Kyrgyz Republic\nresolutely to strive, together with our partners in the\ninternational community, for the preservation and\nstrengthening of this Organization, which we believe\nmost fully reflects our interests. May the Almighty\nhelp us in this work, and let all good peoples of the\nworld join in our prayers for the success and prosperity\nof the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThis\ngreat number of heads of State and Government have\nassembled at the current session neither to perform\nceremonial rituals nor to conduct the periodic\nconsideration of agendas. Rather, it is the state of the\nworld today that necessitated this exceptional\ngathering, because people everywhere sense a growing\nstruggle between fear and hope, security and\ninstability, force and weakness, surplus and need, and\nfreedom and oppression.\nReturning to this Assembly is tantamount to\nreturning to our origins and sources, and to common\nsense and principles, after nearly losing them. We\nreturn to this mother Organization like children who\nreturn home changed. Some are obedient and others are\nrebellious; some are just and others are unjust.\nHowever, we find the mother Organization as badly\nhurt as some of its children.\nWhat hurts the United Nations hurts us all. Its\nfallen victims are indeed martyrs of humanity in its\nentirety, like Count Folke Bernadotte, Dag\nHammarskj\u02c6ld, Sergio Vieira de Mello and others who\nhave made the ultimate sacrifice for this Organization.\nThe peoples of the world perceive the United\nNations as a haven for the rights of the weak and the\nneedy. It also exercises its authority to dissuade the\nstrong who act aggressively and forget their obligations\nand commitments.\nIn our region and in our country, we have greatly\nsuffered from double standards and recourse to might\nat the expense of right. Since the foundation of an\nentity on the ruins of the people of Palestine, an entity\nthat recognizes neither its own borders nor those of\nothers, repeated injustices and wars have arisen as a\nresult of violations of the spirit and raison d''tre of this\ninternational Organization.\nComprehensive and just approaches were adopted\nat the international Conference in Madrid to find a\npeaceful resolution to the Middle East conflict,\nresulting in principles and accomplishments that cannot\nbe renounced or reversed. Incomplete approaches\nemerged, but they failed to achieve peace, maintain\nsecurity and ensure stability. It has become clear to\neveryone, except to those in Israel who are arrogant\nand intransigent, that there can be no security without a\npolitical solution, and no partial, peaceful, political\nsolution without the comprehensive peace that\nembodies the spirit of justice of the Madrid Conference\nand the integrated Arab peace initiative of the Arab\nSummit in Beirut.\nSuch a solution is based on the relevant\ninternational resolutions calling for the return to\nLebanon of the rest of the territory still under Israeli\noccupation, including Shebaa farms; for the return to\nSyria of its territory up to its 4 June 1967 borders; and\nfor enabling Palestinian refugees to exercise their legal,\nhumanitarian and moral right of return to their\nhomeland. Such a process should ensure the\nestablishment of a sovereign, independent, stable and\nviable Palestinian State, with al-Quds al-Sharif as its\ncapital.\nDevelopments on the ground, however, dash that\nhope. The Government of Israel continues to build\nsettlements, impose extrajudicial sentences, kill men,\nwomen and children, demolish houses and carry out\npre-emptive arrests and assassinations.\nSimilarly, Lebanon suffers from persistent and\nextremely provocative and aggravated Israeli threats,\nattacks and violations by sea, land and air, as described\nby the Secretary-General and his Special\nRepresentative in the region. The international\ncommunity should therefore pressure Israel to end\nthose excesses.\nLebanese detainees and prisoners are still\nillegally held hostage, without due process, in Israel,\nwhich still keeps the remaining maps of the landmines\nthat it planted during its occupation of southern\nLebanon. Furthermore, Israel continues its policy of\nassassination and still covets Lebanon's waters and\nnatural resources.\nI must say that the failure to guarantee the right\nof Palestinian refugees to exercise their right of return\nputs the entire Middle East in an explosive situation.\nThe Government and people of Lebanon are especially\ncommitted to the implementation of this right, which\nwe consider to be legal, natural and moral. Therefore,\nthe so-called realistic solutions to this problem should\nnot even be raised, since they run counter to the\nprinciples of international law and the spirit of justice.\nIndeed, only a commitment to the right of return and\nrefusal to resettle the refugees in Lebanon are at the\ncore of Lebanon's reconciliation that ended the war in\nLebanon and that led to the Taif Agreement, which was\nendorsed by the United Nations.\n36\n\nIn this context, I wish to stress that Lebanon's\npolicy choices and positions regarding the Middle East\nconflict are constant and unaffected by the balance of\npower. We believe that those choices are righteous,\nmoral and consistent with the requirements of a just\npeace. Those choices alone are capable of bringing\nabout a possible and strong settlement to the Arab-\nIsraeli conflict.\nSuch an undertaking is compatible with the goals\nof the United Nations, as it strives to strengthen its\nrole, with the support of the sponsors of the peace\nprocess and the participation of the European Union.\nIt is in Israel's interest to revert to or to be\nbrought back to the language of reason and justice.\nSince Israel's Governments have failed to do so,\nresponsibility for bringing Israel back to reason falls to\nthe international community.\nFor in Israel there is a Government that considers\nonly its rights and fails to take account of its\nobligations. We believe that those who consider only\none side are the most dangerous kinds of people.\nUnder the pretext of security, the Government in\nIsrael is continuing to build a wall that separates Israel\nfrom the people of Palestine and is attempting to build\na higher, larger and more menacing wall between the\ngreater nations of the West and the rest of the world,\nespecially the Arab and the Muslim world. Israel does\nthat in a bid to serve and support those who wish to\nfuel conflict between East and West, between\nChristianity and Islam and among religions, cultures\nand civilizations, when, in the final analysis, there is\nonly one human civilization, which stems from\ncommon spiritual values based on the belief in one\neternal God and his messengers.\nFurthermore, the Government of Israel resorts\ndaily to the stick as a means of subjugation. It ignores,\nor pretends to ignore, that the use of the stick incites\ndisobedience; that, with time, the oppressors and the\noppressed often exchange roles and positions; and that\nmany who were once at the helm at various stages of\ntheir lives have faded from historical memory, having\nforgotten that only God is everlasting, as are the\nuniversal principles of equality, fairness and justice.\nThere are those in the Israeli Government who\nwere brought to power by the very extremism that\ncaused the ouster of their predecessors or even led to\ntheir assassination, and who nevertheless do not\nhesitate to label Arabs and Muslims as the extremists\nor accuse them of being the sole source of extremism.\nIn Israel, there are those who insist on making\nIsrael a fortress towering over the region, rather than a\nState within it. There are those who make life for the\nPalestinians worse than death, and who are determined\nto force fellow Israelis to die with the Arabs in war,\nrather than live with them in peace.\nThere are those in the Government of Israel who\ntry to deny that Lebanon, Syria and the Palestinian's\nright of return are a mandatory path for any political\nsettlement and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace\nis to be achieved. On the contrary, they desperately use\nthe feeble-minded to fan the flames of conflict among\nthe Palestinians themselves, among the Lebanese,\nbetween the Lebanese and the Syrians, and among the\nArabs, instead of extinguishing the flames of conflict\nbetween the Arabs and Israelis in a decent, just and\ncomprehensive manner.\nThe Government of Israel believes that it is more\nimportant to gain time than to gain peace, that it is\nbetter to manipulate the various tracks and problems\nthan to seek to resolve the conflict in all its dimensions\nand problems and that intimidation can transform\ninjustice into right, right into injustice and occupation\ninto independence.\nIn Israel, the Government clings to its slogan of\nabsolute sovereignty, and to the sovereignty it violates\nor violates with others, limiting the role of its most\nimportant ally to providing money and weapons,\ndenying it even the right to advise. If the world's only\nsuper-Power utters a word of advice about the\nconstruction of the wall of separation and\ndiscrimination, it is ignored and construction of the\nwall continues.\nOffence is often the result of excessive tolerance\nof fault, and excessive chaos in standards and\nyardsticks is caused by the discriminatory use of\nstandards regarding justice and international\nresolutions. It is not just, wise, safe or peaceful for\npowerful States to continue to tolerate double and\nmultiple standards when dealing with Israel, while\napplying firm standards and measures when dealing\nwith the weak and the oppressed and other nations of\nthe world.\nThis clearly leads us to call for the reform of the\nUnited Nations, as well as for strengthening its role, by\n37\n\nreviewing the working methods of the Security\nCouncil, expanding its membership, giving it more\nweight in decision-making and respecting the\ndemocratic consultative nature that must be the basis of\nour international Organization. That reform should\nfairly and effectively address new challenges of world\nsecurity and safety. It should also provide balance and\nstability in international relations, particularly if that is\naccompanied by modernizing the work of the United\nNations organs and rationalization to avoid use of the\nright of veto in a way that contravenes law and justice\nin the world.\nIn Iraq, there is also a growing call for the United\nNations to play a pivotal role in assisting the people of\nIraq to maintain their unity, control their own destiny,\nend the occupation of their territories, establish the\nmeans to administer their wealth, choose the provisions\nof their constitution and freely elect their\nrepresentatives.\nWar can be waged from the air by one side only.\nHowever, peace on the ground must be made with\nothers inside and outside of Iraq and with the United\nNations. Peace in Iraq and Iraq's destiny require that\nthe Iraqis be freed of occupation as soon as possible\nand that they work, under the auspices of the United\nNations, in an expanded, pivotal and political role that\nis not restricted to social matters alone.\nThat is the fundamental appeal of the events and\ntragedies and of the people of Iraq. Only the ignorant\nor those pretending ignorance refuse to listen and to\ndraw lessons and conclusions before it is too late.\nThe beginning of this century has been marked by\nviolence and terrorism, whose worst manifestation has\nbeen the tragedies and crimes of 11 September and the\nsubsequent calls for extremism and clash of\ncivilizations, which prompt us to refuse to yield to the\nworst evils that threaten the peace and unity of our\nplanet.\nLebanon was among the first countries to be\ntargeted by terrorism, which was carried out by\nfundamentalist groups. It fought it with courage and\nresolve. At the same time, Lebanon still faces State\nterrorism practiced by Israel, which has caused the\ndeath, injury and displacement of thousands of\nLebanese and the destruction of essential facilities and\ninfrastructure. While we differentiate between\nterrorism and the right of peoples whose territories are\noccupied to resist and to liberate that land, within the\ncontext of international resolutions and the Charter, our\ncountry explicitly and strongly condemns all forms of\nterrorism, as it constitutes a threat to mankind as a\nwhole, regardless of race, colour or religion. Lebanon\nreaffirms its commitment to continue to cooperate with\nthe international community to fight this extremely\nharmful and damaging scourge.\nIn conclusion, I would be remiss if I did not\ncongratulate Mr. Hunte on his election as President of\nthe General Assembly and wish him success in his\nstewardship. I also would like to commend the tireless\nefforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, to\npromote all opportunities for peace, stability and\ndevelopment in the world. Furthermore, I would like to\npay a tribute to the United Nations Interim Force in\nLebanon (UNIFIL) for its role in southern Lebanon.\nNow that Lebanon has been able to liberate most of its\nterritory, it is my hope that UNIFIL will fulfil the\nremainder of the mandate entrusted to it, as defined in\nSecurity Council resolution 425 (1978).\nLebanon has and always will be a country that\nrejects isolation and rigidity and that will remain open\nto dialogue and creative, rich, civilized human\ninteraction. Our country will always remain true to its\nmessage. Despite the challenges, we remain eager to\neffectively promote justice and the rule of law and\nuphold the values of freedom and democracy.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe deaths\nof Sergio Vieira de Mello and his colleagues leave a\nterrible void. The loss of so many dedicated servants of\nthe United Nations at its headquarters in Baghdad fills\nus with shock, grief and concern. This atrocity and the\nother murderous attacks we have seen in the past two\nyears are chilling evidence that terrorists are ruthlessly\ntargeting the civilized world. Terrorism is a direct\nthreat to us all, to humanity as a whole.\nWeapons of mass destruction are the other direct\nthreat, an even worse threat if such weapons were to\nfall into the hands of terrorists.\nIn addition to these direct threats to peace and\nsecurity, we are faced with, in the words of Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan, \u201csoft threats\u201d: poverty and hunger,\nenvironmental degradation and diseases of mass\ndestruction like HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.\nWhat all these threats have in common is that\nthey do not stop at national borders. Their often lethal\nconsequences affect groups of countries, whole\ncontinents or even the entire planet. The only way to\ntackle them is by collective action. Enforcement and\nimplementation are the key.\nBut do we have the capacity to take such action?\nIs the existing multilateral system with its institutions\nand rules capable of responding to the hard threats and\nsoft threats we are facing? I doubt it. Take the growing\ndanger of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Can we\nallow a few countries to reject the rules agreed to by\n187 other countries? Can we run the risk of countries\nturning into suppliers of nuclear arms to terrorist\norganizations? No, we cannot. And if today\u2019s rules\ncannot avert States putting humanity at risk, we must\ntighten those rules and we must be ready to collectively\nenforce them.\nI therefore welcome President Bush\u2019s proposal\nfor a binding Security Council resolution, tightening up\nthe non-proliferation rules. I suggest that we build on\nexisting export control regimes and make them\nuniversal and legally binding. This approach would be\nin line with the successful example of Security Council\nresolution 1373 (2001), containing binding obligations\nfor States to take action against terrorism. Other\nelements in a more forceful multilateral system are\n15\n\ngreater attention to conflict prevention, better use of\nsanctions or \u201csmart sanctions\u201d, an upgrading of the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s inspections\nregime and, as suggested by President Chirac, a\npermanent instrument for inspections at the disposal of\nthe Security Council.\nMore robust multilateral action is also needed in\nour dealings with failed States. I am encouraged by the\nincreased willingness of the international community to\ntake more determined action. Liberia is a test case. The\nBrahimi report has shown us the right direction.\nPeacekeeping operations can only be effective if they\nare based on a strong mandate, fully implemented on\nthe ground and fully backed by the key players in the\nSecurity Council. The five permanent members bear a\nspecial responsibility for global peace and security\nNoblesse oblige.\nThe United Nations is now also at the centre of\nthe debate about Iraq. Let us put our past differences\non Iraq behind us. It is crucial now that the\ninternational community support the Iraqi people in\ntheir reconstruction efforts. I trust that the Security\nCouncil will reach agreement, as soon as possible, on\nwhat we all want, in other words, stabilization, security\nand transfer of sovereignty to a legitimate Iraqi\ngovernment. This will also allow the United Nations\nand the other multilateral institutions to make their\nindispensable contributions to a better future for the\nIraqi people.\nA stronger United Nations is also needed for the\neffective promotion and protection of human rights. I\nregret that we do not live up to the expectations of the\noppressed. The great dependence of the United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights on voluntary\ncontributions is a major concern. His office should\ninstead receive a larger allocation from the regular\nUnited Nations budget. The promotion and protection\nof human rights is United Nations core business.\nSpeaking of human rights, there is no doubt that\nterrorism itself ranks as one of the most serious threats\nto democracy and the enjoyment of human rights.\nTerrorists seek to destroy democracy, freedom and\ntolerance. If we sacrifice those universal values in the\nstruggle against terrorists, we play into their hands.\nIf I may speak for a moment as Chairman-in-\nOffice of the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE), I can assure you that\nour experience shows that policies aimed at promoting\nhuman rights, the rule of law and good governance can\nreinforce each other as parts of a more comprehensive\nsecurity strategy. The International Criminal Court is\nanother example of how to ensure that international\nnorms are upheld in cases where national Governments\nfail to do so.\nOn the trafficking of human beings, women and\nchildren in particular, I share the concerns expressed by\nPresident Bush. He was right to draw a comparison\nwith slavery. For the OSCE, the threat posed by the\ninternational trafficking of drugs, of small arms and of\nwomen and children is a top priority. We have already\ntaken concrete action, adopting the OSCE Action Plan\nto combat trafficking in human beings as an instrument\nfor protecting our people. This Action Plan could serve\nas a model for worldwide action.\nYet another reason why we need a robust\nmultilateral system is that we must break the cycles of\npoverty and violence we witness in many parts of\nAfrica. This implies restoring stability and order as a\nprecondition for reconstruction and development. It\nalso requires an integrated approach. To this end my\nGovernment will set up a stability fund to tackle the\ntwin challenges of development and security. Because\ndevelopment and security are closely linked, the\nMillennium Development Goals should remain at the\ncentre of our policies. The Netherlands remains\ncommitted to allocating 0.8 per cent of our gross domestic\nproduct to development cooperation and I call on all\ncountries to implement their Monterrey commitments.\nBut development is not just a matter of aid, it will also\ndepend on liberalizing trade. I am disappointed that the\nWorld Trade Organization Ministerial Conference in\nCanc\u00fan failed to produce results.\nThe legitimacy of the decisions of the Security\nCouncil is questioned because the composition of the\nCouncil no longer reflects today\u2019s geopolitical realities.\nHowever, expansion is not a solution in itself.\nEffectiveness can easily fall victim to the quest for\nlegitimacy. Crucial to restored legitimacy is better\ninteraction between the members of the Council and\nthe United Nations membership at large. Members of\nthe Council should represent relevant and broad\nsections of world opinion.\nI agree with the Secretary-General that we need\nto take a hard look at the existing architecture of\ninternational institutions. Many other organizations I\nknow well, such as the OSCE, the European Union\n16\n\n(EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n(NATO) (and I hope to get to know the last\norganization even better in the near future), are in the\nprocess of redefining their roles in drastically changed\ncircumstances. The United Nations cannot be left\nbehind. Interaction between the United Nations on the\none hand, and regional organizations such as the\nOSCE, the EU and NATO on the other, is growing.\nThere is considerable scope for intensifying that\ninteraction, as is indeed foreseen in the Charter.\nAs the Italian Presidency of the European Union\nillustrated in its intervention here some days ago, the\nUnited Nations can count on the EU in the quest for\nrobust multilateralism. As a member State of the EU, the\nNetherlands fully endorses the Presidency\u2019s statement.\nThe EU\u2019s new emphasis on countering the proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction in its common foreign and\nsecurity policy is an example of how we want our\ncommon efforts to be in the vanguard.\nLet me now focus on the General Assembly. Take\nthe example of how we deal with the Israeli-Palestinian\nconflict. Let us connect the General Assembly to\nreality. Instead of dealing with 23 resolutions, should\nwe not try to find our strength in a more focused\ncentral message, supported by all, a message that calls\nupon both Israel and the Palestinians to put an end to\nthe bloodshed and violence and to immediately\nimplement the road map as the only viable way to long-\nlasting peace? The EU will continue to do all it can,\ntogether with its partners in the Quartet, to help\nPalestinians and Israelis reach that destination. I hope\nthat this Assembly can contribute.\nThe Assembly should be made more effective. I\nneed not repeat what you all know about overlapping\nor hardly relevant agenda items, repetitive debates and\nresolutions and the prevalence of the lowest common\ndenominator. As a contribution to improvement, my\ncountry tabled the Greentree report, the result of a\nseminar involving representatives from a wide circle of\ncountries. The Greentree report aims at restoring the\nGeneral Assembly to its rightful place as the centre\nstage for worldwide deliberations on our common\nproblems. We are certain that in that endeavour, we\nwill be able to count on the leadership and wisdom of\nthe President of the General Assembly.\nMy Government wholeheartedly supports the\ndecision of the Secretary-General to establish a panel\nof eminent persons. We look forward to his\nrecommendations for next year\u2019s session of the\nAssembly. Meanwhile, we should not sit back and wait.\nIt is upon us Member States to engage now in the\ndebate on the pertinent reform questions the Secretary-\nGeneral has put to us.\nIn order to defuse the threats we face and to leave\na better world for future generations, we need to do\nmore than talk. We must act and we must act together.\nWe need clear rules and strong institutions \u2014\ninstitutions that ensure that the rules of the multilateral\ngame are respected, strengthened and enforced. We\nneed a multilateral system with teeth; we need a\nmultilateral system that works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffTo stand again at this\npodium today, representing Australia as its Foreign\nMinister, entering into the great conversation of\nnations, is an unsettling experience. Seldom has this\n31\n\nforum been confronted with so many dimensions of\nuncertainty, so many challenges to global peace,\nsecurity and orderly economic reform. Seldom has its\nown capacity for regeneration to deal with them been\nso insistently put to the test.\nConor Cruise O\u2019Brien, one of Ireland\u2019s finest\nwriters, an official and later ambassador here, famously\nremarked:\n\u201cThe cynicism necessary in the approach to\nthe United Nations must at some point be made to\nyield to reverence: the reverence which is\nappropriate to ... an institution which is\nhumanity\u2019s prayer to itself to be saved from\nitself.\u201d\nRecently one of Australia\u2019s foremost novelists,\nFrank Moorhouse, wrote a meditative essay on this\ntheme. In it he discerned a new pair of parallel world\norders:\n\u201cFor the first time in our lives, there are two\nvery powerful agents in world affairs \u2026 the\nUnited Nations Security Council \u2026 and the\nUnited States.\u201d\nHe noted that \u201cfor all the cynicism about the\nfutility of international intervention, pragmatically,\npeople are being helped daily by the United Nations\u201d\nand that \u201cvisionary and innovative international\nmissions\u201d continue to be conceived and achieved\nwithin it.\nMoorhouse\u2019s estimation of the significance of the\nUnited Nations is debatable. But a combination of\npragmatism, vision and reforming innovation is\nnecessary if, as I have already warned, this\nOrganization is to avoid frittering away its credibility\nand influence by failing to exercise its power\neffectively.\nIn the words of Secretary-General Annan, we\nshould not shy away from the need to improve and,\nwhere necessary, change the structure and function of\nthe United Nations and other international institutions\nto make sure they remain effective in promoting\nsecurity and peace.\nI alluded to the global challenges which confront\nus. First among them is the emergence of the \u201cage of\nterror\u201d. Where once it was possible to view terrorism\nas the lamentable legacy of a few unsafe regions, today\nalmost no country has been left untouched. Despite the\nwar on terror \u2014 a war we are winning \u2014 terrorism\ncontinues to be a scourge to which neither age,\nnationality, religion or political affiliation provides\nimmunity. It takes a considerable act of imaginative\nengagement to see these new forms of nihilism for\nwhat they really are. They are a negation of civilization\nand of the discourse that sustains it.\nI referred earlier to the visionary and innovative\nwork which sometimes only the United Nations can do.\nIn that context, I want to pause to pay tribute to the\nSecretary-General\u2019s senior representative in Baghdad,\nSergio Vieira de Mello, well known to many of you\nhere. That such a man, engaged in such vital tasks \u2014\nalong with so many of his colleagues \u2014 should have\nbeen swept by a terrorist bomb into the silent\ndemocracy of death epitomizes the struggle between\ncivilization and the unthinkable alternative.\nWe cannot allow terrorists to succeed in\ndetermining the course of world events. We must\noverwhelm their efforts to disrupt global security and\nprosperity, to undermine democratic countries or\ndestabilize nation-building.\nTerrorism has also created a new urgency in\nsolving a more familiar problem \u2014 the proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction. Efforts by rogue States to\ndevelop and traffic in weapons of mass destruction\nmaterials underpin the priority we give to non-\nproliferation. The possibility that weapons of mass\ndestruction might fall into the hands of terrorists makes\nit an absolute imperative. Terrorism and proliferation\ndo not occur in a vacuum \u2014 except, of course, a moral\nvacuum. It is no longer open to us to ignore the failed\nStates which have become their incubators or the\ntransnational crime on which they depend. The\npromotion of good governance and democratization are\nimperatives both morally and pragmatically. They have\nbecome preconditions for international security.\nGood governance serves both global and national\ninterests, as improved governance will fortify the\nUnited Nations itself. Without it, developing States will\nnever be able fully to realize the opportunities that\nglobalization presents: chiefly, the potential to erase\ndivisions between themselves and the developed world.\nThat can occur only if we are all prepared to accept the\ndisciplines that global trade liberalization imposes.\nWhile the prospects, post-Canc\u00fan, do not seem\nparticularly favourable, pursuing the Doha objectives\n32\n\nremains the best way to alleviate poverty and its\nattendant ills in the developing world.\nIn confronting these challenges \u2014 such as\nsecurity, governance, poverty, terrorism and\npandemics \u2014 collective action is likely to yield the\nbest results, since not even the most powerful among\nus can bear the burden alone. Effective regional action\nalso remains important. Australia has built, with its\nneighbours, a network of bilateral counter-terrorism\narrangements. These enhance practical, operational-\nlevel liaison among regional security, intelligence and\nlaw enforcement agencies that have seen terror attacks\nprevented, networks disrupted and terrorists arrested.\nSimilarly, we are developing regional approaches\nto confront the dangers of State failure. Together with\nour Pacific Island Forum partners, we are restoring\nhope for a better future to the people of Solomon\nIslands. This Regional Assistance Mission has already\nmade excellent progress in its efforts to restore law and\norder and to rebuild the institutions of governance.\nRequested by the Government of Solomon Islands and\nsupported and implemented by Pacific island nations,\nthe Mission is consistent with the United Nations\nCharter\u2019s original vision of strong regional efforts to\nmaintain international peace and security. Indeed, we\nwill continue to concentrate on improved standards of\ngovernance, which are central to our assistance in our\nown region. The Pacific Island Forum leaders recently\nendorsed efforts to promote more effective regional\ninstitutions and, where appropriate, the pooling of\nresources to ensure that services are both deliverable\nand sustainable.\nThe virtues of collective action are self-evident.\nBut collectivity ought not serve as a mantra which is an\nobstacle to effective action. Sometimes the most\neffective means of preserving security \u2014 and indeed\ninternational law \u2014 occur alongside the traditional\nmechanisms of multilateral diplomacy. Australia is a\nstrong supporter of multilateral institutions and\nprocesses, but only insofar as they are a means to an\neffective end.\nThe major global disarmament and non-\nproliferation treaties remain critical to setting norms of\ninternational order. But ultimately, those instruments\nmust be enforced. States are not merely entitled, but\nobliged, to take action to uphold those norms,\nespecially when the transfer of weapons of mass\ndestruction outside internationally agreed frameworks\nis involved. The conviction that States must uphold\ninternational norms \u2014 particularly in relation to\nweapons of mass destruction \u2014 led Australia to join\nthe coalition to disarm Iraq, and, in the same way, we\nrecently joined with others in what is known as the\nProliferation Security Initiative.\nAustralia believes the United Nations has a\ncritical role in promoting international peace and\nsecurity. First-hand experience in East Timor reminds\nus of that fact, and we look to the United Nations for\ncontinuing contributions to ensuring its stability.\nAustralia also appreciates the work of the United\nNations in rebuilding civil society in Iraq. Of the $100\nmillion Australia has committed to humanitarian and\nreconstruction assistance in Iraq, much has been\ndirected through United Nations agencies. Those are\ntwo examples in which the United Nations is playing a\npositive role.\nNevertheless, the role of the United Nations in\ninternational affairs is under critical scrutiny, and with\ngood reason. The United Nations, through its Member\nStates, needs to do much more to adapt to the evolving\nglobal environment. Australia has long been an\nadvocate of a more focused, efficient United Nations\nsystem. The Secretary-General\u2019s reforms to date \u2014 in\nparticular the Brahimi peacekeeping changes \u2014 have\nbeen a valuable start.\nRadical and fundamental change is now needed.\nThe Secretary-General rightly states that the General\nAssembly is bogged down with an unwieldy agenda\nand repetitive and sterile debates. We need to ask\nourselves, if much of the activity of the General\nAssembly \u2014 or indeed of the Economic and Social\nCouncil \u2014 did not occur, what practical difference\nwould it make, and would anyone notice?\nAgain, as Australia has long argued, the\ncomposition of the Security Council is out of step with\ngeopolitical realities. The permanent membership of\nthe Security Council should be expanded to reflect the\ncurrent realities \u2014 with the addition of countries such\nas Japan, India, Brazil, Indonesia and an African\nnation.\nWe support an overhaul of the United Nations\narchitecture, particularly in the light of new security\nthreats. The functioning of all the major United\nNations organs needs to be re-examined, as does the\ninter-relationship among them. Old shibboleths \u2014 such\nas the excessive homage to sovereignty, even at the\n33\n\nexpense of the preservation of humanity and human\nvalues \u2014 should not constrain us. We must end absurd\nduplication of effort. We should refocus the United\nNations on areas where it can and should make a very\nreal difference. But we must be imaginative and bold.\nThe group system, for example, needs\nmodernization. Australia could become part of an East\nAsia and Pacific grouping, and the old divide of\nEastern and Western Europe should be dispensed with\nto reflect the new, converging European reality. That\nwould form the basis for greater regional cooperation\nwithin the United Nations system, for greater\nengagement and problem-solving on a regional scale.\nIn short, we must work urgently on a bold\nblueprint for revitalization, which we should consider\nby the summer of next year. That is why we welcome\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s proposal for a high-level\nreview panel. Real commitment to change \u2014 which\ncan be endorsed at a second San Francisco\nConference \u2014 will be necessary if the United Nations\nis to rediscover its credibility and its promise."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAgain this\nyear, we are meeting to assess our actions and to define\napproaches that can breathe new life into the\nOrganization. Far from becoming a routine, our annual\nmeeting is the high point in the life of the\nOrganization, in that it offers to each Member State,\nthrough a frank and constructive debate, an opportunity\n6\n\nto make its contribution to the building of peace and\nsecurity, which are indispensable to the just and lasting\ndevelopment of our countries. It is also an opportunity\nfor us to reaffirm the paramount role of the United\nNations in the world and to find appropriate ways to\nstrengthen the Organization further.\nBefore I proceed, let me express \u2014 on behalf of\nthe President of the Togolese Republic, His Excellency\nMr. Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyadema, and of the Government and\nthe people of Togo, whom I have the honour to\nrepresent at this rostrum \u2014 my warm congratulations\non the election of Mr. Julian Hunte as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-eighth session. Our\ncongratulations go also to the other members of the\nBureau. They can be assured of the full availability and\ncooperation of the Togolese delegation. I should also\nlike to express our appreciation and profound gratitude\nto Mr. Hunte\u2019s predecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, who led the\nwork of the fifty-seventh session of the Assembly with\ndexterity and skill. To the Secretary-General, we\nreaffirm how much we admire him for the work that he\ncontinues to lead at the head of the Organization.\nThis General Assembly session is taking place at\na particular time of evolution for the United Nations.\nIndeed, in the light of the grave events being\nexperienced by today\u2019s world, the United Nations\nneeds more than ever before to be strengthened so that\nit can fully accomplish the primary tasks entrusted to it\nby the Charter: inter alia, maintaining international\npeace and security and serving as a forum where the\nefforts of nations can be harmonized towards the\nachievement of collective development and shared\nwell-being. It is obvious that the Organization\u2019s\npurposes and principles retain all their relevance and\nremain guideposts for action on the part of the\ninternational community.\nIn my delegation\u2019s view, this session must\nintensify its reflection with a view to defining new\napproaches that will enable the United Nations to\nsearch for more viable and lasting solutions to the\nproblems of peace, security and development, which\ndaily challenge the entire international community. We\nmust therefore support United Nations actions,\nespecially at a time when peoples are aspiring to more\nfreedom and democracy and to greater involvement in\nthe management of civic affairs.\nThe democratic wind that is blowing through our\ncountry is far more than an irresistible movement for\nrenewal; it holds immense hopes for our people. For\nTogo, that is what has justified the people\u2019s support for\nthe political reform that the Government has been\nundertaking for more than a decade and a half. Here, I\nshould like to recall the faith and determination with\nwhich the Togolese Government \u2014 spurred on by of its\nhead of State \u2014 is striving to build a democratic\nsociety that will take everyone\u2019s legitimate aspirations\ninto account and that is rooted in the country\u2019s\nsociological realities. In essence, we are engaged in\nthis democratization process in the conviction that the\ntask \u2014 which will be long-term \u2014 requires much\nresolve, patience and self-sacrifice.\nFrom this rostrum, I should like to stress that,\nthrough the recent presidential election \u2014 which was\nfree, honest and fair in the general view of\nobservers \u2014 a broad majority of the Togolese people\ndemonstrated their political maturity and their keen\nsense of the general interest, which must take\nprecedence over partisan and personal interests. In any\nevent, I can assure the Assembly that the Togolese\npeople \u2014 who know how to go the extra mile \u2014 are\ndetermined to move forward. The Government, for its\npart, is resolved to continue the process of\ndemocratization and establishing the rule of law,\nstrengthening its foundations through the local and\nsenatorial elections whose preparations are now under\nway.\nOne can never emphasize enough that the\ndifficulties related to the whole democratization\nprocess are not limited to one country or to a specific\ngroup of countries; they are inherent in any endeavour\nwhose objective is to involve people in the\nmanagement of public affairs. The path towards\ndemocracy is long and fraught with pitfalls, but we are\nworking tirelessly to provide the country with\ndemocratic institutions which are indispensable to the\nproper functioning under a rule of law. The quest for\ndemocracy \u2014 a contemporary development that Togo\nfully endorses \u2014 is a complex undertaking that\nrequires time. Indeed, democracy can take shape only\nin an environment of peace and security, which alone\ncan guarantee gradual assimilation of democratic\nvalues that are well understood and that emanate from\nthe wisdom of the culture and traditions of the peoples\nconcerned. In that spirit, Togo is striving to establish\nthe rule of law in the hope that we will be understood\nby our partners.\n7\n\nToday, we can affirm that, despite the difficulties\nbesetting our march towards the establishment of\ndemocracy, encouraging and concrete results have been\nachieved. Above and beyond institutional development,\nensuring full human rights in all their aspects is a\nparamount necessity. Here, we wish to emphasize the\nTogolese Government\u2019s primary concern to guarantee\nand promote the economic, social and cultural rights of\nall Togolese citizens. The realization of those rights is\nof particular importance, for in them lie the interests of\ndemocracy and the stability of the Republic\u2019s\ninstitutions.\nIndeed, if one takes a careful look at Africa\u2019s\ncontemporary history, one will note that the many\nsudden changes and various attempts challenging\ndemocratic institutions in some countries result less\nfrom a misunderstanding of the democratic process\nthan from the economic and financial difficulties felt\nby various social strata. The success of the democratic\nundertaking is therefore a function of the economic\npossibilities of the States that are engaged in it, and\nestablishing institutions requires considerable\nresources that our countries cannot muster at the\ncurrent stage of their development without foreign aid.\nIf that observation is universally shared, why impose\nsanctions against \u2014 and suspend cooperation with \u2014 a\ncountry that, like many other States, has encountered\ndifficulties in implementing its democratization policy\nand is undertaking notable efforts to establish the rule\nof law? Does my country, Togo, deserve the treatment\nthat it has received for the past 10 years?\nI would like, once again, to appeal for the\nresumption of cooperation with Togo. That is the\nappeal of an entire people. Peace and security, which\nreign in Togo, and the outstanding efforts to ensure\neconomic and social development, despite the\nsuspension of aid, clearly support the expectations of\nthe Togolese people.\nWhile the elimination of poverty is considered an\nessential task to be tackled to help a people or a\ncountry rebuild, it is also the same thing as giving it the\nmeans to consolidate democracy, which is essential to\nbuild a more just and peaceful world.\nThe need for solidarity, justice and equity must\nlead the international community, particularly the\nEuropean Union and other development partners, to\nreconsider their position and to commit to supporting\nthe reconstruction effort in Togo, a country that has\nmade peace and security the very foundation of its\ninternal and external policies.\nThat said, Togo believes firmly that the use of\nsanctions, if not properly measured and without time\nlimits, will only increase people\u2019s poverty, particularly\nthat of women, the elderly and children. Such sanctions\nprovide, therefore, fertile ground for disorder and\nanarchy. The Assembly must, therefore, think about\nthis question more deeply.\nOur faith in peace and security is reflected in the\nconcrete results of a bold and visionary economic\npolicy, which is carried out untiringly, despite adverse\ntimes. This conviction is also justified by the fact that\npeace and social cohesion remain, undoubtedly, the\nbasic factors, without which any socio-economic\ndevelopment would be carried out ineffectively and\nwith only illusory results. Peace and security are,\ntherefore, priorities for all countries, whether they are\nin Africa or elsewhere in the world.\nAt the African level, the head of State of Togo is\nvery engaged in the process of conflict settlement. By\nway of example, let me recall prior outstanding and\neffective mediation efforts in which he played a role in\nsettling crises that have afflicted Chad, Sierra Leone,\nthe Great Lakes region, Guinea-Bissau and, most\nrecently, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\nRegarding its contribution to peacekeeping\noperations, I wish to recall that Togo is contributing in\na meaningful and active way to the deployment of\nmilitary or police contingents at the subregional level\nor in United Nations peacekeeping operations; in\nNamibia in 1989, in Rwanda in 1993, in Haiti in 1993,\nin the Central African Republic in 1997, in Guinea-\nBissau in 1999, and recently in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and\nLiberia.\nWith regard to Liberia, we welcome the\nestablishment by the Security Council, on 19\nSeptember 2003, of the United Nations Mission in\nLiberia, which will be deployed on 1 October \u2014 in just\na few hours. It will contribute to supporting in a\nmeaningful way the peacekeeping force of the\nEconomic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS).\nMy country, which contributed to restoring that\npeace by sending a contingent, urges the wealthy\ncountries to contribute to financing the United Nations\n8\n\nforce in order to provide it with the necessary means to\naccomplish its mission.\nIn the Great Lakes region, particularly the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, the Togolese\nGovernment hopes ardently that the new stage,\ncharacterized by the establishment of a new\nGovernment and other transitional institutions, will\nlead to stability, unity and national reconciliation.\nIn Burundi, my country welcomed the significant\nprogress made on the basis of the Arusha Agreement,\nand it urges the parties to the conflict to work\nresolutely toward restoring peace to the country. Togo\nis very involved in the settlement of disputes in Africa,\ndemonstrating clearly its firm determination to\ncontribute to maintaining and to consolidating peace in\nthe African continent. It was in that context that the\nPresident of the Togolese Republic advocated the\nestablishment of an African peacekeeping force at the\n1994 summit of the Organization of African Unity.\nIt is worth noting that that idea made headway in\nthe Organization of African Unity, as is attested by the\nadoption at Durban, South Africa, of a protocol on the\nestablishment of the Peace and Security Council of the\nAfrican Union, which demonstrates the determination\nof Africans to be the builders themselves of peace in\nAfrica. It is also comforting to note that, within the\ncontext of that protocol, the establishment of a pre-\npositioned African peace force and a continental early\nwarning system are taking shape.\nMy country is committed to making its\ncontribution to the implementation of this collective\napproach to questions of defence, peace and security in\nAfrica, and calls on the international community to\nfirmly support the African continent with a view to\nguaranteeing the success of this effort.\nOutside of Africa, we are constantly watching\nIraq and the Middle East, always in the grip of\nviolence. Regarding the Middle East in particular, my\ncountry considers that the definitive settlement of the\nPalestinian question, which is at the heart of the\nconflict in the region, necessarily requires the cessation\nof violence and counter-violence and consideration of\nthe legitimate rights of both people \u2014 the right of\nIsrael to live in full security within internationally\nrecognized borders and that of the Palestinian people to\nfully enjoy their national rights, including the\nestablishment of a State.\nIn that context, we encourage Israelis and\nPalestinians to pursue dialogue, with a view to\nachieving a negotiated and comprehensive settlement\nof the Middle East question.\nDespite a new environment conducive to\neconomic expansion, poverty continues to increase and\nremains a striking and paradoxical feature of our era.\nPeace and security will constantly be threatened if\nmeasures of justice are not adopted to push back the\nborders of poverty that weaken the foundations of our\nsociety.\nThe economic situation of developing countries,\nparticularly in Africa, is a matter of great concern. The\nexternal debt burden, instability in export income and\nthe devastating effects stemming from deterioration in\nterms of trade have largely contributed to aggravating\nthe deterioration of socio-economic conditions in many\nAfrican countries.\nSpeaking of international trade, it is unfortunate\nto note that, despite liberalization of the economy,\nindustrialized countries continue to practice\nprotectionist measures in the industrial and agricultural\nsectors. These measures, particularly harmful to\ndeveloping countries, particularly African countries,\nimpede the efforts made to restore increased export\nincome.\nLike many other delegations, Togo demands,\ntherefore, that protectionist practices and subsidies be\nended. That would contribute significantly to the\ndevelopment of poor countries. We believe that\nglobalization must be accompanied by a greater spirit\nof solidarity and by a policy aimed at the purchase of\nproducts from the South at fairer and more lucrative\nprices.\nIn that regard, the Togolese Government wishes\nto emphasize that, if they are to benefit all, the rules of\nthe World Trade Organization (WTO) must take into\naccount the deep aspirations of developing countries,\nwhich demand that they be able to participate in\ninternational trade in conditions of equality and justice,\nas recently emphasized at Canc\u00fan.\nAt a time when our continent is doing its utmost\nto make the African Union the priority instrument to\nensure peace and security and economic and social\nprosperity, the international community must become\nmore involved to assist economic recovery efforts of\n9\n\nour States, in order to meet the challenges they face,\nsuch as poverty, the AIDS pandemic and malaria.\nIt is important that our common Organization\nmobilize its efforts even more in order to fight the evils\nthat afflict the world and make it vulnerable. Terrorism\nwould definitely be included among those evils. The\nterrible events of 11 September 2001 and the recent\ndeadly attacks against the United Nations headquarters\nin Iraq and elsewhere, still alive within us, compel us\nto act promptly to eradicate this evil. My country,\nwhich has frequently been the victim of terrorist\naggression, in 1977, 1985, 1986, 1993, 1994 and 1998,\nrecognizes the importance of that challenge. This task\nshould be one of our highest priorities if we wish to\ngive future generations a sound world, in which respect\nfor human dignity, love and fraternity are the\nfoundation.\nIn order to achieve those aims, the United\nNations must assume greater responsibility and provide\nmore resources. It certainly needs to be substantially\nreformed. We would like to welcome the relevant\nproposals of the Secretary-General to establish a panel\nof eminent personalities from civil society to address\nthis issue. We remain convinced that our actions, taken\ntogether, will lead to the reign of a society free from\nselfishness, violence, terrorism, disease and the threat\nof nuclear confrontation. May the work of this session\nlead each of our States to resolutely follow the path\ntowards peace and ensure that all peoples, without\ndiscrimination, can enjoy the fruits of progress made\nby humanity in a climate of tolerance, justice,\nfraternity and solidarity.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me, at the outset, to\nextend my warm felicitations to you, Sir, on your\nassumption of the presidency of the fifty-eighth session\nof the General Assembly. Your vast experience and\ndiplomatic skills augur well for the success of our\ndeliberations. I would also like to express our gratitude\nand appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan,\nfor his invaluable contribution to the success of the\nprevious session of the General Assembly. We also pay\ntribute to the Secretary-General for his tireless efforts\nin leading the Organization through challenging times.\nWe are meeting at a time when the world is facing\ndaunting challenges. In addition to the perennial\nproblems of extreme poverty, the spread of infectious\ndiseases such as HIV/AIDS and environmental\ndegradation, we are faced with the challenge posed by\nnew forms of terrorism. We must confront all those\nchallenges squarely if we are to fulfil the vision of\nglobal prosperity and collective security set out in the\nDeclaration of the Millennium Summit, three years\nago.\nThe United Nations has a vital role to play in\nensuring peace and security. Myanmar firmly believes\nthat the Organization must be revitalized to accomplish\nour objectives. We cannot overcome the complex\nproblems that beset our world without universal\ncommitment to multilateralism and a reaffirmation of\nfaith in the central role of the United Nations in the\npromotion of global peace and security. The\nimportance of multilateralism and the need for\ncountries to strictly abide by the principles of\ninternational law cannot be overemphasized. Indeed,\nMember States, both large and small, have an interest\nand a responsibility to uphold the Charter of the United\nNations.\nMore than ever before, our world needs greater\ninternational solidarity and cooperation. In that respect,\nwe welcome the intention of the Secretary-General to\nreform the United Nations into a more effective\nOrganization.\n15\n\nMy delegation also shares the Secretary-General's\nconcern that the pre-emptive use of force could set\nprecedents that could result in a proliferation of the\nunilateral and lawless use of force, with or without\njustification.\nRecent attacks by terrorists in Baghdad, Bali,\nCasablanca, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Mumbai and other\nplaces serve to remind us of the grim fact that the fight\nagainst terrorism is not over. It is evident that the use\nof force alone cannot wipe out terrorism. If we wish to\nachieve enduring results, we must address such\nfundamental problems as the persistence of extreme\npoverty, the disparity of income between and within\ncountries, racial and religious prejudice and attempts\nby some countries to impose their values on small and\ndeveloping countries.\nTerrorism poses a common threat to humankind.\nIt respects neither borders nor religion nor race. All\nnations must therefore join hands to meet the challenge\nposed by terrorists. It is only through increased\ncooperation at the national, regional and international\nlevels that we can hope to overcome that menace. I\nwish to reiterate that Myanmar is against all forms of\nterrorism. We have had bitter experiences with\nterrorism in our own country and we are firmly\ncommitted to work with the international community to\nprevent, counter and eliminate that terrible scourge of\nhumankind.\nLast month, terrorists brought their war to the\ndoorsteps of our Organization when they attacked the\nUnited Nations headquarters in Baghdad. They took the\nlives of 22 people, including that of Mr. Sergio Vieira\nde Mello, one of the most outstanding international\ncivil servants. We join the rest of the world in paying\ntribute to his memory and profess our profound sadness\nover the loss of the life of the Special Representative,\nand of other lives, in that unwarranted attack.\nI would now like to turn to recent political\ndevelopments in my country. Some have accused us of\ndeliberately creating a political impasse in order to\ndelay the transfer of power. If one takes a close and\nobjective look at the situation in the country, one will\nsee that what needs to be done to effect a smooth\ntransition to democracy is, first and foremost, to have\nthe political will to do so. Let me assure the General\nAssembly that we have that political will. We are\nfirmly committed to bringing about a systematic\ntransformation to democracy. In the past, successive\nGovernments in Myanmar failed in their attempts to\nbuild a multiparty democratic system, because they\nwere unable to overcome the fundamental issues facing\nthe nation, namely, the issues of peace and stability,\nnational unity among all national races   which\nnumber more than 100   economic development and\nhuman resources development. Attempts were made\nwithout first solving those fundamental problems; the\ncountry drifted and the people suffered.\nThe present Government, aware of the fact that\nfundamental issues must first be addressed, adopted a\ndifferent approach. It laid down four political\nobjectives: first, to establish peace and stability in the\nwhole nation and to ensure the prevalence of law and\norder; secondly, to consolidate unity among all national\nraces; thirdly, to strive for a durable Constitution; and,\nfourthly, to build a modern and democratic nation in\nkeeping with the new Constitution.\nAt the outset, an olive branch was extended to the\narmed groups that had been fighting the Government\nfor decades. Following successful negotiations, those\ngroups returned to the legal fold. National unity was\nachieved. Peace now reigns in the entire country,\nproviding an opportunity for long-neglected border\nareas to develop quickly. The gap between urban and\nrural areas has been narrowed. At the same time, we\nhave taken developmental initiatives to promote a\nbetter life for our peoples. We have worked tirelessly to\nprovide better health care, education and housing for\nall our peoples. We have had to rebuild the country\nfrom scratch.\nThose who come to Myanmar will be able to\nobserve at first hand the immense transformations\ntaking place in the country. As the adage goes, seeing\nis believing. Today our people can look forward to the\nfuture with confidence and renewed hope. Now that\nfirm foundations have been laid, we have moved on to\nthe next phase to commence work on the drafting of a\nnew Constitution and to build a modern democratic\nnation in keeping with it.\nThe new Prime Minister, General Khin Nyunt,\nwho was appointed on 25 August 2003, outlined a road\nmap for the transition to democracy. The seven-step\nprogramme includes, first, the reconvening of the\nNational Convention, which has been adjourned since\n1996; secondly, after the successful holding of the\nNational Convention, the step-by-step implementation\nof the process necessary for the emergence of a\n16\n\ngenuine and disciplined democratic system; thirdly, the\ndrafting of a new Constitution in accordance with basic\nprinciples and the detailed basic principles to be laid\ndown by the National Convention; fourthly, the\nadoption of the Constitution through a national\nreferendum; fifthly, the holding of free and fair\nelections for pyithu hluttaws, or legislative bodies,\naccording to the new Constitution; sixthly, the\nconvening of hluttaws attended by hluttaw members in\naccordance with the new Constitution; and, seventhly,\nthe building of a modern, developed and democratic\nnation by the State leaders elected by the hluttaw, the\nGovernment and other central organs formed by the\nhluttaw. All strata of the country's population have\nadopted a unified approach and supported the road\nmap.\nIn recent weeks, Myanmar has taken substantial\nsteps on the road to democracy. It is important that the\ninternational community recognize those positive\nchanges; credit must be given where credit is due.\nMyanmar is working to ensure an environment in\nwhich we can achieve our objectives. The people of\nMyanmar are enthusiastic about consolidating the\nprogress achieved thus far. At the same time, we seek\nto maintain good and friendly relations with all\ncountries in the region and in the rest of the world so\nthat we can thrive and prosper. We have never posed a\nsecurity threat to any neighbour, and we have always\nsought to promote regional peace and stability and the\ncommon weal of all our nations.\nIt is disconcerting that some countries have\nchosen to turn a blind eye to reality and have subjected\nMyanmar to a wide array of unfair economic sanctions\nfor their own political ends. Those unilateral coercive\nmeasures not only go against the spirit and the letter of\nthe Charter of the United Nations, but also violate\ninternational law and rules of international trade. They\nare intrinsically unfair and only add to the hardships of\npeople already marginalized by globalization.\nCountries that place a high premium on democracy and\nhuman rights have a responsibility to live up to those\nnoble ideals in their relations with others. Our common\naspirations to peace and development can be fulfilled\nonly if nations avoid double standards and adopt a\nmore positive attitude.\nWe live in challenging and dangerous times.\nConflicts and tensions in various parts of the world\nthreaten global peace and security. Transnational\ncrimes and new forms of terrorism also add to our\nproblems. Yet it is in our power to make the world a\nbetter place. Here, it is pertinent to recall what I stated\nlast year in this hallowed Hall: if we want to ensure a\nbetter future for mankind, we must heed the teachings\nof the world's great religions. Every religion calls for\ntolerance, understanding and compassion for fellow\nhuman beings. Only when we can overcome anger and\nhatred and do away with false pride and prejudice will\nwe succeed in establishing a world in which peace and\njustice prevail.\nAll conflicts, rivalries and hostilities have their\nroots in hatred and enmity. We must try to overcome\nthem. We should all try to build a global order where\nthe strong will not impose their will on the weak and\nwhere democracy prevails not only within nations, but\nalso in the international arena. Let us work together, as\na family of nations, to overcome the serious common\nchallenges that we face.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me at the\nvery outset offer my warm congratulations to Mr.\nHunte on his election to preside over this fifty-eighth\nsession of the General Assembly. With his proven skills\nin the field of international affairs and his wide-ranging\nexperience, we are confident that we will deal\neffectively with the many crucial tasks facing this\nAssembly. I assure him of the full support and best\nwishes of my delegation as he carries out the tasks of\nhis high office.\nLet me also extend our appreciation to the\noutgoing President, Mr. Jan Kavan, whose committed\nefforts guided the fifty-seventh session of this\nAssembly.\nI wish to express my delegation\u2019s appreciation for\nthe indefatigable efforts of the Secretary-General to\npreserve and enhance the role of our Organization last\nyear, which proved to be one of the most difficult in its\nexistence. One sad sign of this was the bombing of the\nUnited Nations headquarters in Baghdad last month,\nwhich took the lives of Sergio Vieira de Mello and 21\nother persons of different nationalities. It was a\nmonstrous act that deserved strong and universal\ncondemnation. Nothing could justify such a senseless\nattack against the civil personnel of a mission whose\naims were none other than to help the Iraqi people to\nface the tragic situation in which they are living. We\nthus pay our respectful homage to the memory of those\ndedicated persons who lost their lives in the tragedy.\nMy country fully cooperates with the United\nNations bodies in the struggle against terrorism and\norganized crime. However, the fight against terrorism\nshould not lead the international community to\ndownplay the importance of promoting development\nand fighting poverty and everything associated with it,\nincluding hunger, illness, illiteracy and environmental\ndegradation. Nor should the international community\nforget the need to guarantee the respect of the rights of\npeoples and individuals, combat discrimination and all\nits aspects that deprive human beings of their dignity.\nVery relevant proposals concerning the future of\nour Organization have been presented by the Secretary-\nGeneral. He stressed the need to accelerate the reform\nof the United Nations by adapting it to the realities of\nthe world in which we live, namely addressing the\nquestion of enlarging the Security Council and\nincreasing the number of its permanent members,\nstrengthening the General Assembly and reinvigorating\nthe role of the United Nations Economic and Social\nCouncil (ECOSOC), as well as of the United Nations\nas a whole, including its relationship with the Bretton\nWoods institutions.\nBy their size, economic power, regional and\ninternational influence, there are obvious candidates to\nbecome permanent members of the Security Council.\nTheir weight in international affairs can no longer be\noverlooked. We should not lose sight of the fact that\ntheir contributions to peace, security and development\ncan bring more legitimacy to the body. The time is ripe\nto welcome those countries in an enlarged and more\nrepresentative Security Council, in which Africa should\nhave at least two permanent seats.\nBeing a member of the Community of Portuguese\nSpeaking Countries (CPLP), Brazil should, in our view,\ntake a permanent seat in the Council.\nThe issues relating to the reform of the United\nNations have been the subject of a longstanding debate\nthat points to an overwhelming consensus among\nMember States. My delegation supports the proposals\nmade by the Secretary-General and hopes that the\nmomentum provided by acknowledgement of the\nchallenges, threats and dangers faced by the world will\nbe seized by this Assembly and instil its members with\nthe sense of urgency to come up with appropriate\nbinding and pragmatic decisions relating to these\nissues.\n18\n\nAs the President of the Assembly rightly pointed\nout in his inaugural speech, \u201cMany developing\ncountries do not have a wide range of development\nchoices available to them and in fact face serious\nchallenges due to their special circumstances.\u201d\nAmong these developing countries the\ninternational community recognized small island\ndeveloping states as a special case of development and\nenvironment. It will be during the mandate of the\ncurrent President of the General Assembly that, by\nhappy coincidence, an international meeting will be\nheld in Mauritius to assess the state of implementation\nof the Barbados Programme of Action.\nEarlier this month, Cape Verde hosted the second\nregional preparatory meeting in anticipation of the\nMauritius event. In this context, I would like to\nunderline the meaning of my country\u2019s commitment to\nthe process of global support to the sustainable\ndevelopment of small island developing states, a\nprocess to which my Government is fully dedicated.\nThe SIDS denomination has now been in\nexistence for nearly a decade. The work accomplished\nby the United Nations toward a greater international\nawareness of the problems of small island developing\nstates has been generally successful.\nI take this opportunity to express my\nGovernment\u2019s gratitude to the entire United Nations\nsystem for the central role it has played in cultivating\nand maintaining the high degree of international\nawareness that is essential to our countries.\nHowever, the recognition of a special category of\ncountries cannot be justified for the purposes of\nclassification alone. One would expect that the special\ndesignation would lead to some minimal amount of\nspecial treatment of the countries concerned,\ncommensurate with their specific disadvantages and\nhandicaps. Regrettably that is not the case with the\nsmall island developing states. In fact, island-specific\nspecial treatment is almost non-existent, even though\nmany SIDS are in dire need of greater differentiation in\nthe current pattern of international cooperation.\nI therefore wish to convey my Government\u2019s\nhope that the Barbados Programme of Action +10\nprocess, culminating in the Mauritius international\nmeeting, will constitute a landmark in the history of the\ndifferentiated treatment of developing countries,\nparticularly small island developing States.\nThe need for special consideration that is most\ncommonly shared by small island developing states is\nthe need to see market-access preferences preserved,\nnot eroded. Such a need is not a luxury, but a\nprerequisite for many SIDS in their efforts to maintain\ncompetitiveness and economic viability in response to\nthe structural disadvantages resulting from their\nremoteness and small size.\nWhile several SIDS do enjoy a fair amount of\nspecial treatment, such as the treatment derived from\nleast developed country (LDC), African, Caribbean and\nPacific States (ACP) or African Growth and\nOpportunity Act (AGOA) status, there are still areas of\ninternational cooperation in which the absence of\nreference to island status is difficult to understand. One\nof these areas \u2014 of direct relevance to the question of\ntrade preferences \u2014 is the ongoing debate in the World\nTrade Organization concerning the Work Programme\non Small Economies, a debate in which small island\ndeveloping states, regrettably, have not been able to\nadvocate their case under the SIDS designation.\nCape Verde has again been deemed to qualify for\ngraduation from least developed country (LDC) status\nunder the criteria and graduation rules used by the\nCommittee for Development Policy and the Economic\nand Social Council. As stressed by my delegation in\nthe substantive session of the Council in July, we feel\nthat a decision to graduate Cape Verde from least\ndeveloped country status at this juncture would give\nthe international community a gravely incorrect\nimpression of our structural progress and prosperity,\nwhereas Cape Verde remains one of the most\neconomically vulnerable and aid-dependent countries\nin the world.\nHere we are faced with a peculiar paradox: in the\ncontext of its support to small island developing states\nthe United Nations system recognizes the permanent\nhandicaps of a country, but, at the same time, it is\nconsidering withdrawing the special treatment this\ncountry has been eligible for, without leaving any\nalternative treatment available.\nIn this context, and in the light of the\ninternational recognition of the special handicaps of\nsmall island developing states, my Government urges\nthe General Assembly to request the relevant bodies of\nthe United Nations system to re-examine with care the\nrule whereby a least developed country would be seen\nas qualifying for graduation. We believe that such re-\n19\n\nexamination ought to result in a methodological reform\nthat will do justice to the least developed small island\ndeveloping States.\nAfrica has made a remarkable effort to respond\npositively to the call of the international community\nand its own peoples to foster development, promote\ndemocracy, transparency, good governance, the rule of\nlaw and accountability. In the wake of this call African\nleaders agreed to establish the New Partnership for\nAfrica\u2019s Development (NEPAD), in whose success we\nare all engaged in order to lead our continent out of\npoverty and conflict, ushering in a new era of\nprosperity and peace. Its adoption not only by the\nAfrican Governments and civil societies but also by the\ninternational community as a framework for African\ndevelopment will help establish common goals and\nclear commitments that will lead our continent on a\npromising new journey. We believe that the NEPAD\nproject should pay special attention to the situation of\nthe island States.\nNoticeable progress has been achieved, both in\nthe manner of installing democratic Governments\nthroughout the continent and in putting an end to\nconflicts.\nIn this particular case, we are heartened by the\nrecent accord between the Sudanese Government and\nthe Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army. This constitutes a\nvery significant step towards putting an end to the\nsuffering of the Sudanese people. If, as we all\nanxiously hope, this agreement brings peace to that\ngreat African nation, it will add to the successes\nalready registered in Mozambique, Angola and Sierra\nLeone, along with the ongoing processes in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, the Great Lakes\nand Liberia.\nWe must be cautious, however. Conflicts result\nfrom unsettled social and political issues. If these are\nnot adequately tackled, the risk of new conflicts will\npersist. It is important to recall that democracy and the\nrule of law can develop unhindered only when and if\nthe minimum conditions for survival are assured for the\npopulations and when the rights of individuals and\ngroups, including minorities, are respected.\nThe events in Guinea-Bissau two weeks ago\nillustrate the fragility of the institutions in a country\nthat cannot address the basic problems of its\npopulation. While it may be true that political leaders\nmust be held accountable for not ensuring good\ngovernance, in an environment of poverty, lack of\nresources and indebtedness good governance is easily\nset aside. These events point to the need for a stronger\ncommitment of the international community to helping\ncountries in distress face the tasks of fighting poverty,\nconsolidating democratic institutions and promoting\neconomic and social development not only with\npromises and advice, but also with concrete means.\nNotwithstanding the serious threats that hover\nover mankind, a safer, more just and more peaceful\nworld is now within reach of our living generations.\nNever before has mankind had such an array of means\nto face the great challenges that continue to defy\nhumankind, such as hunger, poverty, illiteracy and\ncurable diseases. Hunger is a case in point. Several\nexperiences in different regions of the world prove that\nhunger can be eliminated if there is determination and\navailable resources. It is therefore unacceptable that, in\na world awash with food, one in three sub-Saharan\nAfricans should continue to suffer from chronic hunger.\nLast July, at the second ordinary session of the\nAssembly of the African Union, held in Maputo,\nMozambique, heads of State and Government of the\nAfrican Union adopted a Declaration on Agriculture\nand Food Security in Africa. In this Declaration,\nAfrican leaders once again demonstrated their firm\ncommitment to combating hunger on the African\ncontinent.\nAt the national level, fighting hunger was set as\none of the main priorities of the first Government of\nCape Verde immediately after independence and\ncontinues to have a prominent place in Government\npolicies in the framework of poverty reduction\nstrategies. That is why we support the plea made by the\nPresident of Brazil to establish a world committee to\nfight hunger.\nThree years ago, world leaders endowed\nthemselves with the important political tool that is the\nMillennium Declaration. There is no excuse for the fact\nthat the promised resources and the proclaimed will\nhave not been put to work to achieve and even surpass\nthe arduously negotiated but unanimously agreed Goals\nadopted in this very Hall. Despite the difficulties and\nuncertainties looming over the Organization, the eyes\nof the world are focused on the United Nations because\nall believe that our Organization can and should be the\nvehicle for achieving those Goals. Let us work together\nto make it happen.\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the\nUganda delegation, I wish to congratulate you,\nMr. President, on your election to preside over the\nfifty-eighth session of the General Assembly. We are\nconfident that, under your able leadership, we shall\nachieve the objectives of our deliberations. Let me also\nthank the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the\nexcellent leadership he has provided to the United\nNations during a very trying and difficult year.\nMy country attaches great importance to the\ncentrality of the United Nations in the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security and in fostering\ninternational development cooperation. In that regard,\nUganda hopes that this session of the General\nAssembly will focus on the critical reform of the\nUnited Nations to meet the new challenges to\nmultilateralism.\nTerrorism has reached epic proportions as a threat\nto international peace and security. Particularly since\n11 September, terrorist organizations have\nindiscriminately attacked, killed and maimed thousands\nof innocent civilians in Asia, the Middle East, Africa,\nEurope and the Americas. In northern Uganda, a\nterrorist organization called the Lords Resistance Army\nhas killed hundreds, displaced thousands and abducted\nchildren into forced recruitment and sale in slavery.\nOn 19 August, the terrorists chose to strike at the\nheart of the United Nations. They attacked the United\nNations offices in Baghdad. That callous attack led to\nthe death of innocent Iraqis and many members of the\nUnited Nations staff, including the Secretary-General\u2019s\nSpecial Representative, Sergio Vieira de Mello. On\nbehalf of the Government and people of Uganda, I wish\nto express sincere condolences to the Secretary-\nGeneral and to the bereaved families. We must\ncondemn those acts of terrorism in the strongest terms,\nand the international community must unite to fight\nthis scourge. Under no circumstances should\nindiscriminate use of violence be justified.\nWe must acknowledge that the emergence of new\nthreats such as terrorism and weapons of mass\ndestruction, combined with genocide and the massive\nviolation of human rights, poses a clear and present\nchallenge to the United Nations.\nMy country, therefore, shares the view of the\nSecretary-General that the time has come to examine\nthe fundamental policy issues and structural\nmechanisms that may be needed to deal with these new\nchallenges. We support his proposal to establish a\ngroup of eminent persons to make recommendations\nregarding the necessary reforms of the Security\n2\n\nCouncil and other United Nations institutions and\nprocesses.\nOn the situation in the Middle East, Uganda\nwelcomes the Quartet-led road map for a\ncomprehensive settlement. We support the\nestablishment of a Palestinian State living side by side\nand in peace with Israel, within secure and recognized\nborders, in accordance with the relevant Security\nCouncil resolutions.\nI now turn to the Great Lakes region of Africa.\nWe are pleased to note that there have been positive\ndevelopments as a result of regional and international\nefforts to build peace and stability in the region. In the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, the Transitional\nGovernment of National Unity has been established in\naccordance with the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement and\nthe related Pretoria and Luanda Agreements, as well as\nthe relevant resolutions of the Security Council.\nUganda remains committed to supporting the\npeace process in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo, including ending the Lendu-Hema inter-ethnic\nconflict in the Ituri Province. Uganda encouraged the\nSecurity Council to establish a robust force of the\nUnited Nations Organization Mission in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC), under\nChapter VII, for peacekeeping operations in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, including the\ndisarmament, demobilization, rehabilitation,\nresettlement and reintegration of negative forces.\nIn that regard, Uganda welcomes Security\nCouncil resolution 1493 (2003). My country provided\nEntebbe airbase for logistical support to the European\nUnion-led stabilization force in Bunia in July, 2003.\nWe have also concluded an agreement with MONUC to\nutilize Entebbe airbase, as well as the Kasese and Arua\nAirports, for United Nations operations in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.\nWith regard to the situation in Burundi, the\nimplementation of the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation\nAgreement remains on track, under the regional\ninitiative presided over by President Museveni of\nUganda and facilitated by Deputy President Zuma of\nSouth Africa. The African Union mission in Burundi\nhas been established. We call upon the international\ncommunity, including the Security Council, to provide\nthe necessary support for the mission.\nOn the situation in the Sudan, the Government of\nUganda commends the Government of the Sudan and\nthe Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army for the historic\nagreement on security arrangements, signed in\nNaivasha, Kenya, last week. We urge the parties to\nexpedite the negotiation of the remaining issues so that\na comprehensive agreement can be reached. The\nrestoration of peace, security and political stability in\nthe Sudan is not only good for the long-suffering\npeople of that country, but also for Africa as a whole.\nUganda particularly welcomed the initiative of\nthe Secretary-General to convene a high-level meeting,\nwhich adopted the Principles on Good-Neighbourly\nRelations and Cooperation between the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda\non 25 September. Our countries pledged to refrain from\ninterfering directly or indirectly in one another\u2019s\ninternal affairs, including making sure that none of the\nneighbouring countries\u2019 territory is used to arm, supply\nor host any hostile elements or armed groups against\nthe other.\nThese efforts, aimed at the restoration of peace,\nsecurity, political stability and good-neighbourliness,\nare not only good for the Great Lakes region, but also\nfor Africa and indeed the entire international\ncommunity. Uganda strongly believes that these are\nnecessary pre-conditions for regional integration and\nthe promotion of trade and investment to meet the\nneeds of our people. To that end, Uganda welcomes\nand supports the forthcoming United Nations\nconference on the Great Lakes region.\nDespite many commitments already made at\nvarious international forums, the international\ncommunity has yet to demonstrate sufficient political\nwill to mobilize adequate resources to meet the\nMillennium Development Goals and to ensure\nequitable sharing of the benefits of globalization for\nall. The failure of the World Trade Organization\nMinisterial Conference, held at Canc\u00fan, vividly\ndemonstrates this.\nSince the Millennium Summit in 2000, important\nplans of action, declarations and strategies have been\nagreed upon, inter alia, in Brussels, Doha, Monterrey,\nJohannesburg and Almaty, for the achievement of\nsustainable development and the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals. The challenge for the international\ncommunity now is to ensure their full and effective\nfollow-up and implementation. The international\n3\n\ncommunity must accord special priority to the\ndevelopment needs of the landlocked and least\ndeveloped countries, in order to facilitate their full\nintegration into the global system. Although official\ndevelopment assistance will continue to play an\nimportant role in development, Uganda regards trade as\nthe single most important external source of\ndevelopment financing and productivity growth. In this\nrespect, the Doha Development Agenda should ensure\nthat the least developed countries not only have access\nto markets, but also attain capacity to produce\ncompetitively for those markets. We call upon the\ndeveloped countries to show the necessary flexibility,\nespecially on the question of agricultural subsidies, to\nallow for the full and timely completion of the\ncomprehensive agenda agreed upon at Doha.\nThe fifty-seventh United Nations General\nAssembly endorsed the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s\nDevelopment (NEPAD) as a home-grown African\nframework for international development cooperation\nwithin the continent. We reiterate the call made last\nweek from this podium by the current Chairman of the\nAfrican Union, President Joachim Chissano of\nMozambique, for strong and effective support for\nNEPAD by the international community.\nIn summary, my country has supported the call\nfor collective action against terrorism and weapons of\nmass destruction. We have noted the positive\ndevelopments in the Great Lakes region and expressed\nour commitment to building a peaceful and stable\nregion. We have also underscored the need for urgent\nand effective implementation of agreed upon plans of\naction to meet the Millennium Development Goals and\nto assure practical support for NEPAD. Finally, Uganda\nhas reaffirmed its full commitment to the purposes and\nprinciples of the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe General Assembly\nis meeting in the shadow of the tragedy last month in\nwhich United Nations staff were killed or injured in\nBaghdad. New Zealand unreservedly condemns such\nbrutal and calculated acts of terror. The United Nations,\nafter all, was in Iraq to improve the conditions of Iraqi\npeople and to assist the restoration of Iraqi sovereignty.\nWe mourn the loss of all those who perished. In\nparticular, I pay tribute to Sergio Vieira de Mello, who\nworked so effectively in the world\u2019s trouble spots,\nincluding Timor-Leste, where New Zealand worked\nalongside him and developed huge admiration for his\nability and determination.\nThis was not the first occasion on which the\nemployees of the international community have been\ntargeted, although it was the worst. History suggests\nthat it will not be the last.\nTo do its work effectively, the United Nations\nmust interact with local communities, not operate from\nbehind barbed wire and concrete barriers. Its\nemployees are mainly unarmed civilians. We, the States\nMembers of the United Nations, must do more to\nprotect those whom we employ to work on our behalf.\nNine years ago New Zealand was at the forefront\nin creating the Convention for the Safety of United\n7\n\nNations and Associated Personnel. It was opened for\nsignature in 1995. Regrettably, only one third of the\nmembership has since become a party to it. We urge all\ncountries to do so now.\nNew Zealand believes that the Convention should\nbe widened to cover all situations where United\nNations and other associated personnel are engaged in\npeacekeeping, humanitarian and other assistance-\nrelated activities.\nOver the last year we have witnessed terrorist\nattacks, including in Casablanca, Riyadh and Jakarta,\nas well as in Baghdad.\nNext month is the first anniversary of the terrorist\nattack in Bali, in which more than 200 people lost their\nlives. And two years ago this city itself was the victim\nof the 9/11 attacks, which took 3,000 lives.\nInternational terrorism remains the primary threat to\nthe security and well-being of people across the world.\nIf we are to defeat terrorism, regional cooperation\nis imperative. In the Asia Pacific region, a concerted\nresponse to terrorism is now at the centre of the\nAssociation of South-east Asian Nations Regional\nForum agenda and is becoming increasingly important\nin the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.\nThe Pacific Islands Forum is responding\ncollectively to security challenges, including terrorism,\ntransnational crimes and challenges to national\nintegrity and independence.\nAn effective campaign against terrorism requires\ninternational collaboration on intelligence, military,\nsocial and economic measures.\nNew Zealand is aware that while we focus on the\nsymptoms of terrorism, the international community\nmust work together to tackle the conditions that foster\nit. We welcome the Norwegian initiative to strengthen\nanalysis of the causes of terrorism. There are simply no\nends that can justify the death and the maiming of\nvulnerable and innocent people.\nNew Zealand has, since 1972, supported the\ndevelopment of a comprehensive international regime to\noutlaw terrorism. I hope that the General Assembly will\nbe able to move forward on this issue and conclude the\ncomprehensive and nuclear terrorism conventions.\nIn combating terrorism, however, we should\navoid undermining the very values we are seeking to\nuphold. The fight against terrorism should not become\nan excuse to justify actions that do not conform to\ninternational standards of humanity.\nNew Zealand is the current Chair of the Pacific\nIslands Forum, which it hosted last month. Leaders\nstrongly endorsed the Regional Assistance Mission to\nthe Solomon Islands \u2014 a concrete example of the\nregion working together to assist one of its members to\nrestore security, stability and progress to its people.\nNew Zealand joined with the other members of\nthe Pacific Islands Forum in responding to a request\nfrom the Solomon Islands Government for police and\nmilitary assistance to end the actions of armed\ncriminals responsible for the deterioration in the social\nand economic conditions in the Solomon Islands. A\npolice-led operation has been working successfully to\nrestore the rule of law and economic stability.\nIn failed or weak States, Governments often lack the\ncapacity or will to exercise territorial control. That can\ncreate a power vacuum for terrorist organizations and\ncriminals to exploit and maintain safe havens, training\nfacilities and bases for launching terrorist operations.\nThe Regional Assistance Mission has gone\nexceptionally well to date and has received strong\nsupport from the people of the Solomon Islands. It is a\nPacific solution to a Pacific problem. Cooperation and\ncommitment by Pacific States to respond to regional\nsecurity needs, under the umbrella of the Pacific Islands\nForum, is a model that other regions could adopt.\nThe statements of support from the Secretary-\nGeneral and the Security Council for this regional\naction, taken in accordance with the Charter, are\nwelcome. We would urge the United Nations to assist\nwhere it can the process of rebuilding the social\nstructure and the economy of that country.\nNew Zealand is working to enhance and\ncomplement existing security capabilities within the\nPacific region. We are engaged in a number of\nactivities, including establishing border security\nsystems and drafting model legislation to address\nterrorism and transnational organized crime.\nThe international community must retain an\nongoing commitment to Afghanistan, where President\nKarzai\u2019s Government continues to face significant\nchallenges. Improving security outside Kabul will be a\ncrucial element in bringing political stability to\nAfghanistan.\n8\n\nIt is in the interests of us all to assist in the\nrestoration of Afghanistan \u2014 not only for the well-\nbeing of the Afghan people, but also so that terrorists\ncannot operate freely within its borders.\nEarlier this week, New Zealand assumed\nleadership of the Provincial Reconstruction Team in\nBamian Province. I am pleased that we could\ndemonstrate support for the Afghanistan Transitional\nGovernment in this way.\nThe shared nightmare of all States is that\nweapons of mass destruction or the materials from\nwhich they can be constructed will find their way into\nthe terrorist arsenal. The possibility of nuclear weapons\nin the hands of terrorists is a worst-case scenario with\nhorrific implications. We must do everything we can to\nprevent this from happening.\nThe possible acquisition of nuclear weapons by\nterrorist groups increases as the numbers and types of\nthese weapons, and the States that possess them,\ncontinue to expand. For these and other reasons the\nelimination of these weapons is vital.\nNew Zealand calls on all countries to commit and\nto adhere to multilateral disarmament and arms control\ntreaties.\nNorth Korea\u2019s proclaimed nuclear weapons\nprogramme is a major concern. We urge North Korea to\nresume its cooperation with the International Atomic\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) and its commitment to the\nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The current\nmultilateral dialogue process is a positive way forward.\nWe commend China for facilitating this.\nIran, too, must heed the strong message of the\ninternational community and take the urgent steps\nrequired to restore confidence that its nuclear\nintentions are peaceful.\nThe Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is equally\nabout nuclear disarmament. The commitment given by\nthe nuclear-weapon States to give up their nuclear\nweapons, reaffirmed unequivocally at the NPT Review\nConference in 2000, must be honoured.\nThe nuclear Powers have a particular responsibility\nin this respect. They must lead by example against\nproliferation. Meaningful steps toward permanent\ndisarmament would add to their moral authority in\ndemanding that others must not develop nuclear\nweapons capability.\nThe invasion of Iraq has had a profound impact\non this Organization. We regret that differences of view\ncould not be resolved in the Security Council.\nThe reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration of its\nsovereignty and the rebuilding of political and social\nstructures to guarantee the Iraqi people a better life are\nnow the critical issues. We welcome initiatives to push\nforward the political and constitutional process.\nThe passage of Security Council resolutions 1483\n(2003) and 1500 (2003) recognizes the vital role of the\nUnited Nations and the need for the international\ncommunity to be fully engaged in reconstruction\nefforts. While responsibility for security must\ninevitably rest with coalition forces, multilateralism\noffers the best prospect and the greatest legitimacy for\nthe process of transition back to Iraqi self-rule.\nNew Zealand has announced substantial\ncontributions to reconstruction and humanitarian relief\nwork. These include the deployment of a New Zealand\nDefence Force light engineer group to work on\nhumanitarian and reconstruction tasks alongside a\nUnited Kingdom engineer regiment in southern Iraq.\nWe have helped with demining operations and have\nmade contributions through United Nations agencies,\nthe International Committee of the Red Cross and non-\ngovernmental organizations.\nNew Zealand continues to view the United\nNations as the best hope we have to collectively pursue\nthe principles enshrined in the Charter. The strength of\nthe United Nation is that it brings all countries of the\nworld together on an equal footing to address common\nproblems. Millions of people around the world have had\ntheir lives improved by the actions of the United Nations.\nEast Timor is but one recent example of its effectiveness\nwhen it is supported by a common will to act.\nAt the same time, we all recognize the need to\nreform the Organization. In opening this session, the\nSecretary-General called on us to consider whether the\nrules and instruments of this multilateral institution\ncontinue to serve us well. We have been discussing the\nreform of the Security Council for more than a decade\nnow. It is time to make an institution designed in an\nearlier age, for a smaller number of nations more\nrepresentative and responsive to the 191 current\nMembers of the United Nations. We welcome the\nestablishment of a panel to address key issues\nfundamental to the Organization\u2019s future role. Member\nStates will need to put aside self-interest and\n9\n\ndifferences to reach agreement on the panel\u2019s findings\nand to translate those into action.\nFifty-eight years ago, the United Nations was\ncreated in the aftermath of the death and devastation\nthat had resulted from two world wars. The vision of\nits founders was that of an organization that would\nestablish rules to govern international behaviour, with\nprocedures to enforce them through collective action. The\nUnited Nations was bestowed with a unique legitimacy\nand unique authority to resolve conflict. Whatever its\nshortcomings, it remains an indispensable organization.\nThe challenge before us is to create the structures\nand provide the political will that will enable it to\ndeliver the peaceful, just and prosperous world that is\nthe hope and expectation of humanity.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nAt the outset, Sir, I should like to convey to you, both\npersonally and in your capacity as a representative of\nyour country, Saint Lucia, my sincere congratulations\non your election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-eighth session. I am confident that\nyou will lead its work with efficiency and skill. I\nshould also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute\nto your predecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan of the Czech\nRepublic, for his remarkable and effective contribution\nto the results achieved during the last session, results\nwe value and seek to deepen further.\nWe meet today at a critical juncture in world\nhistory. More than ever before, we need to chart and\ndefine clearly the path we wish to take to avert the\nconfusion of concepts and the undermining of\nestablished principles. Doubts have been raised about\nthe United Nations and its role; attempts have been\nmade to circumvent it and ignore the fact that it was\nborn out of the world's tragic experience in the first\nhalf of the previous century. From that experience, the\nworld drew the necessary lessons concerning the need\nfor collective action to solve problems, to prevent wars\nand to enable peoples to rule themselves and to\ncooperate for a better future.\nI believe that the time is now past for such\ndoubts. Everyone has come to realize the importance of\n17\n\ntaking action through the Organization in a spirit of\ncooperation and solidarity. That is the only way to save\nthe world from new divisions and scourges. That new\ndevelopment places new responsibilities on us all to\ncooperate within the United Nations in a spirit that\nseeks unity rather than division, cooperation rather than\nconflict, real solutions to problems rather than ways of\naddressing them without justice and respect for the\nCharter, thus lacking legitimacy and effectiveness.\nCommitment to the Charter and to international\nlaw is the safety valve for the international community.\nThe role of the United Nations cannot be reduced to the\nrole of the Security Council alone and to the questions\nthat it can or cannot address. In our opinion, the United\nNations is much larger than that; its contributions\nembrace all the elements of the wide-ranging and\ncomplex international agenda.\nIn that regard, we reiterate that challenges such as\nterrorism and illicit drugs, diseases, disarmament,\nprotection of the environment, AIDS and achieving\nsustainable development can be met only through\ncoordinated action in which all States, large and small,\nact within an international framework that enjoys\nlegitimacy and is conducive to the attainment of\ncommon objectives.\nIn that connection, I should like to pay tribute to\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his\ndistinguished role and his continuing efforts in\nstrengthening the purposes and principles of the United\nNations to enable the Organization to shoulder its\nresponsibilities and to achieve its goals. Kofi Annan\nplayed a significant role in returning the Organization\nto the centre of events. In the course of United Nations\nefforts to carry out its noble principles, many of its\nstaff members lose their lives. In the recent tragic\nevents in Baghdad, Egypt lost two of its and brave\nnationals who had been working ably in the service of\nthe Organization's principles.\nTragic events have struck many countries and\npeoples. Foremost among them were the events of 11\nSeptember 2001, which afflicted the friendly people of\nthe United States of America   events that we fully\ncondemn and deplore. In the midst of the agony and\nanxiety generated by such events, inescapable\nconclusions have been reached: we must unite in\ncombating terrorism on realistic, sound and legitimate\nbases; we must avoid confusing terrorism with certain\nlegitimate acts that are inspired by the wish to break\nthe shackles of occupation, domination and injustice;\nand we must understand that the desire to combat\nterrorism must not become the only yardstick for\njudgement.\nExperience has proven that in combating\nterrorism we must not fail to see that it is not a product\nof one of the world's major cultures. We must not\nignore the fact that terrorism is not confined to a\ncertain region and that the fight against it must not be\nrestricted to the perspective of security or politics\nalone. Terrorism is by nature a multifaceted\nphenomenon. As such, it must be dealt with in a\ncomprehensive manner that encompasses its political,\neconomic, security, legal and psychological aspects, as\nwell as the conditions exploited by some to justify it.\nThe United Nations has proven its ability to\ncoordinate international efforts and to achieve tangible\nresults in this field. Egypt has participated seriously in\nall activities aimed at strengthening international\nefforts against terrorism. This has been Egypt's\nobjective all along. In 1995, Egypt launched President\nHosni Mubarak's initiative to convene a high-level\ninternational conference under United Nations auspices\nto consider ways and means to combat terrorism. This\ninitiative gave expression to Egypt's keen interest in\nsupporting the international efforts aimed at reaching a\nclear and precise understanding of the fight against\nterrorism, including through special negotiations on the\ncomprehensive convention to combat international\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. The\nEgyptian initiative must not be construed as a chance\nfor protracted polemics or disagreement that clouds our\nobjective. On the contrary, it is a call to frame a\ndocument that expresses the international political will\nand reflects the international resolve to eradicate the\nscourge of terrorism, to restore peace and security,\nalong with justice and stability, and to clarify the\nresponsibilities of each and every member of the\ninternational community.\nOur world today is facing numerous challenges\nregionally and internationally. There are challenges to\nthe logic of fairness, justice and peace and challenges\nrelated to the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction and the slow pace of international action in\nthe field of nuclear disarmament. We are witnessing\ntendencies to consecrate the right to possess, develop,\nand modernize nuclear weapons. Some States still cling\nto the obsolete doctrines of deterrence and attempt to\nfind justifications for the use of nuclear weapons.\n18\n\nTherefore, it has become necessary to widen the\nestablishment of zones that are free of weapons of mass\ndestruction. In this regard, I recall Egypt's repeated\nassertions, in all international forums, that rendering\nthe Middle East free of weapons of mass destruction,\nparticularly nuclear weapons, in a comprehensive\nframework that applies to all without exception or\ndiscrimination, is the only way to spare the region and\nthe world the dangers that threaten all our\nachievements and all that we strive to achieve. It is\nunacceptable that Israel's possession of such weapons\nshould remain a reality that some prefer to ignore or\nshould prevent the international community in Vienna,\nNew York or elsewhere from facing it fairly and\nsquarely.\nThe Middle East region continues to suffer from\nthe absence of peace. There were high hopes that the\nhistorical reconciliation between the Palestinian and\nIsraeli peoples was within reach after the Oslo accords,\nthe parties' mutual recognition and the subsequent\nagreements and negotiations. Yet the efforts failed\nevery time, seemingly because the Israeli party does\nnot yet fully share the conviction of all, expressed by\nPresident George Bush and the Quartet, that the\nsolution lies in the establishment of an independent\nPalestinian State, within the 1967 borders, that would\nlive side by side with Israel in peace and security.\nThe Palestinian people continue to be subjected\nto oppression, provocation, and aggression. They\ncontinue to languish under the oppression of a cruel\nand unfair occupation that generates feelings of despair\nand frustration and leads to a spiral of violence and\ncounter-violence whose victims are innocent civilians.\nIt is high time for the international community to\nreiterate its call to the parties to return to the\nnegotiating table in order to implement the principles\nof international legality and to achieve a just peace in\nthe entire Middle Eastern region on the basis of a\ncomplete withdrawal to the 1967 borders and of respect\nfor rights. Egypt has continually made efforts to\nachieve that objective in Palestine, the Govan and in\nthe occupied Lebanese territories, confident that the\nlogic of peace will prevail over the logic of aggression\nand that the resolve of the people who yearn for a\npeace that achieves security and opens the door for\ndevelopment will prevail over those who continue to\nharbour ambitions of expansion and aggression and\nthus put the interests of their peoples in danger. They\nwill bear a heavy responsibility for that.\nThe situation in Iraq is cause for grave concern.\nWe reaffirm anew the need for respect for the\nsovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of\nIraq, as well as the need to create conditions conducive\nto the earliest possible withdrawal of the occupying\nforces and the assumption by the United Nations of a\ncentral role in assisting the Iraqis in the political and\neconomic reconstruction of their State. Egypt affirms\nits readiness to contribute to the reconstruction process,\nin accordance with the wishes and needs of the Iraqi\npeople and in cooperation with the rest of the\ninternational community, under the aegis of the United\nNations. We look forward to the day when the\naspirations of the Iraqi people are realised and when it\nbecomes an effective and free partner working with its\nArab brothers for a better future.\nEgypt welcomes the recent agreement between\nthe government of the Sudan and the Sudanese\nPeople's Liberation Movement (SPLM), an agreement\nthat paves the way for a consolidated effort towards a\nbetter future for the people of a united Sudan and one\nthat ensures equality, security and prosperity for all its\ncitizens. Egypt calls upon the international community\nto assist in securing the implementation of this\nagreement. The profound and eternal ties and relations\nbetween Egypt and the Sudan and our firm belief in the\ncommonality of the hopes we entertain and the threats\nwe face impel us to be in the vanguard of action for the\nachievement of that lofty goal. It alone can guarantee\nthe maintenance of the interests of the Sudanese people\nas a whole, as well as the interests of the Arab world\nand the African continent.\nEgypt believes that cooperation for development\nis the cornerstone of multilateral international action.\nThe eradication of poverty is a moral, human, and\npolitical responsibility shared by the countries of the\nNorth and the South. It is the shortest route to\nachieving international peace and security. A fair look\nat the international economic situation must conclude\nthat it is impossible to accept the continuation of the\ncurrent imbalance in the distribution of wealth among\nthe peoples of the Earth. Equally impossible to accept\nare the lack of democracy in international economic\ndecision-making, the grave fluctuations in the\nefficiency of the work of the world financial markets,\nthe unfair trade practices against the interests of\ndeveloping countries and the policies that lead to\nrecurrent financial crises which eliminate, in a few\ndays, the achievements of decades of great sacrifice.\n19\n\nWe regret that the Cancun Conference was unable to\nproduce the desired and previously agreed outcome of\naffording developing countries a real opportunity to\nbenefit from liberalization based on balanced trade.\nInstead, it made liberalization an obstacle to the efforts\nof developing countries to promote growth and\ndevelopment under difficult and complex\ncircumstances.\nEgypt has welcomed the outcome of United\nNations conferences and summits, including the\nMillennium Summit Declaration, and has called for full\nimplementation of the letter and spirit of the decisions\nadopted. Hence, we view with satisfaction the decision\nof the General Assembly at its last session to consider\nin 2005 at a high level the implementation of the\noutcomes of international summits and conferences.\nGlobalization, with the hope it brings for\ninternational cooperation that benefits all, could turn, if\nmisused, into an attempt at domination, thereby\nexacerbating the structural flaws in the international\nsystem at both the economic and political levels.\nHence, there is a need for measures to increase the\neffectiveness of international institutions and to\nachieve good governance, which is as necessary on the\ninternational level as it is on the national level, and to\ncreate a favourable economic environment. There is\nalso a need to adopt a comprehensive package of\nreforms that includes international finance and for\nmutual respect among cultures and civilizations so that\ndialogue and cooperation can benefit all and can\npromote understanding between nations and peoples.\nWhile urging the United Nations to continue its\nefforts in the promotion of international cooperation\nfor development, Egypt stresses the importance of\ntaking the cultural diversity of societies into account. It\nis also important to seek acceptance of the other as an\nequal partner in discourse without the imposition of\ncertain models. At the same time, we reiterate that this\ncooperation must be the fruit of a new philosophy that\nposits the common destiny of mankind in a unified and\ninteractive manner, whereby if one part suffers, the rest\nwill subsequently suffer. The repercussions of the\neconomic and social problems in a given country or\ncontinent can no longer be confined to a single place.\nRather, these repercussions now swiftly find their way\nto the rest of the world.\nThe United Nations should place the situation in\nAfrica among its top priorities, in view of the political,\neconomic, social, and environmental challenges facing\nit, as well as the outbreak of armed conflicts, spread of\ndeadly epidemics and plunder of the riches and\nresources of peoples, whether directly or indirectly\nthrough the imbalance in trade and economic relations.\nThe New Partnership for Africa's Development\n(NEPAD) constitutes a new starting point to change the\nstandard of living in Africa. It is an initiative created\nby the Africans themselves, based on their own vision\nof their reality, needs and the great hopes of the\nAfrican peoples for a better future and their wish to be\npartners with the world for the sake of development\nand progress. Egypt reaffirms the need to implement\nthe resolutions adopted by the General Assembly last\nyear, which took NEPAD as a framework for\ndevelopment in Africa. Egypt calls for the development\nprogrammes of international organizations to be\nadapted to the priorities set by NEPAD. Egypt urges\ndonor countries and economic organizations and\ninstitutions to provide support to the African countries\nfor the implementation of NEPAD and the achievement\nof its desired objectives.\nAfrican countries have already established within\nthe African Union the machinery required for the\nimplementation of the initiative. The international\ncommunity is called upon to help bridge the financial\ngap that impedes the achievement of poverty reduction\nin Africa. This should be done through a prompt and\ncomprehensive approach.\nEgypt's belief in the centrality of the role of the\nUnited Nations in the world, now and in the future,\nimpels it to reaffirm the urgent need to develop and\nincrease the Organization's effectiveness. This includes\nthe reform of its main organs, particularly the General\nAssembly and the Security Council. We all agree that\nthere is a need for reform and that this reform is a long\nprocess. Many of the steps towards reform have been\nimplemented. However, much remains to be done to\nstrengthen collective and international action through\nthe revitalization of the General Assembly and reform\nof the working methods of the Security Council. All\nStates should be given ample opportunity to shoulder\nthe responsibilities of membership in the Council.\nTherefore, we continue to support a\ncomprehensive approach to the reform of the Security\nCouncil and believe that this process should be based\non two main guidelines: a commitment to the overall\nconcept of reform and the rejection of a policy of\n20\n\ntaking small steps in one direction or another. The\nOpen-ended Working Group of the General\nAssembly   the only open and transparent forum\navailable for the consideration of this important\nsubject   should also continue its consideration of this\nmatter and abide by its mandate.\nThe dangers that beset us all make it imperative\nfor us to rally around the lofty principles established\nunder the Charter of our Organization. We must\ntranslate our belief in those principles into continuous\nwork that transcends greedy ambitions, hatreds,\nillusions and the desire for domination and hegemony.\nOur work must proceed from a belief in the equal\nrights and duties of peoples. Thus we will achieve the\nhopes of the peoples of the Earth and spare them\nhardship and suffering.\nThe path towards that objective lies in the\ncommitment to United Nations resolutions and the\ncessation of attempts to ignore, circumvent or adapt\nthem to serve purposes incompatible with the Charter\nand with law and justice. If we uphold those principles,\nwe will all be victors. The only vanquished ones will\nbe the forces of evil and aggression, which will be\ndefeated by our peoples' hopes for a more just and\nsecure world for all.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI have the honour of\naddressing the General Assembly on behalf of His\nExcellency Mr. Eduard Kukan, Minister for Foreign\nAffairs of the Slovak Republic.\nSlovakia as a European Union acceding country\nfully endorses the statement made by the Prime\nMinister of Italy on behalf of the European Union. The\npositions and ideas expressed in Mr. Berlusconi\u2019s\naddress perfectly reflect the values of the Government\nand people of Slovakia. I will therefore concentrate\nonly on the topics that we consider the most important.\nAt the outset, I warmly congratulate the President\non his assumption of the presidency and wish him\nevery success in discharging his important duties. He\ncan rely on Slovakia\u2019s support and cooperation. Let me\nalso add the voice of my delegation to those who have\nthanked his predecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, for his\ncontribution to the work of this body.\nAmongst the most challenging issues before us,\nthe one that has drawn the closest attention of the\nworld community is the situation in Iraq. We should\njoin our efforts to help the Iraqi people reconstruct\ntheir country and build a democratic society, which is\nthe best course of action for stabilizing the situation,\nwhich is still volatile on the ground.\nThe unprecedented tragedy of the destruction of\nthe United Nations Baghdad headquarters, which\nripped from our midst many brave United Nations\npersonnel, including Special Representative Sergio\nVieira de Mello, to whom we again pay our undivided\ntribute, has shown us that no target is safe. Uniting to\nhelp Iraq has become a matter of common interest.\nSecurity Council resolution 1483 (2003) laid the\nimportant framework enabling the international\ncommunity to contribute to Iraq\u2019s reconstruction. At\nthe time of its adoption, Slovakia decided to participate\nin stabilization operations in Iraq by sending mine-\nclearing experts. Although this was only a token\ncontribution, given our capacity and the number of\nSlovak troops already deployed in active peacekeeping\nmissions around the globe, I believe that it showed our\ncommitment to creating conditions in which the Iraqi\npeople can build their own future. As more troops are\nneeded on the ground, we support the efforts to win\ngreater participation from willing countries. The\nUnited Nations, with a specific mandate, must play a\ngreater role in the Iraqi post-war restoration.\nIraq must show that a free and democratic\ncountry is the inevitable replacement for dictatorship.\nA democratic and prosperous Iraq is important to peace\nand security in the Middle East, which directly affects\nthe rest of the world.\n26\n\nThe difficult economic and social situation in\nAfghanistan, where people continue to strive to build a\ndemocratic and viable society, still leaves room for a\nresurgence of extremists. The international community\ncannot move away from Afghanistan. It must stay\ncommitted and continue to provide the necessary\nassistance to the Afghan people. I am pleased to\nannounce that last July the Slovak Parliament decided\nto extend the participation of Slovakia in Operation\nEnduring Freedom.\nTen years after Israelis and Palestinians\nastounded the world by signing the Oslo Accords, the\ntwo sides are again locked in a cycle of violence,\nattacks, counter-attacks and revenge. It is unfortunate\nthat the latest wave of violence has come at a time\nwhen the road map had started to encourage feelings of\nhope.\nSlovakia is deeply concerned over the\ndeteriorating situation. Recent tragic and violent events\nhave caused enormous suffering and resulted in many\ninnocent victims. In the face of the current situation,\nboth sides must act responsibly, with the utmost\nrestraint, and consider carefully the tremendously\nnegative consequences of a complete breakdown of the\npeace process. The only realistic way out of the\nimpasse is the creation of a viable Palestinian State\nexisting alongside Israel, with the security and survival\nof each guaranteed. Every effort has to be made to keep\nthe road map on the table, because there is no other\nalternative. Both sides must fully and without further\ndelay implement their obligations in accordance with\nthe road map. Slovakia reiterates its support for the\nroad map and sees the role of the Quartet in the peace\nprocess as irreplaceable and essential.\nWe will not relax our efforts in the fight against\nglobal terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of\nmass destruction. Underestimation of this peril could\nhave a fateful impact on the international community.\nThe United Nations must continue to play a decisive\nrole in this fight. The Slovak Republic appreciates and\nfully supports the activities of the Counter-Terrorism\nCommittee. Slovakia, as a party to all 12 global\ninternational conventions against terrorism, has\nsuccessfully implemented their provisions into its\nlegislation.\nAs a party to various international conventions\nand treaties, Slovakia supports joint efforts to adopt\nglobal international legal instruments and standards\nconcerning the principle of the rule of law. The\nratification process of the United Nations Convention\nagainst Transnational Organized Crime is well under\nway in the Slovak Republic and should be completed\nby the end of this year.\nOver the past decade, we have witnessed\nexponential growth in peacekeeping activities in an\nincreasing number of conflicts throughout the globe.\nThe recent comprehensive reform has significantly\nimproved the effectiveness of planning and\nmanagement of the ever more complex and challenging\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations. However, the\nmost important factor for the success of United Nations\npeacekeeping is still the political will of Member\nStates and their readiness to contribute contingents and\nequipment. In order to support and sustain the\nincreasing number of peacekeeping operations, the\ntimely payment of financial contributions is necessary.\nSlovakia has been among the leading contributors\nto United Nations peacekeeping operations since it\nbecame a Member of the United Nations in 1993. Our\npeacekeepers are currently serving in six United\nNations missions in Africa, Asia and the Middle East.\nGiven our clear understanding of the new threats to our\nsecurity and a willingness and ability to help tackle\nthem, our engagement in peace support operations\naround the world will expand even more when we join\nthe European Union and NATO next year. Slovakia\u2019s\nactive involvement in peacekeeping operations\nconfirms the fact that the maintenance of international\npeace is among the priorities of our foreign policy.\nIn recent years attacks on humanitarian workers\nand on United Nations personnel have increased\nalarmingly. We therefore welcome the unanimous\nadoption of Security Council resolution 1502 (2003) on\nthe protection of United Nations personnel, associated\npersonnel and humanitarian personnel in conflict\nzones. It emphasizes the obligation of each Member\nState to take every step in its power to protect those\nworking under the blue flag and to bring to justice\nthose who attack or harm them. Slovakia has been a\nparty to the Convention on the Safety of United\nNations and Associated Personnel since 1996, and we\ninvite those States that have not yet done so to become\nparties to this very important international legal\ninstrument, which provides for the protection of United\nNations and associated personnel.\n27\n\nOne of the most important steps towards\nachieving international justice and putting an end to\nimpunity for the most serious violations of human\nrights, war crimes and genocide was the establishment\nof the International Criminal Court. Slovakia, which is\na State party to its Rome Statute, is firmly committed\nto ensuring that the Court is an independent, fair and\neffective institution. The election of 18 judges and of\nthe Prosecutor and Deputy Prosecutor was essential for\nthe successful start of its work. We are convinced that\ntheir expertise and moral integrity will ensure the\nhighest standards in their performance and will\nguarantee fair and impartial justice.\nSlovakia views arms control as a pivotal\ninstrument of security policy. Here I would like to\nreiterate our continued support for the further\nstrengthening of major international disarmament and\nnon-proliferation instruments such as the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). It would\nbe most appropriate to reinforce this cornerstone of\nnuclear non-proliferation by speedily bringing into\nforce another significant instrument \u2014 the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) \u2014\nhence my delegation\u2019s repeated call on those that have\nnot yet done so to sign and ratify the CTBT as soon as\npossible.\nSlovakia also encourages those countries that\nhave not signed or ratified the Ottawa Convention to do\nso quickly. The terror that landmines cause, despite\ntheir limited military utility, continues to spread, along\nwith the appalling humanitarian consequences of their\nuse in actual conflicts.\nWith its entry into the European Union, Slovakia\nis taking on moral responsibility for the poorer\ncountries of the world. Just as Slovakia received aid in\nthe past, it is now in duty bound to help reduce social\ntensions and poverty in other parts of the world. That is\nour contribution to achieving the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals. Slovakia is systematically and\nconsistently preparing its compact and efficient\ndevelopment agenda. The Slovak Government has\nrecently adopted a legal framework and strategy for\ndevelopment assistance. An important step in the\ndevelopment of official assistance was the approval of\nthe first annual budget in December 2002.\nThe current modest level of official development\nassistance reflects the potential of our growing\neconomy, and we are convinced that the effective and\nefficient use, and sustained growth, of such official\ndevelopment assistance will place Slovakia more\nfirmly within the group of new emerging donors.\nWe endorse the appeals made for the\nstrengthening of the role of the United Nations and for\nimproving the efficiency and working methods of its\nmajor organs. First and foremost, a comprehensive\nreform of the Security Council and a revitalization of\nthe General Assembly is needed.\nIn the past year, the international community has\nhad to deal with events whose significance have put to\nthe test the principles that have governed international\nrelations since the signing of the United Nations\nCharter. Though it is undisputed that the validity of\nthese principles remains undiminished, we cannot shy\naway from seeking answers and solutions to the\nfundamental global challenges that we face today,\nincluding extreme poverty, drug smuggling, the spread\nof deadly diseases and global climate change. Finding\nappropriate solutions to these and other issues requires\nmultilateral cooperation, with a viable United Nations\nat its core. We all wish to see a strong and decisive\nUnited Nations that is capable of effectively\nresponding to current and future challenges. Slovakia\nremains committed to multilateralism and to its\nfundamental institutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In last\nmonth\u2019s attack the precious lives of several innocent\nUnited Nations staff members were lost, including that\nof Sergio Vieira de Mello, the High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights. The world must not be intimidated by\nterrorism. The role of the United Nations as a guarantor\nof collective security is irreplaceable. Global security\nis the responsibility of all nations, just as we are all\nequally bound by international law.\nNicaragua has come to the General Assembly to\nmake suggestions with regard to the building of a new\nworld order and to cooperate actively within the\nmultilateral system to combat, among other scourges,\nterrorism, corruption, drug trafficking, the illegal\ntrafficking in arms and persons, and transnational\ncrime, all of which are harmful to strengthening\ndemocracy and the progress of the world.\nThat is why we have begun a new era in Central\nAmerica, in which the region will be more united than\never before and serve as a model for democratic\nsecurity that includes an innovative strategy to\novercome both traditional challenges and modern\nthreats.\nAt the meeting of Central American Presidents\nthat took place in Guatemala on 17 July 2003, I made a\nproposal for a programme for arms limitation and\ncontrol in Central America to achieve a reasonable\nbalance of forces and to foster stability, mutual trust\nand transparency. The idea behind my Government\u2019s\nproposal is to establish the necessary controls to\nachieve a reasonable balance in defence forces; to put\nin place modern policies for regional defence and\npublic security while strengthening mechanisms for the\npeaceful settlement of disputes. The Central American\nPresidents meeting in Belize at the beginning of this\nmonth enthusiastically approved that plan. I am also\npleased to inform the General Assembly that technical\nteams have already begun to work to implement the\nplan.\nIn the current situation, the subject of\ninternational trafficking in small arms and light\nweapons is equally worthy of our attention. Nicaragua\nwill soon be the site of a major project to achieve\nprogress in that area.\nDrug trafficking is global threat that constitutes\nan assault on democracy and its institutions and\nimperils comprehensive human development. Due to\nour privileged geographical position, international\norganized crime is continuing to attempt to make\ninroads into our region in order to make it a gateway\nbetween producers and consumers of illicit substances.\nWe have cut off its advance in Nicaragua, a country\nthat enjoys high levels of domestic security. However,\nit is essential that we strengthen the cooperation of all\ninternational actors on the basis of shared\nresponsibility to prevent the expansion of organized\ncrime and increased drug use.\nMy country\u2019s commitment to democratic security\nis consistent with the struggle for peace and the\nestablishment of a just international order. A country\nthat has experienced war, like Nicaragua, is in a better\nposition to make a more effective contribution to\npreventing war than countries that have not. We\nNicaraguans have suffered the horrors and the\naftermath of war. It is for that reason that Nicaragua\nhas the ability to make a contribution to the\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\nIt is also for that reason that I have come to\nGeneral Assembly, namely, to convey to the Assembly\nthe resolute desire and just aspirations of my\nGovernment and people to be elected as a non-\npermanent member of the Security Council for the\n2006-2007 term. Our candidacy has garnered\nincreasingly strong support, which we hope to\nstrengthen decisively in the coming months.\nThe fight against corruption is an unrelenting\nundertaking for my Government. We have achieved\nmajor successes and are proud to know we have set an\nexample that is already being emulated by some of our\nsisterly countries. I wish to express my gratitude for\nthe support of the international community, which\nunderstood our desire to bring morality to public\nadministration. Corruption is the cause of many evils,\nand it takes a huge toll on the economy, in addition to\nundermining public and private institutions.\nNicaragua greatly appreciates efforts to develop a\nUnited Nations convention against corruption. In that\n6\n\nregard, we also welcome the progress made during the\nsixth round of meetings in Vienna, which will provide\na solid foundation for the establishment of international\nlegal norms to help combat that scourge, thereby\nstrengthening political stability in our countries.\nHowever, the fight against corruption in my country\nalso requires a strengthening of the judicial and\nelectoral systems.\nResistance to change makes it difficult to make\nprogress in those areas at the pace and scope required\nto meet my country\u2019s needs. I therefore recently\npresented to Nicaragua\u2019s political, economic and social\nactors my proposal for a national development plan, in\norder to obtain the input of all segments of Nicaraguan\nsociety. That plan also specifies the actions to be taken\nby every State entity in evaluating and modifying the\nplan to achieve the country\u2019s comprehensive\ndevelopment.\nNicaragua needs foreign assistance. That\nassistance should be coordinated in a manner that takes\ninto account national plans and strategies pertaining to\nhow assistance is utilized. The quality, effectiveness\nand impact of such cooperation should be improved by\nemploying new ideas that lead to tangible results in the\narea of sustainable development. Additional new\nresources will also be necessary to fulfil the\nMillennium Development Goals.\nWe appreciate the United Kingdom\u2019s proposal for\nan international financing facility as a way to increase\nthe flow of short-term resources by issuing negotiable\ninstruments backed by future assistance.\nCooperation in solidarity by the international\ncommunity has been particularly meaningful in the\narea of mine clearance in my country, where substantial\nprogress has been made, thanks both to the fine work\nof national and international institutions participating\nin that humanitarian endeavour and the professionalism\nof the our army\u2019s sappers.\nNicaragua is also a thankful country. On several\noccasions, we have received significant amounts of\nhumanitarian assistance from many countries. As a\ntoken of our gratitude, we have made our small, but\nfull, contribution of humanitarian assistance to\nneighbouring countries in need. We are now taking part\nin the purely humanitarian mission involving mine\nclearance and the provision of medical support for the\ncivilian population in Iraq.\nHowever, international cooperation alone is not\nenough to achieve economic development. We must\npromote a more equitable international trade system\nthrough the World Trade Organization. In other words,\nwhat good is cooperation for productive development\nwhen there are tariff and non-tariff restrictions on\ntrade? We want fair treatment. That is the issue, and we\nhope the developed countries will support us in\nbringing about a new trade relationship with\ndeveloping countries \u2014 such as Nicaragua. With fair\ntreatment and with markets for our products, we will\nhave a more competitive Central American market and\nwill attract greater investment in order to generate\nmore jobs at fair wages, reaping the benefits of the\nregion\u2019s strategic geographic location.\nThe Central American integration process has\nmade much progress and has been one of the pillars of\nmy foreign policy. We have achieved our most notable\nresults in economic integration, and we have paved the\nway for successful negotiation of free-trade treaties\nwith other countries and regions, such as the one we\nare currently working out with the United States.\nNicaragua will insist on preferential treatment in our\nnegotiations because our economy is less developed,\nvery open and highly dependent on trade and external\nfinancing. With greater development and wealth\ngeneration, we will keep our citizens from migrating to\nthe North or to other countries.\nPeace is still only a hope in some regions of the\nworld. Nicaragua advocates multilateral action to find\npeaceful solutions in keeping with international law.\nWe are concerned at the escalation of the situation in\nthe Middle East and its consequences, which is why we\nbelieve that the international community must\ncontribute, through the United Nations, to finding a\njust and lasting peace in the region. My Government\nsupports an immediate resumption of the peace process\nbegun this year through the peace plan known as the\nroad map.\nWe confirm our commitment to strengthening the\nuniversal vocation of the United Nations so that all\npeoples of the world, without exception, can be fairly\nrepresented in it. That is why I reaffirm before the\nAssembly the importance of considering the desire of a\npeople with legitimate representation \u2014 the Republic\nof China \u2014 to participate as a full-fledged member of\nthe United Nations.\n7\n\nNicaragua recognizes its responsibility in the\nbuilding of a new international order that is more\nhumane, more just and more secure. It has been our lot\nto live through difficult times since that fateful day of\n11 September. Let us be capable of building a different\nworld, so that future generations will not blame us for a\nlack of consensus on humanity\u2019s problems requiring\nurgent action. Nicaragua is aware of that responsibility,\nand therefore we pledge to work with other Member\nStates to defend multilateralism and to overcome\ncurrent security problems, remaining united in the\nspirit of the Charter of the United Nations and in strict\nadherence to and respect for international law.\nMay God bless the Assembly, may God bless the\nUnited Nations, may God bless all peoples of the\nworld, and may God always bless Nicaragua.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet\nme from the outset congratulate the President of this\nfifty-eighth General Assembly on his election. I have\nno doubt that his election by the international\ncommunity is a recognition of his vast diplomatic skills\nand leadership qualities. His election is also\nrecognition of the coming of age of small island States.\nI also wish to thank his predecessor Mr. Jan Kavan for\nhis stewardship of the work of the fifty-seventh\nGeneral Assembly.\n16\n\nPlease allow me also to pay tribute to the United\nNations Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan and his\nstaff for their dedication and commitment in dealing\nwith many pressing international issues that confront\nus today.\nI join others delegations in expressing our\nGovernment\u2019s sincere condolences to the families of\nthe United Nations staff, including the late Sergio\nVieira de Mello, the former United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights, who lost their lives\nin Baghdad on 16 August 2003.\nThe attacks were barbaric and against the\nprinciples of freedom, democracy and peace as\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter. They must be\ncondemned in the strongest possible terms.\nIn pursuit of our commitments to combat\ninternational terrorism, I am happy to report that Papua\nNew Guinea has substantially complied with United\nNations Security Council resolution 1373 (2001).\nOur Parliament recently ratified many of the\nconventions and protocols to combat global terrorism.\nYesterday, I personally deposited four conventions with\nthe Office of the United Nations Secretary-General.\nHaving fulfilled these requirements, Papua New\nGuinea is now faced with resource constraints and\nother challenges to implementing the treaty\nobligations. This situation is further exacerbated by\nother threats, such as illicit drug trafficking,\nproliferation of small arms and light weapons,\nsmuggling of humans and money-laundering.\nIn the Pacific Islands region, we have taken\npositive initiatives to collectively deal with these\nthreats. The Nasonini and Biketawa Declarations\nagreed to by the Pacific Islands Forum leaders provide\nthe framework for cooperation in dealing with these\nthreats.\nIn the wider Asia/Pacific Region, the Southwest\nPacific Dialogue has met twice, in addition to the\nannual Bali security meetings, to discuss political and\nsecurity issues facing the region. The Dialogue partners\ninclude Indonesia, the Philippines, New Zealand,\nAustralia, Timor-Leste and Papua New Guinea.\nWhilst issues of greater political and security\nrisks are of concern to us, the real threat at this stage is\nthe proliferation of small arms and light weapons.\nSmall arms and light weapons have not only\ndestabilized regions, sparked, fuelled and prolonged\nconflicts but also obstructed relief programmes,\nundermined peace initiatives, exacerbated human rights\nabuses, hampered development and fostered a culture\nof violence. There are no international treaties or other\nlegal instruments for dealing effectively with this\ncategory of weapons.\nIn this context, Papua New Guinea welcomes the\ncall for the immediate and full implementation of the\n2001 Plan of Action on small arms aimed at curbing\nand eradicating the flow of small arms and light\nweapons.\nLet me place this in the context of the crisis in\nour province of Bougainville where the proliferation of\nsmall arms and light weapons contributed to the\nprolonging of the conflict in the province.\nWith regard to progress in Bougainville, we have\ncompleted the second stage of the arms disposal\nprogramme, which has been verified by the United\nNations. The regional Peace Monitoring Group (PMG)\nhas now been wound down and replaced by the\nBougainville Transition Team (BTT). With the help of\nthe United Nations the Team will maintain logistical\nsupport for the peace process and assist in other\noperational areas.\nI would also like to inform this Assembly that the\npeace process under the Bougainville Agreement has\nreached the crucial third stage under the constitutional\namendments agreed to by the Papua New Guinea\nNational Parliament. While there are delays, every\nnecessary step is being taken by all parties concerned\nto ensure that the momentum built to date is not being\nunduly hampered.\nMy Government therefore seeks the\nunderstanding of the international community,\nespecially the members of the Security Council, to help\nus fully achieve all tasks agreed to under the\nBougainville Peace Agreement. This will signal a win-\nwin story for all, the United Nations, our Government\nand the people of Bougainville.\nI express our Government\u2019s profound\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for the invaluable\nefforts of the United Nations Political Office in\nBougainville (UNPOB), including those of\nAmbassador Noel Sinclair.\nI also acknowledge and thank our regional\nneighbours \u2014 Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Solomon\n17\n\nIslands, Tonga and Vanuatu, for their immense\ncontribution to the peace process.\nWith regard to the conflict in the Solomon\nIslands, the package of assistance developed and\nagreed to by the Pacific Islands foreign ministers and\nlater adopted at the Pacific Islands Forum leaders\nmeeting in Auckland, New Zealand, last month has\nhelped restore peace and normalcy in that country. It\nwas undertaken at the request of the Government of the\nSolomon Islands under the Biketawa Declaration.\nThe Australian-led operation includes the\ndeployment of both civilian police and armed\npeacekeepers from many of the Pacific island member\nStates, including my own. The cooperation among\nmember States underlines the strength of regional\npeacekeeping, if done properly.\nOn the Israeli and Palestinian issue, we were\nencouraged by the general positive signs of progress\ntowards resolving and securing peace based on the\nUnited States-led road map. However, this has\ndeteriorated in recent weeks. We call upon all parties\ninvolved to exercise maximum restraint and work\ntowards the peaceful settlement of this crisis.\nWe are pleased that the Quartet has recently\nconvened in New York to review the road map. We\nlook forward to their strong leadership in assisting to\nresolve this long outstanding issue. Fighting and\nviolence will not resolve the conflict. We join the\ninternational community\u2019s call for both the Israeli and\nPalestinian leadership to make renewed efforts at the\nnegotiating table, to cease all hostilities by both sides\nand to find a permanent solution to the problem.\nOur belief is that diplomacy is the only means by\nwhich States may join as partners and co-operate in\nbringing about changes which promote peace,\neconomic and social progress for all people, both in\nprinciple and, more importantly, in practice.\nWe believe that this too should apply to the\nsituation in Iraq. We support the work being done in\nthe Security Council to adopt a new resolution on a\nrole of the United Nations that would provide a\nframework for the widest possible participation of\nUnited Nations Member States in the reconstruction of\nIraq.\nRegarding United Nations reforms, Papua New\nGuinea commends the leadership demonstrated by the\nSecretary-General in the current work being done to\nreform the main organs of the United Nations, the\nGeneral Assembly and its subsidiary bodies and the\nSecurity Council.\nWe support the expansion of the Security Council\nin both permanent and non-permanent membership\ncategories. Reforms should take into account the\ninterests of both developed and developing countries.\nAll permanent members in an expanded Council\nshould have similar rights and privileges. However, the\nuse of the veto power should be curtailed and applied\nonly to Chapter VII issues. In doing so, we must move\nswiftly to complete the reforms of the United Nations\nsystem \u2014 including the Security Council \u2014 so we can\nrestore the capacity of the multilateral system to better\nserve us all.\nPapua New Guinea fully endorses the recent\nDeclarations and Plans of Action of the Doha,\nMonterrey and Johannesburg Conferences. We are\nresolved to meet the challenges of poverty eradication;\nhunger; illiteracy; environmental degradation; climate\nchange; and HIV/AIDS, malaria and other preventable\ndiseases. We are also committed to addressing issues of\ngood governance. It is the desire of the Government of\nPapua New Guinea to incorporate the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals into our national development\npriorities. We are in the process of adopting the\nmedium-term development strategy, which is aimed at\nredirecting development to the rural areas where the\nmajority of our people live. We encourage the\ninternational community \u2014 including all stakeholders\nin developed and developing countries \u2014 to continue\nto make resources available to fully implement those\nDeclarations and Plans of Action.\nLike other developing member States of the\nPacific Islands Forum, Papua New Guinea is firmly\ncommitted to the Barbados Programme of Action for\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island\nDeveloping States. We fully support its 10-year review\nprocess, which will take place at the international\nmeeting to be held in Mauritius in August 2004. We\ncall upon our regional and international development\npartners to support the review process, as was the case\nwith the recent conferences of the least developed and\nlandlocked developing countries.\nThe recent breakdown in the World Trade\nOrganization negotiations in Canc\u00fan is of great\nconcern to us all. However, that should not be a barrier\nto further negotiations to arrive at a fair and equitable\n18\n\narrangement that provides for the interests of all\nnations.\nOn a more targeted front, the African, Caribbean\nand Pacific (ACP) group of countries \u2014 of which\nPapua New Guinea is a member \u2014 are now negotiating\nwith the European Union for a possible economic\npartnership agreement. It is important that the main\nobjective be the eradication of poverty, and therefore\nthat trade preferences enjoyed by ACP countries under\nsuccessive Lom\u00e9 Conventions and under the current\nCotonou Agreements not be eroded.\nThe small island developing States of the Pacific\nregion are among the custodians of the largest ocean\nspace. The Pacific Ocean is rich in natural marine\nresources. The recent Pacific Islands Forum Leaders\nMeeting in Auckland, New Zealand, again reaffirmed\nthe Pacific Islands Regional Oceans Policy, which aims\nto ensure the future sustainable use of our oceans and\ntheir resources by our island communities, in close\ncooperation with our development partners.\nThe countries of the region, however, have\nlimited human, financial and technological capacities\nto control, manage and secure those resources for the\nbenefit of our current and future generations. In\nprotecting our vast marine resources, the Pacific\nIslands Forum leaders reiterate their serious concerns\nabout the shipment of radioactive materials through the\nregion. They also call upon States engaged in those\nactivities to accept full responsibility and liability for\ncompensation for any damage that may result, directly\nor indirectly, from the transportation of radioactive\nmaterial through the region. The two accidents that\nhappened in the Atlantic Ocean last year underline the\nreality of our concerns.\nPapua New Guinea, together with other small\nisland developing States, continues to express deep\nconcerns about the adverse impact of climate change,\nclimate variability and sea-level rise, particularly on\nthe small, low-lying islands that are already\nexperiencing extreme hardships. We will continue to\nstress the urgent need for developed countries to exert\nstrong leadership in the reduction of greenhouse gas\nemissions.\nPapua New Guinea has signed and ratified both\nthe United Nations Climate Change Convention and the\nKyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol paves the way\nforward for developed countries to fulfil their\nobligations under the Climate Change Convention. We\nbelieve that the larger developing countries also have\nan obligation to take concrete actions in reducing their\ngas emissions. We welcome the support of Japan, the\nEuropean Community and China for the Kyoto\nProtocol. We urge the United States, the Russian\nFederation and Australia to join the global efforts\naimed at addressing that issue, including ratification of\nthe Kyoto Protocol.\nPapua New Guinea is also not immune to the\nHIV/AIDS pandemic. Tuberculosis and malaria are\nagain on the rise, so there is an urgent need to find\npreventive measures for those diseases. I am, however,\npleased to report that the Papua New Guinea\nParliament this year enacted legislation aimed at\ndealing with the scourge by assisting with prevention\nand awareness programmes to reduce and limit the\nspread of HIV/AIDS, which threatens the lives of our\npeople, particularly mothers and children. In that\nregard, we thank Australia for its substantial assistance.\nWe also acknowledge continuing support from other\ndevelopment partners, including the United Nations\nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), the Joint United Nations\nProgramme on HIV/AIDS and the World Health\nOrganization.\nWe also support the work of the United Nations\nin relation to the protection and advancement of the\nrights of women and children. While we have ratified\nthe appropriate conventions, we realize that we must do\nmore. We acknowledge the support being provided by\nour development partners, including United Nations\nagencies such as the United Nations Development\nProgramme and UNICEF.\nPapua New Guinea fully concurs with the calls by\nthe international community to reform and restructure\nthe charters and mandates of the two Bretton Woods\ninstitutions. Their lending policies should be made\nmore lenient and flexible with regard to assisting\ndeveloping countries in their developmental efforts.\nAmong the greatest achievements of the United\nNations is the process of decolonization. But that\nprocess will not be completed \u2014 as it must be \u2014 until\nthe remaining 16 Non-Self-Governing Territories have\nexercised their inalienable right to self-determination.\nThe United Nations should continue to monitor\ndevelopments in New Caledonia, Tokelau and the other\n14 Non-Self-Governing Territories on the United\nNations decolonization list on a case-by-case basis.\nNeither size, remoteness nor population density should\n19\n\nbe allowed to limit the exercise of this inalienable\nright. The Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Meeting held\nin Auckland last month once again reaffirmed its\nsupport for that principle.\nIn conclusion, I want to reaffirm Papua New\nGuinea\u2019s firm commitment to the timeless principles\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter. We also\nstrongly advocate that it is Papua New Guinea\u2019s\nposition that diplomacy, through positive dialogue, is\nthe key to addressing these challenges.\nFinally, Papua New Guinea believes that a greater\nchallenge for all United Nations Member States is to\nwork together as genuine partners. That will serve as\nan effective tool for implementing our collective goal:\nto create a better and more secure world, both today\nand for future generations.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt\ngives me great pleasure on behalf of my delegation to\nextend to you, Sir, our heartfelt congratulations on your\nwell-deserved election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-eighth session. My delegation is\nparticularly pleased at the way you have been\nconducting the work of the Assembly thus far. The\nskills and experience that you bring to the Assembly\nhave been amply proven in the past days of our\ndeliberations. I wish to assure you of the continued\nsupport and cooperation of my delegation.\nLet me use this opportunity to congratulate your\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, for a job well done during\nthe fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly.\nIn the same vein, I wish to pay tribute to our\nillustrious Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his\nvaliant efforts in bringing the United Nations closer to\nthe people and in fostering peace and development\naround the world. He is discharging the functions of his\nhigh office in such a manner that he has won the hearts\nand minds of many people the world over.\nThis fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly\nis being held at a very momentous time in the history\nof the United Nations \u2014 a time when multilateralism is\nfacing serious threats and a time when the United\nNations, the main embodiment of multilateralism, has\nbeen confronting formidable challenges. Never in\nhistory have the relevance and mandate of the United\nNations been put to a greater test as in the past few\nmonths.\nCertainly, the tumultuous events of the past\nmonths have shaken the very foundation of our\nOrganization, but fortunately have not broken it. We\nare comforted by the fact that the United Nations has\nwithstood the test of time and emerged as not only\nrelevant, but indispensable in keeping world peace.\nLikewise, multilateralism has stood out as the only\nhope for all peoples. As we celebrate the United\nNations and its success, we should always remember\nthat it is our solidarity and steadfast adherence to the\nideals of the United Nations that have made our\nOrganization survive the trials and turbulence of the\npast year.\nI assure the Assembly that the Government and\npeople of the United Republic of Tanzania take pride in\nTanzania\u2019s membership of the United Nations. We\nremain committed to its ideals and ready to work\ntirelessly towards its advancement, strengthening and\nsuccess.\nPeace and security still eludes the world, as guns\nand explosives continue to thunder and cries of agony\ncontinue to be heard across the continents. These days,\nviolations of human rights have become common\noccurrences, even among the developed countries of\nthe world. Wars continue to rage, with Africa and Asia,\nsadly, claiming the largest share. Acts of terror, too,\ncontinue to resonate all over the world. Since the last\nGeneral Assembly session, for example, terrorists have\nstruck in 12 countries.\nAs a country that has been a victim of\ninternational terrorism, Tanzania condemns terrorism,\nwhatever the reason and wherever it takes place. My\nGovernment remains committed to the war against\nterror. In this regard, we will continue to cooperate\nwith world Governments and institutions of goodwill to\ndefeat terrorism. I take this opportunity to inform the\nAssembly that Tanzania has ratified all the major anti-\nterrorism protocols. We have also enacted a\ncomprehensive legislation to deal with terrorism and\nterrorist acts in our country.\nIt is very saddening to note that even the United\nNations has become a target of terrorist attacks, as\nexemplified by the recent tragic bombing of the United\nNations headquarters in Baghdad, which resulted in the\ndeath of 23 United Nations staff members, including\nthe charismatic diplomat and chief of mission, Sergio\nVieira de Mello and his chief of staff, Nadia Younes.\nOnce again, we condemn this senseless act, while\njoining in mourning our fallen heroes. They died for\nthe United Nations. They risked their lives and died for\na just cause, for which they will be remembered for\never in the history of our Organization. Tanzania\nproposes that the United Nations erect a fitting\nmemorial in their honour and memory.\n12\n\nI mentioned earlier that Africa has had an unfair\nshare of violent conflicts and wars, especially when\none considers the rampant poverty and low levels of\ndevelopment on the continent. However, I dare say,\nwith a sense of guarded optimism, that we see a\nglimmer of hope in the evolutions of processes to\nresolve some of Africa\u2019s seemingly intractable\nconflicts. I have in mind the conflicts in Liberia, the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, the Sudan\nand Somalia, where encouraging progress has been\nrecorded on the path to finding lasting solutions. The\nmost welcome development in these conflicts,\nhowever, is the fact that African nations and leaders\nhave taken the lead in the search for solutions. They\nhave done so under the auspices of the African Union\nor their regional economic groupings. In several cases,\nthey have also intervened as individuals or as groups of\nneighbours or like-minded nations and leaders.\nTanzania appreciates the support of the United\nNations and the international community for the efforts\nmade by African nations and leaders in the search for\npeace on the continent. We appeal for continued\nsupport to sustain the peace in the reconstruction\nphase. Equally important, I appeal for timely support\nand action. Experience has shown that the support of\nthe international community, including the United\nNations, in the search for solutions to African conflicts\nis a bit too slow, or comes a bit too late.\nMy delegation is extremely pleased to have been\na witness, on 25 September, of the adoption of the\nprinciples of good-neighbourly relations and\ncooperation between the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo, Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda. It is a welcome\ninitiative. We commend the Secretary-General for\nconceiving the idea. Once again, I register Tanzania\u2019s\nsupport for the initiative and promise that we shall do\nwhatever is within our means to promote its success.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to call\non the international community to extend the necessary\npolitical, economic and financial support to the\nTransitional Government in the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo, under the leadership of President Joseph\nKabila. We consider this critical to keep up the\nmomentum and avoid reversals.\nThe situation in Burundi, regrettably, remains\nprecarious. While we welcome the smooth transfer of\npower from President Buyoya to President Ndayizeye,\nwe also take note of positive developments under the\nTransitional Government. However, the Government\nand people of Burundi need to be supported to achieve\ncomprehensive peace and social and economic\nreconstruction. The regional leaders have been trying\nto help on the peace front and will continue to do so.\nSome progress has been made, but serious challenges\nstill lie ahead.\nThe unrelenting support of the international\ncommunity, especially the Security Council, is\ntherefore essential. We also call on the international\ncommunity to do more by way of extending economic\nand financial support to the Transitional Government\nof Burundi. It needs that support to effectively respond\nto the humanitarian needs in the country.\nMy Government welcomes the decision by the\nUnited Nations to convene the long awaited\ninternational conference on the Great Lakes region.\nPreparations are progressing well under the able\nleadership of Mr. Ibrahima Fall, the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s special representative for the Great Lakes\nregion. There is good cooperation between him, the\nAfrican Union and the six core countries of the region.\nTanzania feels greatly honoured to be given the\nopportunity to host the Conference in June 2004. We\nstand ready to contribute to its success.\nThe Conference will undoubtedly provide an\nimportant forum to all concerned parties to deliberate\non important issues of peace, stability and development\nin the region. We also hope that it will give due focus\nto the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the war-torn\ncountries. I appeal to all in the United Nations to\nextend the requisite material, financial, political and\ndiplomatic support to the Conference.\nWe welcome the latest Baker Plan on resolving\nthe long-standing Western Sahara problem. We appeal\nto the parties to extend the maximum possible\ncooperation to Mr. Baker so that the people of Western\nSahara can have an opportunity to determine their\nfuture peacefully.\nOwing to our strategic position in a conflict-\nridden region, and our history of stability and\ntraditional hospitality, Tanzania has played host to\nthousands of refugees from neighbouring countries.\nThe influx began in 1959 and has not stopped to date.\nAt present, we play host to more than 800,000 refugees\nfrom Rwanda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo and Somalia. We remain committed to our\ninternational obligations under the 1951 Geneva\n13\n\nConvention relating to the Status of Refugees as the\ncornerstone of international protection. However, our\n42 years of experience of hosting refugees have made\nus see the urgent need to review its relevance and\napplication. We are particularly concerned with the\nconcept and practice of burden-sharing, which does not\nadequately alleviate the burden of hosting refugees in\npoor developing countries like ours. We welcome the\nnew concept of \u201cConvention Plus\u201d espoused by the\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees. We hope that new\nand emerging realities will be given serious thought in\nthe discussions and conclusions of the High\nCommissioner\u2019s Executive Committee.\nThe situation in the Middle East remains a matter\nof great concern to my Government. When the Middle\nEast road map for peace was promulgated a few\nmonths ago, we became hopeful. My Government\nsupported it because it addressed comprehensively the\nissue of the establishment of a viable Palestinian State,\nliving side by side and in peace with Israel. Despite the\ncurrent difficulties, we still believe that the road map is\nthe most reasonable and viable way of resolving the\nlong-standing Israel-Palestine conflict. It is imperative,\ntherefore, that the obstacles on the road map be\novercome quickly. Violence and counter-violence will\nnot help.\nWe are also of the view that the use of excessive\nforce and recourse to extrajudicial measures in dealing\nwith Palestinian militants, or exiling President Yasser\nArafat, would be counterproductive; it would inflame\nthe situation. We appeal to the Quartet and the Security\nCouncil to do everything possible to bring the\nimplementation of the road map back on track.\nAs we all remember, at the dawn of the twenty-\nfirst century, the General Assembly at a special session\ndiscussed the challenge of poverty and development.\nAt the end we came up with the Millennium\nDeclaration and the Millennium Development Goals,\nwhich embodied a vision of engaging in a\ncomprehensive offensive against poverty, deprivation\nand lack of development. The clear target of halving\nthe scourge of poverty by 2015 was set.\nWhen we look back and evaluate what has been\nachieved in the three years since the Millennium\nSummit, we cannot fail to discover that not much has\nbeen done. Provision of the estimated $50 billion to\n$100 billion additional resources required annually\nover a period of 15 years to finance the implementation\nof the Millennium Development Goals is far from\nbeing realized. The subsequent meetings in Monterrey\nand Johannesburg, as well as the successive G-8\nsummits, have been unable to meet the requirement. As\nit stands now, the Millennium Development Goals risk\nnot being implemented as expected. Indeed, something\nneeds to be done quickly to save that historic summit.\nIt is incumbent upon the developed countries to\ndemonstrate greater political will. Certainly failure will\nnot be good for our Organization and surely it will be\nbad for all of us.\nThe current wave of globalization is the greatest\neconomic process of our time. The unfortunate collapse\nof the World Trade Organization meeting in Canc\u00fan\nlast month demands that we face up to this\nphenomenon. We hope that summit will be reconvened\nsoon. The social imperative of the wave of\nglobalization presents us with two interlinked\nchallenges that are central to the work of this\nOrganization. These pertain, on the one hand, to\nfighting poverty, and on the other, to working on\nconstructive and inclusive measures to promote the\neffectiveness of global institutions in global issues and\nconflicts.\nThese concerns have also been at the centre of the\nwork of the World Commission on the Social\nDimensions of Globalization, established last year\nunder the auspices of the International Labour\nOrganization (ILO), with a mandate to promote social\njustice and decent work, linked to economic and social\npolicies for global prosperity. This World Commission,\nwhich my President is privileged to co-chair with\nPresident Tarja Halonen of Finland, is about to\ncomplete its work and is due to submit its report early\nnext year.\nThe Commission has been a forum of useful\ndialogue between eminent personalities with a wide\ncross-section of backgrounds, views and competencies.\nIt has consulted widely and extensively. Its report is\nexpected to generate practical ideas for change that can\nmake the process of globalization more inclusive and\nmore equitable. It will address the needs of those who\nfeel marginalized, as well as those who have benefited\nfrom globalization but feel uncertain about the future.\nIt will speak of the significance of a value-based\nmultilateralism and the role of this Organization.\nHowever, the recommendations, mandate and\nvision of the work of the Commission will not be\n14\n\nundertaken, pursued and achieved through the work of\nthe ILO alone. They will constitute a wide remit for\nother agencies of the United Nations, other multilateral\nagencies, regional groupings, individual Governments,\nnon-governmental organizations and civil society. It is\nalso hoped that the report will be submitted to this\nAssembly for consideration and appropriate\npromotional direction.\nIt is the hope of my delegation that the\nCommission\u2019s report will be a welcome basis for\ncollective and concerted action towards the attainment\nof the Millennium Development Goals and in rendering\nglobalization a process that works for all, in all\ncountries, within countries and between countries.\nI would like to associate myself with the\nstatement made this morning by the Permanent\nRepresentative of Finland concerning the launching of\na Helsinki process on global governance and\ndemocracy, with which my Government feels proud to\nbe associated.\nThe fight against AIDS remains a major\nchallenge to mankind today. It is a war that we must\nfight and win. We realize the dire consequences of the\npandemic on human life and on our economies. The\nhigh-level plenary meeting held last week was\nreassuring and most of us came away from the session\nmodestly optimistic. Certainly, our resolve to squarely\nface up to the pandemic and to meet the set targets has\nto be coupled with equal responsibility for leadership\ninitiatives, accountability and more judicious resource\nmobilization and management.\nReform of the United Nations Security Council\nhas been in the cards for some time now. Tanzania is\nconvinced that the reform of the Security Council is\ndesirable, to make this important organ of our\nOrganization more representative, more democratic,\nmore transparent and more measured in the conduct of\nits business. We believe that this will go a long way\ntowards renewing the confidence and support of\nMember States in the relevance and effectiveness of the\nOrganization.\nTanzania accepts the truism that reform is a\nprocess and not an event. We support the establishment\nof the high-level panel of eminent personalities to\nreview the functioning of major organs of the United\nNations. We look forward to its early constitution. We\nattach special importance to this process and promise\nto play our part.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, my Government\nand country warmly congratulate you on your\nassumption of the Presidency of this fifty-eighth\nsession of the United Nations General Assembly. In\npresiding over the Assembly, Saint Lucia is setting an\nhistoric precedent for small island developing States,\nwith the able support of its Caribbean Community\n(CARICOM) neighbours.\nFiji fully supports your chairmanship. We also\nrecognize the successful leadership of your\n17\n\npredecessor, President Jan Kavan of the Czech\nRepublic.\nI wish to express my Government\u2019s deep\ncondolences to the family of Mr. Vieira de Mello and\nof all the victims of the bombing at the United Nations\nin Baghdad last month. This was a brutal crime, which\nrobbed the world of one of its most accomplished\nmediators and peacemakers. We hope that at this\nsession, we can all come together, united, in our\ncollective determination to rid the world of terrorism.\nI come from a part of the globe that is isolated in\nthe vast South Pacific. But that remoteness does not\nseparate us from the international perils of the bomb,\nthe gun and the hijacker. It does not insulate us against\nthose bent on causing death and destruction to defend\ntheir interests or advance a cause. The fact is that every\ncountry and region is a potential target.\nMembers of the Pacific Islands Forum are joined\nwith the United Nations in the search for a new order\nof peace and stability. That might seem an impossible\ntask set against the tensions, the hatreds, the bloodshed\nand violence of the times. But, if we abandon it, we sell\nout the principles of the United Nations. We betray our\ncountries, our peoples and generations to come.\nAre we so inadequate and lacking in our\nunderstanding and abilities that we are incapable of\ncoming up with new solutions to stop the spread of\nterror? It is not enough to simply strike out at the\nperpetrators. We must spend more effort and resources\nfinding out what turns people towards violence to\nachieve a goal. We must tell ourselves that there is a\ndifferent way, that the growing culture of violence and\nkilling is not destined to be a permanent part of our\nworld.\nThe United Nations needs to go to the root causes\nof this terrible phenomenon, which casts a very dark\nand menacing shadow over the first years of the\ntwenty-first century. In the Pacific, we are\nconcentrating on security issues, strengthening law and\norder and maintaining stability. A number of initiatives\nwere taken during the last 12 months when our Prime\nMinister served as Forum chair.\nForemost among these initiatives was the ground-\nbreaking decision to send a peace mission to the\nSolomon Islands in response to a plea for assistance\nfrom that country. The Solomon Islands had been\nwracked for several years by civil unrest, lawlessness\nand ethnic conflict. We in Fiji had a sympathetic\nappreciation of the difficulties facing those islands\nbecause of our own crisis in 2000. We were more than\nhappy, therefore, to contribute to a task force to the\nSolomon Islands charged with bringing back order and\nre-establishing peace. A contingent of our troops,\ncombined with others from Australia, Papua New\nGuinea, Tonga and New Zealand, is now in the\nSolomon Islands working with the people there. We are\nencouraged by what our own soldiers and their\ncomrades have been able to do so far to support a\nneighbour in distress. Our task is given extra\nsignificance through the close ties we enjoy with the\nSolomon Islands.\nThe Solomon Islands mission has inevitably\ngenerated some controversy and debate about\nAustralia\u2019s expanding involvement in our region. But\nlet the record reflect that we endorse Australia\u2019s\nleading role in this intervention on the invitation of the\nSolomon Islands Government. One of its notable\naspects is that it is multilateral. It was accomplished\nthrough the Pacific Islands Forum and has the\nunanimous support of the members. Beyond this, we\nknow that the support and encouragement of the\ninternational community and the United Nations\nsystem will remain important, as work to build a\ncredible law and justice system, an effective\nadministration and a viable economic base continues.\nRecent happenings have brought into question the\nvalue, the relevance and the future of multilateralism.\nOur position is that we understood the concerns, which\nled the United States to act in the way it did over Iraq.\nThe date of 11 September 2001 was a shattering ordeal.\nIt changed history and it changed America.\nThat said, Fiji declares an unwavering\ncommitment to the concept of the world community\nworking together, seeking the common path forward.\nWe stand by the ideals of a multilateral, cooperative\napproach among nations. We welcome the decision by\nthe United States to now seek United Nations\ninvolvement in Iraq\u2019s reconstruction.\nIn the Pacific, the Nasonini Declaration on\nregional security, adopted last year in Fiji, is a\nkeystone of joint strategy. It followed the earlier\nHoniara Declaration on Law Enforcement Cooperation,\naimed at countering transnational and organized crime.\nThe Forum countries will give higher priority to\nimplementing legislative provisions to improve our\n18\n\ncapacity for dealing with law enforcement and security\nchallenges. Underpinning this is an Australian\ncommitment, also approved by the Forum, to spend\napproximately $15 million over three years, to\nstrengthen regional police forces. New Zealand has,\nadditionally, agreed to put in $2 million. This important\nproject is to be based in Fiji. A regional academy will\nprovide training for about 900 police officers annually\nfrom Forum countries.\nFiji has been taking part in United Nations\npeacekeeping operations since 1978. This has come at\na price. But, to us, serving world peace with our\nsoldiers demonstrates that even the smallest States can\nplay their part in minimizing and preventing conflicts.\nCurrently, 635 Fiji personnel are on active duty in\nUnited Nations missions, apart from 123 soldiers and\n15 police in the Solomon Islands. Our commitment to\nUnited Nations peacekeeping has not changed. It is a\nvital part of our foreign policy.\nFiji stresses the importance of strengthening\nmultilateral treaties and conventions on disarmament\nand non-proliferation. Our country is one of those that\nwant to see an effective global strategy for the control\nof small arms and light weapons.\nDuring our Prime Minister\u2019s chairmanship of the\nPacific Islands Forum, there was a deepening of the\nSouth Pacific region\u2019s engagement with development\npartners and international organizations. Heads of\nGovernment from member States enhanced their ties\nwith France and Japan. They met in Tahiti with\nPresident Chirac and discussed many topics of common\nconcern.\nAt a summit with Prime Minister Koizumi in\nOkinawa, they were able to reach and agreement on the\noutcome of the World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment, the Millennium Development Goals and\nour own regional priorities, as a further basis for future\ncollaboration.\nThe Pacific Islands Forum now has 12 dialogue\npartners, including the United States, Canada, France,\nthe United Kingdom, the European Union, Japan,\nChina, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, India and\nTaiwan.\nChina \u2014 the emerging giant in world affairs and\ntrade \u2014 has a steadily growing presence in our region.\nIts involvement and support for our economic and\nsocial development is welcome. We see definite scope\nfor trade, investment, cultural and tourism links. China,\nmany commentators believe, already has the world\u2019s\nsecond largest economy. Its present aid programme is\nsignificant and we expect it to grow substantially as\nbilateral relationships grow stronger.\nAt the same time, we place great value on our\ntrade and commerce with Taiwan and value its\nassistance to our development. We look forward to the\nday when China and Taiwan peacefully resolve their\nlong-standing differences.\nWe also welcome Japan\u2019s role and presence in the\nPacific Islands region. Japan is an economic\npowerhouse and its increased role and contribution in\npromoting international security and development\nshould be recognized by all Member States in allowing\nJapan a special place in the United Nations Security\nCouncil.\nI am pleased to report that in Fiji and the region,\nthere is more coordination in the effort to curb\nHIV/AIDS, the most terrible disease of our era.\nAlthough we have so far escaped the worst effects of\nHIV/AIDS, it is a real danger in the islands.\nWe expect to make substantial progress in our\nfight against this affliction, with support from Japan\nand France and an allocation from the Global Fund to\nFight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. A programme\nfinanced by Australia provides $12.5 million for the\nregional campaign. Our Government will also make a\nlarger HIV/AIDS allocation in next year\u2019s budget.\nHIV/AIDS screening was recently at the centre of\ndiscussion in Fiji, when a suggestion was made for\nobligatory testing. Such a move was regarded by our\nHuman Rights Commission as a rights violation. We\nmust weigh the Commission\u2019s views carefully against\nthe competing call for radical response to a national\nthreat.\nThe Fiji Human Rights Commission is a product\nof our Constitution and its comprehensive bill of rights.\nThe Commission is implementing a public education\ncampaign to overcome a lack of awareness on rights\nissues. It also monitors Government and statutory\nauthorities so that laws and policies conform to\ninternational human rights principles and the\nrequirements of the Constitution. These generally\nreflect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\nadopted by this Assembly in 1948.\n19\n\nAs a former colony, Fiji is a late-starter in\npromoting human rights and civil liberties. Our\nGovernment\u2019s strategic plan to 2005 expresses very\nclearly where we stand. The plan was endorsed by a\nnational economic summit and by Parliament. Please\nallow me to quote briefly from the plan:\n\u201cThe guarantee of fundamental rights and\nfreedoms for every citizen of Fiji and their equal\nprotection under the law ... is an essential part of\nour vision for a peaceful Fiji. A feeling of\npersonal security and of group security comes\nabout when people have confidence that breaches\nof rights and freedoms will be dealt with\nimpartially and speedily\u201d.\nI quote further:\n\u201c... Respect for the rights of others is a\ncritical component of our freedoms guaranteed\nunder the constitution. It is essential for peaceful\nexistence in our multi-cultural society\u201d.\nI emphasize these points because sometimes there\nare attempts to depict Fiji as a land where rights are\nhabitually abused. Propaganda against our country has\nbeen circulated in some quarters here at the United\nNations.\nMuch of this stems from opposition to our\naffirmative action policies designed to end social and\neconomic inequalities. These are based on principles\nwell-established internationally and are provided for in\nour Constitution.\nIt is self-evident that a country cannot grow in\njustice, harmony and prosperity when more than half of\nits population \u2014 in this case the indigenous Fijians \u2014\nare largely outside the economy looking in.\nAll right-thinking people will agree that it is just\nand fair that this should be changed. But we constantly\nstress that this is not about taking from one group to\ngive to another. It is about making the economy grow\nso that there is enough wealth to be shared equitably\namong our population. We want to give the Fijians a\nchance to catch up and compete in business and\ncommerce.\nLet it be noted that we have brought in laws to\nhelp the disadvantaged of all communities. This is a\nconstitutional obligation. No one is being left out. That\nis the commitment we have made to our own\npopulation, and we now make to the international\ncommunity.\nDisparities and inequalities go to the very heart of\nthe dispute which brought about the collapse of the\nCanc\u00fan talks. The failure of the talks underscores the\ndeep differences which separate the poor countries\nfrom the rich in the battle to reform international trade.\nWe acknowledge the ideal of free trade, but the stark\nreality is that there are many dangerous pitfalls for\nnations whose economies are weak and vulnerable.\nIt will be a long time before most developing\nStates are ready to compete on that so-called level\nplaying field. To them it is not level at all. Bring the\nbarriers down completely and the full might of first-\nworld commercial power will descend. What will that\ndo to home-grown and emerging industries in poorer\ncountries?\nFor the time being, countries like ours need\npreferences and special access for our economic\nsurvival. Think of it as a form of affirmative action to\nreduce that yawning chasm between the rich North and\nthe poverty-stricken South. We now need to urgently\nconsider where the World Trade Organization goes\nfrom here, and what can be done to salvage the\nwreckage of Canc\u00fan.\nAbout three and-a-half years ago, my country\ncame very close to anarchy. We had an armed\ninsurrection, hostage-taking and violence. The\nGovernment of the day was overthrown. It was a time\nof extreme crisis for Fiji.\nNow, I can stand before this Assembly to tell you\nthat our nation is being reborn. Order and stability were\nrestored and the first steps taken on a continuing\njourney of reconciliation. We had peaceful, democratic\nelections. Our Government is on a mission to build a\nFiji where peace, multi-racial harmony and prosperity\nwill always reign.\nOur economic policy is to create more\nemployment and wealth through high growth. We have\nincreased Government investment in infrastructure and\nmade a concerted and, to this point, successful effort to\nattract greater volumes of private capital. Many of the\nindicators are positive \u2014 apart from those relating to\nour sugar industry. This year, we expect to achieve an\noverall growth rate of more than five per cent.\nThis remarkable recovery could not have been\nachieved without the encouragement and support of\n20\n\nmany friends of Fiji in the international community,\nand especially here at the United Nations.\nI pay tribute to the role of the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme, the World Health\nOrganization, the Food and Agriculture Organization,\nthe United Nations Population Fund, the United\nNations Children\u2019s Fund, the United Nations\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and\nthe International Labour Organization. The ILO is\nmaking a particularly valuable contribution at the\nmoment with a plan to accelerate job creation.\nTo conclude, the \u201cspecial case\u201d of the small\nisland developing States is calling for a \u201cspecial\nresponse\u201d of the global community, in further\nadvancing our sustainable development efforts. The\nten-year comprehensive review of the Barbados\nProgramme of Action in Mauritius next year will\nprovide the avenue for our development partners to\nmake further commitments to our cause. Fiji is urging\nthe international community to contribute to the\nsuccess of this meeting.\nMr. President and fellow delegates, the United\nNations is currently experiencing considerable strain\nand division, but it is for all of us to ensure that this\nOrganization comes through the period of difficulty,\nstrengthened and regenerated. The world needs the\nUnited Nations and what it stands for.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMy delegation celebrates the\nwisdom of the United Nations in choosing one of our\ndistinguished Caribbean statesmen, Mr. Julian Hunte,\nto preside over this fifty-eighth session of the General\nAssembly. I assure you, Sir, that the energy and\nindustry that you will bring to our work will produce\nvery meaningful results in this very important session.\nWe continue to be fortunate to have the guidance\nand strength of our Secretary-General, whose skill and\ncompassion are especially needed today. His words last\nTuesday echoed strong and true, and we should all take\nheed.\nAnd speaking of all, we need to respect the\nprinciple of universality of our Organization. The time\nhas come to admit Taiwan to membership of the United\nNations. Taiwan has proven itself to be an exemplary\nmember of the international community with a deep\nsense of solidarity with small and poor nations.\nBelize\u2019s Prime Minister has said:\n\u201cWhen we turn our attention to the\ninternational stage there is greater cause for\nanxiety. Let us ask ourselves: After all the\ndevelopments in building the international system\nand crystallizing international law from 1945 to\nthe present, which of the following fundamental\nprinciples are respected in practice or indeed safe\nin theory: the peaceful settlement of disputes; the\nright to self-determination, sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity; non-interference in the\ninternal affairs of States; the right of peoples to\nhave the social and political system of their\nchoice; respect for social, economic and political\nhuman rights; not to use force or the threat of\nforce to settle disputes; respect for the\ninternational rule of law; abiding by the Charter\nof the United Nations; and working towards a\nworld governance based on multilateralism and\nthe rule of reason, rather than of force?\n\u201cWhich of those is safe? Indeed, in the\ninternational arena \u2026 we do seem to be in free\nfall towards barbarism\u201d.\nBarbarism may not be new, but there does seem\nto be a greater tolerance for it and we do seem to be\n22\n\nmore powerless to contain it. In a world riddled with\nfear and dominated by terrorism, including State\nterrorism, we need to concentrate on what needs to be\ndone to save our humanity.\nAs we contemplate the international arena, with\nmultilateralism under threat and the development of\npeoples blocked by the practices of the rich and\npowerful, we can take comfort in one thing \u2014 that,\nyes, in the end ideas are more powerful than arms. And\nour ideas \u2014 we the United Nations of the world \u2014 are\nclearly and powerfully set out in our Charter. Yes, the\nCharter needs reform; we need urgently to democratize\nour practice. Small States make up the majority of our\nmembership and elementary democracy demands that\nwe have a greater say than our Charter presently allows\nus, but the basic principles of the Charter remain valid.\nThe fundamentals are in place.\nArticle 1 of the Charter states the fundamental\npurpose of the United Nations: To maintain\ninternational peace and security, and to that end to take\neffective collective measures for the prevention and\nremoval of threats to the peace, and for the suppression\nof acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace.\nArticle 24 of the Charter confers on the Security\nCouncil primary responsibility for the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. Under Article 42,\nshould the Security Council consider that measures\nshort of the use of force would be inadequate or have\nproved to be inadequate, it may take such action by air,\nsea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or\nrestore international peace and security. Such action\nmust, of course, be agreed collective action, not\nunilateral action.\nI ask members of the Assembly: Is there any part\nof that we do not understand? It seems perfectly simple\nand clear to us small States, which depend on the\nUnited Nations Charter and on respect for international\nprinciples and international law for our very existence.\nWe are confronted with the question: Are we as an\nOrganization irrelevant? And I say: only if we make\nourselves irrelevant. And we do that only if we are\ndetermined to self-destruct.\nWe can call here for many lofty objectives, as\ncontained in our Millennium Development Goals. We\ncan pronounce on the many injustices facing so many\npeoples and countries in the present world\ndispensation, but all of that would be futile if our very\nUnited Nations should cease to be effective or become\nirrelevant. That is why I have restricted my statement\nto one plea to nations large and small, powerful or\nweak: Keep the United Nations alive, respect its\nCharter, abide by agreed international principles and\ninternational law. That is all we ask, nothing more.\nAbove all, let us not give up what it has cost us so\nmuch time and effort, so much blood, to bring to a\nmodest but important stage \u2014 our multilateral system.\nAll civilized nations would surely agree to this\nplea rather than plunge the world into barbarism.\nMultilateralism or chaos. Long Live the United\nNations!\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMy delegation associates\nitself with the compliments expressed to Mr. Julian\nHunte on his election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly at this session; to his predecessor, Mr. Jan\nKavan of the Czech Republic; and to the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan.\nAs we converge upon this city of New York, we\nare once again reminded of the stark reality of the\nscourge of terrorism, whose effects have reverberated\nacross the world. Earlier this month two years ago, in\nthis very city, humanity suffered the worst threat ever\nvisited on it by terrorism. We continue to share the\ngrief of those who will forever miss the love and the\nsupport of their loved ones. We must therefore reaffirm\nour resolve to join together in partnership to eliminate\nthose elements which threaten to destroy humanity and\nits way of life.\nOur best hope for success is   and should be  \nour collective strength. We owe it to ourselves and to\nfuture generations of humankind to pool our resources\nand strategies to annihilate the scourge of terrorism. In\ndoing so, we must simultaneously and genuinely\nexamine and begin to understand what forces and\nfactors drive an inherently good human being to\ncommit such desperate actions and drastic acts of\nviolence, in the process committing them not only\nagainst others, but against himself. Our preventive\nmeasures must address such forces and factors in order\nto disarm potential terrorists.\nThe progress report on the implementation of the\nMillennium Development Goals in Lesotho documents\nthat the single greatest obstacle to the development of\nour nation   and indeed to reaching the objectives laid\nout in the Goals   is the scourge of HIV/AIDS. In our\npart of the world, Southern Africa, Governments are\noverwhelmed by high levels of morbidity and\nmortality, especially among the working-age group in\nall sectors, including health and agriculture. HIV/AIDS\nhas become the leading cause of the food insecurity\nand famine that plague so many of our people today.\nWe are also frustrated because our efforts to\nachieve the Millennium Development Goal of\neducation for all by 2015 through the introduction of\nfree primary education is faltering due to the high rate\nof absenteeism by both teachers and pupils. Teachers\nare sick and dying. Children   especially girls   are\ndropping out of school to take care of their sick\nrelatives. The number of malnourished, traumatized,\norphaned and out-of-school children is increasing at an\nalarming rate. We therefore stress the need for urgent\nassistance to Lesotho and the southern African region\nand increased supplies of the anti-retroviral and other\nrelated HIV and AIDS drugs, in order to curb the\nscourge. Lesotho and the region also need financial and\ntechnical resources for training and capacity-building\nin HIV and AIDS programme implementation and\nmanagement.\nLesotho is concerned that the goal of poverty\neradication, which is the first Millennium Development\nGoal and one of the cross-cutting themes of all major\nUnited Nations conferences and summits, could elude\nthe international community. Indeed, this critical state\nof affairs is highlighted in the Economic Report on\nAfrica, 2003, which indicates that in 2002, of the 53\ncountries in Africa, only five achieved the 7 per cent\ngrowth rate required to meet the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals, while 43 countries registered\ngrowth rates below 7 per cent and five countries\nregistered negative growth rates.\nAgainst the backdrop of a democratizing\ncontinent   a precondition set for assistance by the\ndeveloped North   there is a growing consensus that\nthe decline in official development assistance and other\nfinancial flows to Africa is increasing the\n19\n\nmarginalization of the continent in the global economy.\nWithout new inflows of external resources, the pace of\ndevelopment in Africa will forever remain elusive. My\ndelegation therefore wishes to reiterate its appeal to the\ndeveloped countries to fulfil the commitments made at\nall the major United Nations conferences, as well as at\nthe Millennium Summit.\nFurthermore, we wish to stress the need for a\nreview of the list of heavily indebted poor countries\nand those on the borderline, so that all poor countries\nthat, like Lesotho, face debt servicing difficulties, can\nbe considered under the enhanced Heavily Indebted\nPoor Countries Debt Initiative. My delegation also\nshares the view that debt cancellation for the least\ndeveloped countries should be considered as a viable\noption so that such countries can inject that money into\ntheir economies.\nMy delegation reiterates the call for increased\nsupport to the New Partnership for Africa's\nDevelopment (NEPAD). We are aware that Iraq today\ndominates the world spotlight, as was confirmed in\nrecent testimony before the Congress of the United\nStates of America, which was asked to approve $87\nbillion for the rehabilitation of that country. In sharp\ncontrast, an injection of only about $6 billion into\nNEPAD would go a long way towards achieving what\nis a continentwide agenda.\nAfrican leaders need extensive support as they\naddress, inter alia, the root causes of the agricultural\ncrises in the continent. For us in Africa, agriculture is\nthe engine of overall growth, as it is at the very core of\npeople's livelihoods, especially in the rural areas. It is\nlinked to issues of food security and affects growth in\nother economic sectors.\nLesotho is deeply concerned that armed conflicts\ncontinue to hinder economic growth in Africa and\nelsewhere. We have also been shocked by several\nreports of an extreme lack of respect for the basic\nprinciples of international humanitarian law on the part\nof parties to armed conflict. Equally regrettable are\nincidents of egregious violations of the rights of\nwomen and children. We therefore commend the\nUnited Nations for all its efforts aimed at the\nelimination of human suffering in armed conflict.\nIndeed, the establishment of the International Criminal\nTribunals, the birth of the International Criminal Court\nand the setting up of the Special Court for Sierra\nLeone, are cause for considerable optimism and prove\nbeyond any doubt that the world has grown weary of\nimpunity. It is our fervent hope that Member States will\ncontinue to provide the necessary support and\ncooperation to those institutions.\nAfrica hungers for peace. The continent must\nnever again have to witness acts of violence and\natrocities such as those that were recently committed in\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and Liberia. We\nhope that the international community will continue to\nsupport all endeavours aimed at attaining lasting peace,\nsecurity and stability in those countries.\nMy delegation is encouraged by the progress to\ndate to restore law and order in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, including the establishment of\nan all-inclusive transitional Government of National\nUnity. The international community must intensify its\nefforts to assist millions of Congolese people who are\nnot only displaced but also facing serious food\nshortages. My delegation is confident that, with the\nnecessary support, the Government of National Unity\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo will restore\npeace and security in the country and heal the deep\nwounds caused by war and ethnic hatred. We are also\ngratified that the Security Council has mandated a\nspecial Panel to investigate the plunder of natural\nresources in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It\nis our hope and wish that those responsible will be\nbrought to book.\nThe people of Angola have peace at last, now that\none of Africa's longest-running fratricidal wars has\ncome to an end. The scars of war in Angola will remain\nforever, deeply embedded in the memories of the most\nvulnerable of the population   the women and\nchildren of that country, where motherhood was abused\nand children were deprived of their childhood.\nReintegration and rehabilitation assistance to Angola,\ntherefore, should, in the main, target those groups.\nThe future of Somalia continues to hang in the\nbalance, despite the efforts by Kenya, the Inter-\nGovernmental Authority on Development, the African\nUnion and all other stakeholders to put an end to the\ncarnage in that country. Somalia has been turned into a\nbreeding ground for warlords who have no respect for\nhuman life but are greedy for power and money. We\ntend to agree with those who argue that the deployment\nof an international force would help to facilitate the\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration process.\n20\n\nAt the end of the day, however, the responsibility for\nbringing peace and reconciliation to Somalia lies with\nthe Somalis themselves.\nAlthough there have been positive indicators in\nthe search for a peaceful and acceptable solution to the\nconflict between Israel and Palestine, we are concerned\nthat the recent resumption of the cycle of violence will\nrender the road map for peace futile. The drastic and\nrepressive measures, the unilateral erection of a wall\ndividing the two, the reoccupation of Palestinian towns\nand villages, and the targeting of Hamas leaders with\nthe aim of killing them are all measures which cannot\nhelp the course of peace or ensure that the Palestinian\npeople enjoy their inalienable rights, including the\nright to self-determination in a sovereign and\nindependent State. In like manner, the continuing\nsuicide missions by militant groups to kill Israelis\nindiscriminately cannot, and must not, be condoned or\njustified.\nBut then two stark realities must be addressed:\nfirst, that the root cause of the problem is the illegal\noccupation of Palestinian lands; and secondly, that no\none country can be an honest broker in the Middle\nEast. History itself positions some countries so much\nwith one party to the conflict that they cannot   even\nwith the best of intentions   be non-partisan.\nConsequently, my delegation strongly urges the United\nNations to take the initiative and to lead the process,\nand thus to lend legitimacy and credibility to the efforts\nto find an abiding solution.\nThe same goes for the people of Western Sahara.\nIn the civilized world of the twenty-first century, it is\nsimply untenable that we still have colonizers in some\nparts of the world, in disregard of the widely accepted\nprinciples of self-determination and democracy. The\ninternational community must intervene so as to bring\nfinality to the status of the Saharawi Arab Democratic\nRepublic. The brotherly people of Sahara have suffered\nunduly and long enough.\nOn a positive note, we welcome the lifting of\nsanctions against Libya by the Security Council.\nNevertheless, it is our contention that the lifting of the\nsanctions would have been more significant if all the\nmembers of the Security Council had raised their flags\nin favour.\nBy the same token, it is now time to collectively\naddress all issues relating to the unilateral economic\nblockade against Cuba. It is simply untenable for the\nUnited Nations to look on helplessly when a Member\nState strangles another Member State of this body,\nsimply because it holds or practices different economic\nphilosophies or political viewpoints. Those truths must\nbe confronted and discussed in honesty and without\nmalice towards anyone. Otherwise, our credibility and\nour raison d''tre are called into question.\nIn conclusion, I wish to refer to the question of\nthe reform of the Security Council. It is now a trite fact\nthat the credibility of the United Nations   including\nits adherence to multilateralism   is being openly\nquestioned. It will take a lot of work to change that\nperception on the part of many, especially in the\ndeveloping world. The Secretary-General, Mr. Annan,\nhas on several occasions stressed the need for radical\nreform to restore United Nations credibility. We\ntherefore applaud the statement that he made before\nthis body yesterday that he intends to establish a high-\nlevel panel of eminent persons to look into the\nchallenges to peace, security and other global issues. It\nis our hope that the recommendations of that panel will\npave the way to a better international order.\nIt has been almost 10 years since the\nestablishment of an open-ended working group to study\nall questions relating to equitable representation in the\nSecurity Council, including increasing the membership\nof the Council. My delegation is of the view that there\nis an urgent need to accelerate the pace and to redouble\nour efforts to bring this matter to a conclusion. Let us\nface it: the very concept and practice of a veto in the\nSecurity Council is simply untenable and is totally at\nvariance with the democratic principles of our modern\ntimes. For one member with a veto to overrule 14\nothers is simply undemocratic. It is patently unjust and\ncontrary to every principle underpinning fair play and\nworld order. My delegation cannot   in all honesty\nand without malice to anyone   understand how and\nwhy leading champions of democracy can cling so\ndesperately to such an outmoded, primitive and unjust\nsystem. The same sacred convictions, truths and beliefs\nthat guided and forced our forbears to abolish slavery,\nto declare racism and genocide crimes against\nhumanity and to preach and uphold the equality of all\nhumans must of necessity guide us in this instance.\nOtherwise, history will judge and chastise us\nseverely   but justifiably   as dishonest. Such is the\nnaked truth staring us in the face.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like to begin\nby extending Latvia\u2019s heartfelt congratulations to\nMr. Julian Hunte on his appointment as President of the\nUnited Nations General Assembly. Latvia highly values\nhis extensive experience and is confident that he will\nsucceed in his efforts to hasten the pace of reforms\nwithin the Assembly. I am pleased that a broad\nconsensus on the main goals of these reforms was\nachieved during the previous session, and I wish him\nsuccess in his responsible duties.\nThree days ago, the people of Latvia made a\nhistorical decision that will influence their country\u2019s\ncourse of development over the next foreseeable\ndecades, or even centuries. On 20 September 2003, the\npeople of Latvia decided, in a referendum, to join the\nEuropean Union. In voting for accession to this\ninfluential body of free and democratic nations, my\ncountry became the last of 10 candidate States to\nconfirm its commitment to a strong and united Europe\nand to the extension of a growing family of secure and\nprosperous nations.\nIt is our hope that this extended Union of 25\nmember States will serve not only to promote the\nwelfare of its citizens, but also to become an even more\nsignificant contributor to international stability and\nworldwide prosperity. The European Union is already\nthe world\u2019s largest provider of development assistance\nand Latvia looks forward to undertaking the\nresponsibilities and commitments that this entails. This\nincludes taking an active part in the formulation of\npriorities to ensure that the assistance provided by the\nEuropean Union reaches those who need it most.\nLatvia and her Baltic neighbours reappeared on\nthe international stage only twelve short years ago,\nfollowing half a century of totalitarian rule under Nazi\nGermany and Soviet Russia. Our success story of\nrebirth and renewal testifies to the fact that through\nhard work and dedicated effort the re-establishment of\ndemocratic societies and functioning market economies\ncan be realized within a relatively short period of time.\nMany other nations in transition are now\nundertaking similar paths of development and reform.\nLatvia is already sharing its experiences with other\n2\n\ndeveloping countries, and will continue to do so in the\nfuture.\nTwelve years ago, when Latvia became a member\nof the United Nations, the Soviet Union was in the\nprocess of breaking up and the Cold War was coming\nto an end. As the threat of a nuclear conflagration\nbetween two mutually hostile superpowers receded,\nnew challenges to world security were coming to the\nfore, and older ones were showing no sign of going\naway.\nPerhaps humanity\u2019s greatest problem lies in its\npropensity for violence, which manifests itself in all\nlevels of society, starting with the abusive individual in\nthe family household and ending in armed conflict in\nthe international arena. Even peaceful countries with\nlengthy traditions of non-intervention and domestic\ntranquillity are finding themselves faced with tragic\nacts of senseless violence that include the beating and\nkilling of immigrants and political assassinations.\nThe unrest and turmoil in the Middle East, which\nhas lasted for well over five decades, shows no sign of\nabating and can only come to an end once violence is\nfirmly forsaken as a means for obtaining political ends.\nLatvia views the road map for peace, which foresees a\nfree and secure State of Israel living in peace alongside\nan independent Palestinian State as the only feasible\nmeans for ending the dangerous impasse that both sides\nhave now reached. The alternative is a continuing\nescalation of bloodshed, a never-ending cycle of killing\nand mounting mutual hostility.\nLatvia is ready to promote the establishment of a\nlasting peace in the region, under the auspices of both\nthe United Nations and the European Union. We\nencourage the interested parties to do everything within\ntheir means to de-escalate tensions and put the peace\nprocess back on track.\nThe establishment of a genuine and lasting peace\nbetween the Israelis and the Palestinians would also\nhave an additional benefit. It would remove the\nPalestinian cause as an excuse for terrorists to justify\ntheir actions of murder and destruction. As the events\nof the last few years so poignantly reveal, terrorism and\narms proliferation have become two of the largest\nthreats to world security today.\nCurrently, the international community is deeply\ndivided about the ethics and feasibility of\nimplementing direct military action against\nGovernments that are deemed to support and sponsor\nterrorism. In the case of Afghanistan and Iraq, where\nundeniably repressive regimes were removed by force\nthrough outside intervention, the military measures\nundertaken by the United States and its allies will have\nto be followed by comprehensive international efforts\nto help those countries rebuild their societies and their\neconomies. I am certain that most of us would agree on\nthe need for reconstruction and security regardless of\nour opinion about the foreign military presence in these\ntwo countries.\nWithin the limited means at its disposal, Latvia\nhas sent humanitarian assistance and military medical\npersonnel to Afghanistan and has dispatched a military\ncontingent to help maintain order in post-war Iraq.\nAs we collectively seek to avoid a clash of\ncivilizations between different societies in the world,\nso we must seek to reduce the growing discrepancies\nbetween the rich and the poor. Poverty afflicts every\nsingle member country of the United Nations. About\nthree billion people, or half the world\u2019s population,\nstruggle to subsist on the equivalent of less than two\ndollars a day. Seventy per cent of the world\u2019s poorest\npeople live in rural areas and depend on agriculture for\ntheir subsistence. The Millennium Goal of reducing\npoverty and of halving the proportion of people earning\nless than one dollar a day can be achieved only by\nimproving the plight of poor farmers and creating\nviable agricultural communities. Poor farmers in\ndeveloping countries cannot compete with products\nsubsidized by the treasuries of the world\u2019s richest\ncountries.\nAt this month\u2019s World Trade Organization (WTO)\nMinisterial Conference in Canc\u00fan, Mexico, United\nNations Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged the WTO\nmember States to say no to trade policies that\naggravate poverty and to say yes to bold and sensible\nsteps that will revive the global economy and set the\nnew course for development.\nPoverty also provides fertile ground for modern-\nday slavery and the trafficking of humans, which\ncontinues to occur in nearly all regions of the globe. At\nthe beginning of the twenty-first century, an estimated\n27 million people are still being bought, sold, held\ncaptive, brutalized and exploited for profit. Together\nwith non-governmental organizations that are working\nto stop slavery, and through international organizations\n3\n\nsuch as the United Nations, our Governments must\nhelp those slaves break free from their chains.\nWe all live in a world where such deadly diseases\nas HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and, lately, SARS,\nto name a few, know no borders. It is only through the\ncontinued vigilance of our countries\u2019 health officials\nand through close international cooperation that we\nwill ever be able to keep those mortal dangers in check.\nI hope that yesterday\u2019s AIDS conference has\nstrengthened the resolve and confidence of participants\nto overcome this great affliction.\nThe Government of Latvia is actively pursuing its\ncommitments under the Millennium Declaration to\nattain the Millennium Development Goals. For\nexample, it has prepared a national action plan to\naddress the needs of children in consultation with local\nauthorities, non-governmental organizations and the\nchildren themselves. In cooperation with the United\nNations Development Programme office in Riga, it has\nalso established a working group that is devoting\nparticular attention to the reduction of child mortality\nand the improvement of mothers\u2019 health.\nDuring the twentieth century, mankind inflicted\nmore environmental damage on our planet than during\nall of the previous centuries combined. If we do not\ndevote greater efforts to reducing environmental\npollution, including greenhouse gas emissions, then\nfuture generations stand to inherit a planet with\nincreasingly destructive climate change and with a\nforest cover that is restricted to scattered nature\nreserves. We must avoid reaching the stage at which\nthe Earth\u2019s energy and food resources become\nirreversibly depleted. People and Governments must be\nwilling to make difficult economic sacrifices for the\nsake of a cleaner environment.\nSince its foundation in 1945, the United Nations\nhas seen the number of its Member States increase\nalmost fourfold. It has seen European colonialism, the\nCold War and apartheid come to an end. It has\nsuccessfully brokered the cessation of hostilities in\nCyprus, East Timor and other countries. It has provided\ntrillions of dollars of development assistance to\nnumerous countries. Latvia believes that the United\nNations should remain the principal world body for the\nmediation of international disputes and for the\nformulation of universal rules of conduct that all abide\nby.\nHowever, the United Nations has also been\ncriticized for being slow, unwieldy and ineffectual.\nFew would disagree that it has reached a point where\nchanges within its structure are required so that it can\neffectively deal with the new challenges of the twenty-\nfirst century. Let us recall that a working group on the\nreform of the Security Council was created already ten\nyears ago, shortly after the collapse of the bipolar\nworld that had dominated international relations for\ndecades. At that time there were hopes that an\nunprecedented degree of unity might be reached within\nthe United Nations community. For the moment,\nhowever, it appears that any substantial changes within\nthe United Nations will have to await a renewed\nclimate of consensus, which is not likely to precede the\nresolution of the crisis in the Middle East, the settling\nof trade disputes and the establishment of greater unity\nabout agricultural subsidies, arms proliferation and\nenvironmental issues.\nLatvia firmly believes in the universal ideals that\nthis Organization embodies and is ready, within the\nlimited means at its disposal, to contribute to their\nrealization. The United Nations presents our 191\nMember States with the unique opportunity to work\ntogether for the benefit of humanity. Let us hope that\nour efforts will be coordinated and constructive, so that\nwe may make the twenty-first century one of security,\npeace, and continued development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAs in\nthe past, and despite present ordeals, Chad, my country,\nis very glad to take active part in this meeting of\npeoples united by the same fate and motivated by the\nsame spirit of peace, justice and equality.\nI am convinced that the wise choice of someone\nwith the experience and requisite skills of Mr. Julian\nHunte to preside over this historic meeting will\nguarantee the success of the session. My country has\nassumed similar responsibilities within the previous\nBureau and knows just how consuming yet exalting\nthey can be. My delegation would also like to express\nits encouragement and congratulations to Mr. Hunte\nand other members of the Bureau. My delegation and I,\npersonally, would like to assure him of our complete\navailability and full support for the success of his\nmission. We would like to reiterate our deep gratitude\nto him and especially to his predecessor, His\nExcellency Mr. Jan Kavan, for the skill and enthusiasm\nwith which he led the Assembly during the fifty-\nseventh session.\nAllow me also to express to His Excellency\nMr. Kofi Annan our sympathy and admiration for the\ncourage and the firm resolve that he places at the\nservice of the ideals and causes of the United Nations,\nwhich is now confronting many exceptional challenges.\nFinally, the Government of Chad would like to\nassociate itself with other members of the international\ncommunity to condemn in the strongest terms the\nterrorist attacks against the United Nations offices in\nIraq, which claimed the lives of several staff members\nof the United Nations, including the Special\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Sergio\nVieira de Mello. These heinous acts of violence should\nin no way break our resolve to pursue the noble goals\nof our Organization, foremost among which is to help\npeoples in difficulty to fully regain their rights to lead\n3\n\ntheir lives in conformity with the values of freedom,\ndemocracy and justice.\nI would therefore like to extend the condolences\nof the Chadian Government to all United Nations\npersonnel, and the Brazilian, Egyptian and other\nGovernments for the deaths of those who sacrificed\nthemselves for the freedom of others.\nIf the international community has been\nthoroughly overhauled since the fall of the Berlin Wall\nand the end of the cold war, it has been victim to a new\nkind of trauma since 11 September 2001. Since that\ntime, terrorism has been a dire threat to international\npeace and security. Globalization has complicated the\nrules of the game in trade between the North and the\nSouth, and new forms of conflict have emerged at the\nregional level.\nThe best response to all this must be based on\ncollective and joint action. As a full member of the\ninternational community, Chad, which is faithful to its\nquest for peace, strongly reaffirms its resolute\ncondemnation of any act of terrorism, act of violence\nor any use of force \u2014 in the defence of any cause \u2014 to\nresolve disputes among nations.. Such actions must be\ndealt with by our regional organizations first and\nforemost, and, if they fall short, to our common\nOrganization, the United Nations. Although it has been\nthe subject of some controversy, the United Nations\ncontinues to be the only Organization in the world to\ntruly enjoy international legitimacy.\nBut to continue to best ensure that its mission and\nfunctions are carried out and to maintain its legitimacy,\nour Organization must enjoy the full support of all\nMember States. We must all contribute to assisting it in\nregaining its principal mission. The United Nations\nmust once again become a common tool for us all and\nno longer be seen as showcase, much less a sounding\nboard, for the will and power of the few.\nIt will undoubtedly achieve this goal all the more\neasily if the long-postponed reforms are successful and\nreflected in the enlargement of the Security Council to\ninclude new or emerging Powers of Europe, Africa,\nAsia and the Americas \u2014 in sum, in recognition of the\ntrue state of the world today. This would do justice to\nthose nations and render a service to the Organization\nitself.\nIn that respect, the Iraqi crisis has only further\nconvinced us of the need to pursue those reforms. We\ncannot continually evade this crucial issue. Stability\nand international peace and security are at stake, for\nthe kind of globalization that our peoples seek cannot\nevolve in the interest of all if the international political\nsystem is predominantly unilateral in nature.\nPending this revolution, which all peoples who\ncherish justice ardently seek, we still note with\nsatisfaction that our Organization remains active in all\ncrisis areas, particularly in Africa, where we urge it to\nbe more proactive. Indeed, Africa is confronted with\nmany difficulties that have ensued from both wars and\nother crises, as well as from a lack of good governance.\nThe recent establishment of New Partnership for\nAfrica\u2019s Development (NEPAD) promises to save the\ncontinent from the economic quagmire in which it has\nbeen plunged. But the coherence of this extensive\nprogramme is connected with the support of the entire\ninternational community. The anticipated outcome will\ndepend on true solidarity on the part of all economies\nworldwide.\nMy country, which has been committed to the\npath of democratic pluralism since 1 December 1990,\nhas made significant progress. These efforts will be\nsustained until we have perfected the republican\ninstitutions provided for under the Constitution of 31\nDecember 1996. The Government of Chad believes it\nimportant that this democratic process be achieved so\nthat the rule of law and also peace and prosperity,\nwhich are the ultimate goals, might be attained.\nTo that end, in 1999 the President of our Republic\npromulgated, a unique type of law that sets out\nmodalities for the use of oil revenues. This has resulted\nin a system in which a substantial part of this direct\nincome \u201410 per cent \u2014 is set aside for future\ngenerations, and the remaining 80 to 90 per cent\nremainder goes to priority sectors \u2014 those vital areas I\nmentioned earlier \u2014 and the region of production\nreceives 5 per cent.\nSecondly, the law provides for an office for the\ncontrol and surveillance of oil income. It is made up of\nnine members, including only one representing the\nGovernment, with five representing civil society and\ntwo the Parliament. As an independent body, that office\nwill have broad powers and prerogatives, including\nauthorizing expenditures from oil revenue and\nverification of their proper use.\nIn this new international context, in which States\nare increasingly interdependent and in which the world\n4\n\nhas truly become a village, Chad, while addressing its\ninternal problems, is endeavouring to open itself to the\noutside world. It is following with great interest\ndevelopments in the international political situation\nand is working to make its modest contribution to the\nefforts of the international community in settling\nconflicts, especially in Africa.\nTherefore, we note with satisfaction, in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, the new awareness\nof the parties involved and the emerging understanding,\nby the Congolese people themselves, of the enlightened\nself-interest of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nWe fervently hope that the transition process will\ncontinue uninterrupted until the final return of stability\nto that fraternal country.\nIn the Central African Republic, realities in the\nfield have shown positive change, but it is up to our\nCentral African brothers to close their ranks to an even\ngreater extent in order to consolidate peace in their\ncountry. The national dialogue under way offers them\nan excellent opportunity for a deep and constructive\nprocess of reflection on ways of bringing about\nnational reconciliation.\nWith respect to our border with the Sudan, we\nwelcome most particularly the prospects for peace that\nhave been emerging in that long-suffering country.\nAccords were concluded on 3 September 2003 under\nthe auspices of President Idriss Deby at Abeche in\nChad, between the Government of the Sudan and the\nPeople\u2019s Liberation Army of the Sudan, and the\nprotocol on security questions signed on 25 September\nbetween the Government and the SPLA also is a\nwelcome development on the path to peace. Chad\nencourages the two parties to do their utmost to\nconclude a genuine peace agreement that would put an\nend to the sufferings of that fraternal country.\nWe note with satisfaction a trend towards peace\nand stability in West Africa. For us, the Ivorian crisis\nwas a serious cause for concern. The Marcoussis\nagreements gave rise to a real hope finally to see a\npeaceful solution emerge. Today all eyes are turned to\nAbidjan, where the Transitional Government has the\nheavy responsibility of conducting national\nreconciliation in the interest of all the children of that\ncountry. Chad encourages the Ivorian people to help\nthe Transitional Government to carry out its mission,\nso that peace might be consolidated in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\nWith regard to Liberia, we hope that, with\ncontinued international assistance, its situation will\nbecome stabilized. The participation of the countries of\nthe subregion in peacekeeping operations and the\npresence of the Economic Community of West African\nStates Mission in Liberia in Monrovia all give rise to\nhope and are a guarantee of political stability. The\nadoption of resolution 1497 (2003) was very timely. It\nrepresents a framework for settlement which should be\nused finally to break the infernal cycle of violence in\nthat country. We would therefore like to ask the parties\nto the conflict to overcome their differences and work\ntowards the return of a just and lasting peace.\nI cannot conclude my words on Africa without\njoining my voice to those of other delegations that\nspoke earlier from this rostrum and welcoming finally\nthe wise decision of the Security Council to lift the\nembargo that for years had penalized the fraternal\npeople of Libya.\nOutside of Africa, other hotbeds of tension\nremain, especially in the Near and Middle East, that\nrequire the involvement of the international community\nin the quest for adequate solutions. In the Middle East,\nthe Israeli-Arab conflict has long been one of the\nconcerns of the United Nations. Today conditions seem\nto have been met for a constructive dialogue between\nthe two neighbouring peoples, since the road map\ncontaining the peace plan was agreed to by the parties\nto the conflict. This peace plan will, it is hoped, allow\nPalestine to achieve, by the year 2005, national\nindependence and international sovereignty.\nRegarding the Middle East, the Republic of Chad\nwelcomes the interest shown by the international\ncommunity in the restoration of Iraq\u2019s sovereignty and\nindependence. We hope that the process of restoring\npower to the Iraqis will continue pursuant to Security\nCouncil resolution 1483 (2003) in a way that best\nserves the interests of the Iraqi people.\nIn East Asia, the question of the proliferation of\nnuclear weapons, territorial conflicts and terrorist\nattacks are jeopardizing stability, not just for States in\nthe region but for the entire world. Nevertheless, we\nare pleased to note that a dynamic for peace has\ndefinitely begun to prevail in that region. We welcome,\ntherefore, the holding of multilateral talks on the North\nKorean nuclear programme, and we encourage States\nin the region, whose role in this respect is crucial, to\n5\n\nbecome truly involved in order to facilitate the quest\nfor a final settlement of that crisis.\nWe welcome also with relief the significant\nimprovement that has taken place in the context of\nrelations between India and Pakistan. This favourable\nclimate will no doubt enable the two nuclear Powers to\nmaintain good-neighbourly relations and to undertake\nthe true problems of development.\nAbove and beyond these conflicts, which are all\nof great concern, there remain two major issues with\nwhich the international community has not dealt with\ncourageously, in spite of good intentions and of the\nresolutions adopted in various forums beginning with\nthe Millennium Summit. I am speaking of development\nassistance and of the fight against HIV/AIDS. Both are\nMillennium Development Goals with respect to which\ncommitments were entered into here, in June 2001, at\nthe special session on HIV/AIDS, and at Monterrey in\nMarch 2002.\nWhile it is encouraging to note that the heads of\nState or Government of the Group of Eight, at their\nmost recent Summit in May 2003, gave their support to\nthe achievement of those goals, they still have to\ntranslate such commitments into action, as was\nemphasized by the Secretary-General in his report on\nthe work of the Organization.\nThat means, inter alia, that developed States\nshould implement the outcome of the Monterrey\nConsensus and the results of the Johannesburg World\nSummit on Sustainable Development in August 2002.\nBut the conclusions of the most recent World Trade\nOrganization (WTO) Conference in Canc\u00fan have\nshown that we have not yet embarked on that path.\nWe must all translate into action the Summit\u2019s\nresolutions on HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and\nother infectious diseases. Indeed, in spite of the\nincrease in resources and the strengthening of the\npolitical commitment at the highest level \u2014 following\nthe example of the commitment made by the President\nof the Republic of Chad \u2014 the situation remains one of\ngreat concern and calls for unfailing determination and\nexceptional efforts in order to stem this pandemic. I\nwould almost say that we must invent a new kind of\ncontainment in order to stem the spread of this disease.\nIn any case, the disease is waging a brutal war\nagainst humankind, which must respond by utilizing\nthe means required to fight a global war. This is a\nprerequisite for the survival of many nations\nthroughout the world and therefore for the stability of\nour future world.\nI cannot conclude without drawing the attention\nof the international community to the crucial issue of\nthe representation of the Republic of China on Taiwan\nin our Organization. That country has diplomatic\nrelations and relations of cooperation with many\nMember States, including Chad. Paradoxically,\nhowever, with regard to the United Nations, it finds\nitself without any status. Its ostracism is unjustified\nand unjustifiable.\nIndeed, the Republic of China was one of the\nfounders of the United Nations and was represented\nhere from 1949 through 1971. The fact that this item\ncomes up each and every year in the debates of the\nGeneral Assembly proves that a substantive issue is at\nstake. Chad deems it inadmissible for 23 million\nTaiwanese to be discriminated against by the United\nNations and its specialized agencies. It is thus\nunfortunate to note that, in the current context, the\nWorld Health Organization, for example, cannot lend\nTaiwan assistance in the event of epidemics, which was\nrecently the case with severe acute respiratory\nsyndrome. Yet the Taiwanese also have the right to live\nin serenity, to lead a democratic life and to be in\nsolidarity with the world\u2019s other peoples. They need\npeace \u2014 the very foundation of democracy and a\ncondition for development. Peace presupposes the\nresolution of conflicts through mediation. That implies,\nin both hearts and minds, a culture of tolerance and\nrespect for differences.\nWe urge this session to put an end to Taiwan\u2019s\nexclusion by restoring its status as a full-fledged\nUnited Nations Member, and we take this opportunity\nto invite all States in the region to halt the military\nescalation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the United Arab Emirates, I have\nthe honour to extend to Mr. Hunte and to his friendly\ncountry, Saint Lucia, our sincerest congratulations on\nhis election to the presidency of the General assembly\nat its fifty-eighth session.\nI should also like to thank his predecessor, Mr.\nJan Kavan, for his valuable efforts and effective\nleadership of the previous session.\nOn this occasion, I would also like to express our\nappreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his\nwise leadership and perseverance in his efforts to\nenhance the role of the United Nations in maintaining\npeace, security and sustainable development.\nDespite our hopes and the great humanitarian\nexpectations that we entertained with the dawn of the\nnew millennium, there remain many regional and\ninternational issues that have not been resolved and are\na major concern to us all. They represent a serious\nthreat to international peace and security, as well as to\nthe stability, development and prosperity of peoples, all\nof which depend on respect for and implementation of\nthe norms of international laws, and conventions.\nThe regrettable events that our world is\nwitnessing today are but the natural aftermath of the\nprevious political era, which was characterized by\nconflicts, occupation, oppression, injustice, the violation\nof human rights and wars that led to a wide range of\narm races at the expense of human, economic and\nenvironmental development. If we are to confront and\ncontain these challenges and their repercussions, it is\n17\n\nimportant to reform the United Nations and all its main\nbodies \u2014 especially the Security Council, the General\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council \u2014 as\nwell as to enhance cooperation and coordination\nbetween these international organizations and regional\norganizations.\nMaintaining stability and security in the Arab\nGulf area is an essential priority, not only for the peoples\nof the region, but also for the entire world. Accordingly,\nwithin the framework of the Gulf Cooperation Council\nand of bilateral, regional and international relations, the\nUnited Arab Emirates has adopted a foreign policy\nbased on peaceful coexistence, confidence-building,\ngood-neighbourliness, mutual respect, non-interference in\nthe internal affairs of others, the settlement of disputes\nand the ending of occupation by peaceful means.\nOn the basis of its commitment to these doctrines\nand the principles of the Charter of the United Nations,\nthe United Arab Emirates believes that the way to end the\noccupation of its three islands \u2014 Greater Tumb, Lesser\nTumb and Abu Moussa \u2014 by the Islamic Republic of\nIran is by peaceful means that would spare the region\nfrom the atrocities of warfare from which its people\nhave suffered for the past three decades. Therefore, the\nUnited Arab Emirates reiterates its call on the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran to reconsider its position and to\nrespond to the peaceful initiative that we announced a\nfew years ago, which calls on both countries to engage\nin serious bilateral negotiations or to resort to the\nInternational Court of Justice, as has been done in other\nbilateral issues that have been settled in accordance\nwith the principles of the Charter of the United Nations\nand the provisions of international law.\nThe question of the three occupied islands, which\nbelong to the United Arab Emirates, has been on the\nagenda of the Security Council since their occupation\nby Iran in 1971. In this regard, we reaffirm the\ncomplete sovereignty of the United Arab Emirates over\nGreater Tumb, Lesser Tumb and Abu Moussa and on\ntheir regional air space and waters, the continental\nshelf and the economic zone of the three islands, which\nare considered an indivisible part of the regional\nsovereignty of the United Arab Emirates. The United\nArab Emirates calls on the Iranian Government to\naddress this sensitive and important issue in a positive\nspirit in order to end the occupation. We hope that the\ncurrent bilateral communications and meetings\nbetween the United Arab Emirates and the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran will lead to a solution that will cement\ntheir good-neighbourly relations, enhance cooperation\nand mutual interests between the two countries, and\nstrengthen the foundations of security, stability and\nprosperity in this important region.\nSince the last session of the General Assembly,\nthe world has witnessed many changes in the political\nand security fields that have had a strong impact on our\ninternational relations, especially those related to peace\nand security in the Arab Gulf region. This has had\nconsequences and repercussions that may undermine\nthe foundations of peace, stability and development in\nthe area and the world.\nThe United Arab Emirates, which is deeply\nconcerned about the continued suffering of the\nbrotherly Iraqi people and the deterioration of their\nhumanitarian, security, social, economic and\nenvironmental conditions, reaffirms that the restoration\nof security and stability in Iraq and the country\u2019s return\nto the international community will not be achieved\nwithout the collective efforts of the regional and\ninternational community to help the Iraqi people\nreform their constitutional and developmental\ninstitutions and to enable them to manage their internal\naffairs and external relations with their neighbours and\nother countries so that they can play their responsible\nand historic role in the region.\nWe therefore reiterate our expression of welcome\nand support for the efforts made by the provisional\nIraqi Governing Council and the interim Iraqi\nAdministration. We hope that the United Nations will\nplay an increasingly important role in resolving the\nsituation in Iraq; in its reconstruction; in maintaining\nits territorial integrity, unity and the right of its people\nto self-determination; in the election of its\nGovernment; in its political future; and in the\nexploitation of its natural resources.\nThe United Arab Emirates has been closely\nfollowing the dangerous developments in the occupied\nPalestinian territories. We condemn the policies of\ntargeted killings and closure being carried out by Israel, in\nviolation of all relevant international and humanitarian\nlaws. We therefore call upon the Quartet and on other\ninfluential countries to revitalize the peace process and\nto compel Israel to implement the road map, which\nstipulates an end to the Israeli occupation and the\nestablishment of a Palestinian State by 2005. The road\nmap also calls on Israel to refrain from building illegal\nsettlements and to ensure the return of the refugees.\n18\n\nWe demand that Israel cease placing obstacles in\nthe way of the implementation of the road map \u2014\nobstacles such as the killing and destruction\nperpetrated by Israeli occupying forces against\nPalestinians and their property in the West Bank and\nthe Gaza Strip. We also demand that Israel lift the\nunjust siege on President Yasser Arafat and the\nPalestinian people, dismantle the separation fence and\nrelease Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons.\nA fair, lasting and comprehensive settlement of\nthe Middle East conflict requires a commitment by\nIsrael to adhere to international resolutions, which are\nbased on the principle of land for peace; the Arab\npeace initiative, endorsed by the Beirut Summit,\nincluding the Syrian and Lebanese tracks; and Israeli\nwithdrawal from all Palestinian and Arab lands\noccupied since 1967, including Al-Quds Al-Sharif, the\nSyrian Golan and the Lebanese Shaba\u2019a Farms area.\nThe Middle East region, including the Arab Gulf,\nmust be freed of all weapons of mass destruction, and\nIsrael must join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons and subject its nuclear facilities to\nthe safeguards of the International Atomic Energy\nAgency, pursuant to relevant United Nations resolutions.\nThe United Arab Emirates condemns all forms\nand manifestations of terrorism. We call for the\nmustering of national, regional and international efforts\nto combat and eradicate such a dangerous phenomenon,\nbecause it is exploited by radicals and outlaws as\nmeans to achieve their destructive goals.\nIn this respect, we express our deepest sorrow\nfollowing the criminal attack perpetrated against the\nUnited Nations headquarters, as well as against the\nJordanian Embassy in Baghdad and against the Imam\nAli mosque in Najaf, which resulted in the killing of\nImam Mohammed Baqer Alhakeem and a number of\ninnocent victims. We stand shoulder to shoulder with\nthose countries that have been the targets of terrorist\ncriminal attacks, in particular our brothers in the\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia. We express our support for\nall the measures taken by Saudi Arabia to eradicate\nthese terrorist activities.\nIn the meantime, we call on the international\ncommunity to convene an international conference to\ntackle terrorism and eradicate its causes and tools. We\nalso reaffirm the importance of respect for human\nrights, transparency and openness based on mutual\nrespect of the cultural heritage and the beliefs of\npeoples, so as to avoid creating a fertile breeding ground\nfor frustration and hatred from which the terrorists derive\ntheir raison d\u2019\u00eatre and their motivation.\nDespite the numerous international conferences,\nparticularly the World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment and the International Conference on\nFinancing for Development, aimed at tackling the\nimbalance in international economic relations and its\neffect on international economic development, the\nmajority of the world\u2019s people continue to live in\nunstable and inhuman conditions, characterized by\nincreased poverty, the spread of disease and illiteracy,\nbecause of the increasing economic gap between\ndeveloped and developing countries. Developed\ncountries must commit to implementing the pledges\nthey made according to international resolutions.\nFrom this perspective, the United Arab Emirates\ncalls on the international community to fulfil its\ncommitment to providing development assistance to poor\ncountries, in particular the least developed countries.\nInternational financial and development institutions as\nwell as the private sector should plan strategies geared\ntowards providing financial and development resources in\norder to implement economic development programmes\nin developing and poor countries, all within an\nenvironmentally friendly framework, ensuring access by\nsuch countries to new technologies, in order to\nalleviate the external debt burden and remove tariffs on\ninternational trade, which would benefit all countries of\nthe world.\nOn this occasion, I cannot fail to point out the\nconfidence placed in the United Arab Emirates by the\ninternational community through its hosting of the\nannual meeting of the heads of the International\nMonetary Fund and of the World Bank in the Emirate\nof Dubai, a meeting that concluded its work on 24\nSeptember. We are very satisfied with the outcome of\nthat meeting, particularly the special attention it\nfocused on the question of development and\ncooperation for the purpose of alleviating the impact of\npoverty and debt burdens around the world.\nIn conclusion, the grave challenges facing the\ninternational community today bolster our conviction\nmore than ever of the importance of adhering to the\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and of\ninternational law, as our point of reference in resolving\nregional and international disputes and differences.\n19\n\nWe express the hope that the meetings and\ndebates held during this session of the General\nAssembly will succeed in strengthening the role of the\nUnited Nations as a multilateral Organization and in\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI have the honour to\naddress the fifty-eighth session of the General\nAssembly on behalf of the European Union, over which\nItaly presides until 31 December 2003. The associated\ncountries, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia,\nHungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, the Slovak\nRepublic and Slovenia, align themselves with this\nstatement.\nOn this occasion, I cannot forget the sacrifice of\nSergio Vieira de Mello and the other United Nations\nofficials who recently fell victim to blind,\nindiscriminate hatred in Baghdad. Allow me also to\npay a tribute to the memory of the Foreign Minister of\nSweden, Anna Lindh, the victim of a brutal act of\nviolence. In their memory and in the memory of all\nthose who gave their lives in the service of freedom,\ndemocracy and human rights, the European Union pays\na heartfelt tribute.\nTwo weeks ago, we commemorated the second\nanniversary of 11 September. The European Union\nremembers with great sorrow the victims of those\nattacks, when the horror of terrorism struck this city,\nthe United States and the world.\nThe European Union welcomes the Secretary-\nGeneral's recent report on the implementation of the\ndevelopment goals indicated in the United Nations\nMillennium Declaration and its conclusions. We share\nhis view that the multilateral institutions should be\n32\n\nupdated and strengthened, and we are ready to\ncontribute actively to the goal of building an\ninternational order based on effective multilateral\ninstitutions and within the fundamental framework of\nthe Charter.\nWe are all convinced that two of the greatest\nthreats to peace and security today are terrorism and\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\nThe European Union condemns all acts of\nterrorism, which are threats to democracy, human\nrights and economic and social development. We must\nbe firm in our determination to destroy this virus and\nfree present and future generations from its attacks.\nEfforts to combat terrorism must respect human rights\nand the fundamental freedoms, the rule of law and\nhumanitarian law.\nIn this struggle, we are working in close\ncollaboration with and give our full support to the\nUnited Nations. It is a battle that must be conducted for\nthe sake of freedom and democracy   the universal\nvalues enshrined in the Charter, which should be\ndeeply rooted in the lives of all the peoples of this\nglobalized world.\nWe must show the same commitment to stop the\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their\nvectors. We cannot shirk our responsibilities. The\nEuropean Union has doubled its efforts to put an end to\nthis threat to international peace and security. After\nhaving recently agreed to an action plan, we are now\nbusy with its implementation. Universal subscription to\nthe main multilateral agreements is at the heart of the\nEuropean Union's policies.\nWorld peace and security are indivisible. The\npeoples of Europe are well aware of the need to\naddress both the military and the humanitarian aspects\nof the North Korean situation. The European Union is\nclosely watching the six-party talks aimed at resolving\nthe current crisis relative to North Korea's nuclear\nprogramme. The European Union sends a firm appeal\nto North Korea to completely dismantle its nuclear\nprogramme in a prompt transparent, verifiable and\nirreversible manner, in compliance with the obligations\nderiving from international non-proliferation\nagreements.\nThe European Union reiterates its request to India\nand Pakistan to adhere to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to act in\ncompliance with Security Council resolution 1172\n(1998). We forcefully encourage India and Pakistan to\npursue a process of political dialogue that will lead to\nan agreement that is satisfactory to all the parties on all\nthe controversial points, including Kashmir: a problem\nthat cannot be resolved through violence or terrorism.\nThe European Union expresses its growing\nconcern over the development of the Iranian nuclear\nprogramme and the risks of proliferation that it\ninvolves. We reiterate our expectation that Iran will\ndemonstrate accelerated cooperation and full\ntransparency with the International Atomic Energy\nAgency (IAEA) by acceding to its requests. Urgent and\nunconditional acceptance, signature and the\nimplementation of an IAEA additional protocol on\nsafeguards are of the utmost importance. The\ninternational community would consider it a sign of\nIran's commitment to the non-proliferation framework\nand a step toward the desired reforms.\nThe non-proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction is a priority. It requires constant political\npressure and the use of every political and diplomatic\ninstrument available as the first line of defence. We\ncannot allow weapons of mass destruction to end up in\nthe hands of terrorists or regimes that represent a threat\nto world peace.\nIn that context, another grave danger is\nrepresented by the increasing spread of light and\nportable weapons and by the expansion of armed\norganized violence, whose toll in human lives has\nbegun to exceed the lives lost in wars.\nWith regard to non-proliferation, the European\nUnion is firmly committed to supporting the United\nNations, particularly the Security Council, in pursuit of\nthe following common objectives: strengthening\ninternational agreements; increasing support for the\nmonitoring agencies; and intensifying controls over\nillegal trafficking. Finally, should all political and\ndiplomatic measures fail, recourse to coercive\nmeasures provided for by the Charter cannot be ruled\nout.\nHowever, recourse to force can be avoided if all\nthe instruments of international law, including human\nrights safeguards, come to prevail in all their effects.\nWe are all persuaded that that is the proper thing to do.\nTo that end, the European Union considers the\nInternational Criminal Court a new instrument with\n33\n\ngreat powers of deterrence and reiterates its full\nsupport for the Court and its universalization.\nThe EU is and will always remain committed to\nthe promotion and protection of all human rights and\nall fundamental freedoms. In that context, we reiterate\nour strong support for achieving universal abolition of\nthe death penalty. In recent years, important progress\nhas been made in that direction, thanks in part to civil\nsociety. Abolition is our primary goal. Where capital\npunishment continues to exist, however, we are\nrequesting that its application be impeded through a\ngeneral moratorium on executions.\nConflict prevention and crisis management are\nessential components of the EU's contribution to\nsafeguarding international peace and security. More\nthan 40,000 men and women of the European Union\nare currently deployed on United Nations-led\nor -authorized peace operations in the world.\nThe Union is directly involved in missions in the\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Bosnia and\nHerzegovina and, until a few days ago, the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, where it demonstrated its will\nto contribute to the international community's efforts to\nrestore peace and stability in Africa, including by\nmilitary means.\nIn light of this concrete commitment, the\nEuropean Union reaffirms its support for reforming and\nstrengthening United Nations peacekeeping activities.\nThe decision by the Council of the European\nUnion to strengthen cooperation between the European\nUnion and the United Nations in the area of crisis\nmanagement reaffirms the Union's strategic relations\nwith the Organization. The Union is now drafting\nguidelines on the protection of civilians in Union-led\npeacekeeping operations that will fully reflect United\nNations principles.\nDemocracy is the only system of government that\ncan fully guarantee respect for human rights while\nfostering development, prosperity and peace. The\nEuropean Union plans to increase cooperation with\ncountries that share the values of freedom and\ndemocracy. In a spirit of openness towards the entire\ninternational community, the European Union states its\nwillingness to give support to all States that intend to\ncomply with those principles.\nThe European Union continues to consider its\nrelations with Africa a priority and recalls the common\ncommitment to strengthen this dialogue. The European\nUnion has expressed a special interest in strengthening\nAfrican peacekeeping and conflict-resolution\ncapacities, and has also targeted its initiatives in those\nfields on Africa. We are committed to supporting the\nefforts of the African Union to establish a regional\nsecurity mechanism.\nThe European Union will continue to work for\ninter-African peace and will support the efforts of\nAfrican States to end the many conflicts that afflict the\ncontinent. Stable conditions for peace cannot be\ncreated, however, without a strategy to eradicate the\ncauses of poverty and the social exclusion that fuel so\nmany conflicts in Africa and other regions of the\nworld.\nOn the long road towards managing globalization\nand spreading its benefits to all, Europe will remain\nfirmly committed to Africa, and the European Union's\nprivileged partnership with African countries shall\ncontinue. In this framework, we reiterate our support\nfor the New Partnership for Africa's Development and\nfor the hopes that it represents for African\ndevelopment.\nThe European Union's special commitment to\nAfrica should also be seen in the framework of the\nMillennium Development Goals, primarily designed to\neradicate poverty, hunger, disease, social and gender\ninequality and environmental degradation. In this\nregard, we reaffirm our commitment to fight AIDS,\ntuberculosis and malaria with a view to eradicating\nthem.\nThe European Union expresses its deep regret\nover the failure to achieve substantial progress at the\nCancun Conference organized by the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO), especially with regard to\nagricultural products. We remain convinced that\nincreased liberalization of world trade, together with\ndevelopment cooperation activities, can play a crucial\nrole in achieving the Millennium Development Goals\nfor a better world. This is why the European Union\nbelieves that it is important to continue the negotiations\nin the WTO framework with the determination and\nflexibility needed to honour the commitments\nenshrined in the Doha Development Agenda.\nThe European Union has made a financial\ncommitment, in line with the Monterrey objectives, to\nincrease official development assistance to 0.39 per\ncent of gross national product by 2006.\n34\n\nOur commitment does not stop at financial\ncontributions. We also intend to join our development\npartners in a process that integrates the fight against\npoverty and disease with progress in the field of\nsafeguarding human rights and fundamental freedoms,\ngood governance and environmental protection. The\nprotection of our environment, including through\nimplementing the commitments undertaken by signing\nthe Kyoto Protocol, is the benchmark of our ability to\nfoster sustainable development that reconciles the\ndemands of economic and social progress with the need\nto protect natural resources. Those two goals are not\nalternatives but rather the pillars of the Johannesburg\nDeclaration.\nThe European Union appreciates the progress\nmade since the fifty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly following the presentation of the Secretary-\nGeneral's report on reform, Strengthening of the\nUnited Nations: an agenda for further change'\n(A/57/387 and Corr.1). It continues to support the\nSecretary-General's efforts to implement the reforms\nneeded to bring about efficient management capable of\nachieving the objectives established for the United\nNations by the international community. We will work\nfor the adoption of a budget plan for the 2004-2005\nbiennium that supports the implementation of the\nMillennium Declaration and the reform process begun\nduring the Assembly's fifty-seventh session.\nSafeguarding international peace and security\nrequires a strong commitment to address regional\nconflicts. A lack of such a commitment could entail\nincreased destabilization, to the detriment of the entire\ninternational community.\nIn the Middle East, the European Union is deeply\nconcerned by the deterioration of relations between the\nState of Israel and the Palestinian Authority and\nreiterates its strong support for the road map, the only\nhope for lasting peace and for paving the way towards\nstability and development in the region. The European\nUnion will lend its efforts to this end within the\nQuartet. To implement the road map, it is also\nimportant that the European Union and the Group of\nEight countries have a specific and generous\ncommitment to a plan for the comprehensive economic\nreconstruction of the area. Both Israel and the\nPalestinian Authority must act urgently to implement\nthe commitments contained in the road map.\nIn Iraq, the European Union has welcomed the\nend of Saddam Hussain's regime, whose power was\nbuilt on fear and the violation of human rights. The\nformation of the Iraqi Governing Council was the first\nmajor step towards a representative government of the\nIraqi people. The European Union stresses the\nimportance of the restoration of Iraqi sovereignty and\nthe establishment of a fully representative Iraqi\nGovernment through democratic elections. The United\nNations has a vital role in this process. The upcoming\ndonors conference in Madrid provides a welcome\nopportunity for all those who share our concern for\nIraq's future to make a positive contribution to the\npolitical and economic regeneration of Iraq. We\nrecognize that, for the reconstruction process to be\nsuccessful, it will need to be accompanied by\nimprovements in the security situation.\nIn Afghanistan, the European Union wishes to\nexpress its full appreciation for the work done by the\nUnited Nations within the framework of the Bonn\nprocess.\nWe will continue to assure our support for the\nprocess of democratization also through assistance to\nthe reconstruction of the country. The European Union\nunderlines the importance of an effective reform in the\narea of security as the basis for lasting security and\nstability in Afghanistan and throughout the region. The\npreparations for the 2004 elections to choose a\ngovernment and parliament that are representative of\nall components of Afghan society are of primary\nimportance.\nIn accordance with the conclusions of the\nEuropean Council of Thessaloniki, the European Union\nwill continue to work tirelessly in support of the\nSecretary-General's efforts to achieve a\ncomprehensive, just, viable and functional solution to\nthe Cyprus problem, consistent with the relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions.\nRelations between the countries of Europe and\nLatin America are rooted in history and provide the\nbasis for intense collaboration and for the European\nUnion's strong interest in the region. The European\nUnion is committed to further improving the overall\narrangements of its relations with the countries of\nCentral and South America.\nLastly, the European Union will continue to\nsupport the processes of stabilization, democratization\nand development in the western Balkans. At the\n35\n\nEuropean Union-Balkan Summit in Thessaloniki, the\nEuropean Union reaffirmed its full consensus on the\nfuture European perspective of the region. The\nrealization of those hopes will depend on the ability of\nthe individual countries in the region to implement\ninstitutional, governmental and economic reforms, and\non the fulfilment of the political criteria of the\nEuropean Union, including full cooperation with the\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former\nYugoslavia and progress in the field of respect for the\nrights of minorities.\nThe events of recent decades have profoundly\nchanged the world order. Today the conditions exist for\nthe democracies of the world to unite in order to spread\nthose values that are the unavoidable premise for all\nothers: freedom and democracy.\nIn the Millennium Declaration we promised food,\nwater, health and education to the greatest possible\nnumber of citizens. Now the democracies must commit\nthemselves to providing, also and above all, the\nintangible values from which the other, more tangible\nones spring, because without the prerequisites of\nfreedom and democracy there can be no hope for\nlasting peace and development, nor can there be an\nultimate defeat of the challenge of poverty."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like\nto start by congratulating Mr. Julian Hunte on his\n33\n\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at\nits fifty-eight session. We wish him great success in the\nfulfilment of this difficult and lofty task.\nThe current session is taking place at one of the\nmost troubled times in our era. The recent events in the\nGulf region were a severe test of the capacity and\nreadiness of the United Nations to provide appropriate\nresponses to the challenges presently faced by the\ninternational community. The impact of these events\nsomehow diminished the cohesion of our world\nOrganization and weakened trust among its Members.\nThere was a failure in the international security system,\nwhich puts us in the position of needing immediately to\nmake it more effective.\nIn fact, the present international security system,\ncreated after the last great war \u2014 despite having to\ndate prevented the outbreak of a new world conflict \u2014\nhas shown signs of an incompatibility in the global\ncollective security interests of the Members of the\nUnited Nations in relation to the new challenges of this\nmillennium.\nWe are in urgent need of an integrated system\ncapable of dealing effectively with the major threats to\ninternational stability at the outset of this twenty-first\ncentury, specifically terrorism and international\norganized crime; weapons of mass destruction; internal\nconflicts, which, unfortunately, continue to plague the\nAfrican continent in particular; generalized poverty;\nand HIV/AIDS.\nTerrorism is today the most direct threat to the\nsecurity of our countries, as can be seen from the attacks\nthat in the past two years have killed thousands of\ncivilians in the United States, Russia, Africa and Asia.\nWith regard to armed conflicts, the situation\ncontinues to require urgent attention. During the last\ndecade, approximately one third of African States were\neither directly or indirectly affected by internal conflicts,\nwhich resulted in costs as high as $15 billion a year, and\ncaused hundreds of thousands of deaths, massive\ndisplacements of people, famine and malnutrition, and\nthe spread of diseases such as HIV/AIDS.\nThe prevalence of conflicts in Africa is not only\nthe result of the divisions inherited from the post-\ncolonial period and the cold war and of ethnic and\nreligious differences. It is also a consequence of factors\nsuch as the fragility of national institutions, the\nmarginalization of the African continent from the\nworld economy, the illegal exploitation of natural\nresources and the resulting arms proliferation, and the\nweak monitoring of national borders. This situation\nmust be swiftly reversed, since it can endanger the\nfuture of millions of Africans and increase the risk of\ncertain areas of the continent\u2019s becoming true\nsanctuaries for terrorist organizations.\nImproving United Nations political institutions\nand security systems constitutes the most effective\nmethod of addressing the threats facing humankind. It\nis therefore necessary to establish new mechanisms\noutside of the traditional strategic doctrines. The\ninternational legal documents created by the United\nNations, and the current alliances between States, have\nproved insufficient to respond adequately and in a\nconsensual manner to such threats, particularly when they\nare posed by entities that are not themselves States.\nBecause of its universal nature, the United\nNations plays a central role in the management of\ncurrent and future challenges. But that is not enough. It\nis crucial that that role be performed within a more\ndemocratic and participative framework, particularly\nwith regard to major decisions on international peace\nand security.\nIraq and other parts of the Middle East are the\nmain hotbeds of tension in the world today, and the\ncombined efforts of the United Nations are being\nfocused on that region. The continued loss of life in\nIraq \u2014 with most of those killed being innocent\ncivilians, including United Nations officials, among\nthem the late Special Representative of the Secretary-\nGeneral, Sergio Vieira de Mello \u2014 is a reminder of the\nneed for increased support by the international\ncommunity to ensure the security of the Iraqi people,\nthe building of new institutions and the beginning of\nthe reconstruction of the country.\nThe will of the international community, and\ncertainly that of the Iraqi people, is for Iraq to become,\nas soon as possible, a viable, democratic State with\ninstitutions validated by its people, and a country living\nin peace with its neighbours.\nThe achievement of this goal implies the\nestablishment of a political and institutional framework\nin which the United Nations plays an active role,\nspecifically in the pacification and unification of the\ncountry; in the internal political dialogue; in the\nprocess of national reconciliation; and in the\nestablishment of new democratic institutions.\n34\n\nAngola hopes that the present convergence of\npositions among the members of the Security Council\non the role of the United Nations in Iraq will facilitate\nan understanding relative to the transitional process in\ngeneral and to the transfer of sovereignty to the Iraqi\npeople.\nAngola deplores the loss of civilian life and the\nmaterial damage caused by the escalation of the\nconflict in the Middle East. The rekindling of violence\nbetween Palestinians and Israelis represents the\ngreatest danger to the implementation of the road map\nfor peace, whose ultimate objective is the signing of an\nagreement for the creation of an independent, viable\nPalestinian State, living side by side and in peace with\nIsrael and its other neighbours. In our view, that is the\nonly solution capable of putting a definite end to the\ncycle of violence.\nThe end, last year, of the armed conflict in\nAngola, and the success of the peace process, are\namong the most extraordinary political achievements\nseen in sub-Saharan Africa in recent years. With the\nattainment of peace in Angola, the Southern African\nregion became, for the first time in several decades, a\nzone free from conflict, and it can now focus its human\nand material resources on reconstruction and\ndevelopment efforts.\nAngola today is a country in its post-conflict\nstage. It is committed to the tasks of overcoming the\nheavy burden of a 40-year conflict, focusing on the\nstrengthening of its democratic process \u2014 which even\nduring the difficult war period was never abandoned by\nthe Government \u2014 and fully resuming its legitimate\nrole within the regional and international context.\nAs a result of the impact of the conflict on the\nhuman, economic, social and financial structures of the\ncountry, and given the inequities inherited from our\ncolonial past, the current post-conflict stage \u2014 which\nwill lead to the building of a new society in Angola \u2014\nis a difficult and painful one, and this has been an\nobvious impediment to an immediate response to the\nlegitimate aspirations of Angolan citizens.\nThe challenges that confront Angola are enormous\n\u2014 perhaps immeasurable. The main challenges include\nthe resettlement of more than 4 million displaced\npersons and 450,000 refugees; the social reintegration\nof more than 80,000 former military personnel and\ntheir respective families; the resolution of the problem\nof absolute poverty, which now afflicts more than half\nof the Angolan population; and the reconstruction of\nthe social and economic infrastructure.\nAt the same time, in spite of the scarcity of\navailable resources, we are creating the necessary\nconditions to hold elections in the near future. Despite\nour numerous problems and challenges, there is hardly\nany assistance from the international community for\nAngola, as compared with other countries in similar\ncircumstances, some of which received an immediate\nresponse to their appeals, even though they lacked de\njure institutions. We would like to believe that such\ntreatment is not the result of any form of discrimination\nagainst our country.\nThere is no example in modern history of a State,\nrich or poor, that, in the aftermath of a devastating and\ndestructive war such as that which afflicted Angola,\nhas managed to overcome the burden left by such a war\nand rise again without outside assistance. In Angola,\nthis reconstruction effort has, up to now, been borne\nsolely by the Angolans themselves, in spite of the\nreiterated promises that the only factor that hindered\nthe supply of aid to our reconstruction was the\npacification of our country.\nWe hereby renew, therefore, our appeal to the\ninternational community to help Angola in its domestic\nreconstruction effort. To this end, my delegation will\nsubmit a draft resolution on international assistance\nand the reconstruction and economic development of\nAngola, which proposes that an international donor\nconference be convened. We are counting on the\nsupport of the Assembly.\nAngola also welcomes the progress made in the\narea of peace and security in other regions of the\ncontinent, especially the Democratic Republic of\nCongo. The role of Angola, as well as that of its\npartners, was crucial in preventing a situation of chaos\nand disintegration in the territory of that brotherly\ncountry, with which we share a long border, and in\nconvincing the parties to give up war and choose\ninstead a negotiated political solution.\nThe Congolese patriots have shown signs of great\nmaturity in guaranteeing the success of the peace process\nand the transformation of the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo into a viable country that does not constitute a\nthreat to the stability of its border regions.\nAngola will continue to be open to strengthening\nthe traditional relations of friendship and cooperation it\n35\n\nhas maintained with the authorities of the interim\nGovernment of the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\nas well as with future authorities that are legitimately\nelected by popular vote.\nThere is still a stalemate with regard to the\nsituation in the Western Sahara. Difficulties regarding\nthe holding of a referendum on the self-determination\nof the territory are a hindrance to the search for a\ndefinitive solution to this question. Angola urges the\nparties involved to show flexibility and seek a political\nsolution that enables the people of that territory to\ndecide freely about their own destiny.\nToday, as one part of the world, particularly the\nindustrialized countries, enjoys considerable wealth, 40\nper cent of the 600 million Africans continue to survive\non less than one dollar a day. In fact, Africa continues\nto show the lowest social and economic development\nindicators, and those levels are becoming even worse, due\nto the marginalization of the African countries in the\nprogress of globalization and within the world economy,\nwhere trade and capital share are only 1 per cent.\nAfrica is also the continent that benefits the least\nin terms of foreign direct investment, receiving only 7\nper cent of the investment targeted at the developing\ncountries. External debt has been a huge obstacle to the\ndevelopment process because repayment of the debt\nservice alone has depleted the already-limited national\nresources of the African States. Angola supports the\ncancellation of the external debt service of the least\ndeveloped countries, particularly those in the African\ncontinent.\nThe macroeconomic measures imposed by the\nBretton Woods institutions within the framework of the\nstructural adjustment programme have not always been\nable to help the African continent overcome its\ninternational economic problems. In many cases, that\nhas led to controversial results. Based on such results,\nexperience has shown that, in fact, the financial\ninstitutions very often do not take into account the\nidiosyncrasies of each country and frequently put the\nGovernments in the position of choosing between\nmeeting the conditions imposed by the financial\ninstitutions or meeting the real needs of their people.\nAngola hopes that, with the establishment of the\nAfrican Union and the launching of the New\nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development, the tragic\nsituation in which the African continent finds itself\ntoday can be alleviated by setting priorities and giving\nspecial attention to immediate economic development\nissues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me at the outset to\noffer Mr. Julian Hunte my warm congratulations on his\nelection as President. We are confident that he will\nguide our deliberations during this fifty-eighth session\nto a productive conclusion. Let me also express my\ndeep appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan,\nfor his effective guidance of the work of the Assembly\nat its fifty-seventh session.\nFour years ago Kiribati joined the United Nations\nas one of its youngest Member States. Our membership\nof the United Nations was an affirmation of our faith in\nand support for the noble principles enshrined in the\nUnited Nations Charter.\nSince then, events have occurred to test the\nresolve of this Organization. Indeed, the United\nNations has faced many challenges. The recent brutal\nand calculated attack on United Nations personnel in\nBaghdad, which resulted in a tragic loss of life and\nmany injuries, are to be condemned. We mourn the loss\nof the Secretary-General\u2019s senior representative, Sergio\nVieira de Mello, and the others who perished in the\nattacks.\nKiribati commends the Secretary-General for his\nunwavering determination to ensure that the United\nNations continues to perform the role we expect of it in\nthe international arena.\nWe have followed with increasing alarm the\nglobalization of terror. No longer can we in the Pacific\nclaim immunity from terrorism. The consequences of\nterrorist acts are abhorrent. Kiribati condemns\nterrorism and all acts of terror directed against innocent\npeople. We cannot condone acts of terror, regardless of\ntheir purported objective.\nEven though we have not been, and may never be,\ndirectly subjected to horrors such as that of 11\nSeptember 2001 and the terrorist acts in Riyadh,\nJakarta and Baghdad, we realize that terrorism knows\nno boundaries or limitations. It is a crime against\nhumanity and against the international community as a\nwhole, and we must therefore work collectively to\ndefeat it. To do so will require an international\nresponse backed by concerted regional and national\nefforts.\nAt the international level, Kiribati fully supports\nthe relevant Security Council resolutions against\nterrorism. The Pacific Islands Forum is actively\naddressing security issues at the regional level. Despite\nfinancial constraints, Kiribati is pleased to have\ncontributed, within the framework of the 2000\nBiketawa Declaration, police personnel to the Regional\nAssistance Mission to Solomon Islands. My\nGovernment decided to contribute to that initiative\nbecause of our firm belief in the strength of regional\ncooperation. The Regional Assistance Mission to the\nSolomon Islands is a clear demonstration of the ability\nof Pacific Island Forum member countries to respond\nswiftly and cooperatively to requests from fellow\nmember countries for support in restoring law and\norder.\nWhile Kiribati appreciates the recognition of this\nregional initiative by the United Nations, we hope and\nurge that further assistance will be forthcoming to\nstrengthen and ensure the success of this undertaking.\nAt the national level, Kiribati has introduced\nvarious bills and taken other measures as part of its\neffort to address security challenges. This is an\nongoing process that will progress at a pace dictated by\nour financial situation, personnel and other constraints.\nWe are confident that, given our commitment, and with\nappropriate assistance from the international\ncommunity, we will in time achieve our goals.\nKiribati supports the idea that terrorism must be\neliminated. We must all fight against those who reject\ndialogue as a means of securing their objectives and\ninstead resort to terror. We would like to associate\nourselves with the many speakers who advocate that\n18\n\nwe exercise restraint. We must ensure that in our fight\nagainst terrorism we continue to uphold the principles\nthat are the cornerstones of this esteemed body \u2014 the\nprinciples that we cherish and in which we firmly\nbelieve.\nKiribati fully supports efforts to address the\nsecurity challenges facing the world today. We are,\nhowever, mindful that the magnitude of the security\nchallenges facing Member States differs.\nIn the case of Kiribati there are many challenges\nand problems that threaten our people and country.\nKiribati is one of the least developed countries and is\nalso a small island developing State located in the\nmiddle of the Pacific ocean. Our remoteness and\ninsularity, narrow economic base, small population and\nhigh population growth rate are factors that we have to\naccept.\nBeing a small island developing States poses\nmany challenges to national efforts in terms of\nsustainable development and beneficial integration into\nthe world economy. These unique characteristics\nwarrant special consideration for sustained and\nenhanced cooperation from development partners.\nKiribati has benefited, and continues to benefit,\nfrom the various programmes offered through the many\nUnited Nations agencies. In acknowledging with\ngratitude the support extended by the United Nations in\nthis regard, I would also like to record our appreciation\nto our development partners for their continuing\nsupport for our efforts at increasing and enhancing the\nequitable distribution of development benefits to our\npeoples.\nWe realize that a lot more needs to be done.\nKiribati has a vast exclusive economic zone rich in\nfisheries and marine resources. We are actively\npromoting the sustainable exploitation of these\nresources, and consider the establishment of an onshore\nfish processing facility to be an appropriate\ndevelopment.\nKiribati comprises low-lying coral atolls and is\ntherefore very vulnerable to climate change, climate\nvariability and sea-level rise. This is an issue of high\npriority for us, as it is for other low-lying countries. It\nis also an issue that requires an international response.\nPolitical commitment and a high level of cooperation\nby the international community are called for in\naddressing this challenge.\nThere is a need for immediate reductions in and\nlimits on greenhouse gas emissions to bring them into\nline with the objective of the United Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change. We call\nupon the major emitters of greenhouse gases to ratify\nthe Kyoto Protocol in a timely manner.\nWe recognize the need to develop and implement\nappropriate adaptation response measures, and call for\nsupport in this respect from international sources,\nincluding the Global Environment Facility.\nInternational support will similarly be required in\nthe joint implementation of the vulnerability and\nadaptation Pacific type 2 initiatives, launched last year\nat the World Summit on Sustainable Development.\nWe look forward to the 2004 international\nmeeting to be held in Mauritius. This will provide a\nvaluable opportunity to the international community to\ntake stock of what has happened since Rio and\nBarbados. We certainly hope that Mauritius will\nprovide a road map of concrete and practical actions,\nwhich are required to achieve the objectives of the\nProgramme of Action. While we accept primary\nresponsibility for our own development, we also realize\nthat the achievement of such aspirations will be beyond\nour reach if we have to work alone. We require the\nassistance of our partners in development.\nThese have been turbulent times for the United\nNations. Recent events have brought to the fore the\nneed for the United Nations to adapt. The rapidly\nchanging global environment in which the United\nNations operates demands adaptations if the\nOrganization is to continue to be of relevance to\nMember States.\nKiribati joins previous speakers in welcoming the\nreform initiatives outlined by the Secretary-General.\nWe realize that Member States must direct and actively\nsupport the adaptation process. The direction and\nsupport thus accorded to the United Nations will enable\nit to become more responsive to the aspirations of its\nMember States and those of the communities and\npeoples they represent.\nKiribati fully supports the view that the United\nNations and its major organs should be more\nrepresentative and more democratic in order to reflect\nthe expanded membership of the Organization. The\nrules so appropriate to situations in the 1940s cannot be\n19\n\napplied practically and effectively in the twenty-first\ncentury.\nTo conclude, we are faced with new challenges.\nWe must commit ourselves to tackling these emerging\nchallenges meaningfully. We must therefore be ready to\nintroduce and accept changes appropriate to our times.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the\nGovernment and people of Nigeria, I would like to\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election as the President\nof the fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly. I\n18\n\nassure you of the cooperation and support of my\ndelegation in ensuring a successful outcome to this\nsession. Permit me also to acknowledge the excellent\nwork done by your predecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan. I also\nwish to commend the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, for his tireless efforts, vision and leadership,\nand for his inspiring address to the General Assembly\nthis morning.\nIn recent months, many voices inside and outside\nof Governments have questioned the utility, relevance\nand efficacy of the United Nations, the only universal\nmultilateral tool at our disposal. Even more tragically,\nsinister forces have taken aim at the United Nations\nand its dedicated staff, as demonstrated by the\nsenseless attack on the United Nations compound in\nBaghdad. My Government once again joins the\ninternational community in condemning that heartless\naction, which claimed the lives of so many talented and\ndedicated staff members. We share the sorrow of the\nSecretary-General and his staff, and extend our\nheartfelt condolences to the bereaved families. In that\nconnection, I wish to reaffirm my country\u2019s total\ncommitment to, and support for, our Organization.\nMy Government is deeply concerned about the\npersistence of conflicts in many regions of the world,\nand in particular in our subregion of West Africa. The\nconflict in Liberia has again tested the will of the\ninternational community to respond proactively to\nconflicts and to the humanitarian catastrophes they\nleave in their wake. The decision of the Economic\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) to\ndeploy troops to Liberia in the face of obvious\nhesitation by the international community and despite\nthe strain it placed our resources was therefore\nindicative of our determination to show that we will\nnot stand by wringing our hands when such\ncatastrophic events occur in our neighbourhood. We are\ngreatly relieved that our forward deployment of troops\nand the initiative to remove the former Liberian\nPresident from the scene have had such an immediate\ncalming effect, which will hopefully be further\nreinforced by the deployment of a United Nations\npeacekeeping force.\nI therefore wish to assure the General Assembly\nthat Nigeria appreciates the decision taken by the\nSecurity Council in resolution 1509 (2003), of 19\nSeptember 2003, to authorize a multisectoral\npeacekeeping mission in Liberia in order to continue\nthe achievement of the ECOWAS initiative. I should\nlike to emphasize the fact that if regional organizations\nare to play the lead role that the United Nations is\nincreasingly demanding, the international community\nwill not be able to escape its own responsibility to do\nmuch more to strengthen the requisite capacities of\nsuch organizations.\nLet me now turn to another subject that is closely\nrelated to the conflicts in Africa. The proliferation of\nsmall arms and light weapons has been identified as\none of the major factors fuelling conflicts. An effective\nstrategy to deal with that proliferation entails\ncontrolling the illicit trade in that category of weapons\nemanating from the countries where they originate, as\nwell as controlling their transfer to intermediaries and\narms merchants. We therefore call for an early\nconclusion of negotiations on a legally binding\ninternational instrument to control the indiscriminate\nsupply of small arms and light weapons, especially to\nnon-State actors. In keeping with our commitment to\nthe eradication of those weapons, ECOWAS has\nalready established and renewed a moratorium on the\nimportation of small arms and light weapons. To make\nthat moratorium as effective as intended, we call for\neffective cooperation on the part of all producing\ncountries.\nIn April 2003, the people of Nigeria reaffirmed\ntheir commitment to good governance and democracy\nby holding successful elections. Following our 1999\nelections, which marked the transition from military to\ncivilian Government, last April\u2019s election represented\nboth our first civilian-to-civilian transition and a\nconsolidation of our democratic process. I consider my\nre-election to a second \u2014 and under our Constitution,\nmy last \u2014 term of office not only as a vote of\nconfidence but also as a great challenge to deliver the\ndividends of democracy to our citizens. To meet that\nchallenge, my Government has developed a programme\nof economic reforms, the National Economic\nEmpowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS).\nThe programme, which places people first, is aimed at\nlaying a solid foundation for sustainable socio-\neconomic transformation and poverty eradication. By\nits design, it will strengthen governance, enhance\ntransparency, intensify the fight against corruption and\ndevelop infrastructure \u2014 especially in the areas of\nelectricity, water and roads. It also places high priority\non food security, agricultural development and the\npromotion of small- and medium-scale enterprises.\n19\n\nI believe that that ambitious economic reform\nwill constitute an important national contribution to the\nattainment of the targets of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals and of the objectives of the New\nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD). In that\nconnection, my Government\u2019s new reform programme\nis a clarion call to national mobilization and re-\norientation. However, it also envisages active\ncooperation by our multilateral and bilateral partners.\nWe are all too well aware that the development of our\nagricultural sector, by which the majority of our people\nstill earn their living, cannot be successful as long as\nhuge subsidies to agriculture in the developed countries\ncontinue. My Government, therefore, wishes to use this\nforum to call again for the reform of the system of\nsubsidies to agricultural production, which is\nstrangulating agriculture in developing countries.\nIn this connection, it is regrettable that the\nreasonable proposals made by the group of developing\ncountries at the recently concluded World Trade\nOrganization (WTO) Ministerial Conference in Canc\u00fan\nwere rejected by their negotiating partners, leading to\nthe collapse of the Conference. Creating conditions of\nfair and undistorted trade would be the most effective\nway of providing additional resources to developing\ncountries. This is particularly urgent in light of the low\nlevels of official development assistance and the recent\nsharp decline in the flow of foreign direct investment.\nOther areas that we hope the international\ncommunity will address with determination include the\nproblem of external debt. This continues to be a major\nobstacle to the development of my country and many\nother African countries. It is evident that the various\ninitiatives by the international community on debt\nrelief and debt management have been able neither to\naddress nor solve the problems.\nWhile appreciating the efforts by the international\ncommunity in the context of the Heavily Indebted Poor\nCountries (HIPC) initiative, we must observe that these\nefforts have not provided adequate responses or\nsolutions to the problems. This is even more true in the\ncase of the heavily indebted middle-income countries,\nlike Nigeria, for whom no special debt relief\nmechanism exists, although such machinery was\nsuccessfully established for countries in Eastern and\nCentral Europe, for instance.\nNigeria believes, therefore, that bolder steps must\nbe taken to resolve the heavy debt burden, which for a\nlarge number of countries has become unsustainable\nand a hindrance to development. I am afraid that we\nhave no effective mechanism in place to tackle this\nproblem. Neither the Bretton Woods institutions nor the\nParis and London Clubs alone can provide lasting\nsolutions and relief. I therefore believe that this issue is\nof such significance for the peace and development of\nsuch a large portion of the world community that we\nneed to create a mechanism within the United Nations\nto address the problem in its full scope, based on the\nprinciple of the joint responsibility of debtors and\ncreditors alike.\nWe welcome the ongoing negotiations for a\nlegally binding instrument on the repatriation of\nillicitly acquired funds stashed away in foreign\ncountries. We call for the early conclusion of the\nConvention on that issue. This Convention is expected\nto make more resources available for development and\nshow concretely the global commitment to eradicating\nlarge-scale corruption, which is at the origin of the\nfunds. In this connection, I must say that the\nexperience of my country has been one of only\nlukewarm cooperation by most countries where our\nlooted funds have been traced. Our partners among the\ngreat banking nations should recognize that it is\ncontradictory to condemn corruption on the one hand,\nand, on the other, to hinder us in the recovery of the\nplundered funds. For our economic and social reform\nprogrammes, the funds to be recovered can make a\nhuge difference in meeting our national objectives. I\nearnestly appeal through this forum for maximum\ncooperation in repatriating the looted funds. I take this\nopportunity to thank those countries that have matched\ntheir words with actions in assisting us in repatriating\nlooted funds.\nLast year, this Assembly endorsed the New\nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD) as the\nframework for development of the continent. We\ncommend the Group of 8 for their Africa Action Plan\nto support the implementation of NEPAD and hope that\nthis will soon be translated into cooperation on specific\nprogrammes and projects. In addition, we hope that the\ndeveloped countries will also concretely demonstrate\ntheir support for NEPAD.\nFor our part in Nigeria, the Government\u2019s\neconomic reform programme is a commitment to\ncontinue to make our contribution to an African\nrenaissance, which will underpin NEPAD.\n20\n\nWe welcome the establishment by the United\nNations of the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa\nand urge that adequate resources be provided for its\nmandate to be discharged effectively.\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to ravage our\ncontinent, affecting most of all the productive segment\nof the population. To combat the epidemic, my\nGovernment has embarked on a major national\nprogramme of action, the highlight of which consists of\na nationwide public enlightenment campaign and mass\nmobilization to deepen awareness and understanding of\nthe disease, the prevention and control of its spread and\nmodalities for providing care and support for people\nliving with the virus. To contribute to the global\nprogramme on HIV/AIDS, Nigeria has redeemed its\npledge of $10,000,000 to the Global Fund.\nLet me urge all countries that have not yet made\npledges to the Global Fund to do so urgently. Those\nthat have made pledges should kindly redeem them\nearly. I wish to acknowledge with gratitude, the efforts\nso far deployed by the international community on the\npandemic, and to thank Secretary-General Kofi Annan\nfor convening yesterday the high-level plenary meeting\ndevoted to HIV/AIDS. However, a lot still needs to be\ndone in a more concerted way to address all aspects of\nthe problem, including the issue of more international\nfunding and access to affordable drugs. These actions\nmust be taken urgently if the Millennium Development\nGoal of halting and reversing the spread of this dreaded\ndisease by 2015 is to be achieved.\nThe issue of terrorism has been of great\npreoccupation to our Organization in the past few\nyears. Several instances of terrorist attacks continue to\nsurface in different parts of the world, involving the\nloss of innocent lives and vast destruction of\nproperties.\nNigeria reiterates its condemnation of terrorism in\nall its manifestations, and joins other Member States in\nthe global determination to combat this veritable threat\nto national and international security. We support the\nwork of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, and\nreaffirm our conviction that a comprehensive\nconvention on international terrorism will constitute an\nimportant instrument for the protection of the\nindividual and collective rights to life.\nThe situation in the Middle East, which we had\nhoped would improve with the adoption of the road\nmap for a peaceful settlement of the conflict, has again\ndeteriorated. We call on the parties to halt the new\ncycle of violence \u2014 a cycle from which neither side\nstands to gain. We believe that any violation of the\nterms of the peace plan by either side does a great\ndisservice to the Palestinians, as well as to the Israelis.\nWe therefore appeal to both sides to demonstrate their\nfull commitment to the implementation of the plan so\nas to create conditions for the peaceful coexistence of a\nPalestinian State, side by side with the State of Israel.\nIn conclusion, I would like to comment briefly on\nthe issue of the reform of our Organization so as to\nmake it more responsive to contemporary global needs\nand challenges. Nigeria has noted with dismay that\nobstacles continue to be placed in the way of the\nadoption of any of the constructive proposals for the\nreform of the Security Council. The changes that are\nbeing made in the Council\u2019s working methods to make\nit more open to non-members are appreciated; however,\nthese are no more than marginal. I wish again to\nreiterate Nigeria\u2019s long held conviction that what is\nrequired is a more fundamental reform that would\ndemocratize the Security Council and thus reposition it\nto enable it to respond to issues of international peace\nand security in a more comprehensive, objective and\neffective manner. The overwhelming membership of\nour Organization demands no less in the interest of its\ncontinued relevance.\nWe cannot preach and endeavour to practise\nparticipation and inclusiveness at the national level\nwhile denying it at the global level of the United\nNations, and expect that all will be well. Yet we have\nno substitute for this universal Organization. That point\nis now becoming evident in the context of the current\nsituation of Iraq. Whatever the circumstances in which\nthe Iraqi war occurred, the role played by the United\nNations will be decisive in resolving the present\nimpasse. Our Organization has now established itself in\nthe post-conflict pacification of States. We can use that\nvast United Nations experience to our advantage in\nmanaging the current post-conflict situation in Iraq. We\nnow have the possibility of an independent democratic\nIraq, and we must not waste this opportunity.\nOne obvious point of disagreement relates to the\nissue of decision-making, both prior to and after the\nIraqi war. This may be symptomatic of the\ndeficiencies \u2014 to which I alluded \u2014 that are not\nconducive to the well-being of our Organization. Let us\ntherefore undertake the necessary reforms in order to\nmake our Organization work for all of us so that we\n21\n\ncan deal effectively and adequately with the pressing\nissues of the twenty-first century.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to\nstart by congratulating you warmly, Mr. President, on\nyour election to the high post of President of this\nrespected global forum and to wish you success during\nyour tenure. Your election to the post of President of\nthe General Assembly is indeed an honour and a source\nof pride for all Saint Lucians, as well as for your\nbrothers and sisters in the Organization of East\nCaribbean States (OECS), the Caribbean Community\n(CARICOM) and Latin America.\nYour presidency is, as such, a CARICOM-Latin\nAmerican presidency, and your record of prudence and\ndiplomatic skills will certainly be instrumental in\nmeeting the lofty goals sought commonly by all of our\nnations and peoples.\nI take this opportunity to congratulate your\npredecessor, His Excellency Jan Kavan, for the\nleadership he provided to the fifty-seventh session of\nthe General Assembly, a session that brought out\nclearly the many challenges confronting the United\nNations in this decade.\nThe delegation of the Commonwealth of\nDominica assures you of its full cooperation and\nsupport. Profound appreciation is also due to our\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his tireless\nefforts to make the United Nations more responsive\nand effective.\n13\n \nOver the last nine months, the relevance of the\nUnited Nations has become a burning issue worldwide.\nWe must all appreciate that it remains the only\nuniversal multilateral institution with the capacity to\naddress the complex set of global problems of the\ntwenty-first century, ranging from peace and security to\ndevelopment.\nToday's world is entangled in a web of complex\nproblems that threaten global security. These problems,\nwhich require the urgent attention of the United\nNations, include HIV/AIDS and other diseases,\npoverty, the marginalization of indigenous people,\nterrorism and global crime, the growing scarcity of\nfreshwater, global warming, the spread of light arms,\nwhich threaten peaceful countries like Dominica,\nnuclear proliferation, armed civil conflicts and the\nrefugees they give rise to, trafficking in humans and\nunfair trade rules that contribute to growing poverty in\nthe developing countries.\nAll of these problems require a strong and\neffective multilateral organization, which enjoys the\ntrust and confidence of the people on this planet and is\ncapable of articulating collective approaches towards\nsome solutions.\nThe world has changed considerably, yet present\ninstitutions for global governance   the United Nations,\nthe World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the\nWorld Trade Organization   continue to operate on\noutdated political and economic foundations. The\nlegitimacy, effectiveness and credibility of the United\nNations continue to erode in the face of the\ndemocratic deficit', which was an integral part of the\noriginal design but which needs to be remedied now.\nThe reform of the Security Council and the\nGeneral Assembly is indispensable to the restoration of\nthe moral authority lost because of failure to enforce\nresolutions. Effective governance, predicated on the\nprinciples of accountability and transparency to the\npeople of the Member States, is a highly desirable\nobjective that we must strive for.\nI wish to reaffirm our country's total commitment\nto, and support for, the United Nations.\nLet me take this opportunity to pay tribute to\nSergio Vieira de Mello, Special Representative of the\nSecretary-General, other staff members of the United\nNations and the citizens of Iraq who lost their lives or\nsustained injuries in the tragedy of Baghdad last\nAugust. We share the sorrow of the Secretary-General\nand his staff, and extend our heartfelt condolences to\nthe bereaved families.\nThe return of peace and stability to Iraq has now\nbecome the responsibility of all States members of the\ninternational community. If the international community\nmust accept and shoulder this important responsibility,\nthen we must commit to a greater role for the United\nNations. We strongly hold the view that stability in Iraq\nis inextricably linked to the transfer of sovereignty to\nthe Iraqis, who must have sole responsibility for their\nfuture. The coalition forces must give a clear mandate\nto the United Nations for the creation of a\nmultinational force, led of course by the main troop\ncontributors, in order to ensure the security of Iraq.\nWhile the attention of the international\ncommunity is focused on restoring peace and security\nin Iraq, we cannot turn a blind eye to the breakdown in\nthe Middle East peace process. My delegation supports\nthe road map for peace in the Middle East and calls for\nthe removal of the obstacles that have stalled the\nprocess. We embrace the two-State solution as the only\nmechanism for a lasting peace in the Middle East. The\nState of Israel and the Palestinian Authority must both\ncommit to a ceasefire and return to the agreed\nobligations under the road map framework.\nThe fight against international terrorism remains\na priority for Dominica given the horror of 11\nSeptember. In that regard, we have taken many steps to\ncomply with the obligations of Security Council\nresolution 1373 (2001). This year our Parliament\nenacted the Suppression of Financing of Terrorism Act,\nwhich complements two earlier pieces of legislation\nrelated to the prevention of terrorism, the Money\nLaundering Act and the Exchange of Information Act.\nThe passage of these pieces of legislation has contributed\nto significant strengthening of the regulatory regime for\nbanks operating in our offshore financial sector and to\nefforts to combat money-laundering.\nWe welcome the assistance of the Commonwealth\nin a review of our legal system to allow its alignment\nwith the global strategy to fight terrorism, as well as\nthe guidance of the Counter-Terrorism Committee.\nThe numerous terrorist actions this year in\nIndonesia, Kenya, Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Iraq\nunderscore the central importance of being vigilant and\nprepared to manage any crisis from a terrorist attack.\nWe appeal to Member States to continue collaborative\n14\n \nefforts in this global fight to combat terrorism and to\nensure that the capacities of small States are enhanced\nthrough transfer of intelligence information, surveillance\ntechnology and training in prevention strategies.\nThe United Nations International Year of\nFreshwater has helped the world community to focus\nattention on the millions of poor people who lack\naccess to clean sources of water. Dominica is one of\nthe islands in the Caribbean blessed with abundant\nfreshwater resources, largely thanks to our high\nrainfall. Our experience with conserving our mountains\nand forests, which contribute to the maintenance of the\nwater table, is one of the many experiences that our\npeople are prepared to share with the world community.\nMankind faces a great challenge as growing\nscarcity of freshwater becomes a reality of this century.\nThis is clearly an arena for constructive global action\nby the United Nations. Let us hope that concern for and\nattention to freshwater remain a core part of our\ncontinuing commitment to the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals.\nMy delegation is indeed pleased at the\ntremendous progress made by the International\nCriminal Court over the last year. We have moved one\nstep closer to punishing war crimes, genocide, and\ncrimes against humanity.\nThis year is an important year for the\nCommonwealth of Dominica because we are\ncelebrating the silver jubilee of our political\nindependence, as well our twenty-fifth anniversary of\nour membership in the United Nations. Twenty-five\nyears of nation-building has given us some experience\nin the global arena and allowed us to build a foundation\nfor the next 25 years of national development.\nAs a peace-loving people, we highly value the\nright to self-determination and the full, fair and\nunhindered expression of the will of the people. We\nreaffirm our commitment to the rule of law, good\ngovernance at all levels and deepening of our\nlongstanding democratic tradition.\nDominica and its sister islands of Saint Lucia,\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada and\nJamaica are island nations adversely affected by the\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) banana regime,\nwhich will bring to an end preferences and quotas for\nbananas exported to the European Union. The\nimpending abolition of the banana quota at the end of\n2005 has contributed immensely to an economic crisis\nin these Caribbean Community States. Thousands of\nsmall farmers in these island nations have lost hope\nand left banana production altogether. This has led to a\n60 per cent decline in banana export earnings and has a\nnegative impact on our national savings.\nIn Dominica, this situation has necessitated the\nimplementation of an austerity program, in tandem\nwith a standby agreement with the International\nMonetary Fund. We are, however, working assiduously\nto create the conditions for economic revitalization and\ntransformation.\nAs we struggle to eradicate the mono-crop nature\nof our economy, a remaining vestige of the colonial\nperiod, we are determined to anchor our future\neconomic foundation in the following areas:\nsustainable agriculture, renewable energy, ecotourism,\ninformation technology, financial services and water\nresource management. Our resolve to build a new\neconomic order is based on our assertion of the\nprinciple of responsibility for our own development.\nOur efforts at economic re-engineering urgently\nrequire a complement of new foreign direct investment,\nofficial development assistance (ODA) transfers,\ntechnology transfer and deepening of cooperation with\nMember States and global civil society. We remain\nhopeful that our donor partners will soon translate the\nODA commitments that they made at Monterrey last\nyear into action, since these commitments have become\ncritical for economic reconstruction throughout the\ndeveloping world.\nOur call for special and differential treatment in\nthe trade arena continues to resonate loudly. The\noutcome of the WTO meeting in Cancun was not\nencouraging. We join other developing nations in the\ncall for an end or drastic reduction of agricultural\nsubsidies in the developed world.\nLet me take this opportunity to commend the\nUnited Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)\nfor organizing the high-level plenary meeting with\nrespect to the implementation of the Declaration of\nCommitment on HIV/AIDS, which took place on\nMonday, 22 September. This meeting will only be\nsuccessful if it renews the resolve of Member States to\naccord a higher priority to national integrated efforts to\nfight the disease, which is exacting a toll on the youth\nand adult populations of African and Caribbean\nnations.\n15\n \nThe Commonwealth of Dominica has developed a\nfive-year plan of action to guide our efforts to manage\nthe HIV/AIDS pandemic, and we are increasing our\nefforts to ensure a coordinated and participatory\nnational response that involves schoolchildren,\nworkers, the private sector and the voluntary sector.\nI also wish to acknowledge the great initiative of\nPresident George W. Bush for the global fight against\nHIV/AIDS. It is a bold and assertive commitment that\nwill contribute much-needed financial resources for the\nglobal campaign, particularly in Africa and the\nCaribbean. I also want to pay tribute to the tremendous\nefforts of UNAIDS, the United Nations Development\nFund for Women, the United Nations Children's Fund\nand the World Health Organization/Pan-American\nHealth Organization in HIV/AIDS prevention. The\nprogrammes of these United Nations organizations\ndeserve additional resources from Member States,\ninternational financial institutions, private foundations\nand transnational corporations if we are to expect\nhigher levels of effectiveness and greater positive\noutcomes in HIV/AIDS prevention.\nIn 2004, the Decade of the World's Indigenous\nPeople will come to an end. The Decade was important\nin that it highlighted, for the first time since Columbus\ncame to the Americas, the marginalization of the\nworld's indigenous people. Although the Decade has\nfallen far short of expectations, it did have one positive\noutcome, namely, greater awareness on the part of the\ninternational community about the continuing plight of\nthe indigenous peoples of the world. Dominica's\nindigenous people, the Caribs, made some important\ngains during the decade. These include the building of\nlinks with other indigenous groups across continents,\nthe consolidation of a Caribbean grouping of\nindigenous organizations, and the Government's\nestablishment of a Department of Carib Affairs.\nIndigenous peoples around the world continue to\nface marginalization and to wallow in abject poverty.\nThe world community must demonstrate greater\nresponsiveness to improving their condition through\nmore generous contributions to the Voluntary Fund.\nWe welcome the first report of the Secretary-\nGeneral on the New Partnership for African\nDevelopment (NEPAD) and we are greatly encouraged\nby the number of African actions to institutionalize\nNEPAD along with the incremental steps towards\nalignment of United Nations activities with the\npriorities of NEPAD. We commend the African Union\nand the African nations for all the efforts towards\nstrengthening the organization's momentum.\nDominica reiterates its continuing support for the\nefforts of our brothers and sisters in Africa to take full\nresponsibility for their own development.\nNext August, the international meeting for the 10-\nyear review of the Barbados Programme of Action\nregarding the sustainable development of Small Island\nDeveloping States will be held in Mauritius. This\nmeeting will address the future of the world's small\nisland developing States and will be a momentous\noccasion for Dominica and all the members of the\nAlliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) to finally get\nthe much-needed international support to address the\nrange of vulnerabilities we confront.\nDominica is honoured to host next week a\nmeeting of sustainable development experts, who will\nassess the performance of the indicators of the\nBarbados Programme of Action. The Mauritius\nConference is especially important given the\nmarginalization of small island developing States by\nunfavourable World Trade Organization (WTO) trade\nrules and the trade liberalization process.\nThe international community must pay greater\nattention to the social and economic vulnerabilities\nfaced by small island developing States. The sudden\nadjustment to trade liberalization and the WTO trade\nregime has contributed to the economic decline in\nmany small island States. Averting the rapid descent\ninto a downward economic spiral and social dislocation\nin SIDS requires a wider embrace and understanding of\nour call for special and differential treatment in the\ntrade arena.\nThe Dominican delegation believes that we have\nan obligation to be responsible to future generations by\nensuring that they will have an earth that is safe, secure\nand can sustain life. Let us not forget the commitments\nwe made last year at the World Summit for Sustainable\nDevelopment, especially regarding small island\ndeveloping States. We reiterate our concern once again\nabout all manifestations of climate change, and our\nopposition to continuing trans-shipment of nuclear\nwaste through the Caribbean Sea.\nWe therefore call on all Member States to support\nand participate in the Mauritius Conference for the 10-\nyear review of the Barbados Programme of Action next\n16\n \nAugust. We also appeal to corporations, private\nfoundations, bilateral and multilateral organizations to\nlend support for significant participation of civil\nsociety organizations, particularly from the AOSIS\nmember States, at this conference.\nThe delegation of the Commonwealth of\nDominica wishes once again to address the\nparticipation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in the\nwork of the United Nations.\nTaiwan has demonstrated its willingness to\nprovide much needed assistance to countries around the\nworld, including relief to war-torn and devastated\ncountries such as Iraq and Afghanistan. Article 4 of the\nUnited Nations Charter invites all other peace-loving\nStates to join the Organization and compels us to consider\nthe participation of Taiwan's 23 million people.\nThe problem of Severe Acute Respiratory\nSyndrome (SARS) ably demonstrated that progress\ntowards the noble goals of the United Nations is only\nimpeded by not integrating the Republic of China on\nTaiwan into international efforts to confront global\nchallenges. The situation regarding the Republic of\nChina must be addressed to ensure a more meaningful\ncontribution to global peace, security and poverty\neradication.\nIn conclusion, Dominica repeats its call for a new\nglobal framework to redress the imbalances brought\nabout by the galloping forces of globalization. We urge\nthe international community to rally behind the banner\nof multilateralism and to support the bold initiative of\nGeneral Assembly President Julian Hunte to make\ndevelopment and its attendant components, poverty\neradication and the Millennium Development Goals,\nthe central focus of the fifty-eighth session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nWe call also for the leadership role of the United\nNations in the quest for peaceful resolution to the\nconflicts in Iraq, Liberia and the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo, and for the unwavering support of the\ninternational community to the special needs of the\nsmall island developing States.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAs a Vice-\nPresident at this session, Senegal, through me,\nexpresses to the President its heartfelt congratulations\non his election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-eighth regular session. In that\nelection, I see a mark of confidence and a tribute to his\nwonderful country, Saint Lucia, but also to our entire\nsister community, the countries members of the\nCaribbean Community. He may therefore be assured of\nSenegal's full cooperation in the exercise of his\nimportant duties. Let me also express my sincere\nthanks to his predecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan of the Czech\nRepublic, for the decisive results achieved during his\nterm of office.\nI should like to express my fraternal and friendly\ngreetings to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\nand to tell him how proud I am of the spirit of\ninitiative, commitment and resolve that he has\ndisplayed with vigour and determination in his noble\nmission in the service of our common aspirations to\npeace, universalism and solidarity.\nIt is precisely in the name of those shared ideals\nthat my country, Senegal, reaffirms once again its\nfervent support for the readmission of the Republic of\nChina on Taiwan as a full-fledged Member of the\nUnited Nations. By doing that   without calling into\nquestion the participation and the legitimate status of\nany other Member of the great United Nations\nfamily   we would do justice to that country's 23\nmillion hard-working and disciplined inhabitants,\ndeeply attached to the values of peace, freedom and\ndemocracy enshrined in the Charter of the United\nNations.\nTwo years ago, on 11 September 2001, the world\ndiscovered the new face of international terrorism,\nright here and in all its horror. Certainly, other bloody\nattacks have taken place, here and elsewhere, before\nand since those tragic events; even the United Nations\nhas not been spared. The attack that cost the life of\nMr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights, and those of many other United Nations\nstaff, is a sinister reminder that the terrorist threat is\nnow global in its targets and pernicious in its means of\naction. Indeed, a defender of human rights has been\ndeprived of the most basic human right: the right\nto life.\n11\n\nConsequently, a collective, united, coordinated\nresponse is required at all levels. In that spirit, Senegal\ntook the initiative on 17 October 2001 to call for an\nAfrican anti-terrorism summit with a view to\nstrengthening cooperation in that regard at the\ncontinental level, thus joining its efforts with the\nAlgiers Convention on the Prevention and Combating\nof Terrorism. It is still our conviction that Africa must\nnot remain the soft underbelly of the system that is\ngradually being established to combat international\nterrorism in all its forms, in the wake of the armed\nconflicts and the humanitarian tragedies that have been\ncausing bloodshed in the world.\nWith regard to the situation in Africa, Senegal\nsalutes the significant progress achieved in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and in Liberia.\nThose two friendly countries, afflicted by so many\nyears of civil war, seem at last to have embarked on the\npath of negotiation and dialogue, an essential condition\nfor a definitive return to peace. Moreover, Senegal\nwelcomes the Security Council's decision to send a\npeacekeeping force to Liberia in support of the troops\nof the Economic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS), including the Senegalese troops already in\nplace.\nIn the sisterly Republic of C\u00d9te d'Ivoire, Senegal\nwelcomes the progress made in the national\nreconciliation process on the basis of the Linas-\nMarcoussis Agreements, in the hope that the incident\nthat occurred two days ago will prove to be only a\nhitch. I encourage my Ivorian sisters and brothers to\npersevere on the path of reconciliation, cooperation and\nmutual confidence in order to safeguard that country's\nnational unity and territorial integrity with the help of\nthe ECOWAS interposition force under Senegalese\ncommand.\nIn many respects, sources of concern persist on\nthe continent, particularly in West Africa, formerly\nknown for its stability. I am thinking in particular of\nthose who would call into question democratically\nelected regimes. We must say forcefully that the time\nmust be past for coups d'\u00c8tat in Africa. Everyone must\nunderstand from now on that legitimate power, whose\nsole agent remains the people, cannot be acquired,\npreserved or transferred except by means of the ballot\nbox   that is, through the force of law, not the law of\nforce or that of weapons.\nSenegal, for its part, is complying strictly with\nthe Declaration of Algiers of 1999, which enshrines the\nprinciple of excluding from the proceedings of the\nAfrican Union any regime established in violation of\ninternal constitutional order. Last July, it was on the\nbasis of that Declaration and thanks to the vigorous\nreaction of African countries   including mine   that\nconstitutional legality was re-established only a few\ndays after a coup d'\u00c8tat in Sao Tome and Principe. That\nexample   that precedent   should serve as a lesson\nto anyone who might yet be tempted by this practice,\nwhich runs counter to democratic values.\nOnly 10 days ago in Guinea-Bissau, a\ndemocratically elected President was deposed by a\ngroup of officers. As soon as I was informed of this, I\ncited the position of the African Union in calling for\nthe military to relinquish power. President Kufuor,\nChairman of the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States; President Chissano, President of the\nAfrican Union; President Obasanjo of Nigeria; and I\nimmediately took the situation in hand. This led to the\nestablishment of an entirely civilian Government. From\nthis rostrum, I should like to make a solemn appeal to\nthe international community. Guinea-Bissau, a fraternal\ncountry bordering on Senegal, needs immediate\nassistance. Only diligent and consistent economic\nassistance can create the conditions for a lasting return\nto social peace and political and institutional stability\nin that country.\nAs Chairman of the United Nations Committee on\nthe Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian\nPeople, Senegal remains gravely concerned by the\ndeadlock in the peace process in the Middle East. Too\nmuch blood has been shed and too much suffering\nendured in that land holy to the three great revealed\nreligions. And yet, one must face the fact that a\npeaceful solution is the sole, best guarantee of survival\nfor all the peoples affected by daily death and anguish.\nWe must pursue efforts to ensure a return to the\nnegotiating table on the basis of the relevant\nresolutions of the Security Council, the principle of\nland for peace and the parameters established in the\nroad map so that, at last, this long nightmare can yield\nto the oft-aborted dream of peoples who cherish peace\nand freedom.\nHowever, if the words attributed to one Israeli\nauthority are well founded, my country would warn\nagainst any attack on the physical integrity of President\nYasser Arafat and against any decision of expulsion.\n12\n\nAny such act would have incalculable consequences.\nSenegal rejects and condemns violence in all its forms,\nregardless of who the victims and perpetrators may be\nor the reasons invoked, and reiterates its unfailing\nsupport for the establishment of an independent and\nsovereign Palestinian State within secure and\ninternationally recognized borders, just as we have\nalways recognized Israel's right to exist in the same\nconditions. I have the feeling, however, that if we\nconfine ourselves to issuing statements without making\nany real effort to find a concrete solution, the tragedy\nthat is unfolding before our eyes in cycles of violence\nwill last a very long time.\nThe Israeli and Palestinian authorities have asked\nme, without my seeking it, to help them to settle this\nconflict, which is beginning to look like the Thirty\nYears War or even the Hundred Years War. Those\nauthorities may recall simply that Senegal has resolved\nfor itself one of the greatest contradictions of our time:\nthe coexistence in one land of Muslims and Christians,\nwho live in a ratio of 95 per cent to 5 per cent in our\ncountry. Christians, far from suffering from any\ndiscrimination, are fully integrated into national life, to\nthe extent that a Christian has been the President of our\nRepublic for 20 years and supported by Muslims. That\nis why I myself have turned to great thinkers and\ntheoreticians on the issue of conflict to see if their\nwords might be useful to us.\nA compatriot of Jacques Chirac, Mr. Gaston\nBoutoul, invented the science of war and, more\ngenerally, of conflict known as polemology, the\nobjective of which is to understand, through scientific\nanalysis, the motivations and mechanisms of war and\nconflict. A sociological approach includes individual\npsychology, collective and social psychology,\neconomics and the environment. I should like to\nsubscribe to this approach and, in the light of the\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict, to make a modest\ncontribution.\nIt seems to me that there are two possible\napproaches to the conflict: that of the aggressor\naggressed' theory and that of the occupier occupied'\ntheory. If we seek to identify who is in one category\nand who is in the other, we find ourselves in a complete\nimpasse. Unfortunately, that is what each of the parties\nis doing. In the first scenario, Israelis and Palestinians\neach claim to be the aggressed and accuse each other of\nbeing the aggressor. In the second, while Israel is\nundeniably the occupier, it justifies this state of affairs\nby pointing to the so-called aggression of Palestinians.\nHence, we return to the first theory and set in motion\nan endless cycle.\nLet us not play this game, which is one of\nmassacre for the parties to the conflict and of hide-and-\nseek on our side, where political and diplomatic\ninterests cloud the search for an equitable solution.\nThe aim of my proposal is to move beyond the\nsubjective approaches of the two parties by introducing\nexternal action, specifically on the part of the\ninternational community. Instead of pursuing the\ncourse of mutual accusation   which, it may be noted,\nleads nowhere because each party is subjective   I\nwould simply propose that we eliminate the two\nproblems by merging them into a single, unique\nproblem. The dispatch of international forces to secure\nuncontested borders and the placing on stand-by'\nstatus of the parts of the territory on which there is no\nconsensus would eliminate de facto the two approaches\nof occupier occupied' and aggressor aggressed'. I\nbelieve that this approach is all the more feasible and\nrealistic in that Israel has declared itself prepared to\nreturn all the occupied territories   90 per cent of\nthem first and then negotiating a border correction to\ncompensate for the other 10 per cent. That would allow\nus to abandon the two theories, which can only\neternally pit the two parties against each other and\ndivide the international community.\nThe greatest war of all time, that of 1939-1945,\npitted French against German. Today, they no longer\nagonize over the question of who was the aggressor\nand who the aggressed, or of who was the occupier and\nwho the occupied. All such issues have today been\nconfined to history. All the parties have decided to join\nefforts in a cooperative project: the European Union. I\nwould ask, therefore: Can we not dream of a post-war\nperiod in which Israel and Palestine can embark on real\ncooperation to the benefit of their two peoples?\nAs Members know, the Fifth Ministerial\nConference of the World Trade Organization ended in\nacknowledged failure just a few days ago in Cancun.\nBeyond that specific event, we need to reflect more in\ndepth on the international trading system. There is\nsomething paradoxical in this system based on a liberal\nphilosophy, but in which the rich countries spend over\n$1 billion a day in various subsidies for their own\nagricultural sectors. This ruinous practice leads to the\nfreefall of the prices of our peasants' agricultural\n13\n\ncommodities and threatens millions of jobs and the\nlives of over 2 billion human beings.\nThe hypothetical mechanism of limiting the\nperverse effects of subsidies can in no way be a\ncredible solution to the enormous damage done to the\ndeveloping countries. I believe that the time has come\nradically to rethink the mechanisms of international\ntrade in order to break away from this implacable logic\nof injustice and inequity. In that context, I have taken\nthe initiative of proposing to convene, every two years\nin Senegal, an agricultural Davos' an agricultural\nDakar, rather  to encourage thinking on a credible\nalternative to the current system.\nIt is indeed in no one's interest for the present\nimbalances to persist, because they promote poverty,\nfavour unemployment and destitution, and fuel the\nfeelings of exclusion and despair that lead to\nextremism of all types. Once again, for us it is a\nquestion of calling not for assistance, but for\nthe implementation of a minimum level of fairness in\ntrade   free trade, but fair trade.\nThe challenges of globalization and\ninterdependence that it entails forces us to devise new\napproaches that go beyond the obsolete assistance\npolicies to create the conditions for a new kind of\npartnership, which alone is capable of breaking the\nvicious cycle of poverty. Senegal reiterates its\ncommitment to implementing the 2001-2010 Brussels\nProgramme of Action for the Least Developed\nCountries and renews its support for the Office of the\nHigh Representative for the Least Developed\nCountries, whose activities deserve to be strengthened\nby the donor community in the framework of a trust\nfund established for that purpose.\nThe vision put forward by the New Partnership\nfor Africa's Development (NEPAD) is also relevant to\nthe new kind of partnership just mentioned. For two\nyears now, our continent has been carrying out a quiet\nrevolution to firmly take its destiny in its own hands\nagainst the background of key factors such as peace,\nstability, good governance in the public and private\nsectors and regional cooperation. Specific plans have\nbeen developed and are available to all our partners.\nWe have been learning as we go along, by\ncreating a gas pipeline in West Africa, for example,\nwhich will supply along 600 kilometres 3,640,000\ncubic metres of gas starting from Nigeria to Benin,\nGhana and Togo. The electricity grids in southern\nAfrican that brings together the national electricity\ncompanies of 12 countries of the Southern African\nDevelopment Community (SADC) is another example\nof Africa's will to pool our resources. Today NEPAD\nhas designated 14,000 kilometres of roads and just as\nmany kilometres of railways to be laid, and this is one\nof our top priorities. In the area of new information and\ncommunications technology, fibre optics now link\nEurope and the United States to Dakar, Pretoria and\nKuala Lumpur, with connections extending inside the\ncontinent. Those specific examples fully show our\ndetermination to make NEPAD a reality rather than a\ngood intention or unrealistic plan.\nOn a continent where everything still needs to be\nbuilt, it is not a matter of the need to identify\nopportunities but rather to seize them. On the whole,\nwe are committed to creating an environment in which\nthere will be a clear interest in investment and secure\nbusiness operations. On a different order, the African\nPeer Review Mechanism has been launched, and\ncolleagues before me have already spoken about it.\nTogether with our partners, we are ready to fulfil\nthe goals of NEPAD. In a few days, some African\nheads of State will be in Tokyo to establish cooperative\nties between Japan and Africa through the Tokyo\nInternational Conference on African Development.\nIn a report on the state of the international\ncommunity, the Secretary-General made an analysis\nthat sounded alarm bells: the world does not seem to be\nsharing much anymore. The collective security\nmachinery established by the Charter is already\nthreatened. The United Nations system inherited from\nthe Second World War no longer sufficiently meets the\nchallenges of the twenty-first century. He therefore\ncalls for the implementation of reform, as spelled out\nin the Millennium Declaration.\nLet us explore together the guidelines that were\nestablished by the Secretary-General. Let us make way\nfor a culture of peace and dialogue among civilizations,\nwhich bears the fertile seeds for consensus,\nunderstanding and peaceful coexistence. Let us resist\nthe temptation of isolationism and rule of force, for as\nJean-Jacques Rousseau rightly said in The Social\nContract': The strongest is never strong enough to be\nalways the master, unless he transforms strength into\nlaw, and obedience into duty.' Let us ensure that,\nhowever diverse we may be, the universal values of\n14\n\npeace, freedom, democracy and respect for human\nrights will always be safeguarded.\nI take this occasion to voice my support for the\nposition expressed by President Bush against the\nheinous sex trade and other forms of slavery. Instead of\nvague, futile statements of intention, let us all agree to\na realistic platform and guarantee that specific\nmeasures are taken. In that regard, we can justly raise\nquestions on the follow-up to commitments undertaken\nat the Monterrey International Conference on\nFinancing for Development.\nConcerning all these issues vital to humanity's\nsurvival, the United Nations must, in accordance with\nthe Charter, ensure that its mission remain clearly in\nsight, a mission that is a focal point at which our\nefforts towards humanity's common goals are\nharmonized.\nI strongly believe that this need corresponds to\nthe legitimate aspirations of all the peoples whom we\nrepresent here.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffYour election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\nsession, Sir, is a source of great pride and considerable\nsatisfaction to Jamaica and the entire Caribbean. We\nregard it as a tangible acknowledgement of the region\u2019s\nactive engagement on the global stage. I am confident\nthat your combination of long political experience,\noutstanding diplomatic skills and commitment to\nglobal comity will enable all of us to benefit from your\nguiding hand at a time when the United Nations, the\nvery cornerstone of global security and economic\ncooperation, faces its most severe test and the Charter\nitself is exposed to its greatest challenge. We also wish\nto commend the Secretary-General for his work during\na very difficult year and in trying circumstances for the\nUnited Nations.\nIt may eventually prove to be a fortunate quirk of\nhistory that, by virtue of the rotation system, a\ndistinguished representative of the Caribbean now\noccupies the presidency. For, by virtue of our history,\nlocation and size, we who fashioned the Caribbean\nCommunity thirty years ago recognized that we would\nnever be able to acquire the economic power or\nmilitary might to stand alone. Multilateralism,\ntherefore, affords us our only source of protection.\nTherefore, from its inception, our Community has\nremained resolute in upholding the sovereign equality\nof States and the maintenance of an international order\nthat protects the weak and powerless from domination.\nThe international situation today is filled with\nuncertainty and fear. There is a prevailing climate of\ndistrust and insecurity. Humankind faces the dangers of\nterrorism, nuclear proliferation and weapons of mass\ndestruction. We witness outbreaks of war and violence\nand a worrying escalation of confrontation and conflict.\nThere are new doctrines and policies that threaten\npeace everywhere.\nThe pillars of international law and respect for\nsovereign rights are being steadily eroded. Injustice\nand abuses of human rights still remain manifest. These\nare real concerns that underscore the need to strengthen\n2\n\nmultilateralism, to restore confidence in the United\nNations system, to buttress its centrality in decisions\nthat affect us all and to thereby enhance its capacity to\nenforce.\nThe multilateral process will collapse unless the\ninternational community asserts a strong collective will\nto review the structures, mandates and procedures in\nour global system.\nIn relation to efforts to strengthen multilateralism,\nI wish to emphasize four requirements:\nFirst, multilateralism must be equitable. This is\ncritical for its credibility. It should promote policies\nthat provide full opportunity for all States to benefit\nfrom the global system and that take into account the\nneeds, aspirations and welfare of the entire global\ncommunity. It should be non-discriminatory and\nproceed from the principle that the lives of human\nbeings cannot be differentiated on the basis of race,\nnationality or religion.\nSecondly, multilateralism must be democratic.\nThis is critical for its acceptability. Its decision-making\nshould be based on a fully inclusive process, in which\nall States have a voice and where dialogue and equal\nparticipation are encouraged and promoted.\nThirdly, multilateralism must be principled. This\nis critical for its legitimacy. It must be based on\ncommon rules and standards devised and enforced by\nthe international community, standards without\nselective application or double standards.\nFourthly, multilateralism must be effective. This\nis critical for its efficiency. Decisions, once taken,\nshould be implemented. Member States must exercise\nthe political will to guarantee that policies and\ndecisions that are agreed upon and taken are supported\nand upheld.\nAdequate resources must also be provided where\nnecessary. In order to promote the interests of all\nStates, the United Nations and multilateral institutions\nmust facilitate the creation of new opportunities for\neconomic development, through the expansion of trade\nand investment flows and through technical\ncooperation assistance.\nIn order to strengthen multilateralism, we need\nreform and rebuilding to improve the work of the\nUnited Nations in areas such as development\ncooperation, humanitarian affairs and disarmament.\nNo one, not even the five permanent members,\ndares to dispute the compelling urgency of altering the\ndesign and function of the Security Council if it is to\nfulfil, in the realities of the world today, the mandate\nconferred by the Charter of 1945. The case for\nexpansion of membership is irrefutable, as is the need\nto redesign decision-making to correspond with the\nprinciple of the sovereign equality of States.\nLet me make it clear: reform must extend beyond\ncomposition and geographical balance. The Security\nCouncil, as presently constituted, makes no pretence at\nrepresenting democracy in the global system. This must\nbe changed if we are to not fall into a dangerous abyss,\nand it must be changed in a way that deters arrogant\ndeviation from the most basic elements of the rule of\ninternational law. We have been talking for long\nenough; the time has come to cut the talk and walk the\nwalk.\nIn 2001, from this podium, I called for a United\nNations renaissance. Unless we undertake it now, only\nthose who believe in a resurrection will still be present.\nNone of us will then be able pretend that we are not\nresponsible for the demise of the Organization, nor will\nwe be able to exonerate ourselves from the\ncondemnation of history.\nWith regard to the General Assembly, what is\nneeded is a resuscitation in the use of its powers and\nassertion of its role as the principal organ of the United\nNations. This Assembly is a forum of equals. Its\npronouncements and policy decisions must carry the\nstamp of legitimacy as it is the voice of the\ninternational community.\nBut while we emphasize the importance of\ninstitutional reform, there should be equal focus on the\nresponsibilities of membership. There is need for a\nrevitalization in the commitment and political will of\nMember States to support the multilateral system and\nprovide it with adequate resources. Irrespective of the\ninstitutional arrangements we may devise, it is, in the\nfinal analysis, the Member States alone who can make\nthe system work. We cannot afford to fail.\nThe critical problems facing us concerning war\nand peace are compounded by the proliferation of\nweapons of all kinds. Globally, military expenditures\nnow amount to over 800 billion dollars annually.\nExperience has shown, however, that military power\nand massive investment in weapons do not bring\nsecurity and lasting peace. The force of arms cannot\n3\n\nimpose a lasting peace. Instead, it breeds a climate of\ninsecurity and feeds violence, war and terrorism with\nincreasingly destructive capacity.\nAt the same time, the arms industry fuels a\nrapidly growing underworld of trans-national organized\ncrime, which jeopardizes law and order and impedes\neconomic growth and social stability within our\nnational boundaries.\nIt is tragic and painful to witness the continued\ncycle of violence and carnage and the massive\ndestruction of property in the Middle East. No solution\ncan result from the continued military subjugation of\nthe Palestinians or from violence against the Israelis. A\npolitical settlement has to be found to provide security\nfor the Israeli people, to establish an independent State\nfor the Palestinians and to make suitable arrangements\nfor the security of all States in the region.\nWe cannot begin to speak about the situation in\nIraq without noting the atmosphere of fear, disorder\nand insecurity which now prevails in that country. We\ndeplore the recent bombings of the Jordanian Embassy\nin Baghdad and the United Nations office, which\nresulted in the deaths of United Nations officials,\nincluding that of the Special Representative of the\nSecretary-General in Iraq, and the bombing of the\nShi\u2019ite mosque.\nWe must all learn from what has happened in Iraq\nover the past year. The immediate question is how to\nformulate interim arrangements for the recovery and\nreconstruction of that country and the restoration of its\nsovereignty and independence, under a Government\nchosen by the Iraqi people. Efforts to re-engage the\nUnited Nations must ensure that it assumes a\nmeaningful role in the peace-building process and the\ntransition to democracy.\nThe situation in Africa has not been given the\nlevel of attention that is needed, particularly by the\nSecurity Council. The continued turmoil within parts of\nthe continent shows the need for stabilization through\nconciliation and dialogue between contending parties\nto end further fighting and bloodshed. We commend\nthe role being played by regional organizations like the\nEconomic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS) and by African statesmen to mediate and\nbring peace to those areas of current concern. But more\nshould be done.\nAdditional resources are needed to assist to\nensure that societies disrupted by conflict can be re-\nestablished and stabilized. The obstacles to eliminating\npoverty and disease can be overcome by providing\nmaterial assistance, and we are convinced that Africa\nhas the indigenous resources, the human potential and\nthe leadership to prevail over adversity.\nWithin the global economy, the pattern continues\nof a widening gap between developed and developing\ncountries. Wealth is increasing but poverty is also\ngrowing in critical areas of the world. Although we\ncontinue to raise our voices to warn of the dangers of\nthis global trend, our partners in the developed world\nhave given little indication of a change in policies that\nmight reverse it. We are continually told that prosperity\nwill come with policies of liberalization, a minimalist\nState and deregulation. In turn, these policies will\nunleash free enterprise to take advantage of economic\nopportunities that will lead to development and growth.\nBut it has become painfully obvious that this model\ndoes not succeed everywhere, particularly in the\ndeveloping world.\nAs you know so well, Sir, the countries of the\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) have for a long\ntime been a region where democracy flourishes and the\nrule of law prevails. The strengthening of civil and\npolitical rights in our countries has been our passion\nsince we gained our freedom.\nWe know that no country is above improvement\nin any of these areas, but there is a fashion in the\nindustrial world \u2014 including countries that are new\nconverts to these values \u2014 to imply that their adoption\nis the solution to all the problems of development.\nWere that so, Jamaica and all our countries of the\nCaribbean would have been havens of prosperity long\nago.\nWhat much of the developing world needs goes\nbeyond sermons about the precepts of democracy,\nabout obeying the rule of law and securing respect for\nhuman rights. The help we need is help in preserving\nthose rights from erosion by the instabilities that derive\nfrom underdevelopment and from the steady\ndeterioration in the global political environment.\nIn the international community, those same values\nare being systematically discarded and destroyed, as if\nour world society deserves less than our national\ncommunities. The persistence of underdevelopment \u2014\nthe denial of people\u2019s full rights as human beings \u2014 is\n4\n\nthe major challenge that poor countries face. We make\nthis clear, because it has become all too easy for rich\ncountries to excuse themselves from any meaningful\neffort towards poverty alleviation and economic\ndevelopment by asserting that salvation lies simply in\nsecuring civil and political rights. This is exactly what\nthey did at Cancun to the poorest countries in the\nworld \u2014 to those who live in abject poverty \u2014 by\ndenying their plaintive petition for a better deal in\ncotton.\nAs the current Chairman of the Caribbean\nCommunity, I assert that for us in the Caribbean, the\nfuture of our democracies lies in the strengthening of\nour economies, in a more favourable trading\nenvironment for our products, in more rapid and\neffective debt relief, in the protection of legitimate\nareas of economic progress like our financial services\nindustry and in tailoring globalization and the dogma\nof liberalization to the needs of small economies. Our\nfuture lies, in short, in escaping the trap of poverty.\nThat some are poorer does not make us less poor than\nwe are; that some are less developed than we are does\nnot alter our state of underdevelopment.\nTrade and competitiveness are not everything. In\ndeveloping countries there are weaknesses in\nproduction capacity and deficiencies at the micro level\nthat can be helped through programmes of development\ncooperation. Regrettably, in recent years, donor\nresources for such cooperation have been shrinking.\nWhere commitments have been given, there have just\nbeen too many promises broken. But we still remain\nhopeful that the pledges of Monterrey and the targets of\nJohannesburg will be taken seriously as commitments\nto be implemented.\nPartnership should not be used as a vehicle for\nthe imposition of conditionalities to promote bilateral\npolitical objectives. In our view, true partnership must\nrespect the concept of ownership by recipients and the\nnational priorities as determined by them. Decisions\naffecting development are being taken in different\nareas, in different forums and by different agencies.\nIncreasingly, there is the need to ensure coherence in\npolicies and programmes.\nThe international system currently does not have\nan effective mechanism for conducting such an\nexercise. We reiterate our belief that one of the urgent\ntasks of the moment is to create a mechanism within\nthe international architecture, which will focus on\ntrade, finance, technology and development policy in\nan integrated manner.\nWe want to draw attention to the Barbados\nProgramme of Action, which deals with the\nvulnerability of small island developing States (SIDS).\nWe call on the donor community to support the review\nof international economic arrangements, when the\ninternational conference meets in 2004 to review the\nBarbados Programme of Action.\nWe in Jamaica fully recognize that globalization\nhas the potential to advance human development\nthroughout the world. But this is not automatic. For\nglobalization has also increased our vulnerability,\ninsecurity and the possibility of marginalization. Small\ncountries like Jamaica and groups like CARICOM\ncannot and should not be expected to follow the same\npolicy prescriptions applied to larger, more advanced\ncountries. Special and differential treatment of a\nmeaningful kind is important, as we require policy\nspace for our productive sectors. It cannot be expected\nthat countries such as ours will abandon local\nproduction in agriculture and manufacturing, although\nwe fully recognize the growing importance and\npotential of the service sector in both the regional and\nglobal economies.\nIn the aftermath of Cancun, we in the global\ncommunity need to accept that trade rules must be\nasymmetrical in recognition of the diversity in levels of\ndevelopment and the size of economies. Trade rules\nmust also recognize the right of all countries to protect\ntheir development priorities and vulnerable groups,\nespecially their small farmers. Development issues as\nthey relate to the World Trade Organization (WTO)\nagenda must be defined by developing countries\nthemselves and not by others for us. The world\ncommunity must recognize these principles to ensure\nthat the global trade architecture can bring meaningful\nbenefits for all.\nGlobalization may bring a more integrated world,\nbut there will always remain significant variations in\nnational systems, cultures and national priorities. There\nis no single sustainable model for political\ndevelopment or economic success everywhere. We live\nin a diverse world where different ideas, cultural norms\nand standards exist. These should all be respected in\nthe framework of agreed principles within the United\nNations. In a world of such diversity and pluralism,\nthere should be tolerance, understanding, non-\n5\n\ndiscrimination, self-determination, respect for equal\nrights and justice for all. Those, for us, are\ntranscendental values to which we in Jamaica and\nthroughout the Caribbean will always fully subscribe.\nThe United Nations should continue to promote\nrespect for diversity while promoting the common\nprinciples and ideals that form the foundations of\ninternational law and order and international\ncooperation. This provides the only key for the pursuit\nof enduring peace, harmony and real development in\nthe global village to which we all belong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We know that his skill and capabilities will\nensure the success of our work, and we have every\nconfidence that he will be participating in strengthening\nthe role of the United Nations at a time when the\ninternational community is undergoing profound\nchange. I would also like to welcome the laudable\nefforts made by the outgoing President of the General\nAssembly. I would like to stress that the delegation of\nmy country, one of the Vice Presidents at this session,\nwill provide the President with every kind of support.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to express\nto Mr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the United\nNations, our sincere gratitude and appreciation for his\ntireless efforts to successfully carry out the huge mission\nand responsibilities entrusted to the Organization.\nAt a time when we are witnessing a myriad of\nchanges and surprising events, we would also like to\nexpress our sorrow at the horrendous and unjust attack\non the United Nations office in Baghdad, an attack that\nwe consider to be aimed at the fundamental principles\nand values that the United Nations is championing.\nWe meet here full of hope and in response to the\naspirations and concerns raised by numerous important\nissues before us for consideration during the present\nsession. We must meet the difficult challenges and\nperils that confront us. We are at a crossroads in a\nhighly complex era, in which we cannot rest on our\nlaurels. We must face the international tragic events\nand developments that are damaging to the credibility of\nthe United Nations and its noble principles and values.\nWe must do this collectively through multilateral\ninstitutions that will guarantee unified efforts and vision.\nWe have met here today, and we must frankly and\nobjectively recall what took place during the last\nsession of the General Assembly, in 2002. That session\ntook place one year after the odious terrorist attacks on\nthe United States. During our debate then, we were\nunanimous in condemning and combating world\nterrorism with a view to eradicating it.\nWe tried strenuously to avoid a war in Iraq. We\nwelcomed the road map and prospects for a peaceful\nand comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli\nconflict. One year later, here we are asking whether we\ncan indeed say that we have accomplished what we\nsought or taken steps towards peace in the Middle East\nas we had wished. Now that the Iraqi regime is no\nlonger in place, does Iraq in fact enjoy a democratic\nand free system and a constitutional order, which we so\nardently desire or have we in reality made Iraq a stage\nfor violence and a hotbed of terrorism?\nWhen my country opposed the war against Iraq, it\nwas convinced that the United Nations was in a\nposition to locate and eliminate weapons of mass\ndestruction there and that the regime could be made to\ncomply with the relevant resolutions based on\ninternational law.\nMy Government believed that this war would not\nachieve its aims, not only because it was based on\nshaky foundations but also because it was difficult to\npredict its negative consequences. We note with regret\nthat it has led to increased extremism and terrorism.\nOn the other hand, regarding the Arab-Israeli\nconflict, my country has developed a position based on\nthe principles laid down by the Quartet: working for\nthe advent of a Palestinian State that would exercise\nfull sovereignty over its territory, with Jerusalem as its\ncapital; withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Arab\nterritories occupied since 5 June 1967, and the return of\nthe refugees. We were and are still convinced that a\nsettlement can only be achieved if Israel ceases its\ndelaying tactics and complies with United Nations\nresolutions. We are convinced that Israel would only\naccept a solution if it were imposed on it by a binding\nresolution. This has not yet come to pass.\nThe world remains silent in the face of ongoing\nIsraeli aggression against the Palestinians. The Security\nCouncil is paralysed, unable to adopt a resolution\nbecause the United States did not use its influence,\ndespite its positive approach, as represented in the road\nmap, to achieve the desired solution. Therefore we\nwonder if we can still say that everything is fine with\nthe world and that peace and security are within our\n21\n\ngrasp when the Middle East, East and West Africa, and\nEast and South-East Asia have been battered by crises\nand conflicts?\nIf we tried to analyse these crises and their\nramifications, we would find three major causes: first,\na lack of democracy and freedoms; secondly, poverty\nand ignorance; and thirdly, a global order in which\npolicies of hegemony dominate and practices of\npressure are exerted against Third World States.\nWill we be able at the United Nations to alleviate\nthese desperate situations? Is it sufficient to proclaim\ndemocracy, devotion to freedom and human rights as a\npanacea for all problems? Can these ideals eradicate\npoverty and eliminate all that is negative in the realities\nof each country and in international relations? In fact,\nto alleviate these problems in an effective manner, we\nmust take into consideration the three causes I have\njust mentioned. Therefore, the rich and the powerful\nmust heed the cries of the weak and the poor.\nA real partnership and war against injustice are\nguarantees of international peace and security and the\nbest way to prevent extremism and terrorism. If things\nremain as they are now, we will witness a revolution of\nthe poor, a rebellion of the oppressed, a scenario that is\nquite removed from the one on the clash of\ncivilizations, as advanced by some parties.\nMy country believes that we need to seriously\nand positively cope with these crises and conflicts. The\nMiddle East must no longer be a hotbed of tension and\ncrises. The following measures are necessary: first,\nthere must be an immediate halt to the occupation of\nIraq, and its sovereignty, territorial integrity and\nresources must be preserved. The United Nations must\nassume responsibility for rebuilding Iraq; a national\nGovernment must be formed with a national\nconstitution and a democratic regime; the Iraqis must\nbe able to enjoy full rights and freedoms, and the\nLeague of Arab States must make a contribution to\nsuch efforts within international legality. We fully\nsupport the endeavours undertaken by the Governing\nCouncil in Iraq.\nSecondly, the Security Council must shoulder its\nfull responsibilities by implementing resolutions\nrelevant to the Arab-Israeli conflict and by\nimplementing the road map, without any amendments\nby the Israelis. Tel Aviv must be prevented from\ncarrying out the negative and pernicious act of killing\nor expelling Yasser Arafat, the elected President of the\nPalestinian people and the Palestinian National Authority.\nThirdly, Israel must withdraw from Syrian and Lebanese\noccupied territory, for that is an integral part of any\nattempt to have a just peace in the Middle East.\nWe would like to recall that the Arab countries, in\naccordance with the Arab initiative for peace, had\naccepted Israel as a State in the region and had agreed\nto deal with it on the basis of its real interest in peace\nand in ending the occupation of the Arab territories.\nWe would also like to recall that my country\nsubscribes to the efforts made by the United Nations\nregarding measures resulting from the Conference on\nDisarmament, which will allow us to adopt an\ninternational treaty putting an end to the arms race.\nThere is a need to encourage confidence-building\nmeasures on the national and regional level. The\nMiddle East must be a region free from weapons of\nmass destruction. Israeli nuclear installations must be\nsubmitted to international inspection. We must reject\nthe policies of selectivity and double standards for this\nissue and many others.\nThe policy of embargo and unilateral economic\nsanctions that go beyond regional borders and are\nimposed on certain countries are flagrant violations of\ninternational law. My country subscribes to the United\nNations appeal to put an end to unilateral measures\nimposed on the Sudan and Cuba, now that these\nmeasures have been eliminated regarding Libya. This\nwill allow us to spread a culture of peace, dialogue and\nunderstanding, even in dealing with questions on which\nthere has been disagreement. This would be a\nreasonable means and a rational approach to settle\nconflicts and differences among countries.\nMy country believes that this is also the approach\nand the means that must be adopted and implemented\nto settle the conflict in Somalia, in order to preserve\nthe national interests of that country. The Republic of\nYemen was one of the first countries to participate in\nefforts designed to achieve national reconciliation in\nSomalia. Therefore, my country urges the United\nNations and the international community to play their\nrole to ensure peace and security in Somalia.\nYemen would also like to express its support for\nthe peace negotiations between the Sudanese\nGovernment and the various opposition factions, which\nwould finally lead to peace, security and stability in the\nbrotherly country of the Sudan and would safeguard its\npeople and territorial integrity.\n22\n\nThe phenomenon of international terrorism is not\nunique to a single colour, religion or doctrine. It is an\nobstacle to world peace, security and progress. Various\ninternational coordination efforts to contain this\nphenomenon have failed because of lack of vision and\nfaulty approaches. The Republic of Yemen has greatly\nsuffered from terrorism. It has tried to take all possible\nmeasures to cope with this ill. We hope that there will\nbe united efforts by the international community to\neradicate this scourge and to finalize a comprehensive\nconvention against international terrorism.\nYemen renews its appeal for holding an\ninternational conference under the aegis of the United\nNations to define the causes of this phenomenon and to\nfinalize a strategy that contains solutions to the origins\nof this destructive phenomenon. My country also\nbelieves that the efforts of the international community\nmust be focused on putting an end to any and all\npolitical pressure exerted on certain countries and on\nopposing any attempt at threats or use of force and\ninterference   using terrorism as its excuse   in the\ninternal affairs of various countries. The Republic of\nYemen joins many countries in calling for the need to\ndifferentiate between terrorism as a phenomenon and\nnational struggle against foreign occupation by all\nmeans, as is the case with the legitimate and just\nstruggle of the Palestinian people.\nThe developing countries are faced today with\ndevelopment challenges that can be overcome only\nthrough concerted international efforts and support which\nwould help effect political and economic reforms. There\nis a need for rich countries to grant development and\nfinancial assistance to poor countries in order to ease the\ndebt burden of the latter and to facilitate the use and\ntransfer of technology. Heads of State and Government\nwho met during the Millennium Summit in New York\nin 2000 committed themselves to achieving this goal.\nThe United Nations, together with the\nInternational Monetary Fund and other institutions,\nmust try to establish an international fund for the\neradication of poverty and to improve the situation of\nrefugees. There is also a need to relieve economic,\nsocial and security problems, from which countries\nsuch as Yemen suffer due to the many refugees on its\nsoil, especially those from Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me first of all to\nsincerely congratulate Mr. Julian Hunte on his election\nas President of the fifty-eighth session of the General\nAssembly. Your election to the presidency is a\nreflection of the high esteem the international\ncommunity reserves for your country, Saint Lucia, and\nyour good person.\nAt the same time, I would like to express our\nappreciation for the excellent manner in which your\npredecessor conducted the work of the fifty-seventh\nsession of the General Assembly.\nI would be remiss if I did not pay tribute to\nSecretary-General Kofi Anan for his strong\ncommitment to the principles enshrined in the United\nNations Charter and for defending so courageously the\nideals on which this Organization is based.\nThe destruction of the United Nations\nheadquarters in Baghdad, with its unnecessary loss of\nlife, was a heinous crime against humanity and the\nUnited Nations. Sergio Vieira de Mello and his United\nNations co-workers were in Iraq not as an occupying\nPower, but to serve and address the humanitarian needs\nof the Iraqi people. This despicable act is tantamount to\ncutting off the hand that feeds. We offer our sincere\nand profound condolences to Secretary-General Kofi\nAnan, the United Nations family and the bereaved\nfamilies. In memory of the fallen, it is imperative for\nus, Member States, to accelerate ratification of the\nConvention on the Safety of United Nations and\nAssociated Personnel.\nThe recent high-level meeting at United Nations\nHeadquarters on the HIV/AIDS pandemic was of\ntremendous interest to the world and particularly to\nmany countries in Africa. The AIDS scourge, having\ndevastated entire communities, has also negatively\nimpacted the economic development of countries. In\norder to combat this scourge, it is incumbent upon the\ninternational community to make more resources\navailable, even in those countries where the incidence\nof the pandemic is reportedly low.\nMy country, Somalia, is reported to be one of\nthose countries in Africa with a very low rate of\ninfection. However, this should not lead us into\ncomplacency. Countries like Somalia have a unique\nchance to prevent the disease from spreading. An AIDS\nepidemic would be catastrophic for Somalia and\nseriously hamper efforts for peace and nation-building.\nIt is therefore critical to put into place coordinated and\nstrategic AIDS education and early response\nprogrammes to prevent the spread of the epidemic in\nSomalia. As the saying goes, prevention is better than\ncure.\nRecent developments in the international arena\npresent the United Nations with unprecedented\nchallenges. Whether we succeed or fail will depend\nprimarily on the manner in which we address these\nchallenges. In our view, that should be through the\nUnited Nations. We have to reinforce the principles of\nthe United Nations Charter through which we can\nfurther cement the pillars of international legitimacy on\nthe basis of the equality of nations big and small, rich\nand poor; respect for the sovereignty of peoples; non-\ninterference in each others\u2019 internal affairs;\nrenunciation of the use of force in resolving conflicts;\nand respect for human rights.\n21\n\nThere are Members of this Organization who\nviolate these lofty principles with impunity. Israel is an\nexample in this regard. Israel\u2019s continued occupation of\nArab lands seized by war; its denying the Palestinian\npeople their dignity; the daily killings of Palestinian\nchildren; the siege of the legitimate leader of the\nPalestinian people and calls by Israeli officials for his\nkilling; and the suffering and daily humiliations\ninflicted on the Palestinian people are of great concern\nto the international community. We believe that these\ngross violations of international law are not in the\ninterest of Israel or peace in the Middle East. We\nbelieve that the Arab initiative, which has the support\nof Arab States, provides a unique opportunity for\nachieving a just and comprehensive peace in the\nMiddle East and specifically between Arabs and\nIsraelis.\nThe situation in Iraq continues to be of great\nconcern. The people of Iraq need peace and\ndevelopment. The people of Iraq need to recuperate\nfrom the trauma of war and its aftermath. As a country\nthat has witnessed war and its destruction, we know\nwhat the Iraqi people are going through. We empathize\nwith them strongly. There must be a commitment from\nthe international community to respecting the unity,\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq. The\nwithdrawal of the occupying forces from Iraq as soon\nas possible and the establishment of a truly\nrepresentative Government for Iraq based on a\nconstitution acceptable to all Iraqis continue to be\nimperatives. In this regard, the United Nations can and\nmust play the central role in bringing peace to Iraq.\nA fresh wind is blowing throughout Africa, from\nthe West of the continent to its Eastern and Central\nregions. This fresh wind is one of hope and peace not\nonly for Africa, but also for the world. This wind of\nhope and peace needs to be nurtured and sustained by\nthe international community.\nWe welcome the progress made in the search for\npeace in African countries \u2014 the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo, Burundi, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Liberia,\nthe C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Guinea-Bissau. The latest and\nmost welcome progress towards peace is the 22\nSeptember 2003 agreement signed in Naivasha, Kenya,\nby the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People\u2019s\nLiberation Movement/Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army.\nWe encourage the parties to resolve the remaining\noutstanding issues in a spirit of accommodation and\nmutual understanding. We also commend the\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD),\nthe Economic Community of West African States, the\nAfrican Union, the United Nations and individual\ncountries for their valuable assistance in bringing peace\nto areas of conflict in Africa.\nI pause to share with the General Assembly the\nsituation in my country, Somalia. We express our deep\ngratitude to the Government and people of Kenya for\nhosting us and for their perseverance. We strongly\ncommend Kenya for its active role in promoting peace\nin Somalia. I also take this opportunity to thank the\nSecretary-General for his valuable support for the\npeace process in Somalia. The IGAD Partners Forum,\nthe African Union, the League of Arab States, the\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference and IGAD are\nto be commended for their firm commitment and input\ninto this process.\nThe Somali National Reconciliation Conference\nat Mbagathi enters its twelfth month. A lot of ground\nhas been covered during this period. A declaration on\nthe cessation of hostilities has been adopted and the\nAfrican Union has put in place a monitoring\nmechanism. Today, African Union monitors crisscross\nnearly all areas of Somalia to ensure the\nimplementation of the declaration on the cessation of\nhostilities.\nEqually important is the completion of the first\ntwo phases of the Conference. Despite such progress,\nwe have been struggling with the last and crucial phase\nof the Conference for the past four months. This last\nphase envisaged the adoption of an interim charter, to\nbe followed by the election of an interim head of State\nand the formation of an all-inclusive Government of\nSomalia. However, disagreements regarding the\ncontent of the interim charter and other important\nmatters continue to persist. The provisions of the\ninterim charter that raise the concerns of many touch\nupon the shape and very foundations of the\nreconstituted State of Somalia. It is for that reason that\nthe Conference is currently in suspense and stalled,\nwith the Transitional National Government and at least\nseven other groups refraining from participation.\nAny interim charter for Somalia, in our view,\nmust meet certain, basic criteria. First, it must have\nSomali ownership. Secondly, it must be the result of a\nfair and transparent process. Thirdly, it must have the\nsupport of the Somali stakeholders. Fourthly, it must be\nenforceable on the ground. Fifthly, it must reflect the\n22\n\nunity and indivisibility of the Somali nation. Finally,\nany Government that is established under this interim\nCharter should be an all-inclusive one. By the same\ntoken, any agreements reached in Kenya must be on a\nconsensus basis, have the support of the Somalis as\nwell as of the international community, and be\nenforceable on the ground.\nTo facilitate an agreement based on these criteria,\na re-evaluation of the manner in which the Conference\nis currently being run is called for. The IGAD frontline\nStates must observe the principle of impartiality and\nneutrality, without which no mediation can be taken\nseriously. Furthermore, the IGAD frontline States must\nconfine their role to that of an active facilitator and\nattempts to fast-track the process with a view to\nreaching any agreement in haste and at any price must\nbe discouraged.\nIn spite of the current difficulties, I am here to\nreiterate before this Assembly the sincere commitment\nof the Transitional National Government to the IGAD-\nled peace process for Somalia. I hereby state that the\nTransitional National Government will rejoin the peace\nconference in Mbagathi, Kenya, as soon as its concerns\nare fairly addressed. We do this not only for ourselves,\nbut also for the Somali people, who have suffered so\nlong. I submit that the solution lies in assisting the\nSomali parties to come to an agreement that is owned\nby all Somalis, rather than in imposing something\nagainst their will. We urge the international community\nto engage itself in the realization of this goal. We must\nall work together to ensure that the march to peace in\nSomalia is irreversible.\nThe international community has an obligation to\nre-engage in Somalia in a very serious manner and to\nre-enforce its role as a promoter of peace there at the\nSecurity Council and other levels, as it has done with\nother conflict areas in Africa. It is not enough to\nobserve or to wait and see. Somalia needs serious\nsponsorship to push the peace forward. Finally, we urge\nthe neighbouring countries of Somalia to scrupulously\ncomply with the arms embargo imposed on Somalia by\nthe Security Council. We strongly urge them to do so in\nthe interest of peace and security in the subregion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We\nrespect and admire the patience, tact, wisdom and\ndetermination that he has once again demonstrated in\nthese trying times.\nThe attack on the United Nations headquarters in\nBaghdad on 19 August has added an unwelcome\ndimension of tragedy and urgency to this year\u2019s session\nof the General Assembly. Our thoughts are with the\nrelatives and friends of the victims, to whom we again\nexpress our deepest condolences. Not for the first time\nin its history the United Nations is mourning the\nviolent death of its talented servants in the course of\ntheir duty.\nBesides being a human tragedy, it was indeed \u2014\nfor the first time \u2014 also a direct and deliberate attack\non the United Nations itself. In this sense, an analysis\nof the implications of the attack in Baghdad needs to\nform an integral part of the broader considerations\nrelating to the structures and objectives of the\ninternational system.\nThe reality is that in the United Nations the\ninternational community has a system that is both vital\nand indispensable. However, it is also a fact that the\ninternational community has taken this system for\ngranted for too long. Events over the last few weeks\nand months constitute a renewed reminder that urgent\nreform is necessary. We need to heed the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s advice that this action has to be radical.\nOne important element in the process of building\ninternational cooperation and solidarity lies in the\nregional dimension. That dimension was given its\nimportance in the original architecture of the United\n25\n \nNations Charter. Over the last 12 months Malta,\ntogether with nine other countries, successfully\nconcluded negotiations to join one of the most creative\nand impressive manifestations of regional cooperation:\nthe European Union. The results of those negotiations\nwere confirmed by the people of Malta, first in a\nreferendum and subsequently in the general elections\nheld earlier this year. Our desire to join the European\nUnion stems primarily from our appreciation of both\nthe history and the present reality of the European-\nMediterranean region, and of Malta\u2019s place and role in\nthat region.\nAt the same time, for Malta, the objective of\nmembership in the European Union has also been a\nfurther means of deepening and reinforcing its\nlongstanding commitment towards international\ncooperation and solidarity.\nWe are gratified to see how the European Union\nis fast becoming one of the main partners of the United\nNations in the collective endeavour towards global\ncooperation and solidarity. We are encouraged to discover\nhow much that partnership enhances the opportunities for\neven the smaller members to play a positive and\nconstructive role in many issues of global concern.\nAmong such issues, the question of security in all\nof its complex dimensions has assumed formidable\nproportions this year. One of the more disturbing\naspects in that regard is the way in which the different\ndimensions of terrorism and arms control have become\nintertwined. That link has become a factor in the\nsometimes differing perceptions of the sources of the\nsecurity risks faced by States. In turn, that has led to\ndifferences of emphasis in action priorities, even among\nStates with otherwise very convergent policies and\napproaches. When such differences are reflected within\nthe Security Council itself, there is a risk of erosion to the\nstill fragile structure of international legitimacy.\nOn the question of Iraq in particular, it is\ncritically important for the Security Council to reach\nearly agreement on the role the United Nations must\nplay in the re-establishment of order and legitimacy in\nthat country. We strongly urge all members of the\nCouncil, in particular the permanent members, to spare\nno effort to achieve that objective.\nThe question of armaments today confronts us in\nits bewildering complexity. At one extreme is the\noutrageous reality of child soldiers brandishing lethal\nconventional weapons. At the other extreme is the\nincreasingly credible prospect that terrorist groups will\nprocure and use weapons of mass destruction to bring\nmajor tragedy and destruction to the hearts of States.\nThese extremes have intruded into the more traditional\ndisarmament process that has itself been moving\nforward hesitantly and intermittently over the years.\nYet however hesitant and intermittent it may be,\nthe disarmament process has produced some results\nupon which we can build further. A range of agreements\nand instruments are already available concerning both\nweapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons.\nThe more immediate challenges in this regard lie in the\nareas of compliance and verification.\nOver recent months, the European Union has\nbeen working on a comprehensive security strategy on\nthe issues of non-proliferation and weapons of mass\ndestruction. One of the key principles underpinning\nthis strategy is the need to uphold and implement the\nmultilateral treaties and agreements that exist in this\narea. Equally important is the need to support the\nmultilateral institutions charged with verifying and\nensuring compliance with these agreements. Primary\namong these institutions is the United Nations.\nTerrorism in our day is a phenomenon that is\nunprecedented in terms of motivation, tenacity and\nmethods. Over the past 12 months terrorist acts have\nindiscriminately struck peoples, both in areas of active\nconflict and elsewhere. The counter-terrorism measures\nput in place following the attack here in New York on\n11 September 2001 provide us with tools which can\nhave an effect if applied forcefully, universally and\nconsistently. Our response must remain adamant and\nclear. At the same time, as the Secretary-General\nreminds us, while there is an unquestionable need to\nconfront terrorist groups with determination, this\nshould never be at the expense of the commitment to\nhuman rights.\nThe objective of increased security at the global\nlevel demands efforts across a range of widely different\nfronts, ranging from issues relating to peacemaking and\npeacekeeping, to issues relating to economic and social\ndevelopment.\nThe United Nations has a steady record of\npositive involvement in peacekeeping. The recent\nexperiences in Sierra Leone, Timor-Leste and Kosovo\nprovide encouraging instances of this. The Secretary-\nGeneral reminds us that peacekeeping efforts, and\nespecially what he terms \u201crobust\u201d peacekeeping, must\n26\n \nbe provided with both the necessary capabilities and an\nadequate mandate. He also correctly points out that\npeacekeeping must be preceded by effective action\ntowards conflict resolution.\nThe question of Palestine is one issue with regard\nto which sustained efforts at conflict resolution have\nnot yet prevailed. Over the past few weeks we have\nbeen witnessing the gradual disintegration of yet\nanother major and sustained effort at peacemaking in\nthat region.\nThe immediate obstacles to peace in Palestine\narise from two contrasting directions. On the one hand\nis the reality of an illegal occupation of territory\noriginally achieved, and continuously maintained, by\narmed force. On the other is the reality of a resistance\nto this occupation that uses unacceptable means of\ncivilian terror and destruction to pursue its ends.\nThese two realities feed upon each other in a\nvicious cycle of ever-escalating hatred and violence.\nPerhaps the most frightening aspect of the situation in\nPalestine is the fact that each successive failure of\neffort towards peacemaking ratchets up the level of\nhatred and violence. The international community\nneeds to find a way of breaking the conditionality\nwhich makes the two extremes feed upon each other.\nIsrael needs to clearly recognize the illegality of\nits presence in the occupied territories. This implies the\nreversal of the measures that are accompanying this\noccupation \u2014 in particular the building and maintenance\nof settlements and the construction of the partition wall\non Palestinian territory.\nFurthermore, the support of the chosen leadership\nof the Palestinian people is necessary if progress\ntowards peace and stability is to be achieved. In this\nspirit, we call upon Israel to desist from any act of\ndeportation and cease any threat to the safety of the\nelected President of the Palestinian Authority.\nFor their part, the Palestinians must recognize\nthat all violent acts against civilians are unacceptable\nand must stop unconditionally. The Palestinian\nAuthority needs to assert its control and prevent any\nfurther acts of terrorism.\nIn spite of the latest setbacks, the approach by the\nQuartet still needs to be supported and encouraged. By\nvirtue of its composition, the Quartet offers the best\nprospects for finding ways of breaking the\nconditionality that feeds the extremes on both sides.\nThe hope remains that, at the core of both the Israeli\nand the Palestinian populations, the desire for peace\nand reconciliation is stronger than the delirium of fear\nand hatred.\nMalta always views the problem of Palestine\nfrom the perspective of its effect on issues of security\nand cooperation in the Mediterranean. Our membership\nof the European Union will provide us with enhanced\nopportunities to intensify our traditional role in this\nregard.\nProgress in the process of Euro-Mediterranean\ncooperation has been slow but steady since the\nEuropean Union launched its Euro-Mediterranean\ninitiative in 1995. The process has itself been affected\nby the vicissitudes of the situation in Palestine over\nthese years. Yet the general trend has remained\npositive, even in the most difficult of times.\nThe recent resolution of the Lockerbie issue\nfurther helps in creating the right atmosphere for\nenhanced regional cooperation.\nIt is now our hope that the work of the\nSecretary-General, accompanied by the efforts of\npersuasion of the European Union, will succeed in\nresolving one of the still outstanding problems in our\nregion \u2014 the problem of Cyprus. Malta would\nwelcome in May next year the integration of a reunited\nCyprus into the folds of the European Union.\nOne of the major strengths of the Euro-\nMediterranean process lies in the linkage that it\nmaintains between security issues and wider issues of\ncooperation in the economic and humanitarian fields.\nIn his report this year, the Secretary-General underlines\nthe fact that issues related to development form an\nimportant part of the commitments undertaken under\nthe Millennium Declaration. The Secretary-General\nnotes that a stronger consensus has been forged on this\nissue. But he also cautions that grave doubts remain as\nto whether Member States are sufficiently determined\nto act on this consensus.\nThe failure of the World Trade Organization\nmeeting in Canc\u00fan last week highlights the difficulties\ninherent in translating broad consensus into concrete\naction. In the area of trade, as in other areas of\ndevelopment, it is indeed the case that globalization\nhas exposed a major disequilibrium and great\ninequalities in the international arena. In some respects\nit has also exacerbated the injustices arising from those\n27\n \ninequalities. There is an even greater need, therefore,\nfor the international community to persevere in its\nefforts towards more concrete and effective measures\nof consensus-building. The high-level meeting on\nHIV/AIDS that recently concluded highlights the way\nin which problems that have a global dimension need\nto be tackled.\nThe problem of AIDS also underlines the\nimportance of continuing efforts towards norm-setting\nin the various dimensions of international life.\nThe practice of holding annual treaty events,\ninstituted following the Millennium Summit, has\nproved its value in this regard. This year\u2019s event is\nfocusing on Treaties against transnational organized\ncrime and terrorism. On that occasion, Malta will be\ndepositing its ratification of the United Nations\nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime and\ntwo of its protocols. We will have thus already ratified\nor acceded to 11 of the 15 Treaties on which the\nSecretary-General has focused for this year\u2019s event.\nOne area where norm setting is in its early stages\nconcerns the issue of cloning. Malta approaches this\nissue from a moral and ethical standpoint based on the\ndeepest respect for human life. We believe that while\nscientific considerations are sometimes relevant in\nmatters of this nature, final decisions must primarily be\nbased on fundamental human, ethical and moral\nconsiderations. In this spirit, the draft resolution\nproposing a convention that bans all forms of human\ncloning fully reflects our views. For this reason we will\nsupport this draft resolution. At the same time, we also\nbelieve that on issues of such deep ethical and moral\nsensitivity, real progress can only be achieved through\nconsensus.\nThe issues before the General Assembly are many\nand wide-ranging. Such a dense and varied agenda\nconfirms the relevance and vitality of our Organization.\nAt the same time, it also points to the problems\nregarding the effectiveness and functionality about\nwhich so many of us are concerned.\nI trust that under your guidance, Mr. President,\nthe Assembly will find the wisdom and energy to\nclearly define its priorities and take the necessary\naction. I wish you every success in your endeavours.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffToday I\nstand before the Assembly representing the voice of the\nIraqi citizen who long suffered from cruelty within and\noutside his homeland. Those within his country\ninflicted on him the worst kinds of torture: they\nattacked his honour, assaulted his family, humiliated\nhim, shackled him, oppressed him and forced him into\nmiserable wars. His brothers and his friends in the\nregion not only remained silent, ignored him and\nturned a blind eye to his catastrophe, they also\ncriticized and faulted him the moment he dared to\nspeak up. And throughout the world, those who stood\nto benefit scrambled to do business and cooperate with\nhis torturer.\nVery few accepted and spoke the truth; very few\nconsidered the catastrophe of their fellow human being\nand declared that he was a victim. He heard no\nresponse to his appeals. So the Iraqi citizen remained\nlost and doubly persecuted \u2014 first, with the injustice\nof the sword with which the dictatorial regime attacked\nhim at home, and then with the injustice of criticism \u2014\na more painful affliction \u2014 from many abroad. But the\nIraqi citizen did not give up. Rather, he was persistent\nand patient, and he continued his struggle through his\nthoughts, words and actions to achieve liberation, the\nideal for which he had always yearned most.\nI stand today before the Assembly expressing to\nMembers to the best of my ability the voice of this\nIraqi individual, declaring with him and on his behalf\nthe end of silence. I ask each Member present here to\nlisten to him.\n28\n\nI come today to present the Assembly with four\nessential truths and to demonstrate, through those\ntruths, two fundamental rights.\nThe first truth is that Iraq\u2019s long, dark night has\nended. The bitter experience of humiliation,\noppression, suppression, and dictatorship that the Iraqis\nendured for more than three decades has ended. It\nended with the fleeing of the head of the regime, along\nwith his cronies, and with the collapse of the symbols\nthat he had erected in Baghdad and throughout Iraq.\nThe second truth is that the liberation of Iraq \u2014\nand what took place was indeed liberation \u2014 could not\nhave been achieved had it not been for the resolve of\nPresident George W. Bush and the commitment of the\ncoalition, headed by the United States of America and\nthe United Kingdom. The Iraqis will never forget their\nsacrifices and the courage they displayed in Iraq\u2019s\nliberation. If today we hear the voices of those who\nquestion the intentions of the Governments of the\nUnited States and the United Kingdom in undertaking\nthe liberation, we invite them to come to visit the mass\ngraves, the drained marshes and the gassed city of\nHalabja, and to examine the list of the missing whose\nright to life was taken from them by the regime.\nThe third truth is that the liberation embodied a\nuniversal Iraqi national resolve. The liberation came as\na result of vigorous Iraqi efforts to oppose the deposed\nregime during many long years when hundreds of\nthousands of martyrs were sacrificed. The martyr\nAyatollah Muhammad Bakr al-Hakim and his\ncompanions \u2014 may God rest their souls \u2014 were not\nthe last victims; they added another page to the annals\nof Iraqi bravery on 29 August, the day of the Iraqi\nmartyr. Nor was death by treachery spared the martyr\nAkila al-Hashemi.\nThe fourth truth is that the removal of the regime\nwas only the prelude to the birth of a new Iraq. The\nbirth that has been prepared for by so many faithful\nIraqis, both at home and abroad, is at hand.\nA unique experience awaits us in Iraq today. We\nwill succeed through our desire to do good, to achieve\ndevelopment and to let freedom spread and flourish. I\nstand here today to confirm that, with God\u2019s help, we\nin Iraq will accept nothing short of success. Iraqis are\ncapable of succeeding, and they want to succeed. We\nwill not allow a gang of mercenaries and terrorists to\ndeprive the Iraqi citizen, the Iraqi society and the Iraqi\nnation of a bright tomorrow.\nThe land of the two rivers, the cradle of\ncivilization, the land of Sumer, Akkad, Babylon and\nAssyria, the land of peace, the land of the caliphate and\nthe house of wisdom, the home of the Code of\nHammurabi and the storehouse of accumulated\nknowledge, literature, poetry and intellectual\nachievement is dependent, first and foremost, on its\nhuman resources more than on its natural and oil\nresources.\nOn the basis of its human resources, Iraq can\nundergo a qualitative sea change, moving it from the\ngrip of totalitarianism and fear to stability, prosperity\nand tolerance. What the international community puts\ninto Iraq will be returned many times over. Put your\nconfidence in Iraq and receive from it stability and\nprosperity. Not only would stability and prosperity be\nIraq\u2019s but they would spread to the rest of the region\nand the entire world.\nThe Iraq that we want to see is the Iraq of the\ninnovative individual. More than 60 per cent of Iraq\u2019s\npopulation is below the age of 20. Our first priority in\npreparing those young people for the twenty-first\ncentury is to give them cultural and educational values\nthat will enable each of them to prove themselves and\ntheir particularities in a new Iraq.\nIn the past in Iraq, as in other nations that\nsuffered under the ideologies of the twentieth century,\nthe individual was suppressed by the masses, the\nmasses by the revolution, the revolution by the party,\nand the party by the leader. The result was that the\nhuman being was lost under continuous layers of\nnegation that obliterated his individuality, making him\nan object for consumption in an ostensible defence of\nthe nation and in the name of the revolution, or to be\nsacrificed, body and soul, for the leader. The concerns\nof Iraqis are no different from those of all other peoples\nof the world. Iraqis are eager to define themselves and\nto project their singularity. The Iraq of tomorrow must\nrecognize the individual citizen as the basis of\nsovereignty and the starting point for legislation.\nThe rights of the individual are fundamental; the\nrights of the group derive from them. Iraqis, like other\npeoples, insist on their right to dignity, freedom, justice\nand peace. The assertion of such rights will build the\nfoundations of tomorrow\u2019s Iraq. The dignity of every\nIraqi, without exception, must be guaranteed, without\nconsideration for social status, political position or\neconomic situation. An accused person will not lose his\n29\n\ndignity, even if found guilty. We will begin with\ndignity because the previous regime worked futilely to\nconvince Iraqis that their dignity was an endowment\nfrom the ruler. Today, we stress that the dignity of the\nentire nation stems from the dignity of each citizen.\nAs with dignity, so with freedom. Freedom is not\na gift from the ruler or the State. Rather, it is a basic\nprinciple, the essence of a human being. Responsible\nfreedom that does not impinge upon the liberties of\nothers is the core of the social contract. Despite the\nexcesses of outsiders and infiltrators since the fall of\nthe repressive regime, Iraqis have proved to themselves\nthat freedom means neither chaos nor the law of the\njungle.\nThe individual has an instinct for freedom, and\nthus he demands justice. The previous regime\nundermined justice and transformed it into a tool of the\nState to oppress and suppress the people. The new Iraq\nwill be based on a firm justice system that ensures the\nindependence and integrity of the judiciary. After the\nsenseless wars that destroyed innumerable lives,\nleaving disaster in their wake, the new Iraq will adopt a\nnew defensive policy based on peace. Iraq will be an\nactivist for peace for the region and the world. The\naforementioned four truths will form the foundation of\nIraq\u2019s political future.\nIraq will abide strictly and explicitly by all\nhuman rights instruments, beginning with the\nDeclaration of Human Rights, guaranteeing the right of\nman to life, property and the pursuit of happiness.\nWe pledge that Iraqi laws and legislation apply\nequally to all the people. No person will be above the\nlaw for any reason, regardless of merit or individual\nresponsibility. Indeed, there will be no distinction on\nthe basis of religion, sect, race, language, ethnicity,\ngender, class or tribe. The defunct regime exploited\nthose divisions for its own ends. The new Iraq will rely\non justice and fairness.\nIraqi women are capable of innovative excellence\nand productivity and can take on all the responsibilities\nof the nation. It is the duty of society and the State to\nremove any obstacles in their way.\nThe constant dialogue that is required between\nIraqi citizens and the State that represents and serves\nthem will take place on the basis of an honest,\ndemocratic and representational system. This system is\nbased on the principle of the separation of powers, and\nfirmly upholds elections as the ultimate arbiter. We are\nnot concerned with the dressings of democracy, but\nwith the safety of the political system as the\nincarnation of the democratic spirit.\nThe pillars of this system are, first and foremost,\nthe separation of powers in the framework of a written\nconstitution that avoids duplication in the judicial,\nlegislative and executive powers. That will provide a\nsound basis for each to oversee the other. Secondly,\naccountability will be ensured as a result of such\nsupervision and by means of elections that will provide\nfor the participation of individuals in politics. Finally,\ncivil society will be empowered by means of a free\npress, unions and independent institutions, which will\nact as monitors and critics and represent the plurality of\npolitical forces in the country.\nThe third pillar is the upholding of transparency\nas a fundamental principle, based on the sovereignty of\nthe individual citizen. The State exists to serve, and is\nanswerable to the citizen, who is entitled to inquire into\nits affairs. The State does not have the right to withhold\ninformation on its affairs. The fourth pillar is\nrecognition by the minority of the right of the majority\nto assume power, and the respect by the majority of the\nrights of the minority. Here, it is important to\ndistinguish between a political majority and minority\nand a factional majority and minority. Political\nmajorities and minorities are determined by the ballot\nbox, not by a population census or random correlations.\nNo one has the authority to arrogate to himself a\npolitical right on the basis of a presumed factional\nmajority. We do not want a political, sectarian or\nnational allocation in Iraq. A sound representative,\nfederal political system can best express the interests of\nall Iraqi citizens in a manner that reflects their religion,\ncreed, ethnicity or language.\nThe previous period was characterized by\nrestricting all power to an abusive few in Baghdad, but\ntomorrow\u2019s Iraq will be based on the principle of local\nauthority in the context of a federal union. Federalism\nas construed by Iraqis is not based on the division of\nthe homeland; rather, it is a way of empowering and\nrehabilitating those living in different regions to take\ndirect responsibility for their affairs in their own\nregions, without constant interference from the central\nGovernment.\nOur constitution charts the relationship between\nintegrated and continuous local and national\n30\n\nauthorities. We rely on the federal system, as we do on\nthe democratic system, because we have a clear\nunderstanding of the relationship between the State and\nits citizens. This relationship is not one of\nguardianship, because the Iraqi citizen is not a minor\nand is therefore not in need of the State\u2019s interference\nin all his affairs. Our concern is to ensure that this\nrelationship is based on care, with the State being the\nvigilant servant of the citizen, and on nurturing in some\nareas, especially with regard to the provision of\neducation and social and health services for young\npeople.\nComplementing our belief in federalism, and in\ncontrast with the vain and false nationalist excesses of\nthe previous regime, we declare that Iraq is one nation,\npermanent and whole.\nNothing in this declaration belittles the continuity\nof our Arab and Muslim heritage, or contradicts the\nsentiments of many Iraqis about their own culture and\nnational identity. Rather, it confirms that all the\nterritory of Iraq \u2014 from its mountains in the far north\nto its marshes and the Gulf in the extreme south,\nincluding its rivers, plains and deserts \u2014 is a lasting,\nindivisible unit. This is an expression not only of the\ntrue beliefs of most Iraqis, but also of a key political\nprinciple and point of reference that will help the\ncountry recognize realities on the ground and avoid\nfurther upheaval.\nWhile we seek to strengthen the rule of law and\ninstitutions of governance, we wish to make clear that\nauthority emanates from the citizen who occupies the\npolitical position not from the political post itself.\nThere must be a legal foundation in this respect, and\ndecisions must not be taken because of the whims or\nopinions of a person in authority. The previous regime\nissued many arbitrary rules, regulations and decisions\nbased on one man\u2019s views. The alternative in\ntomorrow\u2019s Iraq will be the application of the rule of\nlaw through sanctioned legislative authority that\nreflects the will of the Iraqi people, through an\nindependent judiciary and under the supervision of an\nelected legal body.\nLast but not least, let me touch on the relationship\nbetween religion and State in the new Iraq. Islam is the\nreligion of the overwhelming majority of Iraqis. It is\nvital to the Iraqi identity as well as to the State and the\nnature of governance. In any case, the great\ncivilizational heritage and rich cultural repository of\nIslamic jurisprudence is, no doubt, one of Iraq\u2019s assets,\nand we will benefit from it through a judiciary that is\nbased on equality and pluralism.\nLet me point out a truth that is often overlooked:\nthat the State, during the previous century, used\nreligion for its own ends and took from it what suited\nthose who had usurped power. They rejected the\nindependence of institutions and of religious centres,\ntaking over the Awqaf and imposing a religious\nterminology that suited their own interests, at the\nexpense of those of others. In Iraq, religion is one of\nthe most important assets of the individual and of\nsociety. We will not abandon it in any area, or reject its\njudicial, intellectual, behavioural or daily implications.\nWe call for the rehabilitation of all religious\ninstitutions by enabling them to reassume their\nresponsibilities in protecting Iraqi citizens who seek\ntheir moral and spiritual guidance without hypocritical\npolitical involvement.\nThese are the main guidelines for what we want\nfor our country.\nOur right today is to demand help and assistance\nfrom the world, thanking all those who stood by the\nIraqis in their darkest hour and forgiving those who\ninadvertently did not stand with us. It is important for\nall nations of the world to acknowledge that what\nhappened in Iraq \u2014 past atrocities and today\u2019s\nreconstruction \u2014 reflects an ongoing and dramatic\nhistorical event. The international community must\nstand shoulder to shoulder with us. That is what we\nourselves want and what we want from others on the\nroad to a free, just and peaceful Iraq.\nWe want an Iraq in which unity and plurality are\ntwo sides of the same coin. We want an Iraq that\nreturns sovereignty to the individual citizen, not to the\nleader. We want an Iraq that is secure in its cultural and\nreligious identity and engaged in open dialogue with\nthe world. We want an Iraq that embraces its past while\nlooking to the future \u2014 an Iraq that is at peace with\nitself, its neighbours and with the world. We want an\nIraq that will eradicate all Ba\u2019athists once and for all,\nbring all their officials to justice and prevent them from\nassuming power again.\n(spoke in English)\nI stand before the Assembly as the representative\nof a free Iraq. To all those here who helped us in our\nstruggle for liberation, we extend our gratitude. Our\n31\n\nliberation would not have been achieved without the\ndetermination of President George W. Bush and the\ncommitment of the coalition, at the forefront of which\nstand the people of the United States of American and\nGreat Britain. The Iraqis will never forget their courage\nand sacrifice on our behalf.\nTo those who stood with the dictator and who\ncontinued to question to intentions of the American and\nBritish Governments in undertaking this liberation \u2014\nwe invite you to come and visit the mass graves where\nhalf a million of our citizens lie. Come and visit the\ndried-up marshes, come and visit Halabja, where\nchemicals were dropped on civilians. Come and\nexamine the lists of the disappeared, whose right to life\nwas taken from them by Saddam Hussain, and we, the\nIraqi people, will ask you why you chose to remain\nsilent. We are here today to declare that a new Iraq has\nbeen born \u2014 an Iraq in which dignity, justice and\nhuman rights are assured for all citizens, an Iraq at\npeace with its people, its neighbours and the world, an\nIraq that stands ready to regain its rightful place in the\ninternational community of free and proud nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me pleasure to\nbegin my statement by congratulating the President,\nboth personally and as representative of his country,\nSaint Lucia, on his election as President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-eighth session. Given his skills\nand experience, we are confident that he will\ncompetently lead our deliberations as we consider the\npressing global issues that face the Organization at this\ncritical time. He may be assured of my delegation\u2019s\nreadiness to fully cooperate with him in order to ensure\nthe successful fulfilment of his mandate. I wish also to\npay tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, for his\nactive and positive role and for his remarkable\ncontribution to the promotion of international\ncooperation.\nIn addition, I wish to express once again our\nappreciation and gratitude to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his tireless efforts to bring peace\nand stability to the various troubled regions throughout\nthe world. Mr. Annan deserves special tribute for his\nextraordinary performance in maintaining the integrity\nof the United Nations and its leading role in moving\nthe global agenda forward, despite the enormous\nchallenges and high risks facing the Organization and\nits personnel. The terrorist attack against the United\nNations office in Baghdad last month, which claimed\nthe lives of the Special Representative of the Secretary-\nGeneral, Sergio Vieira de Mello, and of a number of his\ncolleagues, is yet further clear testimony of those\nchallenging difficulties and immense dangers. Another\nsimilar terrorist attack occurred two days ago, and\nagain the target was the United Nations presence in\nIraq.\nFrom this rostrum, I reiterate our condemnation\nof that terrorist act and of all other similar acts that\n30\n\nhave occurred in the cities of Baghdad and Najaf.\nThose attacks claimed the lives of highly respected\nreligious leaders and symbols and other innocent\nvictims. We believe that such acts are aimed not only at\nthe underpinnings of security, of stability and of the\npeople\u2019s sense of confidence, but also at the noble\nvalues that we all seek to restore and consolidate in\nbrotherly Iraq.\nPerhaps the most appropriate and resolute\nresponse to such criminal acts is a two-track approach.\nThe United Nations, together with the international\nPowers interested in the Iraqi question who are also\nseeking to establish security and stability in Iraq,\nshould stay the course and resolutely face the\ncontinuing violence there. In the meantime, further\nefforts should focus on enabling the Iraqi people to\nconsolidate national legitimacy and to develop national\ninstitutions. In parallel, efforts for Iraq\u2019s reconstruction\nshould be intensified in order to make up for many\nlong years of deprivation, oppression, destruction and\nmismanagement painfully endured by the Iraqi people\nunder the now-defunct regime that was removed by\nconcerted international action anchored in Security\nCouncil resolutions related to Iraq\u2019s liberation.\nKuwait strongly condemns the inhuman crimes\nand practices perpetrated by the previous regime in\nIraq. The most recent manifestation of those atrocities\nwas the discovery of numerous mass-grave sites in\nvarious parts of the country. Those graves contained\nthe remains of thousands of innocent human beings \u2014\nparticularly those of Kuwaitis and third-country\nnationals \u2014 among which 33 were identified by\nforensic experts as having been prisoners who were\nexecuted by shooting in 1991 and 1992. That is further\nproof of the regime\u2019s brutality and of its total disregard\nfor international treaties and for the norms of\ninternational humanitarian law. Above and beyond the\ncrimes themselves, for the past 13 years the regime\npersistently denied any knowledge of those prisoners\u2019\nwhereabouts. It also ignored relevant decisions of the\nSecurity Council and of other international and\nregional organizations calling for its cooperation in\ndisclosing the fate of those victims, only aggravating\ntheir relatives\u2019 anguish.\nHaving said that, I should like to add that Kuwait\nwill pursue its efforts, in coordination with the United\nNations, the International Committee of the Red Cross,\nthe Tripartite Commission, the interim Coalition\nAuthority and the citizens of Iraq, to determine the fate\nof the remaining Kuwaiti and third-country prisoners\nand detainees. Furthermore, we shall help in hunting\ndown the perpetrators in order to bring them to justice\nfor the crimes they committed against those innocent,\ndefenceless victims.\nResponding to its national and legal obligations,\nKuwait joined the coalition forces in their endeavour to\nenforce Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq.\nThus, we provided all possible facilities within the\nframework of that legal structure, which eventually led\nto Iraq\u2019s salvation from an oppressive, tyrannical\nregime. Let me take this opportunity to say that we\nwelcome that regime\u2019s removal from Iraq. We\ncongratulate the brotherly people of Iraq on their\nliberation, and we wish them prosperity in a secure and\nstable Iraq.\nIn addition, Kuwait welcomes the Security\nCouncil\u2019s adoption of resolutions 1483 (2003) and\n1500 (2003), on Iraq. We also invite United Nations\nMember States to join the ongoing international efforts\nto restore security and stability to Iraq. That will help\nthe people of Iraq to rebuild their homeland and to re-\nestablish the political and constitutional institutions of\na national Government. In that regard, we emphasize\nthe central and significant role of the United Nations in\nthis political process.\nImmediately after the collapse of the former\nregime in Iraq, Kuwait reached out to the brotherly\npeople of Iraq with a wide array of humanitarian\nassistance. Our response came in the spirit of our\ncommon Arab and Islamic heritage. Kuwait rushed\nmaterial and financial aid to several local and\ninternational organizations, as well as to the United\nNations specialized agencies operating in Iraq. We also\ncontributed directly to the restoration of electrical\npower, health care, educational services and water\nsupplies to various areas in the country. In addition,\nKuwait set up a humanitarian operations centre to\nfacilitate and coordinate relief aid activities and\ninternational emergency relief efforts to deliver aid to\nIraq. Kuwait will continue its efforts to ensure the\ndelivery of all kinds of assistance, which we hope will\nalleviate the suffering of the brotherly people of Iraq.\nNow it is our fervent hope that Iraq will safely\ncross the dire straits through which it is passing and\nthat it will recover its security and stability and will\nsafeguard its independence and territorial integrity. All\nthat will enable the people of Iraq to recommit their\n31\n\nresources and energies to their country\u2019s reconstruction\nso that Iraq will reclaim its legitimate and natural\nstatus in the region and in the world. Indeed, we are\nfully confident that Iraq will overcome the challenges\nof this critical stage of its history, because it is\nendowed with enormous natural riches, a profound\ncultural heritage and skilled human resources.\nThe Government and people of Kuwait will stand\nwith Iraq at this stage and we look forward to enjoying\ngood, brotherly relations with a free and united Iraq.\nWe hope that our bilateral relations will be\ncharacterized by mutual trust, respect and good-\nneighbourliness, and governed by established treaties\nand United Nations resolutions. This will help us leave\nthe past behind and shift our focus onto building a\nbetter future that will contribute to enhancing security\nand stability in the region.\nSince the tragic events of 11 September 2001 that\nstruck the United States, the phenomenon of terrorism\nhas dominated the global agenda. Kuwait strongly\ncondemned those terrorist acts and all similar crimes\ncommitted in other countries. These are horrendous\nacts of terrorism that have created new realities on the\ninternational scene, including a universal conviction\nthat terrorism in its pernicious manifestations is\nactually an evil not exclusively associated with one\nnation, religion or culture. All of us also realize that\nthe fight against this evil is an international\nresponsibility to be borne by all Member States, not\njust one State or a certain group of States. Therefore,\nwe maintain that the United Nations remains the most\nappropriate forum for examining this issue and\ndeveloping the most effective means to combat and\neventually to stem it. To that end, the universal\nsignature, endorsement and enforcement by all Member\nStates of the 12 international agreements relating to\nterrorism would represent a real breakthrough in\nensuring the deployment of the most effective means to\ncontain and eliminate this pandemic.\nAs Kuwait firmly reiterates its categorical\nrejection of terrorism in all its forms and\nmanifestations, as well as its renunciation of all acts of\nviolence and extremism, it condemns the vicious\norchestrated campaign being waged against a sister\nState \u2014 the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia \u2014 by some\nAmerican media agencies. Instead, we commend Saudi\nArabia for its concrete and significant contributions to\nthe global campaign against terrorism, bearing in mind\nthe fact that Saudi Arabia itself has been the target of\nterrorists and has suffered as a result. Kuwait fully\nendorses all measures taken by the Saudi Government\nin its drive to eliminate terrorism and to consolidate\nregional security and stability.\nIn the same context, Kuwait will maintain its\nefforts, in coordination with the States of the region\nand the United Nations, to fight terrorism and to\nfurther strengthen the measures it has enforced in order\ncompletely to fulfil its international obligations,\nespecially those set forth in Security Council resolution\n1373 (2001).\nThirty-six years have passed since the oppressive\nIsraeli occupation of the land of the Palestinian people,\nwho continue to suffer an ongoing decline in their\neconomic and social living conditions as a result of\nIsrael\u2019s policies and practices, which contravene\ninternational and humanitarian laws and norms. Kuwait\nis following with grave concern the recent escalation in\nthe occupied Palestinian territories. Despite the intense\ninternational efforts led by the Quartet, which yielded\nthe road map for the settlement of the conflict within a\nspecific time frame with a view to the attainment by\nthe Palestinian people of their legitimate political\nrights, Israel persists in its policy of backtracking on its\ncommitments. In fact, it deliberately undermines every\npromising initiative while paying no heed to the\npotential consequences of the perpetuation of the cycle\nof violence, rising tension and instability throughout\nthe region. Against this backdrop, the question of\ndeploying an international monitoring force to ensure\nscrupulous compliance with ceasefire arrangements is\nmore pressing than ever.\nWhile Kuwait renews its commitment to fully\nsupporting the struggle of the Palestinian people to\nattain all their full legitimate political rights, including\nthe establishment of their independent State on their\nnational territory, with Jerusalem as its capital, we\ndemand that the Israeli Government commit itself to\nimplementing the resolution adopted last Friday by the\nGeneral Assembly at its tenth emergency special\nsession and reverse its decision to remove the President\nof the Palestinian Authority. In the same context, we\ndemand that the Israeli Government fulfil its\nobligations and pledges set out in relevant United\nNations resolutions, primarily Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973); the land for\npeace formula; the bilateral accords signed with the\nPalestinian Authority in the context of the peace\n32\n\nprocess; and the road map in all its provisions and\nrequirements.\nIn addition, Israel must abandon forthwith its\npolicies of isolating local communities and denying\nthem food supplies, incursions, destruction of physical\ninfrastructures, demolition of homes and arbitrary\nround-ups and arrests. Israel must also stop its\nconstruction of the separation wall and of settlements.\nIt should also release all Palestinian detainees. Recent\ndevelopments on the ground prove that these policies\nand practices will not fulfil Israel\u2019s goals. Rather, they\nwill fuel the sentiments of hostility towards Israel.\nThey will also reinforce the sense of despair and\nundermine the Palestinians\u2019 prospects for living in\nfreedom and dignity, thus forcing them to pursue the\ncourse of national struggle and resistance of\noccupation. Furthermore, Israel must ultimately\nwithdraw from all the Arab territories it occupied in\n1967 as a prerequisite for building the just, permanent\nand comprehensive peace for which we all yearn.\nAt the regional level, and in line with Kuwait\u2019s\ncompliance with the principles of the Charter of the\nUnited Nations, especially Article 2, which stresses the\nprinciple of peaceful settlement of disputes, we call on\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran and the United Arab\nEmirates to maintain their mutual visits and to deepen\nbilateral talks with a view to resolving their dispute\nover the three islands. It is our hope that the resolution\nof the current dispute will strengthen relations between\nthe two countries and the consolidation of security and\nstability in the region. In this regard, Kuwait, in its\nforthcoming chairmanship of the Gulf Cooperation\nCouncil, will spare no effort to strengthen all aspects of\npolitical, security and economic cooperation among the\nStates of the region. Furthermore, Kuwait, in\ncooperation and coordination with the United Nations\nand the regional players, will explore the activation and\ndevelopment of regional security arrangements with\ninterested countries of the region.\nToday\u2019s world is different in many ways from the\nworld of several years ago. The trade and economic\nboundaries of States are rapidly disappearing. Cultural\ninteraction and relations among various societies is\nexpanding as a result of the immense achievements in\ninformation and communications technologies.\nHowever, such technologies have had some negative\nimplications that cannot be brushed aside. Thus, we are\nnow seeing an increasing marginalization of the\nmajority of the developing countries, whose economies\nnow suffer from a growing set of problems that\njeopardize their prospects for meaningful development.\nIn an attempt to face up to these challenges,\nwhich hamper world economic growth, a series of\nUnited Nations meetings were convened to address the\nimpediments to global economic growth. Thus, the\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development, held in\nSouth Africa, and the International Conference on\nFinancing for Development, held in Mexico, developed\na framework of action for ensuring equity and fair\ninterdependence and cooperation between the North\nand the South. Also, specific guidelines and obligations\nwere set for all stakeholders to achieve a more\nequitable balance in economic relations. At this\njuncture, we would therefore call on the developed\nnations to meet their partnership obligations. These\ninclude, inter alia, adequate flows of financial and\ntechnical aid to the developing countries; the\nalleviation of the debt burden and cancellation of the\ndebts of the least developed countries; the removal of\ncustoms restrictions on flows of goods from the\ndeveloping countries into world markets; and an\nexchange of information and expertise that would help\ndeveloping countries to build and modernize their\nnational institutions.\nTo this end, Kuwait, for its part, reaffirms its\ncommitment to continue to provide development and\nfinancial assistance to developing countries. Our\nchannels will either include the United Nations\nprogrammes, funds, agencies and other multilateral\norganizations or the Kuwait Fund for Economic\nDevelopment, which has a sterling track record of\naiding and financing a wide range of development\nprojects and programmes in more than 100 developing\ncountries across the globe.\nAs we are still in the early years of a new century,\nit is our hope that all of us will draw the right lessons\nfrom our collective experiences of the past. Only\nthrough common action can humankind face the\nchallenges of the present in order to fashion a better\nfuture that offers future generations the hope of living\nin freedom and dignity.\nLet us join hands to fulfil our common vision of a\nlife in which law and order prevail \u2014 a life governed\nby the values and principles of freedom, justice and\nequality for all; a life that upholds the concept of\npartnership and cooperation as the shortest path to\nsecurity, stability and peace in the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is my great pleasure and\nhonour to address the General Assembly at its fifty-\neighth session. At the outset, allow me, Sir, to extend\nmy sincere congratulations on your election and to\nwish you every success in presiding over the Assembly\nat this session.\nEven though we entered the new millennium with\nclear resolve to work for a better future, sharing a\nvision of global solidarity and common security, which\nwe expressed in the Millennium Declaration, we are\nwitnessing an increase in tragic events, which occur\nalmost daily. The tragedy that took place on 19 August\nin Baghdad is forcing us to reconsider the true\naccomplishments and values of civilization today and\nto re-examine the connections between poverty,\ndevelopment, self-sustainability, respect for human\nrights and the quest for true progress, as enshrined in\nthe United Nations Charter.\nFully aware of all the global challenges facing us,\nwe must prepare for a long and exhausting\ncampaign   working step by step and tackling one\nproblem at a time   for poverty reduction and the\ndevelopment of underdeveloped countries, and against\nthe scourge of terrorism, organized crime and the\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, wherever\nsuch threats arise.\nThe world is yet again faced with new challenges.\nThe United Nations have yet again to make crucial\n2\n\ndecisions in response to them. Poverty, weapons\nproliferation and AIDS are among the most\ndestabilizing factors on the international scene, as is\nterrorism. I am sincerely convinced, therefore, that this\nyear's debate on all these issues, especially on the issue\nof terrorism, will pave the way towards a consensus\namong Member States on the specific measures to be\ntaken and thus invest the United Nations with new\nauthority, which is so urgently needed to counter\nthreats to international peace, health, stability and\ncollective security.\nAllow me to take this opportunity to stress the\nimportance of dialogue to resolve the most pressing\nissues of today. Dialogue is essential and, it goes\nwithout saying, only possible among those who are\nready for it. Dialogue based on mutual respect\nrepresents a key instrument for the improvement of\nrelations and cooperation among peoples and countries.\nIt is a fundamental condition for the successful\noutcome of negotiations and reconciliation of\ndifferences to reach decisions that are acceptable to all\nsides.\nWe in Bosnia and Herzegovina have learned the\nvalue of dialogue the hard way. Consider our recent\npast, during which the lack of dialogue caused\nmisunderstanding, conflicts and hostilities that resulted\nin the tragic loss of human life, the exodus of young\npeople and the devastation of the economy over the\npast decade. The entire international community not\nonly witnessed this tragedy but was called on to be\nactively involved to overcome it.\nI can only feel proud that I am addressing the\nAssembly today as the head of State of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, which the international community no\nlonger views as a crisis area. Rather, it has become a\nState that actively participates in stabilization\nprocesses in the region and throughout the world. From\nthe Central European Initiative and the South East\nEuropean Cooperation Process to United Nations\npeacekeeping operations, Bosnia and Herzegovina is\ncontributing to regional, European and world peace and\nprosperity. At the same time, committed to reforms, we\nstrive to lay the ground for overcoming the aftermath\nof recent conflicts and are devoted to respect for the\nhuman rights of all individuals and peoples, as well as\ntheir cultural, religious and other diversities.\nI would like to point out that the authorities of\nBosnia and Herzegovina are giving priority to\nadvancing the political and economic stability of the\ncountry and enhancing its international role through the\nimplementation of planned reforms. I am convinced\nthat we in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in partnership-like\ncooperation with the High Representative and other\nrepresentatives of the United Nations and international\ninstitutions, will find the best solutions for the\nimplementation of reforms and the most adequate legal\nsolutions for the realization of a faster economic\ndevelopment of the country and the creation of real\nchances for the integration of Bosnia and Herzegovina\ninto the European Union.\nIn the process of Bosnia and Herzegovina's\naccession to European integration, we have just\ncompleted discussions with the European Commission\n(EC) within the framework of the feasibility study.\nWorking on the EC's tasks has been a positive\nexperience in building partnerships with the\ninternational community. We are now entering a new\nphase with full confidence, convinced that the initiated\nprocess will result in the final fulfilment of all\nconditions for membership in the European Union\n(EU). This comes as a result of the decision of the\nBosnia and Herzegovina authorities to take their\ndestiny into their own hands and to respond to major\nchallenges such as the fight against organized crime\nand corruption, the strengthening of institutions,\nconducting legal system reforms, implementation of\nstructural reforms and reduction of the unemployment\nrate.\nWe are committed to following the path of proven\nsuccess strategies in order to overcome as soon as\npossible our difficult heritage from the past and to start\nbuilding, with mutual understanding, a modern Bosnia\nand Herzegovina. Only in this way may we pass on to\nfuture generations the message of worldwide peace and\ndevelopment, based on mutual understanding and\ntolerance.\nThis year Bosnia and Herzegovina took over the\nchairmanship of the South East European Cooperation\nProcess. We are content with the positive steps taken,\nboth in the stabilization and in the overall development\nof the Balkan region and integration of the Western\nBalkans into the Euro-Atlantic structures. I am pleased\nthat mutually harmonized agreements and joint\npriorities are being fully supported by the EU, by the\nStability Pact, by many friendly countries in the world\nand by international financial and other organizations. I\nam all the more pleased in view of the fact that the\n3\n\ncountries of the region confirm their readiness and\ncommitments to mutual cooperation and the building of\ngood neighbourly and regional relations.\nI must stress the fact that there are still many\nopen issues and incomplete tasks in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. I am convinced that Bosnia and\nHerzegovina will succeed in the process of\nstrengthening joint institutions and in establishing a\nstrong legal framework. We are committed to fulfil all\nBosnia and Herzegovina's international obligations,\nparticularly those related to cooperation with the\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the former\nYugoslavia, participation in the world's fight against\norganized crime, respect of human rights, return of\nrefugees and displaced persons, full implementation of\nproperty laws and the return of property to its rightful\nowners.\nOur absolute priority is the fight against terrorism\nand organized crime, and, at the international level, we\nare of the view that the United Nations and the Security\nCouncil should play the leading role in that fight.\nTogether with other countries, Bosnia and Herzegovina\nintends to actively tackle this issue, which represents a\nthreat to the entire civilized world. Fully committed to\nthis fight, we in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with the\nassistance of the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, which successfully completed its mission\nlast December, have established one of the most\nmodern state border services. In addition, we have\nimproved the legal framework and we are fighting\nactively against the trafficking of women and children,\nthis modern form of slavery. Our efforts have recently\nbeen recognized by the United States Government, and\nas result, we have been moved to category B.\nThe issue of missing persons is particularly\nsensitive and difficult for Bosnia and Herzegovina. We\nhave to make additional efforts, with the assistance of\nthe international community, to at least give the\nopportunity to grieving families to discover the\nwhereabouts of their loved ones, what happened to\nthem, where they were buried, and to identify their\nremains and lay them to rest with dignity.\nAllow me to point out that Bosnia and\nHerzegovina is now a much better place for business\nthan it was a year ago, due to the reforms completed\nduring this year in particular. I would like to mention\nthe example of the Bulldozer Committee that redrafted\n50 laws and regulations that were discouraging private\ninitiative and suffocating any sense for business.\nHaving created a more favourable legal framework and\nbusiness environment, Bosnia and Herzegovina has\nbecome a better place for investment opportunities and\nemployment.\nNevertheless, we must not lie back, we must\nfurther accelerate the process of economic reforms.\nThe continuation of the privatization process and\nfurther reforms of the judicial system are of utmost\nimportance for creating a more secure business\nenvironment in order to open the country to direct\nforeign investments.\nWe are in the process of rearranging and\nsimplifying the tax system through the establishment of\na single custom system and a value-added tax, thus\neliminating corruption and white-collar crime. In order\nto encourage the entire process of the creation of an\ninvestment-friendly environment in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, in February 2004 we will be hosting an\ninternational investment conference in Mostar, where\nwe will present the new economic situation in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina.\n\nFurthermore, particularly during recent days, we\nhave been finalizing the reforms of the armed forces\nand the State intelligence service, having realized that a\nmodern security system is a pre-condition for Bosnia\nand Herzegovina's full participation in common\nsecurity arrangements, through membership in the\nPartnership for Peace and the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization.\nAt this moment we attach paramount importance\nto reforms and the modernization of the educational\nsystem in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is our firm belief\nthat, by caring for the individual and by ensuring the\ncollective right to get an education in one's own\nlanguage and alphabet, we will enhance mutual\ndialogue and tolerance, in order to preserve the\nmulticultural society of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nNext year we also plan to finalize the\nreconstruction of the Old Bridge in Mostar, where we\nare planning once again to celebrate the reunion of\nboth banks of the river and its people. This is our way\nof sending a global message to all civilizations: this\nbridge is built of versatile cultural materials, it is an\nalloy of various traditions and it is the paradigm of a\n4\n\nsolution that is possible and evident despite the\nconflicts and differences in the world. I hereby invite\nyou to make use of this opportunity and make this\nbridge a symbol of unity for the next year.\nElections in Bosnia and Herzegovina were held\nalmost a year ago. This time, the international\ncommunity fully supported the election results. The\ninternational community expressed its readiness to\nsupport democratic processes in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina and we, the elected authorities, have made\nour choice through reforms that have as their aim a\nmodern Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nWe are committed to taking ownership, to bearing\nmore responsibilities. During his 16 months in office,\nthe High Representative imposed in the first eight\nmonths twice as many laws as he did in the second. We\nare pleased to note the trend of reduction of imposed\nlaws this year, but our ultimate goal is a Bosnia and\nHerzegovina that is a member of the EU. This Bosnia\nand Herzegovina has its destiny in the hands of its own\ncitizens and is on the road of no return towards\nEuropean integration, with more power in the engine of\nits own institutions and less power in the tow truck of\nthe United Nations High Representative. Above all,\nthis Bosnia and Herzegovina has a constitution cut out\nto the measure of its peoples and to each and every\ncitizen.\nAllow me to conclude by looking into the future.\nWe have presented our candidature for membership in\nthe Security Council for 2010, reaffirming our\ncommitment to build a State that may share its positive\nexperience and participate actively in the world's\npeace-building, by that time, we hope, within the\nsystem of a reformed and reinvigorated United Nations.\nWe are already participating in the United Nations\npeacekeeping operations in Ethiopia and Eritrea, the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and Timor-Leste.\nWe are ready to send our transport unit, military\nobservers and civilian police officers to Liberia.\nBy the year 2009, we are planning to fulfil the\nconditions set forth for EU membership, fully\ncommitted to the development of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina based on stability, the rule of law,\ndemocracy and a market economy. We are gradually\nbecoming recognized for our implementation of\ndemocratic and economic reforms and for harmonizing\nour priorities with international standards. Next year,\nfrom 15 to 17 May 2004 in Sarajevo, we are planning\nto host the Second Intergovernmental Conference for\nChildren in Europe and Central Asia, together with the\nGovernment of Germany and the United Nations\nChildren's Fund. The Conference is the continuation of\nregional consultations held in Berlin in 2001, and the\n2002 General Assembly special session devoted to\nchildren.\nToday, Bosnia and Herzegovina is a sustainable\nState, albeit with the generous contributions and\nassistance from the international community, the\nUnited Nations and its most prominent leading figures,\nincluding the late Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, who will\nbe remembered in Bosnia and Herzegovina as the head\nof Civil Affairs of the United Nations mission. We\nremain ever so grateful to those who lent us their hands\nin times of need and despair.\nToday, Bosnia and Herzegovina is a State well on\nits way to being part of Europe, with the ambition to\ncreate an environment where the return of refugees and\ndisplaced persons will not be halted for political or\neconomic reasons, but will be encouraged for reasons\nof economic prosperity and sustainability that will be\nachieved through the efforts of all of us.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI\nwould like to express my cordial congratulations to the\nPresident for presiding over this important session of\nthe General Assembly. I wish also to express my\ncongratulations to other members of the Bureau on\ntheir election.\nLess than 60 years ago, our founding fathers\nestablished the United Nations, with the aspiration to\npromote peace and security through cooperation and to\nmake our world a better place. The creation of this\nOrganization was in fact the manifestation of the\ninternational community's determination to prevent the\nscourge of war, which had inflicted tremendous loss\nand damage upon humankind. The United Nations was\nalso designed to promote economic, social and human\ndevelopment and assist Member States to eradicate\ninjustice and poverty.\nThese objectives and concerns remain as valid as\never and perhaps are even more relevant today. We\nbelieve it is time to take stock of recent developments\nand the utility and record of the United Nations, with a\nview to promoting the authority, efficiency and\neffectiveness of the United Nations, and recognizing its\ncentral role in addressing the challenges of our time.\nThe United States waged an unsanctioned war\nagainst Iraq with three expressed objectives: to find\nweapons of mass destruction, to fight international\nterrorism and to bring democracy to the Iraqi people.\nThe first is yet to be realized. The second has\nbackfired. And, as far as the third is concerned, the\ncollapse of a dictatorship is a highly welcome\ndevelopment in the region, but, as history has shown,\nsocial change, including the democratization of a\nsociety, can only be brought about from within, and\ncannot be imported in tandem with tank columns. In\nour view, callous indifference to the negative\n28\n \nconsequences of the invasion of Iraq to the conduct of\ninternational relations and a lack of full understanding\nof the post-war situation in Iraq, particularly the social\nand the cultural complexities of Iraqi society, have\ncreated both an international predicament and a source\nof instability at our borders.\nAs a neighbouring State, Iran adopted a policy of\nself-restraint during the war in Iraq and has continued\nto adopt a constructive approach to the current situation\nin that country by calling on the occupying Powers to\nallow the immediate transfer of Iraqi sovereignty to the\nIraqi people and to withdraw their troops. We welcome\nand support the establishment of the Iraqi Governing\nCouncil and the Council of Ministers and call for\ngranting a central and clear-cut role to the United\nNations in the restoration of Iraqi sovereignty and the\nconstitutional process. We wish to promote unity and\ngreater respect for stability and security among various\nethnic and religious groups in Iraq, and encourage and\nsupport the swift setting in motion of a constitutional\nand institutional process, with a view to establishing a\ndemocratic and fully representative Government by and\nfor the people of Iraq. We urge respect for the national\nunity, independence and territorial integrity of Iraq and\nthe provision of relief emergency assistance to the\npeople of Iraq.\nPending the restoration of sovereignty and\nauthority to the people of Iraq, the occupying Powers\nhave the legal responsibility under applicable\ninternational law to provide for the welfare of the\npeople under occupation, particularly their security. In\nthis context, the United Nations should be allowed to\nplay a central role in laying the ground work, on an\nurgent basis, in assisting the Iraqi people to establish a\ndemocratic and representative Government and in\nsupervising the transfer of authority to them. The\ninternational community, in general, and Iraq's\nneighbours, in particular, will undoubtedly lend their\nfull support to the United Nations in this endeavour.\nI would like to express once again my\ncondolences to the Secretary-General and the United\nNations community as a whole for the loss of a brave\nservant of the nations, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, and\nother United Nations personnel in the terrorist bombing\nof the United Nations headquarters in Iraq. The people\nand Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran also\nsympathize with the people of Iraq over the loss of\nanother man of peace, Ayatollah Mohammad Baqer al-\nHakim, in a separate terrorist bombing in Iraq.\nThe violence against and the killing of innocent\nPalestinian people by the Israeli Army have become a\ndaily occurrence, and prospects for a viable peace are\nsteadily diminishing. The Palestinian people live under\nbrutal occupation and oppression with no hope for\nrelief, let alone peace and prosperity. The policy of the\nSharon Government of reoccupying Palestinian cities\nand using military force to further terrorize the\nPalestinian people has exacerbated the situation and\nadded to the despair and frustration of ordinary people.\nThe international community has a major responsibility\nto take effective measures in alleviating the suffering\nof the Palestinian people.\nThe recent decision of the Israeli regime to expel\nPresident Arafat from his homeland has outraged the\ninternational community, in general, and the Muslim\nworld, in particular. I am confident that the free and\ncivilized world will continue to reject and condemn\nsuch a move by Israel. It is regrettable that the United\nStates, last week, once again and for the thirty-sixth\ntime, resorted to the veto to block the adoption of a\ndraft resolution.\nOn behalf of the people and the Government of\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran, I wish to take this\nopportunity to express our satisfaction over the steady\nimprovement of the situation in Afghanistan under the\nleadership of President Karzai and his Government. At\nthe same time, we are concerned about problems such\nas the regrouping of remnants of the Taliban and Al\nQaeda, the paucity of international assistance and the\nincrease in opium poppy cultivation. Unless the\ninternational community is more forthcoming in\nassisting the Afghan people and Government, recent\nachievements in Afghanistan may be jeopardized.\nWe have a great stake in the return of full\nnormality and stability to Afghanistan. In this area, we\nhave strongly supported the central role of the United\nNations in helping the Afghans to rebuild their own\ncountry, and we believe that the United Nations should\ncontinue to play this role for the foreseeable future.\nTerrorism is a global phenomenon that requires a\nglobal response. Fighting terrorism requires a\nmultifaceted approach that goes well beyond a simple\nfocus on law and order and also addresses its\nunderlying causes. A unilateral and one-dimensional\napproach, based merely on the use of force, may\nneutralize some threats and bring some psychological\ncomfort to those who seek revenge in response to\n29\n \nterrorist acts, but few would regard that as a serious\nmethods of uprooting international terrorism.\nAny attempt to link terrorism to a specific\nreligion or culture is prejudicial, politically motivated\nand thus unacceptable. No religion authorizes its\nadherents to kill innocent people, whatever the\nobjective of such acts might be.\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran condemns terrorism\nin all its forms and manifestations. Iran has done more\nthan its fair share to effectively combat terrorism. In\nthe heat of the military intervention in Afghanistan and\nin the wake of the Taliban collapse, thousands of\nindividuals were denied entry into Iran; more than\n2,300 individuals with false or no travel documents\nwere deported and hundreds of suspects were arrested,\ninterrogated and handed over to their countries of\nnationality or residence; and lists of such persons were\nbrought to the attention of the relevant United Nations\nofficials and bodies. Iran continues to cooperate in\nserious and long-term efforts to combat terrorism in a\ncomprehensive, non-discriminatory and non-selective\nmanner   efforts that do not pick and choose between\ngood and bad, or useful, terrorists.\nWeapons of mass destruction are among the most\npotent threats to peace and security at the regional and\nglobal levels. The Chemical Weapons Convention,\nBiological Weapons Convention and the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) are the\nresults of our collective wisdom in our efforts to\neliminate the threat of chemical and biological\nweapons and the spread of nuclear weapons. We\nbelieve that more needs to be done. We should do more\nto make these basic international instruments universal.\nWe should also do more to strengthen verification of\ntheir implementation. Finally, we should all work\ncollectively, as mandated by the International Court of\nJustice, to move towards the total elimination of\nnuclear weapons.\nBy adhering to all of these three instruments as an\noriginal party, my country has shown its determination\nto work towards the complete eradication of weapons\nof mass destruction from the Earth. Our commitment to\ninternational regimes on weapons of mass destruction\nlies not merely in our contractual obligations but, more\nimportantly, in our religious convictions and historical\nexperience. No country has suffered as acutely as mine\nfrom the tragic scars left from being victims of such\nweapons, particularly against the backdrop of a\ncomplacent international environment. We are\nconvinced that the pursuit of nuclear weapons and\nother weapons of mass destruction will not only fail to\nprovide deterrence or enhance security and influence,\nbut will only increase vulnerability. Thus, I can state\ncategorically that for all these reasons, weapons of\nmass destruction have no place in the defensive\nstrategy of my country. We believe the only option is to\nwork actively towards a global and regional ban on\nthese weapons, and we have thus spared no effort in\nthis regard.\nHowever, the efforts to ban, or strengthen the\nban, on weapons of mass destruction should not\nprovide any excuse for denying States the right to\ndevelop technology for peaceful purposes.\nUnfortunately, the political pressure against the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran to relinquish its inalienable right to\ndevelop peaceful nuclear technology is mounting,\nwhile some nuclear weapon States continue to test and\ndevelop advanced tactical nuclear weapons\nprogrammes. Furthermore, in defiance of international\ncalls to adhere to the NPT, Israel is continuing, with\nimpunity, its clandestine development of sophisticated\nnuclear weapons and their delivery systems. All NPT\nReview and Extension conferences have called for the\nsuspension and freezing of Israel's tactical weapons\nand nuclear programmes, which are the real threats to\ninternational peace and security. They are both\nconsidered to be in contravention with the letter and\nspirit of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.\nIran's nuclear programme is solely for peaceful\npurposes, specifically for the planned production of\n7,000 megawatts of electricity by 2020 for Iran's\neconomic development. Iran will vigorously pursue its\npeaceful nuclear programme and will not give in to\nunreasonable, discriminatory and selective demands\nthat go beyond the requirements of non-proliferation\nunder existing International Atomic Energy Agency\ninstruments. At the same time, Iran does not have a\nnuclear weapons programme, nor does it intend to\nembark on one. Thus, we have nothing to hide, and in\nprinciple have no problem with the Additional Protocol.\nWe are eager to ensure that this step will be utilized\nsolely to enhance confidence and remove all doubts\nabout the peaceful nature of our nuclear programme.\n\n\n \nIn facing global challenges, no possibility other\nthan mutual cooperation through the United Nations\nwill be conducive to lasting and effective solutions.\nThe democratic process advocated at all levels within\nthe international community needs also to be reflected\nwithin the United Nations system. The General\nAssembly should play a more active role in global\naffairs. A more representative and democratic Security\nCouncil would mean a more efficient United Nations\n  the kind of organization we should all want and\nwork for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, my\ndelegation congratulates you on your assumption of\nthis high office. We are confident that, given your vast\nexperience and consummate diplomatic skill, you will\nbe able to successfully manage the proceedings of this\nsession of the General Assembly. I also wish to express\nour appreciation for the excellent and effective manner\nin which your predecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, conducted\nthe work of the fifty-seventh session. In the same vein,\nI would like to commend the Secretary-General for his\nefforts to strengthen the role of the United Nations in\nresolving the world\u2019s burning issues.\nAllow me also to pay tribute to the international\nworkers who have recently given their lives in service\nto the United Nations in Iraq. In particular, we reiterate\nour condolences to the Secretary-General and the\nOrganization for the tragic death of Sergio Vieira de\nMello, that outstanding servant of the United Nations.\nAs we condemn terrorism and violence in all their\nforms and manifestations, we honour the memory of\nAnna Lindh, the slain Foreign Minister of Sweden,\nwho dedicated her life to the pursuit of peace,\ndevelopment and social progress.\nWe appear here before this Assembly every year\nto renew our vow to the United Nations as the main\nguarantor of international peace and security. The\nspeeches that we deliver here are a distilled expression\nof our collective passion for and conviction about the\nideals that the United Nations stands for.\nYet, at times, as was the case with the war on\nIraq, the United Nations gets sidelined and the unique\nlegitimacy of its authority undermined through\nunilateral actions. Such actions produced a general\nfeeling of fear and uncertainty, especially among the\nsmall and weak nations of the world. This is why the\ncentral theme that runs through nearly all the speeches\nat this session is the call for a return to multilateral\ndialogue, persuasion and collective action as the only\nappropriate approach to resolving the many conflicts\nfacing the international community. Being a small\ncountry, Namibia echoes this call. Multilateralism must\nbe the basis of global security, if smaller countries are\nnot to feel that they are at the mercy of stronger ones.\nBut, as recent events have demonstrated, big Powers,\nlike the smaller ones, also need a multilateral\nframework as a more reassuring environment for the\nexecution of foreign policy.\nWe cannot fail to re-emphasize the inseparable\nlink between international security and economic\ndevelopment. Therefore, the Organization must uphold\nthe commitments made in the field of economic\ndevelopment, especially the important pledges made at\nthe Millennium Summit and contained in the\nMillennium Declaration.\nIn that Declaration, world leaders committed\nthemselves to help lift half of the world\u2019s poor out of\nmisery and deprivation by the year 2015. We are\ntalking here of 1.5 billion people around the world who\n10\n\nare today victims of abject poverty and 800 million\nwho are starving. Still more, we are talking about the\n900 million adults worldwide who are illiterate.\nThe tragedy is that this human misery is acquiring\ndeepening and broadening dimensions at a time when\nhuman ingenuity is ever enlarging the horizons of\npossibilities of doing away with this terrible scourge of\nextreme poverty and deprivation. Clearly, therefore, the\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration is a race\nagainst time. Failure to act now, and to do so with a\nsense of urgency, will mean that we, especially the rich\nof this world, have failed to rise to the moral and\npolitical challenge, which is to protect that most sacred\nof all human rights, the right to life.\nNamibia is fully committed to the implementation\nof the Millennium Declaration. To this end, we allocate\n23 per cent of our annual national budget to education\nand 15 per cent to health. In this commitment to invest\nin our people, we have proceeded from the premise that\na fundamental way to address the problem of poverty is\nto improve the productive competitiveness of our\neconomy, and that improving that competitiveness is\ndependant on the rapid increase in the knowledge,\nskills and capacities of the people, with a view to\nempowering them to be able to escape from the trap of\npoverty. Skills in the field of information technology\nare a critical element of our human resources\ndevelopment programme.\nThe other urgent challenge, spelled out in the\nMillennium Declaration, is the fight against the AIDS\npandemic. Namibia is devoting considerable resources\nand attention to this seemingly daunting battle to\ncontain the spread and limit the impact of this epidemic\non our society. In this effort, we are working with other\ncountries, relevant United Nations agencies, the private\nsector and members of civil society. In the context of\nthis battle, the plight of AIDS orphans is given priority.\nHowever, there is a need for more generous\ncontributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,\nTuberculosis and Malaria.\nIn the pursuit of Millennium Development Goals,\nNamibia is, furthermore, working closely with its\npartners in the Southern African Development\nCommunity (SADC) to implement a number of key\nregional projects. One of these is a major power\nproject, involving the power utilities of Angola,\nBotswana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\nSouth Africa and Namibia.\nSimilarly, Namibia, together with Angola,\nBotswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe, has embarked on\none of the world\u2019s largest regional wildlife\nconservation and tourism development projects. The\ngeographical scope of this area cuts across the\nterritories of all five countries and covers\napproximately 278,000 square kilometres.\nWe would like, therefore, to reassure the\nSecretary-General that Namibia has, indeed, started in\nearnest on the implementation of the Millennium\nDeclaration and is staying the course. However, as I\nsaid earlier, there is still a great need for additional\nresources so that we can intensify our efforts aimed at\ndevelopment and poverty eradication.\nFor more than a decade now, the overwhelming\nmajority of Member States, including Namibia, have\nbeen calling for the reform of the institutions of the\nOrganization, especially the Security Council.\nAt the time of the founding of the United Nations\nin 1945, the Organization consisted of only 51 Member\nStates. That number has now grown to 191 sovereign\nStates. But the structure of the United Nations has\nremained in some respects unchanged.\nThe Security Council needs to become\ndemocratic and more representative \u2014 allowing other\nregions and States to be represented. There is a broad\nconsensus that by making it a democratic body, and\nmore representative, we would give the Security\nCouncil greater legitimacy and that that, in turn, would\nmean more effective United Nations machinery.\nThis call for reform is in line with the principle of\ndemocratic governance so often demanded of the\ndeveloping countries by, among others, some of the\nPowers that occupy permanent seats in the Security\nCouncil.\nWe welcome the fact that the Secretary-General\nhas taken on board the reform of the United Nations,\nand that it is one of the higher priorities on his agenda.\nWe have noted with great interest his plan to set up a\npanel of eminent personalities to look into the reform\nprocess and recommend ways of effecting such a\nreform.\nOne of the issues that underlines the need for the\nurgent reform of the Security Council is the pathetic\ninability of that organ to bring the authority of the\nUnited Nations to bear on the situation in the Middle\nEast. The unrelenting carnage that is taking place in\n\n\nthat region has not compelled the Powers that be to\naccept the fact that that situation constitutes a threat to\ninternational peace and security. Because of a lack of\npolitical will in the Security Council, there has been no\nability to act collectively to put a stop to the carnage.\nThe continued occupation of the Palestinian\nterritory exacerbates frustration and despair among the\nPalestinians. It follows, therefore, that the end of the\noccupation and the establishment of a Palestinian State,\nexisting side by side with Israel, is key to peace and\nstability in that region.\nThe implementation of the Security Council\u2019s\nplan for Western Sahara would have closed the chapter\non decolonization in Africa. The right of the people of\nWestern Sahara to self-determination and independence\nis a Charter obligation that we cannot shirk.\nWe hail the efforts of the Economic Community\nof West African States in Liberia and welcome the\nestablishment of the United Nations Mission in that\ncountry. Guided by our commitment to African\nsolidarity and given the resolve of the African Union to\ncontribute to the maintenance of international peace\nand security, Namibia has decided to contribute troops\nto the United Nations Mission in Liberia.\nGeographic proximity is not a matter of choice.\nWe abhor the continued imposition of the United States\nembargo against the people of Cuba, and call on the\ninternational community to demand the immediate\nlifting of that embargo.\nIn conclusion, I would like to stress the vital\nimportance of international cooperation by all\nstakeholders in our effort to realize the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals. In order to reduce the scourge of\npoverty and underdevelopment, developing countries\nneed access to the markets of developed countries.\nThere is, therefore, an urgent need to overcome\nthe impasse which has developed as result of the\nfailure of the World Trade Organization Ministerial\nConference at Canc\u00fan. We need to emphasize that\nurgent need. We call on the developed countries to\ndemonstrate a spirit of compromise in line with their\nundertakings at the Millennium Summit.\nFurthermore the implementation of the decisions\ntaken at the Monterrey Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment must not be allowed to become a dead\nletter. The promise made by world leaders at the\nMillennium Summit to give globalization a human face\nshould also be given practical expression.\nIn short, the vision of a bright and prosperity-\nenhancing new Millennium must not be allowed to\nbecome a mirage or a dream that could not be realized.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is with a deep sense of\npride and pleasure that my delegation congratulates\nyou, Sir, on your unanimous election to the presidency\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session. You\nhave done the entire Caribbean region proud. Your own\ncountry, Saint Lucia, one of the smallest States\nMembers of this Organization, can feel especially\nproud. We are confident that, given the combination of\nyour vast experience, solid leadership skills and\ncharismatic personality, this session will go down in\nhistory as one of the most dynamic and constructive for\nall States, large and small.\nMy delegation pays tribute to your illustrious\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan of the Czech Republic, for\nhis enlightened and innovative conduct of this body\nduring the previous session.\nMy delegation also expresses profound sympathy\nto the Government and the people of Saint Lucia on the\nrecent passing of your predecessor, Sir, as Minister for\nForeign Affairs, The Honourable George Odlum.\nEach succeeding President of the General\nAssembly inherits an agenda of recurring resolutions\nand outcome documents adopted at the many\ninternational summit-level conferences during the past\n4\n\ndecade. My delegation remains confident that your\nadministration, Sir, will put implementation concerns\nhigh on the development agenda.\nWhen the United Nations was founded 58 years\nago, the focus was basically on world peace and\nsecurity in the aftermath of the devastating effects of\nthe Second World War. Security concerns have once\nagain taken centre stage in current international affairs,\nbut they should not displace the consideration of\nimportant issues on the economic and social agenda.\nMy Government remains totally committed to the\nglobal fight against terrorism and the perpetrators of\nviolence. In this regard, it will certainly take all\nnecessary actions to ensure that Grenada is an active\npartner in this common struggle.\nThe proliferation of transnational criminal\nactivities is the most vivid example of the negative\neffect of open borders in a globalized world. The illicit\ntrade in weapons and drugs, money-laundering and\ntrafficking in women and children clearly need to be\ntackled in a more organized manner. A truly effective\nglobal response to these and other threats requires that\nall States act in concert with each other. In this regard,\nmy Government, despite its limited resources, is\nfulfilling its commitment.\nSince the events of 11 September 2001, Grenada\nhas ratified or acceded to all relevant international\ntreaties and conventions on terrorism and related\nactivities. All the appropriate domestic legislation has\nbeen enacted.\nMy delegation is convinced that the elimination\nof terrorism alone will not guarantee social and\neconomic stability. It will not solve the many problems\nassociated with underdevelopment, poverty, hunger,\ndisease, illiteracy, and unemployment \u2014 all of which\ngive rise to hopelessness and pose a threat to peace and\nsecurity.\nThe holding of the recent meeting here at the\nUnited Nations to assess the implementation of the\nDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS made clear\nthat the pandemic is continuing to take a heavy toll,\nespecially in sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean.\nAs the many leaders who took part in the debate\nsaid, much remains to be done in the fight against this\ndreadful scourge if the Declaration of Commitment\ntarget is to be met by 2005. Thus, certain critical areas\nin this fight, such as education on prevention and care\ntargeted especially to young people, mobilization of\nresources by engaging civil society including the\nbusiness sector, and access to affordable medicine are\nabsolutely essential.\nFighting HIV/AIDS is both a medical and a socio-\neconomic problem, with far-reaching implications for\nsmall developing countries such as my own. Caring for\nthe ever-increasing numbers with the virus, together\nwith educating and sensitizing the general public on\nprevention issues and responsible behaviour, has\nbecome burdensome, in terms of both human and\nfinancial resources. Partnership and support from the\ndeveloped countries will be welcomed.\nMy delegation is convinced that the eradication\nof poverty and its related ills is central to social and\neconomic stability. Poverty will not simply disappear\nthrough passionate pleas and eloquent statements, but\nthrough genuine collaborative and cooperative efforts.\nMy Government is acutely aware of our responsibility,\nas a sovereign and independent nation to provide for\nour citizens.\nThe efforts of the Caribbean Community\n(CARICOM) to establish a single market and economy\nwith a view to harnessing and efficiently utilizing the\nlimited resources of the region, improving\ncompetitiveness, productivity and general cooperation,\nmust be applauded.\nThe more developed countries must speedily\ncome to the rescue of the needy developing countries\nby providing tangible and meaningful technical,\neconomic and other forms of assistance \u2014 assistance\nthat will have a positive impact on the lives of millions\nin the developing world.\nIt is for this reason that we will continue to\nclamour for reforms within the global trading system,\nand especially within the framework of the World\nTrade Organization (WTO), particularly as it relates to\ntrade in agriculture and in other services.\nMy delegation calls for a substantial reduction of\nthe subsidies afforded to farmers in the more developed\nand industrialized economies, and also for the removal\nof non-tariff and other technical barriers to the export\nof our commodities.\nIn our efforts to diversify our economies and to\nenhance our revenue-earning options, we need the\nflexibility to develop our service sector free from\npressures and conditionalities, to add value to our\n5\n\nprimary products, and to be able to export our exotic\nfruits and vegetables.\nOur small and vulnerable economies can become\nviable if the right conditions are created to facilitate the\ntrade of our products on the world market.\nThe failure of the recently concluded WTO\nMinisterial Meeting in Canc\u00fan, Mexico, to reach a\ncompromise on issues of extreme importance is a cause\nfor concern. The outcome has confirmed, in\nunequivocal terms, that the divide between rich and\npoor nations continues to widen.\nMy country endorses the idea that the United\nNations must continue its work to ensure that\ndemocracy and respect for basic human rights prevail\nin all civil societies. However, this body should, as a\nmatter of principle, also seek to ensure that fair, just\nand morally correct actions and decisions are taken on\nequally important matters.\nThe people of the Republic of Cuba continue to\nlive under a unilaterally imposed financial, commercial\nand economic blockade, as they have for more than 40\nyears. This has resulted in great human and material\nlosses, and in many personal traumatic experiences.\nGrenada joins the overwhelming majority in the United\nNations and calls for the unconditional lifting of those\nsanctions.\nWe believe that universally accepted norms and\nvalues and economic growth and prosperity can\nflourish only under normal circumstances. The people\nof Cuba need that chance.\nThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict continues to\nescalate, and every effort must be made to return to the\nroad map, as it remains the best hope for the resolution\nof the problem.\nSimilarly, my delegation is concerned about the\nnegative effect of civil unrest and tensions around the\nglobe, particularly in Iraq, Liberia and the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo. My Government supports all\nefforts, actions and initiatives to ensure that normalcy\nreturns to the countries and regions concerned. We urge\npatience, understanding and tolerance in dealing with\nthese difficult situations.\nThe United Nations has been seized with the\nreform of the Security Council and with the\nrevitalization of the General Assembly for a number of\nyears. When the United Nations was founded 58 years\nago, the membership was 51; today there are 191\nMember States.\nMuch has changed in the geopolitical dynamics\nof the world, which the United Nations represents and\nreflects. Therefore, there is a need for structural and\nfunctional changes in the Security Council and the\nGeneral Assembly, two of the main organs of greatest\nimportance in the world body.\nAt the beginning of this intervention, I alluded to\nthe tardiness in the implementation of collective\ndecisions, particularly on the subject of the sustainable\ndevelopment of small island developing States. A total\nof six summit conferences have been held over a period\nof 11 years to address the issues of the environment\nand development in those vulnerable island States.\nDonor countries have not fulfilled their end of\nthat partnership. Official development assistance\ncontinues to fall, and multilateral aid has dropped\nsignificantly. Ten years later, another high-level\nmeeting is scheduled to take place in Mauritius in 2004\nto review the Barbados Declaration and Programme of\nAction.\nMy delegation is hopeful that the occasion will be\nused to ensure that the priority issues facing small\nStates will be addressed in a way that gives optimism\nto the millions whose lives depend on a commitment to\nthe following issues: improving their preparedness for,\nand recovery from, natural and environmental\ndisasters; addressing the problem of climate change\nand sea-level rise, which could submerge low-lying\nnations in the Caribbean and the Pacific; preventing\nworsening shortages of potable water; developing solar\nand renewable energy to lessen dependence on\nexpensive imported oil; and managing growth in\ntourism to protect the environmental and cultural\nintegrity of our nations.\nMy delegation\u2019s appeal to this session of the\nGeneral Assembly is for all stakeholders, including the\nmultilateral financial institutions, demonstrate their\ntotal commitment to the entire process in order that\nefforts to implement outstanding important\ncommitments can be finalized.\nDespite the uncertainty over adequate funding for\nimplementation, my delegation remains confident, Mr.\nPresident, that, with your ability to lead and build\nconsensus, this fifty-eighth session will become known\nas the General Assembly of implementation.\n6\n\nAs Secretary-General Kofi Annan recently stated:\n\u201cWe all live on the same planet, buffeted by the\nsame winds, influenced by the same currents of\nchange. But instead of acting on what unites\nus \u2026 we allow a chasm to persist between us \u2026\nWe need to mend this great divide with a new\nfabric of solidarity\u201d.\nMy delegation is convinced that we have the\nopportunity to build and develop this new kind of\nsolidarity and partnership between rich and poor, big\nand small, powerful and weak, at this session of the\nGeneral Assembly. The opportunity is ours to embrace\nor to lose.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr.\nPresident, you have the honour and privilege of guiding\nthe work of the General Assembly at a time when the\nUnited Nations is at a crossroads. The international\nsituation is marked today by doubt, anguish and\ndisillusionment. Faced with the many conflicts and acts\nof terrorism that beset our world, and with the constant\ndisquieting increase in poverty, we must acknowledge\nthat the end of ideological confrontation did not bring\nthe world either peace or the development so hoped for\nby the founding fathers of this Organization. Therefore,\nin conveying my heartfelt and warm congratulations to\nyou on your election to the presidency of the fifty-\neighth regular session, I would like in particular to\nconvey my wishes for courage and success in\ndischarging this noble mission and assure you of the\nsupport of my country, Benin.\nMy delegation would also like to convey a well-\ndeserved tribute, to your predecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan,\nand to congratulate him on the results obtained during\nhis presidency in defining modalities for implementing\nthe outcomes of the major conferences held under the\naegis of the United Nations.\nAllow me also to congratulate, in particular, the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on the courage,\nskill and resolve with which he is guiding our\nOrganization, an irreplaceable instrument for the\npromotion and maintenance of world peace.\nMy delegation is grateful to him for his constancy\nin dealing with events that shook our universal\nOrganization during this year. He understood how to\nbring the necessary clear-sightedness, with his\nunshakeable faith in the ability of the international\ncommunity, to provide a concerted response to urgent\nproblems of our time while rejecting any confusion of\nroles. In so doing he saved our Organization from scorn\nand collapse.\nWhenever the United Nations has been called into\nquestion, faced with a challenge to its very existence, it\nhas stood up and reaffirmed its usefulness in managing\nsituations as the guarantor of international law.\nThe terrorist attacks against the United Nations\nheadquarters in Baghdad, which caused many\ncasualties, profoundly shocked and enraged the people\nand Government of Benin. The United Nations does\nnot deserve this kind of gratuitous barbarity perpetrated\nagainst its staff, who are devoted to the cause of\nrebuilding Iraq.\nBenin reiterates its sincere condolences to the\nfamily of Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello as well as to the\n14\n\nfamilies of all the other victims of the explosion. We\nonce again convey to them our solidarity and support.\nMy country reiterates to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, and his associates our admiration for\nthe courage and conviction with which, every day, they\ndo their jobs. This act should not shake their firm\ndetermination to defend the cause of humanity, and\nshould be a new source of commitment to attain the\ngoals of the United Nations.\nOur support for the United Nations and the\nSecretary-General is based on Benin\u2019s commitment to\nmultilateralism, which is and must remain the linchpin\nfor the new order that the international community is\nstriving to build.\nIf there is one area in which our Organization has\nmade some progress in strengthening its effectiveness,\nit is in the prevention, management and settlement of\narmed conflicts. It has given real meaning to its action\nin this area by clearly defining modalities for\nimplementing peacekeeping operations.\nMy country endorses the conclusions and\nrecommendations of the Secretary-General on conflict\nprevention, particularly in the areas of poverty\neradication, transparency in the area of arms, the fight\nagainst the proliferation of small arms and light\nweapons and weapons of mass destruction and the\npeaceful settlement of disputes.\nThe gravity of the situation prevailing in Africa\nmakes the continent a central concern of the\ninternational community. Given the seriousness of\nAfrica\u2019s problems, the United Nations and its Member\nStates owe it to themselves to step up their support for\nAfrican initiatives to reverse negative tendencies and to\navoid any prolonged destabilization of the continent.\nAt its recent summit held in Maputo,\nMozambique, the African Union gave a forceful\ndemonstration of its resolve to acquire the means to\ntackle its problems. The conference elected all the\nsenior officials of the African Union Commission. The\nnew team should strive to develop and maintain\nrelations of partnership with the world, based on\nAfrica\u2019s priorities. Benin hopes that this new team will\nenjoy the trust and support of the international\ncommunity in order to restore peace on the continent\nby eliminating various pockets of tension and through\nthe promotion and implementation of development\nprogrammes.\nWe also commend the work done in the\nframework of the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s\nDevelopment (NEPAD), which embodies the hope for\nthe revitalization of the continent through combined\nsynergies produced by implementation of the main\npoints of this programme, which is based upon\nconsensus.\nThe importance accorded by the G-8 to the\npromotion of peace and stability in Africa is an\nimportant step forward. This new commitment will\ngive Africa the means to contain the many conflicts\nand latent crises that are fraught with serious danger\nand unimaginable consequences. Benin is prepared to\ncooperate to establish this work plan so that by 2010\nAfrica will have an inter-African peacekeeping force,\nan essential instrument for political stability, without\nwhich Africa would be unable to tackle urgent tasks of\neconomic and social development. The Security\nCouncil missions to Central Africa and West Africa in\nJune and July this year highlighted the crucial need to\nhave this mechanism as a permanent presence.\nDevelopments in Africa since our fifty-seventh\nsession, and the facts gathered on the ground by the\nCouncil missions reaffirm one unavoidable fact, that\nthe effective mobilization and rapid deployment of\ntroops to the field is decisive in managing armed\nconflicts in Africa, as indeed it is everywhere else on\nour planet.\nThe speedy reaction of the international\ncommunity was crucial in the case of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire,\nwhere Operation Licorne and the deployment of the\ncontingent of the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) and the United Nations\nMission in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire (MINUCI), made it possible\nto help warring brothers to silence their arms and\nembark on a dialogue in order to preserve the territorial\nintegrity of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\nThe restoration of calm should not lead us to\nunderestimate the seriousness of the situation in C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire, where the political crisis is far from over.\nMajor problems remain to be resolved, and it is\nimportant that an international military presence be\nmaintained in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire in order to maintain\nconditions conducive to dialogue regarding\nimplementation of the Linas-Marcoussis agreements\nfor a return to normality.\nFurthermore, the rapid reaction by the Central\nAfrican States and Nigeria made it possible to put an\n15\n\nend to the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Sao Tome and Principe and to\nreturn to power the democratically elected President.\nLikewise, just a few weeks ago in Guinea-Bissau,\nimmediate action and initiatives taken by ECOWAS\nprompted the perpetrators of the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat to enter\ninto a negotiating process aimed at a short transition\nleading up to the organization of presidential and\nlegislative elections.\nThe authorization to send a multinational force\nand a United Nations stabilization force to Liberia,\nunder Chapter VII of the Charter, gave a clear signal of\nthe international community\u2019s determination to end the\nconflict there. The impact of these steps is very\nencouraging, and we welcome the signing, in Accra on\n18 August this year, of the Comprehensive Peace\nAgreement.\nRecent political developments in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo have continuously highlighted\nthe importance of the need to hold an international\nconference on the situation in the Great Lakes region.\nThe complexity of phenomena in Africa requires\nthe Secretary-General to maintain an ongoing dialogue\nwith African leaders and to adopt common approaches\nto relevant issues. That is why Benin welcomes the\nestablishment of the Office and the appointment of an\nUnder-Secretary-General as the Special Adviser on\nAfrica.\nThe implementation of the New Partnership for\nAfrica\u2019s Development (NEPAD), a genuinely African\ninitiative, has made significant progress this year. It has\nbecome increasingly detailed in programme design and\nin its specific projects for agriculture, the environment,\nenergy and information and communications\ntechnologies. The involvement of civil society has been\neffective in expanding the social basis of NEPAD and\nas a way of involving peoples in its implementation.\nBenin urgently appeals to the international community\nto enhance its support for NEPAD, as it did in Tokyo in\nthe context of the Third Tokyo International\nConference on African Development.\nIn this regard, it is important that the United\nNations operational activities be buttressed by\nstrategies based on effective partnership with all\nstakeholders in the development process. They must\nhelp implement concrete projects that have a real\nimpact on the living and working conditions of peoples\nwith a view to poverty eradication. Indeed, the annual\nrise in the number of poor people in the world has\nbecome increasingly distressing. It makes us question\never more deeply the current world order and the\nsincerity of the determination of the international\ncommunity \u2014 in particular, that of the development\ninstitutions and the rich countries \u2014 to combat poverty\nand to promote genuine sustainable development.\nIt is true that the absence of democracy,\ncorruption and poor governance are tragic scourges in\nthat they exacerbate poverty and impede development.\nThere is no doubt, however, that the least developed\ncountries have undertaken extremely courageous\neconomic and political reforms at the cost of enormous\nsacrifices made by their populations. That is why we\nremain concerned by the low rate of implementation of\nthe Brussels Programme of Action for the Least\nDeveloped Countries and call on the international\ncommunity and our bilateral and multilateral partners\nto demonstrate greater solidarity and responsibility. My\nGovernment strongly favours a substantial increase in\nresources made available to the various assistance\nfunds, in particular the United Nations Capital\nDevelopment Fund, which is working to eliminate\npoverty.\nThe Fifth Ministerial Conference of the World\nTrade Organization (WTO) ended less than a month\nago in Canc\u00fan. My country, Benin, which is the\nChairman of the Coordination Bureau for the Least\nDeveloped Countries, attended with the firm\ndetermination to establish a candid and constructive\ndialogue with the developed countries. The goal was to\nfind a solution to the dysfunctional free trade system,\nwhich prevents the developing countries, particularly\nthe least developed among them, from enjoying their\ncomparative advantages in the agricultural sector. The\nsectoral initiative on cotton introduced by Benin,\nBurkina Faso, Mali and Chad targeted that specific\nissue.\nHistory will record the Conference as a failure.\nMy delegation nevertheless believes that, despite the\ndifficulties, Canc\u00fan moved the negotiations forward. It\nwas an opportunity for the least developed countries to\nstate some of their concerns, in particular those related\nto the practice of subsidizing non-competitive\nagricultural producers. This practice is literally\nstrangling the cotton growers of the underdeveloped\ncountries, particularly in West Africa.\n16\n\nBenin should like to reopen discussions so that\nthe trade negotiations begun in Doha can effectively\noffer new prospects for the development of the least\ndeveloped countries. We must establish transparent\npricing on the world market and open up markets in\norder to allow competitive countries to produce and\nsell their products at remunerative prices. This is of\ntremendous importance to African cotton-producing\ncountries, because the future of a sector that has been\ndeveloped at great cost, with the assistance of the\ninternational community, is at stake. Our Organization\nwould gain in credibility if it could find a way to\nguarantee our peoples their right to subsistence.\nIndeed, who on this Earth has never worn a\ncotton shirt, dress or loincloth? Who among us here has\nnever used cotton to clean or bind a wound? The\nprogressive disappearance of the cotton sector will\nhave unimaginable implications and consequences for\nour comfort in clothing and other needs of all\nhumankind. The time has come, therefore, for the\ndeveloped countries to hear the voice of the poor\npeasants labouring under the sun and rain in Africa.\nWhile globalization may require considerable structural\nadjustments, it is increasingly necessary that its\nconcomitant sacrifices be parcelled out fairly. This will\nrequire the rich countries to assume their responsibility\nto give the peoples of the least developed countries a\nchance at survival.\nIn 2004, the international community will\ncommemorate the tenth anniversary of the International\nYear of the Family. That will be an important event, to\nwhich my delegation should like to draw the attention\nof the international community in order to spotlight the\nrole of the family in our society and the part it can play\nin meeting contemporary challenges. To that end,\nBenin proposes the convening of a regional African\nconference in 2004 and calls for the support of the\nSecretariat for such an event.\nAt the national level, since our last session Benin\nhas met two significant challenges in the entrenchment\nof our democratic process launched in February 1990.\nThe decentralization of our territorial administration\nwas achieved following our municipal and communal\nelections of December 2002. Those elections marked\nthe conclusion of a fundamental reform of State\nadministration in Benin, which is now structured\naround decentralized, financially autonomous\ncommunes led by elected mayors who are accountable\nto the people. This reform has created the optimal\nconditions for grass-roots democracy and has allowed\nthe people to participate actively in public\nadministration and thus to become real stakeholders in\nlocal community development. Elections for deputies\nto the fourth legislature were also held in March 2003.\nThese two elections were free, transparent and\ndemocratic. They took place calmly and peacefully.\nThey made a further contribution to strengthening the\ndemocratic rebirth of Benin.\nThese concrete achievements attest to the vitality\nand stability of our national institutions and to their\neffective contribution to the ongoing strengthening of\nthe constitutional order in Benin. This historic\nopportunity for Benin to enjoy peace and stability in a\nsubregion beset by recurring internal armed conflicts\nimplies a certain responsibility with regard to our\ncontribution to the international community\u2019s efforts to\npromote democracy throughout the world and to\nrestore peace in countries in conflict, particularly in\nAfrica.\nIt was in recognition of this firm commitment of\nBenin\u2019s that the General Assembly entrusted us with\nthe organization, from 4 to 6 December 2000, of the\nFourth International Conference of New or Restored\nDemocracies. For nearly three years, Benin chaired the\nfollow-up mechanism to that Conference; it recently\ntransferred that chairmanship to Mongolia, which\norganized the Fifth Conference from 10 to 12\nSeptember 2003. My country welcomes the outcome of\nthe Ulan Bator Conference. We remain committed to\nthe principle of periodic assessment of democratic\npractices. We will spare no effort in implementing the\nUlam Bator Declaration and Plan of Action.\nThe active and effective participation of Benin in\npeacekeeping operations decided upon or authorized by\nthe Security Council also makes clear my country\u2019s\nresolute commitment to democracy, the maintenance of\npeace and security in the world and international\nsolidarity. It is in that context that Benin\u2019s candidacy\nfor a non-permanent seat in the Security Council for\n2004 and 2005 should be seen. In that context, Benin\nwill resolutely strive to strengthen the crucial\npartnership that the Security Council is endeavouring\nto establish with regional and subregional\norganizations in the area of peacekeeping. Benin is\ncounting on the support of the entire international\ncommunity so that we can have the privilege of\nserving, at such a high level, the cause of peace and\ninternational security.\n17\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is neither pride nor\nthe prospect of privilege that moves us to assume the\nPresidency of the United Nations General Assembly\nbut a certain determination that is the unspoken\nstrength of islands. Nor is it merely that we are\nhonoured \u2014 though indeed we are \u2014 but that we also\nfeel worthy, as worthy as any other member of this\ncommunity and determined to make our contribution to\nthe progress of humanity and the welfare of the world.\nSaint Lucia recognizes and appreciates that this\nPresidency became a reality only with the support of\nthe Latin American and Caribbean family.\nOur preoccupation is not with size, sovereignty or\npower but with people, and by this measure we are not\nsmall, nor are we just an island, for we do not stand\nalone. We stand as one Member of this Organization,\nproud of the legacy and the vision that we can offer the\nworld. We assume this role because we wish to offer\nthat vision to the world \u2014 because it is larger than our\n238 square miles and larger than our population of\n159,000 people. It is a vision we wish to place at the\nservice of humanity.\nIt is our hope that Saint Lucia\u2019s presidency will\noffer a fresh perspective, an alternative view, and a\ndifferent, but not discordant, voice to the heart of the\nAssembly. As such, the people and the Government of\nSaint Lucia express both their appreciation and their\ndetermination to the members of this international\ncommunity \u2014 appreciation for the faith and trust\nbestowed upon us with the presidency of this\ninstitution, and determination that we shall not fail it,\nbut be judged equal to the task before us. If it is a task\nof Herculean proportion, then we will face it with equal\nconfidence, certain that the rebuilding of our broken\nhumanity is a matter which we encounter in the\ncompany of equally resolute and undaunted partners.\nSince the end of the cold war, the legitimacy,\ncredibility and relevance of this time-honoured\ninstitution have never been so questioned as they are\ntoday. The United Nations Millennium Declaration was\ndesigned to revive the dying pulse of all humanity but\nhas itself become comatose. Indeed, Secretary-General\nKofi Annan was moved to state that:\n\u201cIt is uncertain whether the consensus and\nthe vision that the Millennium Declaration\nexpressed are still intact.\u201d\nSaint Lucia therefore calls on the international\ncommunity to heed the appeal of our Secretary-General\nto seek balance between the imperatives of military\nsecurity and human security. In the interest of\nredistributive justice, global peace and security, the\ndeveloped countries must not renege on their\ncommitments to the developing world in the areas of\ntrade, debt relief and aid.\nThe Millennium Declaration goal of halving\nglobal poverty is receding into nothingness, but it can\nbe rescued if developed countries make good on their\npledges. Moreover, we might challenge ourselves\nbeyond merely halving global poverty, by aspiring to\nits virtual elimination. By now, it should be clear to us\n27\n\nall that poverty issues are inseparable from human\nrights issues, as are environmental issues from\neconomic and political development issues. National\nsecurity and international stability can be realized only\nwhere there is justice.\nIt was the prophet Isaiah who reminded us that if\nmankind is brought low, everyone will be humbled. Yet\nif we, the international community, retreat from the\nideals of the creation of a greater humanity, we would\nalso be retreating from the core values and principles\nenshrined within the United Nations Charter. More\nimportantly, we would be tacitly endorsing the return\nand consolidation of a global uncivil society \u2014 the\nsymptoms of which are already manifest within our\nglobal society. Religious intolerance, tribal aggression\nand civil war continue to ravage many parts of our\nplanet. Among the victims are the poor, the\nmarginalized and the vulnerable \u2014 often women and\nchildren, who play no part in the making of war but\nfind themselves stripped of their human dignity and\nbasic human rights. Terrorist attacks in Bali, Kenya,\nSaudi Arabia and Baghdad add to our symptoms of\nimpending rupture.\nThe arteries of conscience are becoming hardened\nby the frequency of wanton violence, yet on occasion\nthere are incidents that shock our sensibilities. The\nmurder of Sergio Vieira de Mello and other United\nNations colleagues reminds us of the mindless horror at\nthe heart of that darkness. Saint Lucia joins the\ninternational community in expressing sympathy to\ntheir families, and we reiterate our profound respect to\nthose international workers who are so willing to make\nthe ultimate sacrifice to extend humanitarian\nassistance, security and comfort to those in peril and in\nneed.\nIn this environment, it is essential that we\nmaintain a United Nations which steadfastly adheres to\nits original core values. Saint Lucia will resist any\nattempt to de-legitimize the United Nations system.\nAny strategy which claims to embrace peace, security\nand justice and yet excludes the United Nations belies\na flawed and unreal conception of world affairs. This\nOrganization has been instrumental in the preservation\nof the nation-State within a framework of binding\nrelationships among Governments. More importantly,\nthe United Nations has been a devoted guardian of\nindividual rights and freedoms. Saint Lucia maintains\nthat the United Nations, precisely because of its\ndiversity, is the only organization with the political and\nmoral legitimacy to deal adequately with global issues.\nThis universal body \u2014 this United Nations \u2014 has\nno other choice but to heed the lessons of the past and\nthe wisdom of the ages in its attempt to better serve\nhumanity. When our predecessor organization, the\nLeague of Nations, was discarded as irrelevant, we\nwitnessed the advance of disorder and human\ncatastrophe on a scale never before envisioned. If we\nstand idly by now, while this time-honoured institution\nis rendered irrelevant and toothless, we will have\ncommissioned an epitaph for humanity.\nSaint Lucia therefore calls for the completion of\nthe efforts at reforming the Security Council to better\nreflect the realities of this new century and to make it\nmore representative \u2014 more democratic, legitimate\nand transparent. The existing veto system is too easily\ninfluenced by national interests to address serious\nissues afflicting humankind. If a coalition of the\nwilling could be assembled for war, then surely we can\nalso gather a coalition of the willing to address the\nproblems of poverty, disease, illiteracy, hunger, and\ntrade imbalances. There can be no sanitizing of one\ncorner of the globe while contagion, despair and\ndesperation fester elsewhere. There is no security for\nthe one while insecurity plagues the other.\nBut, ultimately, the strength of the United Nations\nmust come from the political will of the Member\nStates \u2014 a political will that must accept that everyone\nshould adhere to, abide by, and implement all the\ndecisions taken and resolutions adopted by the\nOrganization. We cannot, in the name of national\ninterest, observe only some resolutions and expect to\nhave a strong United Nations.\nThe United Nations cannot be strengthened if we\ndo not have the political will to accept that its activities\ncannot be dictated by the agendas of a few powerful\nStates. It must embrace, in equal measure, the concerns\nof the small and the weak that are the majority of its\nMembers. No single State, by virtue of its economic or\nmilitary might, should determine, on its own, the\nobligations and responsibilities of the rest of humanity.\n\u201cMuscular unilateralism\u201d and the emerging\ndoctrine of diplomatic unilateralism cannot be the\npreferred approach to serious global issues.\nExceptionalism within the international system is\ncertain to fragment international cooperation, making it\n28\n\nless likely that countries will forgo aspects of national\nsovereignty in the interest of the common good.\nIt has become abundantly clear that the\ninternational community will not succeed in its war\nagainst terrorism if it fails to address root causes. The\ncurrent war on terrorism is designed to capture, confine\nor eliminate existing terrorist networks without\naddressing the causes of terrorism. Terrorism does not\nstem simply from the arrogance and madness of a few\ndictators and misguided fanatics; it is also the result of\ndeep-seated inequity and, sometimes, bigotry. If the\nstatus quo denies opportunity, freedom and fulfilment\nto those who hunger and dwell in despair, the appeal of\nchaos and extremism as an avenue to change becomes\nthat much more attractive. If, on the other hand, we\nperceive that the world order works in the interests of\nall of us, there will be a universal commitment to\nsustain that order. Consequently, it is imperative that\nthe international community jointly address economic\ninjustice and political exclusion as common enemies of\nus all.\nYour assumption, Sir, of the presidency of this\ninstitution at this time, as a representative of a small\nisland developing State \u2014 one of the smallest\nMembers of the United Nations \u2014 is both a tribute to\nthe democratic principles of the United Nations and a\nsignal of the need to conclude the process of\nrevitalizing the work of the General Assembly. We\nmust conquer delay, procrastination, repetition and\ninaction.\nMany years have passed since deliberations on\nthe reform of the Security Council began; and yet there\nis no end in sight. Consultations on the revitalization of\nthe General Assembly first began 13 years ago, and on\nthat issue, too, there is no end in sight.\nFor some reason, the United Nations seems to\nenjoy operating in decades. We create decades for our\nprogrammes, and when we fail to take action in a\nparticular decade, we simply declare another decade.\nAnd so the cycle continues \u2014 for decades. This body\ncan no longer afford the luxury of \u201cdecade syndrome\u201d,\ncompounded as it is by bureaucratic operations bound\nby tradition and habit.\nWe must be extremely proactive on the question\nof the revitalization of the General Assembly. Saint\nLucia therefore wishes to propose that during this\nsession we review all the draft resolutions before us,\nand determine which need to be consigned to the\nrecord books and which merit the continued attention\nof the Assembly. We need to restructure the time\nframe, as well as the working methods, of the\nAssembly and its Main Committees, so as to make\nmore productive use of an entire year, rather than\nengaging in a three-month frenzy of activities.\nFurthermore, we should consider making the agendas\nof the Main Committees and the Assembly more\nrelevant to the general debate. It is our view that these\nshould flow from the themes enunciated at the general\ndebate.\nThe United Nations must not compromise its role\nin global economic governance and development. Saint\nLucia calls for Members to resist attempts to dilute the\ndevelopment agenda through cuts and freezes of\nregular and core budget allocations.\nSaint Lucia reiterates the need for reform of the\nsystem of global economic governance so as to allow\nfor fair trade and special and differential treatment for\ndeveloping countries. The current global governance\nsystem has failed many small States by eliminating\ncommodity protocols and the quota and price\npreferences that sustain small economies.\nUnfortunately, they have been replaced by the\nconspicuous indifference of neo-liberal economic\npractice. This has contributed to the decimation of\nmany Caribbean economies. It is Saint Lucia\u2019s earnest\nplea that the distortions in farm trade about which \u2014\ndespite their prevalence \u2014 discussion is conspicuously\navoided, will be treated in a manner reflective of the\nredistributive priorities of this Organization. We are\ntherefore determined that a more inclusive and\ntransparent global governance system should hold as\nsacred the goals and aspirations of those of us in the\ndeveloping world who strive against all odds.\nAmong the most vulnerable countries in the\nworld today are some of the territories that are on the\nUnited Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories.\nThese countries, the majority of which are small island\nStates in the Caribbean and the Pacific, have yet to\nexercise the right to self-determination. In the words of\nthe Secretary-General, it is time for the United Nations\nto bring to a close this colonial chapter of history.\nWe therefore welcome the cooperation that the\nSpecial Committee of 24 on decolonization has\nrecently been receiving from the administering Powers\nof those Territories and the advances that have\nconsequently been made in the work of the Committee.\n29\n\nWe further welcome the negotiations that have just\nbegun, for the first time, between the Special\nCommittee and the United Kingdom on the process of\ndecolonization in the Caribbean. We look forward to\ncontinued cooperation with the administering Powers\nso that the goal of self-determination for all of these\nTerritories can be achieved in less than a decade.\nWe believe that this General Assembly\npresidency is both symbolic and strategic \u2014 not just\nfor ourselves, but for this Organization and the\nrevitalization of its development agenda. That a small\ndeveloping country should aspire to and attain such\nhigh office is a testament to the magnanimity of this\nnoble institution. It is an opportunity to demonstrate\nthat global equity and universal democracy remain\nmeaningful constructs of the world community.\nOur voice can be ignored or it can be heeded, but\nit will not be silenced. The choice of an appropriate\nresponse rests with this community. Our presence here,\nhowever, is a manifestation of our belief that humanity\ndemands conscious renewal \u2014 renewal to guarantee\nthat the international community resists war,\nremembers the poor and is prepared to give tangible\nmeaning to the Charter, to which we all subscribe as\nresponsible members of the world community.\nBut there can be no renewal if faith in the United\nNations system is not also restored and retained. The\nUnited Nations must remain as the moral epicentre of\nworld politics. Any re-conceptualization of the\narchitecture of global governance that excludes the\nUnited Nations will leave the world weaker, more\ndivided, vulnerable and less secure. This cannot and\nshould not be our legacy to future generations, who\nwill judge us not by our words or espoused principles,\nbut by the actions we employ to render this world fit\nfor human habitation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst of all,\nSir, allow me to congratulate you on your election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\nsession and also to commend Mr. Jan Kavan for his\noutstanding and astute leadership in presiding over the\nfifty-seventh session. I should like also to commend\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan for his dynamism and\nfor the great leadership qualities he continues to\ndisplay in steering the affairs of the United Nations. I\nwish to assure you of Malawi\u2019s continued support and\ncooperation as we deal with the challenges before us.\nI would like to express Malawi\u2019s sincere\ncondolences to the families of the victims of the\nsenseless and barbaric attack against the headquarters\nof the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq,\nwhich resulted in the loss of a number of lives,\nincluding that of the Special Representative of the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello. The\nattack should serve as a warning of our need to remain\nfocused on the fight against terrorism to ensure that the\n20\n\nwar against that scourge proceeds as a multilateral\nundertaking. We fully support the call for all those\nresponsible for such attacks to be charged with war\ncrimes.\nTime has demonstrated the cardinal place of\nmultilateral approaches to international issues and\nproblems. The Iraq situation has revealed to us all in\nthe international community the importance of\nmultilateralism under the auspices of the United\nNations, whose central role in addressing international\nconflicts should not be undermined.\nLet me seize this opportunity to express, on\nbehalf of the Government and the people of Malawi,\nmy gratitude to the United Nations and its agencies, as\nwell as to other multilateral and bilateral donors, for\nthe emergency relief assistance given to Malawi and to\nother countries of southern Africa during the past two\nyears, when our people faced a critical food shortage\nthat threatened millions of lives. Their timely\nintervention enabled us to prevent a massive loss of\nlife. We trust that the international community will also\nassist us in improving our agricultural production so as\nto prevent the recurrence of famine.\nAfrica continues to experience the effects of the\ntragedy created by the HIV/AIDS scourge. Our\nnational budgets are seriously overstretched by the\ndemands of care, treatment, support and funerals for\nHIV/AIDS victims, which occur on an hourly basis in\nan environment of devastating economic decline and\nfamine. We are losing able-bodied people and\nprofessional expertise in all the sectors of our society\ntwo and a half times faster than we can replace them.\nWe are grappling with the problem of caring for tens of\nthousands of orphans, whose numbers are increasing at\nan alarming rate.\nThe bleak and desperate situation created by HIV/\nAIDS urgently calls for concerted and practical\ninternational action to implement the Millennium\nDeclaration and Development Goals in the fight against\nthis pandemic. I would like to thank all those partners\nthat continue to assist us in addressing this serious\nproblem.\nMalawi has paid close attention to the new\ninternational debate presently taking shape which\nadvocates a qualitative paradigm shift from policy\nframeworks and mere commitments in conferences to\nthe concrete implementation of an agreed action\nprogramme, or what has become known as the New\nMultilateralism which aims at addressing the serious\nshortcomings of existing multilateral policy\nprescriptions. The debate also seeks to effect a move in\nthe right direction. My Government supports this\nimportant innovation and, especially, the newly-\nlaunched United Nations system wide integrated\nframework for least developed countries, jointly\nworked out by the six core agencies and designed to\nfacilitate the effective integration of the least\ndeveloped economies into the multilateral trading\nsystem.\nWe also support the United Nations Development\nAssistance Framework (UNDAF) mechanism for\neffecting increased coordination and collaboration at\nthe national level in the preparation of development\nplans and programmes. We are keen to see a better-\ncoordinated and integrated follow-up to, and\nimplementation of, not only conference outcomes but\nalso outstanding donor commitments to our\ndevelopment efforts.\nIn the same vein, the Government of Malawi fully\nendorses the current exercise designed to reform the\nUnited Nations. A more representative and democratic\nUnited Nations will enhance the efficiency and\ncredibility of this world organization.\nI cannot overemphasize the centrality of market\naccess and trade to the whole question of poverty\neradication, sustainable agriculture and rural\ndevelopment. We need to translate the debate on\nWestern protectionism into a deliberate, broad-ranging\nglobal policy against trade barriers. Malawi is\nconcerned at the collapse of the recent World Trade\nOrganization meeting in Canc\u00fan, Mexico. We can only\nhope that the stalemate in the talks is only temporary.\nIn the current unbalanced system of trade, low\ncommodity prices on the international market have\nallowed a virtual free flow of our primary products to\nthe West with a near-zero return on our agricultural\nsector, making it all the more difficult to develop the\nsector into a key catalyst for rural and sustainable\ndevelopment as a strategy for effective poverty\nreduction.\nThe world today is faced with multiple\nchallenges, which have tested the resilience of the\nstrong, as well as that of the weak. In Africa, the noble\nobjectives of the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s\nDevelopment (NEPAD), geared towards enabling.\nAfricans themselves to assume full responsibility for\n21\n\ndevelopment challenges, can be meaningfully realised\nonly with the support of the developed countries. So\nfar, not much has been achieved owing to resource\nconstraints. The resource pledges made by the Group\nof Eight at meetings in Canada and France must be\nhonoured in order for the implementation of the\nNEPAD programmes to pull Africa out of economic\nstagnation.\nWe were heartened by the launch, early this year,\nof the road map for a Middle East peace with the\nexpectation that it had established conditions for an\nirreversible transition to the establishment of an\nindependent Palestinian State co-existing with the State\nof Israel. It is, therefore, regrettable that the road map\nis being frustrated by elements that do not wish to see\npeace take root in the Middle East. We call upon the\nMiddle East Quartet and the Israeli and the Palestinian\nsides, in particular, to remain committed to the road\nmap and to do everything in their power to make it\nsucceed.\nI would like to commend the Secretary-General,\njointly with the Assembly and the Security Council, for\nhaving taken a number of decisive steps towards the\nresolution of conflicts in Africa, including through the\nframework of the open-ended ad hoc Committee. of the\nSecurity Council on conflict prevention and recovery in\nAfrica. Malawi reaffirms its alignment with the\nposition of Africa and the Southern African\nDevelopment Community on preventive diplomacy,\nand commends, in this regard, the General Assembly\nwork on a draft resolution on the prevention of armed\nconflict in Africa. We also support the Economic and\nSocial Council resolution establishing an Ad Hoc\nAdvisory Group for mobilizing assistance for African\ncountries emerging from conflict.\nThe humanitarian tragedies in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau,\nSierra Leone and Liberia remain a serious distraction\nfrom important national and regional development\ninitiatives.\nIn this regard, we welcome the peaceful handover\nof the reigns of power in Burundi on 30 April, 2003, in\naccordance with the terms of the peace accord of\nAugust 2000. We also commend the successful\nestablishment and launching of a broad-based\nGovernment of national unity in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo on 15 July 2003 and the\npeaceful and successful elections recently held in\nRwanda. However, it is important that war crimes\ncommitted in conflict areas be thoroughly investigated\nso that justice may take its course. This would help to\ncheck impunity, a phenomenon of most conflict\nsituations. In this connection, my Government\nwelcomes the announcement, on 16 July 2003, by the\nChief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court of\nplans to investigate war crimes committed in the region\nof Ituri in the north-eastern part of the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo.\nMalawi believes that the United Nations can\nmeaningfully advance the principles upon which it was\nfounded and effectively deal with the multiple\nchallenges that the global community is facing by\ntaking an all-inclusive approach to its membership. It is\nin this spirit that my country has, time and again, called\nfor the participation of the Republic of China in the\naffairs of this Organization in line with the principle of\nuniversality. Taiwan has a lot to offer in the promotion\nof the global common good, which the United Nations\nis here to advance. I therefore hope that the 23 million\npeople of Taiwan will be given sympathetic\nconsideration so that they may, once again, enjoy the\nright to associate with the world community through\nthis Organization.\nNext year will be an important one for the people\nof Malawi, as we will be holding the third general\nelection of the democratic dispensation ushered in\n1994. The elections will be tripartite, as they will\ninclude presidential, parliamentary and local\ngovernment elections. The elections could not have\nbeen scheduled to take place at a worse time, given that\nthe country has recently experienced a serious food\nshortage that has further strained the few resources\navailable to it. However, in response to the demands of\nthe country\u2019s constitution, the Government and the\npeople of Malawi remain committed to fulfilling this\nconstitutional requirement for good governance based\non free and fair elections. Malawi seeks the\ncooperation, support and assistance of the international\ncommunity to facilitate the entire electoral process.\nMay I conclude by conveying to you,\nMr. President, to the Secretary-General and, indeed, to\nthe United Nations family, the profound gratitude and\nappreciation of His Excellency President Bakili Muluzi\nand the people of Malawi for the support and\ncooperation extended to the President and his\nGovernment since they assumed power in 1994. As\nPresident Muluzi prepares to retire next year, after\n22\n\nserving the people of Malawi as President for two\nconsecutive five-year terms, he is confident that the\nUnited Nations and, indeed, the international\ncommunity at large, will remain committed to assisting\nthe new leadership and the people of Malawi in their\nquest for meaningful and effective socio-economic and\npolitical development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

My\nGovernment is deeply gratified by the recognition of\nyour accomplishments as someone from a country that\nis a member of the Small Island Developing States\nNetwork. We are confident you will lead the work of\nfifty-eighth session with the same abilities as your\ndistinguished predecessor, His Excellency Jan Kavan\nof the Czech Republic.\nOn behalf of the people of Sao Tome and\nPrincipe, I would like to reaffirm the principles of the\nCharter and its role in promoting peace and\ndevelopment, and to pay tribute to Secretary-General\nKofi Annan for his dedication and leadership.\nWe all face daunting challenges. Violence has\ninflamed international relations. On behalf of my\ncountry, I would like to express our outrage and regret\nthat the United Nations Mission in Baghdad was\nbrutally attacked, with the tragic loss of such\noutstanding United Nations professionals as Sergio\nVieira de Mello. We pay tribute to all those who died\ndefending the peaceful path to peace and development\nin Iraq.\nAs we all are aware, Africa, perhaps more than\nall the world\u2019s continents, faces enormous challenges.\nWe are plagued by endemic diseases such as malaria,\nwhich debilitate and kill our people needlessly. HIV/\nAIDS is devastating Africa\u2019s families, societies,\ncultures and economies. How can we have economic\ndevelopment when our people are too ill to work, or\nwhen the main breadwinner in the family is dying of\nHIV/AIDS, without any medical treatment?\nOur economy has begun to feel the negative\neffects of these two deadly diseases. We urge all\nnations to work together to mobilize the necessary\nhuman and financial resources for the critical task of\ncontrolling these epidemics, which give rise to an\nunrelenting cycle of death and suffering for our\npeoples. There can be no hope for progress in Africa if\nbasic health is not first ensured, so that the people can\nwork and build their own prosperity.\nSao Tome and Principe, a small island State with\na fragile economy, is struggling. We are proud of our\ndemocracy, our free and fair elections, our human\nrights and our rule of law. But in July of this year our\nproud and stable democracy came under threat from\nforces seeking to topple our constitutionally elected\nGovernment. They did not succeed, because the\ninternational community quickly intervened to support\nour elected authorities and to negotiate a peaceful end\nto the coup attempt, which restored our constitutional\nGovernment. I would like to take this opportunity to\nthank Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his personal\nconcern for our country\u2019s well-being. I wish also to\nexpress my appreciation for the support of the African\nUnion, led by President Chissano of Mozambique, and\nfor the tireless assistance of President Obasanjo of\nNigeria, as well as that of officials from Portugal,\nBrazil, the United States, Angola, Gabon, Cape Verde\nand the Congo, and the many others who rescued our\ndemocracy from peril.\nBut our democracy will remain under threat\nunless the Government can mobilize resources\nsufficient to provide basic services to our long-\nsuffering people. For this reason, the people and the\nGovernment of Sao Tome and Principe ask for\ncontinued international support, with development aid,\nto improve the lot of our people and to ensure the\nsurvival of our young democracy.\nWe must all work together to strengthen\nmultilateral cooperation and to ensure that the United\nNations and all its agencies continue to be the forum in\nwhich all Member States can promote dialogue and\nensure world peace, security, democracy and\ndevelopment.\nMy country regrets that international relations in\nsome parts of the world have deteriorated to the point\nwhere extreme violence is the daily norm,\ninfrastructures have been destroyed, and human rights\nare daily violated. We lament the plight of the refugees\nthat this violence creates, and especially the plight of\nchildren, who often become the victims of those who\ntraffic in human beings.\nThe tragedies in Iraq, the Middle East, Liberia\nand Afghanistan \u2014 to name only the most egregious \u2014\ncan be overcome only within the multilateral\nframework of United Nations. Unilateral actions are\ndoomed to failure in the long run.\nAt the same time, Sao Tome and Principe\nsupports an urgent reform of the Security Council, to\nmake it into a body that reflects current realities and\nnot those of the cold-war era. The Security Council\nmust be democratised, with the expansion of the\ncategory of permanent members.\n19\n\nWe observe with great concern the spread of\nterrorist acts across the globe, ranging from tragic\nexamples such as what happened at Bali in Asia, to\nPalestine and Israel in the Middle East, to Spain and\nthe United Kingdom in Europe, to Kenya and Tanzania\nin Africa, to Colombia in Latin America, and right here\nto New York and other sites in North America. But\nfighting violence with violence is not enough. We must\ngo to the root of the problem, and that is the task of the\nUnited Nations.\nThe world is a less secure place today than it was\na year ago. The proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction continues, non-proliferation treaties\nnotwithstanding. We must ensure the universality of\nthose treaties and compliance with them under the\nauthority of the Security Council.\nSao Tome and Principe strongly supports the\nMillennium Development Goals, but much remains to\nbe accomplished. The rules of the international\neconomy continue to be dictated by a small number of\ncountries that promote free markets while closing their\nown. The latest World Trade Organization meeting in\nCanc\u00fan is the natural result of this hypocrisy.\nDeveloping economies like that of my country can be\ncompetitive only if there is a level playing field, if all\nmarkets are open and if subsidies and protectionism are\nerased.\nAs an island nation, Sao Tome and Principe\ncontinues to see its very existence threatened by global\nwarming. Our shorelines are eroding and our national\nterritory is shrinking as the seas rise. Is my small\ncountry to end up as nothing but a tiny volcanic peak\nsticking up above the waves, with the last of our people\nclinging to the land left unclaimed by the rising sea?\nThe Kyoto Protocol must be implemented by all for the\nbenefit of all.\nFor many years, the people of Cuba have been\nliving under an unjustifiable economic embargo. That\neconomic embargo is hampering development, and\npeople\u2019s lives would improve were it to end. The time\nhas come for both sides to improve confidence-\nbuilding measures by going back to the negotiating\ntable and normalizing relations.\nMr. President, my country would once again ask\nfor your attention with respect to the Republic of China\non Taiwan. This is a country with a democratically\nelected Government which has built a strong economy\nand which has strong ties with many Member States.\nTaiwan was recently affected by Severe Acute\nRespiratory Syndrome (SARS), but it was beyond the\nreach of the World Health Organization because\nTaiwan is not allowed to be a member \u2014 simply\nbecause Taiwan\u2019s people do not accept the imposition\nof the \u201cone China\u201d principle.\nDespite its small size, Taiwan offers development\naid to a large number of countries. Taiwan also\ncontributes to international security by being a strong\nproponent of the fight against terrorism.\nI wish to call to the attention of the Assembly\nthat, under the universality rules set out in the Charter\nof the United Nations, the Republic of China on\nTaiwan must one day be here among us.\nOur goal is to leave a better world for the next\ngeneration. We cannot go along with the concept of\nusing force in international relations, and we denounce\nhuman injustice.\nWe decry environmental degradation, which\nultimately threatens us all. Sao Tome and Principe\nurges dialogue, tolerance and mutual understanding on\nthe part of all Member States. We ask all to respect the\nUnited Nations Charter.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish\nto add Romania's voice to the heartfelt congratulations\nof others to His Excellency Mr. Julian Robert Hunte on\nhis election to the important position of President of\nthe General Assembly, wish him every success and\nassure him of our delegation's full support.\nThe political debate of this session of the\nAssembly is being held in an international setting that\nrequires us to take a long, hard look at the way the\nUnited Nations can respond to the challenges facing us.\nThe recent terrorist attacks in Baghdad, which\ntook the lives of Ambassador Sergio Vieira de Mello\nand other brave members of the United Nations\ncommunity, as well as of Iraqis who had committed\nthemselves to restoring stability in their country,\nproved once more that the only language that fanatics\nuse is that of crime and terror. The best way to pay\n38\n\ntribute to the memory of those victims of terror is to\ncarry out, with redoubled determination, the mission to\nwhich they had dedicated their life.\nToday, the United Nations is called upon to\ncontinue to play a greater role in the service of good.\nOver the course of the past decade, the\nOrganization has accomplished a great deal, despite the\nseemingly insurmountable difficulties and certain\nevident limitations. Those obstacles sometimes grew\nout of a lack of shared perspectives regarding the\nproblems confronting us today. Yet, we have managed\nto keep world security under control.\n(spoke in English)\nAs always at the United Nations, we are faced\nwith a challenge brought about by differing views\ntowards common problems. There is nothing new here,\nexcept for the magnitude of the consequences. We\ncannot afford to do nothing simply because we do not\nagree on everything. The United Nations is not about\nagreeing on everything. It is about building consensus.\nWe can do just that if we concentrate on negotiation  \nnot language, but substance.\nIrrespective of how important the debate might\nbe, we should not be distracted today by talk of a\nunipolar, multipolar or even bipolar world. Rather, we\nshould concentrate on how we can govern our world in\na way that benefits the individual, brings about\nopportunity and pre-empts, deters and fights terrorism\nand aggression. If we are true to the principle of an\ninternational community dedicated to preserving peace\nand increasing prosperity, we should discuss how to\nachieve higher levels of international understanding,\nrather than the relevance of the United Nations system\ntoday, for we have to remember that true security is\nshared security, and true prosperity is shared\nprosperity.\nTo achieve this, we should also keep in mind that\nlegitimacy brings credibility that leads to predictability\nand predictability, brings long-term commonality of\nviews that is the cornerstone of lasting coalitions.\nThis is why we share the assessment of the\nSecretary-General, that The United Nations is not an\nend in itself. Rather it is an instrument for achieving\ncommon ends.' (A/58/1, para. 10)\nOur belief that we, the Member States, must keep\nthe United Nations working with efficiency, with\npurpose and with result prompted Romania to put\nforward our candidature for membership in the\nSecurity Council starting next January. We thank the\nEastern European Group and others for their support\nfor us. This is a responsibility that we do not\nunderestimate. Our mission will be to uphold the\nvalidity of the United Nations as an essential\ninternational actor in preventing and resolving\nconflicts, eliminating poverty and promoting human\nrights.\nAs befits a State that will soon be a member of\nboth the European Union and NATO, we believe in the\nmultilateral approach to tackling terrorism, the\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organized\ncrime and violations of human rights.\nAs a country that has struggled to rebuild a\ndemocratic society based on the rule of law, a market\neconomy and respect for human rights, we understand\nthe complex challenges of transition that other\ncountries are also facing. It is not an easy process, but\nin our view it is the only way to guarantee durable\neconomic prosperity and social cohesion for the\ncitizen. We want to see a strengthening of the central\nrole of the United Nations in coordinating worldwide\nefforts to this end.\nRomania's international profile is defined by our\nlocation and our history and capability in Europe and\nby our transition experience. We are determined to play\na responsible role in connecting the West and East of\nour continent, and in reaching out to countries on the\nEastern shore of the Black Sea, the Caucasus and the\ngreater Middle East. We pledge to contribute to\nspreading Euro-Atlantic values beyond NATO and the\nEuropean Union areas by consistently promoting the\nculture of dialogue and regional cooperation.\nTerrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction, the rising number of failing States and\nglobal disparities are some of the most worrying\nhallmarks of our times. The speed and unevenness of\nglobal processes intensify the complexity and\npervasive nature of these threats to our common\nsecurity and prosperity.\nWe already possess an important range of tools to\ntackle threats like terrorism and weapons of mass\ndestruction. They should now be used in a more\nresponsible and effective manner. For example, the\nCounter-Terrorism Committee should be given more\nprofessional resources so it can act more effectively to\n39\n\nstreamline national legislation on uprooting the\nfinancial resources of terrorism and monitor its\nimplementation. International non-proliferation legal\nregimes should be strengthened in order to prevent\ndetermined proliferators from breaching their\ninternational obligations. Countries of concern with\nregard to proliferation could be subjected to diplomatic\nand economic pressure, which is most effective when\napplied multilaterally.\nChallenges to the security and stability of our\nworld also emerge as globalization processes expand.\nSustainable development is increasingly related to\nsustainable peace and security. Globalization is\ninevitable. Provided that it is combined with good\ngovernance, proper development assistance and\nawareness of environmental issues, as well as with fair\ntrade through open markets, globalization is a force for\nprogress. But global disparities are not disappearing.\nThe ratio of per capita incomes of the richest and\npoorest countries now stands at more than seventy to\none. So it is especially disappointing that the World\nTrade Organization talks in Cancun ended in deadlock.\nWe call on all parties to redouble their efforts in\nDecember to resume dialogue and close the gap. The\nsuccess we need is not just that of freer and more open\nmarkets, but also that of equitable trade, creating added\nvalue to regions, nations and communities.\nSustainable development demands first that we\nmanage globalization responsibly so that it benefits all.\nIt is time to focus on implementing the concrete goals\nof eradicating poverty and accelerating development.\nThe challenge will be to prioritize our work. Our focus\nat the High-level Dialogue on Financing for\nDevelopment at the end of next month should remain\nsquarely on achieving results.\nWe also must redouble our efforts to put an end to\nconflicts, and we must find a way to rebuild those\ncountries that have survived conflict but are struggling\nto survive peace. Africa is a particularly worrying\nexample of how dangerous it can be to ignore the\nconsequences of conflicts. The grave humanitarian\ncrises on that continent are foreboding a bleak future\nfor many countries and fomenting despair and far-\nreaching frustrations.\nThe international community has to be more\nengaged in addressing poverty, intolerance and ethnic\nhatred. We would like to see the United Nations\nenhance its peace operation capabilities and emphasize\nin particular the reconstruction and rehabilitation\nprocesses. We have done this in Afghanistan, yet it\nremains a test of our ability and willingness to secure a\nsuccessful democracy offensive in the fight against\nterrorism. I think we have enough at stake to stand by\nthat commitment.\nIn the Middle East, the new wave of violence is\npreventing the full implementation of the agreed road\nmap. Romania strongly condemns suicide bombings\nthat are carried out by the enemies of peace and\nsecurity in the area. We urge the new Palestinian\nGovernment to act effectively against further terrorist\nattacks targeting Israel and its citizens, but it is equally\nimportant that the Israeli Government stand by its\ncommitments in the framework of pursuing a political\nsolution to this bitter conflict. We fully support the\nactions of the Quartet that are meant to contribute to\novercoming this dangerous situation. We shall follow\nwith utmost interest the ministerial meeting that is\nscheduled for this week.\nIn Iraq, we believe it is time for the international\ncommunity to work together to stabilize and\nreconstruct that tragic country, whose people have\nsuffered so much under tyranny for so long. The\nsuccessful conclusion of negotiations on the new\nresolution concerning Iraq is not a mere option   it is\na must.\nWe need now to concentrate on what matters\nmost: the steps that must be taken next by the\ninternational community to empower the Iraqi people\nand to ensure the democratic functioning of institutions\nin that country and stability, not only in Iraq, but also\nin the greater Middle East as a whole. As a\nparticipating country in the Coalition Provisional\nAuthority, Romania is already engaged and ready to\ncontinue to contribute to achieving these goals. We are\nlooking forward to participating in the coming\nministerial conference on assistance for the Iraqi\npeople in Madrid this October.\nMany conflicts in the world stem from the\nbreakdown of nation-States. Porous borders, weak\nnational institutions and the development of alternative\nallegiances based on religious, economic and other\nfactors often lead to the collapse of State structures.\nThe principal feature of such States is the absence of\npolitical legitimacy, coupled with an uncontrolled or\nunaccountable security sector and contempt for the rule\nof law. That leads to violent conflict over control of\n40\n\nresources or between different ethnic groups and to\nviolation of human rights and humanitarian law. Illegal\narms become readily accessible, organized crime and\nviolence flourish and economic prospects die.\nA good example of where the international\ncommunity has been successful in preventing the\nrelapse of a post-conflict situation is South-East\nEurope. The past year has seen real progress in this\nregion, due principally to the increased efforts of the\ncountries themselves, in partnership with the regional\ncommunity and with support from international\norganizations and partners. But certain problems\npersist. It is vital to press ahead with full commitment\nto meeting the responsibilities and timelines that have\nalready been accepted and to creating truly democratic\nand multi-ethnic societies. Combating organized crime\nand illegal trafficking, including the most degrading\nkind that turns human beings into commodities, is a\npriority in our regional approach.\nWe need to look at all these challenges with a\nnew determination to tackle them, making full and\neffective use of the tools available to us within the\nUnited Nations system. There has been much\ndiscussion of the ability of the United Nations to\nrespond to crises. The disadvantages of the present\nworking methods of its structures and mechanisms,\nwhich were conceived more than half a century ago,\ncall for radical reform. The real debate is about\neffectiveness, adaptation and evolution. It is about our\ncommon will, as responsible members of the\ninternational community, to act together. Everything\nelse   especially the badly needed strategies   will\nsimply follow, and this will make it possible to\napproach the new and old threats alike.\nThe United Nations must increasingly serve as a\ncatalyst for collective action. This requires close\ncooperation among its Member States, dialogue and\npartnership with the vibrant constellation of new non-\nState actors: civil society, non-governmental\norganizations, the business community and academia.\nFinally, the Organization must become more effective,\nefficient and accessible to the world's people.\nWe must weigh up our differences, gauge our\nability for joint intervention and act in coordination.\nJust as the nature of current problems affects people in\neverything they do, so too must we put people at the\ncentre of everything we do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like at the\noutset to congratulate Mr. Julian Hunte on his election\nto the high post of President of the General Assembly\nat its fifty-eighth session. I should also like to pay\ntribute to his predecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, for his\nprofessionalism and very fruitful work at the helm of\nthe General Assembly during the previous session.\nThree years ago here at United Nations\nHeadquarters we solemnly adopted the Millennium\nDeclaration, which embodied our hopes and\nexpectations for a more secure and just world. Shortly\nthereafter, however, the world had to face new and\ndaunting challenges. Unfortunately, the tragic events of\n11 September 2001 were not the last in a sequence of\nhorrible acts of terror.\nJust last month, on 19 August, the United Nations\nsuffered irreplaceable losses in Iraq. With a feeling of\ndeep sorrow, I bow my head in memory of the United\nNations staff who lost their lives. We lost excellent,\ntalented and dedicated people, among them the Head of\nthe United Nations Mission in Iraq, the outstanding\nBrazilian diplomat Sergio Vieira de Mello.\nIt is a sad and disturbing fact that during recent\nyears United Nations staff have been facing growing\ninsecurity. This makes it all the more urgent for all\nmembers of the international community to fully\ncomply with the relevant international treaties, first and\nforemost, the Convention on the Safety of United\nNations and Associated Personnel. As one of the\ninitiators of that Convention, Ukraine decisively calls\nupon all States that have not yet done so to accede to\nthe treaty.\nOur country joined the anti-terrorist coalition at\nthe very outset and has made a significant contribution\nto its activities. We are determined to remain in the\nranks of the coalition until international terrorism as a\nglobal threat can be taken off the world's agenda. I\nbelieve, however, that not everything has been done to\ndate to prevent terrorist activities.\nI have in mind first of all effective measures to\ncounter the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction. Ukraine unreservedly stands for a\ncomprehensive strengthening of the system of universal\n9\n\ninternational treaties aimed at preventing the nuclear\nthreat.\nAn effective response to new challenges requires\nurgent action to reform the United Nations, first and\nforemost the Security Council. I am confident that\nfurther delay in the long-overdue reforms could result\nin a serious crisis of confidence for the United Nations.\nWe cannot let that happen. There can be no viable\nalternative to the United Nations as a unique global\nOrganization. As for the task of reforming the United\nNations, we must admit that today there are more\nquestions than there are answers.\nIn this context, the successful reforms in the area\nof United Nations activities for peacekeeping and\nconflict prevention can serve as a good example for all\nof us. In many situations of armed conflict, the United\nNations now acts flexibly, rapidly and effectively. I am\npleased to note that over the past several years Ukraine\nhas been playing a leading role among the countries\ncontributing troops to United Nations peacekeeping\noperations. I believe that conflict prevention should\nbecome a key element of the philosophy of the work of\nthe United Nations in the new millennium. Ukraine\nfully supports the Secretary-General's efforts aimed at\nstrengthening that component of United Nations\nactivities.\nIn my address at the Millennium Summit, I\nstressed the need for the international community to\nelaborate a comprehensive strategy on conflict\nprevention. In my opinion, peacekeeping operations\nwith a preventive mandate from the Security Council\ncould become one of the key instruments of such a\nsystem. We also need to further develop and improve\nthe principles and mechanisms relating to the\napplication of international sanctions aimed at curbing\nthe supply of weapons to conflict zones.\nWith regard to the situation in Iraq, I would like\nto express confidence that the tragic losses in Baghdad\nwill not diminish the international community's\ncommitment to providing support to the Iraqi people\nfor the renewal of their country. The sense of common\nresponsibility for the destiny of the long-suffering Iraqi\nnation and for peace and security in that region was the\nimperative that guided our decision to dispatch a\nmilitary contingent to the Persian Gulf.\nI hope that the adoption by the Security Council\nof a resolution on the establishment of an international\nforce for the maintenance of peace and security in Iraq\nunder the auspices of the United Nations will enable as\nmany countries as possible to join those efforts.\nAfter many months of a slide towards the abyss, a\ntruly historic opportunity arose for achieving peace in\nthe Middle East. Last May, the United Nations\nInternational Meeting in Support of Middle East Peace\nwas held in Kiev at the initiative of Ukraine. It became,\nin effect, the first international forum at which the road\nmap put forward by the Quartet gained the support of a\nlarge number of States Members of the United Nations.\nWe sincerely hope that the resumption of the Israeli-\nPalestinian peace dialogue will not be blocked by\nobstacles created by the current controversies.\nUkraine shares the concern expressed in the\nreport of the Secretary-General on the implementation\nof the Millennium Declaration that the international\ncommunity is not paying sufficient attention to trying\nto resolve the chronic global development problems\nsuch as poverty, the HIV/AIDS pandemic, environment\npollution and other issues. Despite repeated\ndeclarations   primarily by the developed countries  \nof their readiness to increase the volume of financial\nand other assistance to tackle issues of sustainable\ndevelopment, the actual efforts that have been\nundertaken have not been sufficient for the timely\nattainment of the goals set forth in the Millennium\nDeclaration.\nIn this context, I would like to recall that Ukraine\nmade a tangible contribution towards a peaceful and\nsafe world in the twenty-first century by renouncing its\nnuclear arsenal   one of the most powerful on\nEarth   and by decommissioning the Chernobyl\nnuclear power plant. In assuming the burden of the\nlarge-scale effort to transform the area of the\ncatastrophe into an ecologically safe zone and to\nresolve unprecedented economic, social and\nhumanitarian problems, we relied upon the\nunderstanding and support of the entire international\ncommunity.\nToday, welcoming the work of this Organization\nand its Member States with regard to the\nimplementation of the United Nations strategy on\nChernobyl, I express the hope that more decisive steps\nwill be taken in support of our efforts. I am confident\nthat the adoption of a resolution on this question at the\ncurrent session of the General Assembly will provide\nadditional impetus for our cooperation on the\nChernobyl issue.\n10\n\nFinally, I would like to draw the attention of the\nparticipants of this meeting to one other matter.\nSeventy years ago the totalitarian Soviet regime\nengineered an artificial famine in Ukraine, which\nclaimed the lives of between 7 million and 10 million\nof our compatriots.\nUnfortunately, the world did not respond to our\ntragedy back in 1933. The international community\nbelieved the cynical propaganda of the Soviet Union,\nwhich was selling bread abroad while, in Ukraine,\nhunger was killing 17 people every minute. From this\nrostrum, I should like to call upon all Members to\nsupport Ukraine's initiative that the United Nations pay\ntribute to the memory of those who perished. We do\nnot want to settle scores from the past; we simply want\nas many people as possible to learn about our tragedy.\nThat knowledge will help us to avoid similar\ncatastrophes in the future.\nAs the Secretary-General recently stated - and\nquite rightly - thanks to the past century's\nachievements, the world became a world of increasing\nopenness and freedom; of growing mutual confidence;\nabove all, a world of hope.' Today, we are\ndemonstrating the ability to take concerted and\nresponsible action in the face of conflicts, challenges\nand global threats. In that, the principal guarantee I see\nis that we will be able to achieve the noble goals\nsolemnly proclaimed three years ago in the Millennium\nDeclaration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We are\nconfident that this Assembly stands to benefit greatly\nfrom his diplomatic experience and skills. Like others,\nI pledge the full support and cooperation of the Lao\ndelegation to him as he undertakes his duties and\nexpress the hope that our deliberations on many of the\nmost pressing world issues will be fruitful.\nSince the last time we convened, the world has\ngone through major changes and challenges. Although\npeace, dialogue and cooperation for development\ncontinue to prevail today across many regions, we have\nbeen bearing witness to a world beset by terror, civil\nwars, armed conflicts and violence, acts of aggression\nand interference in the internal affairs of States. In\nhandling these problems, we believe it is incumbent\nupon all of us to show patience, courage and\ndetermination and to strive to solve them through\ndialogue, diplomacy and political means. Towards that\nend, we should continue to seek multilateral routes\nthrough the United Nations. In this regard, we should\nlike to make special mention of Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan. While we wish him more success as he\nendeavours to defend and promote the principles and\nideals of this universal Organization, we can only\nexpress great appreciation for the efforts he has made.\nAt present, the problems plaguing our planet,\nalas, are not limited to those considered to be political\nor military. There are also those that affect the\nenvironmental, social and economic fronts. More\nstriking are the issues of global warming, pollution,\nnatural disasters, HIV/AIDS, incurable diseases,\npoverty and underdevelopment, the crises of refugees,\ndebt and economic stagnation, which have yet to find\neffective solutions. The severity of these problems is\neven more acute in a globalized world in which the gap\nbetween developed and developing countries is\nwidening.\nWe should therefore strive effectively to address\nthese problems in order to meet the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals adopted three years ago by this\nAssembly. Standing here today and recommitting\nourselves to meeting those noble Goals, we want a\nworld where poverty and hunger are alleviated; where\neducation is offered to every child; where women have\nthe same opportunities as men; where incurable\ndiseases are effectively combated; and where the world\ncontinues to build partnership and cooperation for\nsustained economic growth and sustainable\ndevelopment.\nFor many years, the land-locked developing\ncountries have attached a particular interest to their\nspecial needs and problems. As Chairman of the 31-\nmember Group of Land-Locked Developing Countries\nfor the past four years, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic\nRepublic has spared no effort in bringing the special\nneeds and problems of land-locked developing\ncountries to the forefront of the international arena. As\na result of this long-standing concerted effort, the\nInternational Ministerial Conference of Landlocked\nand Transit Developing Countries and Donor Countries\nand International Financial and Development\n14\n\nInstitutions on Transit Transport Cooperation was held\nlast month in Kazakhstan as the first-ever United\nNations conference of its kind. The meeting adopted\nthe Almaty Declaration and Programme of Action. We\nare delighted that this global Programme of Action\naddresses, first and foremost, the special needs and\nproblems of the landlocked developing countries, while\ntaking into account the legitimate concerns of transit\ndeveloping countries. In this respect, all stakeholders\nare urged to fully and effectively implement the\nAlmaty Programme of Action in the years to come.\nSince its inception, the United Nations has\nperformed multiple activities in various areas, such as\nthe maintenance of peace and security, socio-economic\ndevelopment, humanitarian assistance, the promotion\nof international law, human rights and the protection of\nthe environment. In these endeavours, the United\nNations has achieved many successes, including in the\nfield of socio-economic development. However, in\nmany other areas, still more effort is required in order\nto attain better results.\nAs Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in his\nannual report this year,\n\u201cin the area of peace and security, it has been a\ntrying year for the United Nations. The war in\nIraq severely tested the principle of collective\nsecurity and the resilience of the Organization.\u201d\n(A/58/1, para. 2)\nIn the light of this, and given the present international\nsituation, the Security Council, the main body for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security, should\nplay its full role in securing peace and security in the\nworld, as stipulated in the Charter. The Security\nCouncil members, especially the permanent members,\nshould do everything possible to ensure that this organ\neffectively discharges its duties in the maintenance of\npeace and security. A safe and secure world would\nenable all nations to better promote their socio-\neconomic development. The international community\nis therefore urged to deploy serious efforts towards this\nend.\nIn a world where cooperation for development is\nwidespread, where in every region there is economic\nintegration to achieve common benefits, it is\nregrettable that the economic, commercial and financial\nrestrictions imposed on Cuba continue. We reaffirm the\nsupport of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for\nthe General Assembly resolution calling for the lifting\nof such a restrictive policy, with the aim of benefiting\nall peoples in the region as well as the world at large.\nWith regard to the Middle East, we continue to be\ngravely concerned about the ongoing violence and\ndisproportionate use of force that have brought nothing\nbut destruction and death to both Palestine and Israel.\nWe urge the two sides to exercise the utmost restraint\nand engage in earnest negotiations so that peace and\ncooperation may eventually ensue in the region. If that\nis done, by 2005 the inalienable rights of the\nPalestinian people to establish an independent and\nviable State, living side by side with Israel in peace and\nsecurity, could become a reality.\nThe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic has\nfollowed the recent developments in the Korean\npeninsula with great attention. We render our full\nsupport to the six-party talks hosted in Beijing in\nAugust by the Government of China, which contributed\nactively. We are pleased with the significant progress\nachieved by this meeting. We very much hope that the\ndialogue process will be pursued to address the nuclear\nissue in parallel with the security of the Democratic\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea. This would no doubt\ncontribute to the realization of a nuclear-free Korean\nPeninsula, the assurance of security for all countries in\nNorth-East Asia and the peaceful reunification of the\ntwo Koreas.\nOver the past year, the Lao people of all ethnic\ngroups have pursued their national development in\nunity and harmony. We are delighted that, through the\npromotion of the untapped potential of all domestic\neconomic sectors and the expansion of cooperation\nwith the international community, the pace of national\neconomic growth has continuously increased; the\nlivelihood of the people, particularly those in the rural\nareas, has been further improved; and, last but not\nleast, political stability and social order have been\nensured and strengthened.\nIn order to free the country from\nunderdevelopment, apart from our domestic effort, we\nhave attached great importance to the achievements\nmade in our increased effort to implement the regional\nintegration of the Association of South-East Asian\nNations (ASEAN). We highly value the continued\ndevelopment of cooperation between ASEAN and the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, the Republic of\nKorea, India and other dialogue partners. Furthermore,\nwe are pleased with the new chapter in the\n15\n\nstrengthening of cooperation between ASEAN and the\nUnited States, in particular the signing of the bilateral\ntrade agreement between the Governments of the Lao\nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic and the United States in\nVientiane on 19 September this year. In this regard, I\nwish to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to\nfriendly countries and international organizations for\nthe invaluable assistance and support rendered to the\ncause of our national development.\nAs it enters this new century, humankind has a\nstrong aspiration for peace and cooperation for\ndevelopment across the globe. In accordance with the\nCharter and international law, we should exert our\ncollective efforts to build a better world. In this spirit,\nour delegation once again calls for cooperation and\nunity in designing and implementing action-oriented\nmeasures to tackle the challenges and problems\nplaguing our planet. If we do this, future generations\nwill commend us for all our efforts in establishing\nconditions for their peaceful lives and prosperity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI greet Julian Hunte warmly\nas President at this session and assure him of Nepal\u2019s\nfull cooperation in his work. His Excellency Jan\nKavan, the outgoing President, deserves our\nappreciation for the job well done. I also pay tribute to\nthe distinguished Secretary-General for providing\ndynamic leadership to the United Nations.\nThe last 12 months have been a momentous\nperiod of convulsive events. It has been a mixed bag.\nWe have made a dent in combating terrorism, but it\nremains a serious threat to peace. Some countries have\nlimped back to normality, while others have descended\ninto chaos. All sides have accepted the Middle East\nroad map, but a new cycle of violence is undermining\nit. Iraq continues to be a source of concern to all. The\nglobal economic slump has turned the corner, but\ngrowth remains anaemic, and the Cancun trade talks\nhave foundered.\nIn these developments, the United Nations has\ncome into a sharp focus that is not always flattering.\nHowever, Nepal has an abiding faith in the United\nNations and believes in its centrality for all humanity\u2019s\nquest for shared peace, progress and justice. To small\nnations like ours, the United Nations is and should be\nthe bulwark of sovereignty and defender of freedom. It\nhas stood up to such challenges in the past, and it must\nprepare itself to face the future just as boldly through a\nprocess of strengthened multilateralism.\nToday, the world faces a number of threats to its\npeace, progress and harmony. Terrorism is now by far\nthe most immediate threat that afflicts countries, rich\nand poor, large and small. After 11 September 2001,\nthe concerted battle we have launched has pushed\nterror into retreat, but the decisive war against it that\nwe must win has yet to be won.\nThis scourge has not left the United Nations\nuntouched either. For instance, two bombs exploded\nwithin the first two months of the United Nations\npresence in Baghdad at its offices there, killing Mr.\nSergio Vieira de Mello and others, and serving as a\ngrim reminder of the indiscriminate dark threat of\nterrorism. We condemn the assault on the United\nNations and our profound condolences go to the\ncountries that lost their citizens and families who lost\ntheir dear ones in those tragic attacks.\nMy own nation is in the throes of terrorism,\nperpetrated by the self-proclaimed Maoists for the last\nseven years. Opposed to constitutional monarchy and\ndemocratic order, the Maoists have broken the\nseven-month ceasefire, withdrawn from the talks and\nunleashed unspeakable violence on the people. They\ndid so even as the Government showed flexibility in\naccommodating several of their demands and put a\ncomprehensive package of reforms on the table.\nHis Majesty\u2019s Government has the duty to protect\nthe life and liberty of the people and to defend freedom\nand democracy in the country. We will do so resolutely\nbut also responsibly. While doing so, we have kept the\ndoor of dialogue open. On behalf of the Government, I\nthank our friends for their understanding and assistance\nin our war against terror and the Secretary-General for\nhis interest and concern.\nClearly, Iraq continues to be a serious issue. Now\nthat the war is over, the global community must agree\nto return sovereignty to the Iraqi people as quickly as\npossible, to let them govern themselves and to help\nthem rebuild their country. The United Nations should\nbe given an enhanced role in this process.\nRenewed violence in the Middle East has\nimperilled the Quartet-endorsed road map, which\npromises a viable State to the Palestinians and security\nto the Israelis. Nepal appeals to both sides to exercise\nmaximum restraint and engage in constructive dialogue\nto attain a comprehensive settlement of the long-\nfestering crisis. It also appeals to Israel to reconsider\nits decision to remove Palestinian President Arafat.\nThe Security Council must take an early decision\nto extend security throughout Afghanistan so that\nrebuilding can go forward in the country. It should also\naugment efforts to resolve conflicts and bring stability\nto volatile countries in Africa and elsewhere.\nNepal has a deep interest in, and unwavering\ncommitment to, United Nations peacekeeping.\nNepalese Blue Helmets have served in various\nmissions in an outstanding manner, and many of them\nhave made the ultimate sacrifice in the service of peace\nand humanity. The United Nations should continue to\n39\n\nhelp poor troop-contributing countries to bridge their\nresources gaps, and give them more say in mission\nplanning and deployment of forces.\nWhile firefighting in crisis situations is urgent,\nthe international community must look beyond the\nimmediacy of conflicts and attempt to build an edifice\nof durable peace in the world. Disarmament,\ndevelopment and the rule of law are the pillars of such\narchitecture. There is a moral case for all of us to work\ntogether towards such peace and it is also a matter of\nenlightened self-interest.\nDisarmament and confidence-building measures\nare critical to building a culture of peace. Nuclear\nweapons are the greatest threat to humanity and must\nbe eliminated, with their delivery vehicles, in a time-\nbound manner. Nuclear-weapon States should steadily\nreduce their nuclear arsenals; the Conference on\nDisarmament must draw up a strategy to eradicate\nthese arms.\nAs a nation committed to peace, Nepal welcomes\nthe proposals to establish nuclear-weapon-free zones\nand to keep outer space free of weapons. We also stress\nthe necessity to reinforce the regimes banning chemical\nand biological weapons and to strengthen measures to\nprevent the access of non-State actors to small arms\nand light weapons.\nNepal supports the regional centres for peace and\ndisarmament as significant tools for building\nconfidence among nations. We eagerly look forward to\nhosting in Kathmandu the Regional Centre for Peace\nand Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific. We have\nasked the Secretariat to revise the draft host country\nagreements so that they are consistent with diplomatic\npractices and with the provisions for the other two\ncentres.\nPoverty is by far the most entrenched threat to\npeace and human dignity, and development is the most\ndaunting challenge for the world. The global\ncommunity must act together to lift people in\ndeveloping countries from the perils of hunger,\nignorance, disease and despair. We must create jobs\nand opportunities to enable people to lead a decent life\nand to raise their stakes in peace and order. Nepal has\naccorded the highest priority to poverty alleviation in\nits current plan, modelled after the Poverty Reduction\nStrategy Papers. Broad-based growth, social sector\ndevelopment, targeted programmes and good\ngovernance constitute the strategy of the plan. We have\nliberalized our economy to foster broader partnership\nwith the private sector, non-governmental\norganizations and community groups and provide a\nwider space for foreign investment.\nImprovements in the agriculture and social\nsectors as well as in rural infrastructure constitute the\ncore of our quest for poverty reduction and sustainable\ndevelopment. However, Nepal lacks sufficient\nresources to achieve its development objectives. Our\nresource constraints have become more acute due to\nMaoist insurgency and consequent economic\ndisruption. Many other developing countries are in a\nsimilar situation.\nThe global community must join forces, in a\nspirit of partnership, to eradicate absolute poverty and\nstimulate development in developing nations. Indeed,\nthe Millennium Summit and global conferences on\nfinancing, sustainable development, HIV/AIDS and\ntrade have clearly laid down the way forward. We must\nensure that these compacts do not fail in the crucible of\nimplementation.\nAs developing countries lead efforts for their\nprogress, development partners must keep their\ncommitments by meeting development assistance\ntargets and providing debt relief to the highly indebted\npoor countries, including the least developed nations.\nIncreasing development assistance alone,\nhowever, will do little to help developing countries\nunless rich nations dismantle their farm subsidies and\npull down their tariff and non-tariff barriers to products\nfrom the South. Improved access to world markets is\ncritical for poor nations to attract investment, remove\ntheir supply-side constraints and transform their\neconomies. In this context, the Cancun trade talks must\nbe resumed soon and in such a manner that\nglobalization brings benefits to the poor as well.\nHis Majesty\u2019s Government is grateful to the\nWorld Trade Organization for deciding to admit Nepal\nand Cambodia as new members. That is just the first\nstep. Nepal needs, as other least developed countries\ndo, duty-free and quota-free access to, and increased\nassistance from, rich nations to escape the poverty trap\nand to integrate itself into the global economy.\nLandlocked developing countries face geographic\nhandicaps and remoteness from the major corridors of\nglobal commerce. We welcome the fact that the Almaty\nProgramme of Action addresses their problem and we\n40\n\nthank the transit and development partners for making\nthe ministerial meeting a success. We urge all sides to\nmake concerted efforts to implement the Almaty\nProgramme of Action.\nDemocracy, fairness and the rule of law are the\nbuilding blocks of secure peace at home and across the\nworld. With this in view, Nepal has embraced\npluralistic democracy, constitutional monarchy, and the\ninviolability of human rights and freedoms as the\ndefining features in our present Constitution.\nOur pledge to these values and ideals remains as\nstrong as ever. Parliamentary elections postponed due\nto the Maoist threat will be held as soon as possible,\nand immediate steps will be taken to restore and\nreactivate local authorities. The Government is\nseriously committed to doing this.\nThe Government has accorded high priority to\nraising the status of women, children and\ndisadvantaged people, as well as to preventing\ntrafficking in women. It has established juvenile courts\nand strengthened the court system, and has tried to give\nthe human rights protection and anti-corruption\nagencies the necessary tools and resources to do their\njob.\nNepal firmly believes that the world community\nshould try its level best to promote democracy, justice\nand fairness in world trade, global governance and\ninternational relations. In this spirit, we underscore the\nimperative need for change in the global trade regime,\nfor reform in the international financial architecture\nand for help to developing countries to overcome their\nproblems.\nSpeaking of justice, nearly 100,000 Bhutanese\nrefugees living in camps in Nepal have been waiting\nfor over a decade to return home in safety and dignity.\nWe hope Bhutan will show more flexibility in the\nbilateral negotiations to find an early and just\nsettlement. We call on the world community, including\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner\nfor Refugees (UNHCR), to help create a climate\nconducive for resolving this distressing humanitarian\nproblem by sustaining its interest and assistance for the\nmaintenance of the refugees at this crucial juncture.\nNo organization can stand the test of time unless\nit is prepared to carry out bold reforms. Events in the\nrun-up to the Iraq war have shown the frailty of the\nUnited Nations and underlined the imperative for\nimmediate and balanced reforms for the Organization\nto secure more legitimacy, not only in the eyes of the\nrich but also in the perception of the poor.\nWhile we welcome the reforms the General\nAssembly adopted last year, we support the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s proposal to set up a high-level panel to seek\nways to make the United Nations a vibrant, effective\nand efficient Organization, which can come to grips\nwith emerging challenges.\nAs we see it, it is imperative for the General\nAssembly to reclaim its primacy at the United Nations\nand for the Economic and Social Council to make its\nwork more visible and relevant to ordinary people. To\nachieve these objectives, we must not only rationalize\nthe agendas of those organs but also ensure that they\nadopt fewer but more relevant resolutions \u2014\nresolutions that could be implemented to benefit\nhumanity.\nReforms are long overdue to make the Security\nCouncil more democratic in its work and more\nrepresentative in its structure. Nepal expresses its deep\nconcern at the lack of tangible progress for over a\ndecade on the issue of Council enlargement and urges\nall Member States to scale up their efforts to achieve\nthat goal. In our view, the Non-Aligned Movement\nshould play an active role in United Nations reform. It\nshould also work closely with the G-77 to advance\ntheir shared agenda in this and other respects.\nIn South Asia, as elsewhere, we view regional\ncooperation as an instrument of South-South\ncooperation for collective progress in the region and\nthe world at large. The South Asian Association for\nRegional Cooperation (SAARC) has been inspired by\nthat aspiration. Let us hope our region can put its\npolitical differences behind it and steam ahead to find\nthe place South Asia deserves in the community of\nnations.\nIf our immediate and overriding preoccupation at\nhome is the restoration of peace, our commitment to\nregional cooperation and a just and secure world\nconstitutes an objective of equal order. The world has\nwitnessed the resilience of the Nepalese people during\nthe difficult periods in our history. We remain equally\ncommitted today to overcome the current challenge. I\ncall on friends and well-wishers of Nepal for greater\nunderstanding and cooperation to help us help\nourselves in our onward journey to peace and progress.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI am honoured to\nparticipate, on behalf of Mr. Moses Zeh Blah, President\nof the Republic of Liberia, in the general debate of the\n6\n\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-eighth session, and to\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at this session. I\nexpress the confidence of the Government of Liberia\nthat you will faithfully honour the responsibilities\nwhich you have been assigned.\nI also wish to commend Mr. Jan Kavan of the\nCzech Republic for the able manner in which he\nsteered the activities of the fifty-seventh session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nUndoubtedly, Mr. Kofi Annan deserves the\ncommendation of this Assembly for his stewardship of\nour global Organization and the excellent leadership\nwhich he exudes in the resolution of international\nquestions, ranging from terrorism to the deadly AIDS\npandemic and from poverty to the imbalance in global\ntrade and commerce.\nWe must also pay a special tribute to Sergio\nVieira de Mello and other United Nations workers who\nlost their lives in selfless humanitarian service in Iraq.\nThose citizens of the world embodied the spirit of the\nUnited Nations and are true representatives of the\nconscience of humanity.\nTerrorism, the menace to international peace and\nsecurity, has brought immeasurable grief to the world.\nActs of terrorism have elicited neither the\nunderstanding nor the empathy of the world for causes\nto which terrorists may aspire. Contrarily, acts of\nterrorism have rightly ignited widespread disdain and\nrevulsion for their perpetrators. Today, terrorism seeks\nto undermine our collective freedom and therefore\nrequires our collective will and efforts to combat this\ncommon enemy.\nHowever, this objective is being undermined by\nthe lack of international consensus. The unwillingness\nto garner and work along lines of international\nconsensus has exposed cracks in our efforts to fight\nterrorism, bringing into scrutiny the structure of this\nworld body and the continued relevance of the Security\nCouncil. When the Security Council appears divided on\nfundamental questions of international security, the\nworld becomes vulnerable. A divided Security Council\nfertilizes the grounds for the germination of\ninternational terror and insecurity. If the Security\nCouncil is to serve as the guarantor of international\npeace and security, then that organ must of necessity be\nguided by mechanisms that ensure the judicious\ndevelopment of consensus and respect for and\nadherence to international law.\nAdditionally, our united condemnation of and\nfight against terrorism must never stoop to the\nemployment of methods not far removed from those\nused by terrorists themselves. To fight fire with fire\nwill leave our global village without a single hut. We\nmust muster the will to tackle the issues that are\nexploited by terrorists and terrorist organizations.\nThe conflict in the Middle East has inescapably\nattracted the attention of the world, posing the greatest\nchallenge to international peace and security. We are\nsaddened by and deeply concerned about the recent\nturn of events, which has occasioned the virtual\ndebunking of the road map for peace and ensured a\nclassic return to violence. Admittedly, there are serious\ndifficulties in the search for peace for our brothers and\nsisters of that troubled region. However, these\ndifficulties should neither beset us with a sense of\nhopelessness nor obscure the agonies and the fears that\nhave come to characterize the way of life in the Middle\nEast.\nWe therefore call on the Government of Israel and\nthe Palestinian Authority to recognize the right to\nexistence of each other within recognized international\nborders and to foster pragmatic approaches to dialogue,\npeace, security and the virtues of good-\nneighbourliness. At the same time, we urge the\nSecurity Council to develop, strengthen and maintain\ninternational consensus on the way forward.\nWith respect to the Liberian crisis, since our last\naddress to this Assembly, Liberia has wrestled and\ncontinues to wrestle with serious political and security\nchallenges. An insurgency that began four years ago\nreached the Liberian capital, Monrovia. Unsurprisingly,\nan already deteriorating humanitarian situation\nworsened, accompanied by the widespread breakdown\nof law and order. Regrettably, while recognizing the\nintensification of the war in Liberia and the right of the\nLiberian people to self-defence, the Security Council\nmaintained an arms embargo on the Government. This\nsituation catalysed the rapid advance of the insurgents\nand bestowed upon their cause a false sense of\ninternational approbation. The Liberian State teetered\non the verge of disintegration.\nBut for the resilience of the people of Liberia and\nthe timely intervention of the Economic Community of\nWest African States (ECOWAS) and the International\n7\n\nContact Group on Liberia, Liberia would have slipped\ninto the abyss of unbridled anarchy. We will therefore\nremain eternally grateful to ECOWAS, and particularly\nto the Governments and peoples of the Federal\nRepublic of Nigeria and Ghana, for their leadership in\nthe quest to stabilize the situation in my country. In a\nsimilar manner, the Government of Liberia expresses\nimmense gratitude to the Government of the United\nStates of America, the United Nations, the European\nUnion and the African Union for their respective roles\nin and continued support for the ongoing efforts to\nrestore lasting peace, security and democracy to\nLiberia. We must also pay special tribute to the support\nof the Governments of South Africa and Mozambique.\nOn 11 August 2003, with the deployment of a\nvanguard force from the friendly Government of the\nFederal Republic of Nigeria, the promise of a smooth\ntransfer of power was remarkably fulfilled. This\ndevelopment energized the signing, on 18 August in\nAccra, Republic of Ghana, of a Comprehensive Peace\nAgreement. The Agreement establishes a framework\nfor the formation and installation of a transitional\nGovernment, the disarmament, demobilization and\nreintegration of combatants and the restructuring of the\nnational security apparatus. It also provides for the\nrepatriation and resettlement of refugees and internally\ndisplaced persons, the rebuilding of the nation\u2019s\nproductive capacity and the creation of democratic\nspace for the conduct of free, fair and credible\nelections in 2005. These goals cannot be achieved\nwithout concerted multinational collaboration and\nassistance.\nThe Government of Liberia welcomes the\nadoption of Security Council resolution 1509 (2003),\nwhich establishes the United Nations Mission in\nLiberia. We pledge our cooperation and support to the\nrealization of the objectives set out in the resolution.\nComprehensive disarmament, demobilization and a\nsustained programme of reintegration and resettlement\nare sine qua non to peace, security and stability in\nLiberia and the West African subregion. The\nGovernment of Liberia is therefore beholden to the\ninternational community, with gratitude for its\ncontinuous assistance and support in the search for\npeace and security in Liberia and the West African\nsubregion. However, unless democratic expressions\nand aspirations are allowed to flourish through\nstrengthened democratic institutions, and unless an\nalternative source of livelihood is provided the\ndisarmed combatants, the gains obtained through the\nsupport of the international community could be\ngrievously undermined.\nIn this respect, resolution 1509 (2003), which\nengenders new hope for Liberia, appears to be\ncontradicted by the demands of resolution 1343 (2001).\nThat resolution imposes and maintains a regime of\nsanctions and other restrictions on Liberia. Unarguably,\neconomic sanctions imposed under resolution 1343\n(2001) becloud Liberia with an undeserved stigma that,\nin effect, discourages the flow of much-needed\ninternational investment into the private sector to\nsupport Liberia\u2019s post-conflict reconstruction and\ndevelopment programmes and restricts the essential\nflow of energy needed to revive Liberia\u2019s economic\ninfrastructure.\nA vibrant private sector is the key to Liberia\u2019s\nrecovery and the cure to problems of unemployment,\nwhich provides stimulus to social unrest and political\ninstability. If sanctions, smart or targeted, are tools to\naccomplish political objectives, then they must respond\naffirmatively to the realization of the objectives. One\ndoes not administer medication to a dead person nor\ndoes one take medication to cure the illness of another.\nThe Government of Liberia therefore calls on the\nSecurity Council to lift its regime of economic\nsanctions imposed on the country.\nIn situations such as ours, international goodwill\nand assistance are often accompanied by the temptation\nto ignore indigenous expertise largely in favour of\nexpatriates. The net effect of adherence to such\ntemptation is the development of structures and\ninstitutions that are neither manageable nor sustainable\nby the beneficiaries after the departure of the\nexpatriates. Even so, Liberia is blessed with its share of\nendowments in human and natural resources. As can be\nexpected, years of political turmoil, conflict and\nmismanagement have resulted in the massive exodus of\nLiberia\u2019s human resources. Welcoming a new\nopportunity to rebuild a more democratic, accountable\nand coherent society, Liberians are desperate to return\nhome and contribute. To that end, it is the desire and\nexpectation of the Government and people of Liberia\nthat, as much as is possible, Liberians will be\nemployed at all levels in the post-conflict\nreconstruction and rehabilitation of their country.\nLiberia is a founding Member of this world body.\nIrrespective of the current problems we face and our\n8\n\nneed for international assistance, Liberia will remain a\nrespectable member of the international community.\nWe intend to uphold our sovereign dignity in the\nconduct of international affairs. Liberia cannot and will\nnot be a subject of trusteeship.\nLike most third-world nations, Liberia is deeply\nindebted to several international financial institutions\nand organizations. We are grateful to our creditors for\ntheir patience and understanding. Determined as we are\nto survive, we count on the empathy of the\ninternational community to treat our indebtedness with\nthe uniqueness that it deserves and pledge our\ncommitment to working along with those institutions in\ndeveloping appropriate mechanisms to deal with\nLiberia\u2019s debt. Servicing these debts remains a priority\nfor the Government of Liberia. However, our capacity\nto make payment is limited by manifold problems\noccasioned by several years of continuous warfare.\nI should now like to turn to the case of the\nRepublic of China. The General Assembly must\nconfront the moral and legal challenges posed by the\nexclusion of more than 23 million people from\nrepresentation in this world body. How else are we to\nexplain the denial of the rights of a progressive and\nindustrious people from representation at the level of\nthe General Assembly? The fact remains that the\nGovernment and people of the Republic of China on\nTaiwan have, and continue to engage in, responsible\nself-governance. It is incontestable that the people of\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan continue to\nsignificantly contribute to the improvement of the\nhuman family. Their achievements in the spheres of\nscience and technology, commerce and trade, and the\narts and culture cannot be ignored.\nThe undaunted spirit of the great people of the\nRepublic of China aspires to participate in the United\nNations. Liberia is convinced that the participation of\nboth sides of the Taiwan Strait in the activities of\ninternational organizations will encourage greater\nunderstanding and mutual trust between the two sides.\nThat is consistent with the spirit of preventive\ndiplomacy advocated by the United Nations. Liberia\ntherefore reiterates its call for the admission of the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan to the United Nations and\nits specialized agencies, as well as the assumption of\nits rightful place in the discourse and transaction of\nworld affairs.\nIn conclusion, Liberia is today in urgent need of\ninternational assistance and support. While our\nsituation appears to be grim, it is certainly not\nhopeless. While many of our compatriots may have lost\nlives and limbs, we are still a forgiving people. While\nour national infrastructure may have been destroyed,\nwe are still a resilient people. While our dignity may\nhave been impinged upon, we are still a proud people.\nWe Liberians are unified in our determination to work\nfor a better and brighter future. We are united in\nfostering the faith of our founding fathers to build a\nnation dedicated to freedom, liberty and justice for all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Allow me to extend\nmy wishes of success to the other members of the\nBureau.\nI also take this opportunity to commend your\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, for the skill with which he\nguided our work at the last session.\nTo Secretary-General Kofi Annan, I wish to\nreiterate, in the context of the current international\nscene, Cameroon\u2019s expression of great pride and trust\nin him and his role as a facilitator in the settlement of\ninter-African conflicts. I thank him for his energetic\nand tireless activity in the service of the great ideals of\nthe Organization.\nOur Organization was created to preserve future\ngenerations from the scourge of war, to create\nconditions in which all can enjoy dignified lives, and to\npromote respect for human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms. The United Nations was created to ensure\nthe reign of peace at the service of humankind. As\nPope John XXIII recalled in his encyclical Pacem in\nTerris, which was addressed to all men of good will\nand the fortieth anniversary of which we celebrate this\nyear, that peace rests on four indispensable conditions\ncorresponding to four specific necessities of the human\nspirit: truth, justice, charity and liberty. Our heads of\nState trod the same path at the Millennium Summit.\nThey undertook to free humankind from warfare and\npoverty, to promote human rights and to strengthen the\nUnited Nations. We felt that it would be useful to recall\nthose principles because the picture of the world that\nhas emerged in this general debate since 23 September\nis not a very optimistic one.\nOn 19 August, the United Nations was struck by\ntragedy. The terrorist attack that destroyed the United\nNations headquarters in Baghdad and struck and killed\ndozens of innocent victims, including Sergio Vieira de\nMello, Special Representative of the Secretary-General\nfor Iraq, posed a great challenge to the principles and\nvalues that are the bedrock of our Organization. At the\ntime, President Paul Biya expressed on behalf of\nCameroon expressed his profound indignation and\nfirmly condemned that odious, criminal act. Tomorrow,\nwe will weep with the people of Iraq for the tragic\ndeath \u2014 again in Baghdad \u2014 of Akila Al-Hashemi, a\nhighly talented diplomat and eminent member of the\nIraqi Governing Council.\nCameroon is proud that our Organization did not\nshirk its responsibilities or even weaken in its resolve\nto play a central role in the stabilization, orderly\nrestoration of the sovereignty and reconstruction of\nIraq and to support the political process under way.\nFollowing upon the long series of terrorist acts\ncommitted throughout the world since the tragedy of 11\nSeptember 2001, the 19 August attack in Baghdad was\na timely reminder of the vulnerability of our world\ntoday. The complexity of the challenge and the gravity\nof the danger require us to step up our collective efforts\neffectively to confront terrorism, which today poses\nperhaps the most serious threat to international peace\nand security. Cameroon again calls for a high-level\nconference to be convened to define a collective\norganized response by the international community to\nterrorism.\nIn addition to new threats to international peace\nand security, such as terrorism and the proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction, there are other, equally\ndangerous, threats: all sorts of pandemics, including\nHIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, and despair\nstemming from almost endemic poverty.\nTherefore, our joint mobilization should be aimed\nprimarily at reducing or even eliminating the germs\nand causes of conflicts and despair.\nIn the Middle East, we must demand that the\nparties to the conflict \u2014 Israel and Palestine \u2014 return\nwithout delay to the negotiating table to agree on\nmodalities conducive to the rapid and comprehensive\nimplementation of the road map. Cameroon regrets and\ncondemns the escalation of violence, which is seriously\n26\n\nendangering any peaceful solution based on the letter\nand spirit of Security Council resolution 1397 (2002),\nadopted with no vote against. In it the Council affirmed\n\u201cthe vision of a region where two States, Israel\nand Palestine, live side by side within secure and\nrecognized borders\u201d.\nOur Palestinian and Israeli friends must get used\nto the idea that they are condemned to live side by side,\nto coexist in the geopolitical configuration forged by\ntheir rich, common history. To that end, Israelis and\nPalestinians will have to disarm \u2014 of course, in terms\nof weapon policies, but primarily disarm at the cultural\nlevel by unanimously and sincerely ridding their hearts\nof fear and the psychosis of war. The axiom that peace\nresults from a balance of war-making ability and\nweapons should be replaced by the principle that real\npeace can be built only on mutual trust.\nThe same applies to the peoples of the renowned\nMesopotamia, who are emerging from three decades of\ntyranny, and must very soon, with the help of the\ninternational community, have their full dignity and\nsovereignty restored in a stable and prosperous Iraq,\nliving in peace with all its neighbours.\nOver the past year, the many conflicts that have\nbloodied Africa have remained at the centre of the\nconcerns of the United Nations, which has made many\nefforts to end them. Fortunately, those efforts are\nbeginning to yield results. Some African conflicts are\non the way to being resolved, nourishing new and\nlegitimate hopes. Unfortunately, despite everything,\nthere are still deplorable situations where the\nprotagonists are having trouble finding a negotiated\npolitical solution or keeping their commitments. We are\nconvinced that there will soon be results, given genuine\npolitical will on the part of the major actors. The\nirreplaceable support they receive from the United\nNations deserves to be welcomed and recognized.\nAfrica in general and our subregion in particular\nare fully aware of the role this important partner plays\nin our economic development, in consolidating\ndemocracy and the rule of law, and, finally, in\npromoting peace and security within and outside our\ncountries. That is why the member States of the\nEconomic Community of Central African States\n(ECCAS) have forcefully expressed their desire to\nstrengthen their cooperation with the United Nations\nthrough a political presence of that Organization in the\nsubregion, which would bolster our subregional\ncapacities, particularly in the area of peace and\nsecurity.\nIn that connection, Cameroon reiterates its thanks\nto the Secretary-General for sending a\nmultidisciplinary mission to Central Africa last June at\nthe request of the members of the Security Council. We\nawait with interest its innovative recommendations,\nwhich will shortly be made to the Security Council.\nThey will nourish the debate to be held in this Hall on\nthe agenda item entitled \u201cCooperation between the\nUnited Nations and the Economic Community of\nCentral African States\u201d.\nWe welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s suggestions\nconcerning the functioning of the Organization in this\nconstantly changing world. We will fully support any\nreform that will bring the Organization closer to our\npeoples, as envisaged by the measures for strengthened\ncooperation between the United Nations and Central\nAfrican organizations.\nIn the Millennium Declaration, the political\nleaders of the world committed themselves to creating\na world partnership for development and to respond to\nthe special needs of Africa. The New Partnership for\nAfrica\u2019s Development (NEPAD), whereby Africa has\ndecided to take back the initiative and to control its\nown fate, can serve as a sound platform for a fruitful\npartnership between the continent and the international\ncommunity.\nAfrica is waiting for multiple responses. One,\nwhich will play a decisive part in the growth of our\ncontinent, is linked to trade. What African States want\nand aspire to is to play a more important part in the\ntrade of goods and services. That implies in particular\nstandards favouring fair competition.\nThe failure of the recent World Trade\nOrganization Ministerial Conference held at Canc\u00fan\nhas raised grave doubts, particularly among African\ncountries that export agricultural products. The\ntremendous reluctance of wealthy nations to dismantle\ntheir agricultural subsidy regimes is puzzling, and\nseriously threatens the survival of African economies\nbased on agriculture and livestock. The subsidies given\nto that sector are stifling millions of farmers and cotton\nproducers in Central and West Africa.\nIn the same context, Mr. President, your country,\nSaint Lucia, and Cameroon have been carrying out an\nepic battle for almost a decade for the survival of our\n27\n\nbanana industries, which are up against the giants of\nthe sector.\nThere are many more examples of the need for\nsolidarity and urgent reform of the multilateral\neconomic system. We hope that the Doha round will\nnot deviate from its main objective \u2014 development \u2014\nand that it will take well into consideration the\nconcerns of the poorest in order to integrate them\npromptly into the global economy.\nGlobalization does not relate only to trade. It also\naffects human development and new technologies, the\nprotection of the ecosystem and the sustainable\ndevelopment of water and other natural resources. All\nof those aspects require a concerted approach, given\nthat the sacrifices of some work to everyone\u2019s\nadvantage. Cameroon, which has chosen, for example,\nto participate in rational and sustainable management\nof the world forest ecosystem, has established a bold\nnational environmental management plan.\nIt is clear that, in order to effectively implement\nsuch policies without exposing its rural populations to\nextreme poverty, our country needs significant\nfinancial assistance, particularly to diversify its\nproduction and to ensure systematic transformation of\nits natural resources. In other words, today, more than\never before, solidarity should rhyme with\npartnership \u2014 and globalization with fair trade \u2014 to\nensure the comprehensive and orderly development of\nour world.\nThe United Nations assuredly remains the only\nuniversal Organization that not only possesses the\nnecessary competencies and impartiality, but is also the\nonly entity that can confer legitimacy on any\nmultilateral action tackling the great world challenges,\na number of which we have just listed. To attain these\nnoble objectives, it urgently needs to consider in depth\nits current approaches, the way it operates and its\nimplementing mechanisms.\nCameroon unreservedly supports the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s initiative to establish a high-level panel of\neminent personalities to consider ways to strengthen\nthe United Nations. We hopefully await their\ncontribution to the Organization\u2019s necessary and\nunavoidable reform to improve its performance,\nincluding its missions of an economic and social nature\nas well as international peace and security.\nThe Secretary-General invites us to go further\nalong the path of reform, to which he has been\ncommitted for several years. He is right. What is at\nstake is the Organization\u2019s very effectiveness, which it\nneeds to tackle the great challenges of our time. He can\ncount on Cameroon\u2019s support.\nAs I have been concluding my remarks, the light\nhas changed from green to yellow and from yellow to\nred. How can one refrain from prolonging his\ncomments when it is a question of humanity and\nhumanity\u2019s future through peace, a negotiated peace, a\nconcerted peace, a peace that rests on justice and the\nequitable distribution of benefits and wealth?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffSeldom has the world's\nattention been so focused on the United Nations;\nseldom has so much been expected of this\nOrganization. The question now being asked\nthroughout the world is: Is the United Nations\nexperiencing the deepest crisis in its history, and does\nit still play a fundamental role in international\nrelations?'\nToday, at the beginning of the twenty-first\ncentury, the main reason for the existence of our\nOrganization is the same as it was 60 years ago: to\nmaintain world peace, reached at the cost of millions of\nlives; and to contribute, in an ongoing manner, to the\nwell-being of humankind all over the world.\nWe live in a world where no one can go it alone,\nwithout the help of others, however big and powerful\nthey may be. Global solutions require the concerted\nand united efforts of all countries and of all the\ninhabitants of our planet.\nOur Organization is a joint effort by the world\ncommunity that is persistently searching for solutions\nto the ever-growing problems of our time. I emphasize\nthe phrase our Organization', for sometimes it seems\nthat we expect the United Nations administration alone\nto solve our problems. We tend to forget that the\n27\n\nUnited Nations is not some abstract institution with a\nwill of its own   one that we depend on   but that the\nUnited Nations is the will of each and every one of its\n191 Member States. We alone are responsible for the\nwill, the decisions, the work and the activities of the\nUnited Nations.\nThere is no doubt whatsoever that the United\nNations needs to be reformed. In this connection,\nCroatia welcomes and fully supports the Secretary-\nGeneral's September report on the implementation of\nthe Millennium Declaration. When discussing our\nOrganization's reform, especially reform of the\nSecurity Council, but also that of the General\nAssembly, we must be aware that this is a matter of our\nown political will and readiness to accept change.\nUnfortunately, and this should be openly stated,\nso far there has not been enough political will to move\nfrom debates on the subject to actual reform. Croatia is\nconvinced that reform of the Security Council is\nnecessary and should no longer be put off. In fact, we\nourselves decided in the Millennium Declaration that\nwe would intensify joint efforts to achieve\ncomprehensive reforms of the Security Council in all\nits aspects. We have an opportunity to do this at this\nsession of the General Assembly.\nCroatia has never been a member of the Security\nCouncil. However, in the 1990s Croatia acquired\nconsiderable experience in the work of that organ and\nlearned about its good points and its shortcomings, its\nimportance and its true scope. Therefore, unless it\nadapts to the new realities in international relations, the\nCouncil will not be able to maintain its credibility and\nauthority in all parts of the world. What is required is\nadherence to the principle of equitable representation\nof all United Nations Members in the Security Council.\nCroatia is prepared further to intensify its\nactivities as an active promoter of regional and world\npeace. With this in mind, Croatia has presented its\ncandidacy for membership in the Security Council for\nthe 2008-2009 mandate. Croatia's membership in the\nSecurity Council would represent a great tribute to my\ncountry and a recognition of all that has been achieved\nin bringing peace to South-eastern Europe, which has\nfound the strength, after many years of war, to embrace\nthe path of good-neighbourly relations.\nThe fight against international terrorism is high\non Croatia's list of priorities. Two years after the 11\nSeptember terrorist attacks on the United States, we\nstand firmly by our American allies and all those who\nrefuse to accept terror, fanaticism and killing as a\nmeans of resolving problems between peoples and\ncountries. Our collective duty to maintain international\npeace and security, which stems from the Charter of the\nUnited Nations, provides an international framework\nfor a decisive response to terrorism in the twenty-first\ncentury.\nCroatia's forces are participating in bringing\npeace and stability to Afghanistan. Croatia is aware of\nthe fact that concerted action by all democratic\ncountries is the best response to terrorism. The fight\nagainst terrorism requires not only action by the\ndemocratic coalition at a global level, but also that of\neach of its members at the national and regional levels.\nIt is equally important that we intensify our activities\nto assist countries lagging behind in economic\ndevelopment and other areas. Inequality, injustice and\nignorance are fertile breeding grounds for the seeds of\nterrorism.\nCroatia is still dealing with the consequences of\nthe war imposed on it and does not have the economic\nresources to participate as a donor in the action for the\nreconstruction of Iraq. However, Croatia stands ready\nto offer its wealth of experience in post-war\nreconstruction, especially in construction work, as well\nas the knowledge and operative capacities required for\ndealing with post-war confidence-building,\nstrengthening the country's stability, normalizing life,\nand mending the tears left by the war in the fabric of\ncivil society. I am thinking in particular of the\nknowledge and experience acquired in civil police\ntraining and activities.\nEvents in the Middle East confirm that greater\ncourage is required to reach a compromise and ensure\ncoexistence than to wage battles; Croatia knows this all\ntoo well. We are also aware of the importance of timely\nresolutions of the Security Council and General\nAssembly, which must be fine-tuned to meet the\nchallenges and needs of the peace process, keeping\nabreast of realities in the field and encouraging a\ngreatly needed agreement. We hope that in its\nforthcoming work the General Assembly will take this\ninto account when adopting new resolutions on the\nMiddle East.\nThe importance of United Nations peacekeeping\noperations has been recognized on many occasions.\nThe mandate and character of peacekeeping operations\n28\n\nhave been significantly transformed, from operations\naimed primarily at disengaging warring parties into\ncomplex missions for building democratic systems,\nprotecting and promoting human rights, strengthening\ncivil society and establishing the groundwork for the\nsustainable development of independent States.\nThis complexity, and the frequent overlapping of\nmandates, requires a high degree of expertise in\nvarious areas: from holding democratic elections and\ndeveloping judicial systems to establishing police and\nmilitary forces that meet international standards and\nbasic international legal regulations.\nThe United Nations is the only global institution\nthat can respond to the challenges of simultaneously\nestablishing regional stability, introducing post-war\nreconstruction and building a democratic society.\nThe United Nations has paid a high price in its\npeace efforts. I would like to take this occasion to once\nagain express Croatia's condolences to the families of\nthe victims of the recent barbaric attacks on United\nNations headquarters in Baghdad, and to re-emphasize\nthat such attacks strengthen our belief that the\ndevelopment of collective security systems and global\nsolidarity must continue.\nCroatia is currently participating in five United\nNations peacekeeping missions   in Ethiopia and\nEritrea, India and Pakistan, Sierra Leone, Timor-Leste\nand Western Sahara.\nWe are determined to further intensify our\nparticipation in United Nations peacekeeping missions,\nin line with our physical and financial capabilities\nregarding the composition and number of troops\ndeployed, as well as theatres of operation. Croatia feels\nthat as a country that received United Nations\npeacekeeping forces at a time when its sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity were attacked, and as a country\nwhich hosted one of the United Nations most extensive\noperations, it now has a moral obligation to contribute\nthis experience to securing peace and prosperity in\nother parts of the world.\nI would particularly like to stress the importance\nof closer cooperation between the Security Council and\ntroop contributing countries. We welcome the positive\nchanges that have so far occurred in this respect. It is\nalso important to ensure the necessary exchange of\nviews between the Security Council and the countries\non whose territory the peacekeeping operations are\nbeing conducted. This is not only a question of due\nrespect of those countries' sovereignty, but it is also a\nway of acquiring full insight into its needs and\npriorities.\nI also believe that there is the need for the\nestablishment of closer links and better coordination in\nthe work of the United Nations main bodies, especially\nbetween the Economic and Social Council and the\nSecurity Council. The Economic and Social Council\nand its commissions possess exceptional knowledge\nand experience important for the building of post-\nconflict societies, something we were able to see for\nourselves last year when Croatia presided over this\nbody. The establishment of working groups for Guinea-\nBissau and for Burundi were steps in the right\ndirection, and we hope that this experience will be used\nto further the involvement of the Economic and Social\nCouncil in processes of maintaining and building\npeace.\nThe Millennium Declaration, this joint vision of\nall United Nations members for a more just and better\nworld, is a beacon we must follow. Not only must we\nfollow it, we must ensure that its goals are fully\nimplemented. In this context, Croatia would like to see\nthe Economic and Social Council play a greater role in\nthe general implementation of the Millennium\nDeclaration. Therefore, Croatia supports the idea of a\nhigh-level dialogue on the achievement of the Goals set\nout in the Millennium Declaration taking place at the\nnext General Assembly session.\nAs a member of the United Nations Commission\non Human Rights, Croatia supports the universal\nratification of international instruments in the field of\nhuman rights. The Commission should continue\nunhindered in its activities while carrying out its\nmandate. In an effort to promote and protect the human\nrights of all people, Croatia is devoting special\nattention to the human rights of women, children,\nrefugees and disabled persons, and to the human rights\nof members of national minorities.\nAlthough much has been done in the past period\nto improve the position of women in society and\npromote principles of gender equality, the international\ncommunity still has an obligation to intensify efforts to\nprevent all forms of violence against women, and must\ntry to include women in decision-making processes,\nensuring empowerment of women at all levels. Against\nthis background I am proud to say that Croatia has\n29\n\nprovided the first woman participant in the United\nNations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan.\nApart from terrorism, one of the biggest security\nthreats in the world is the proliferation of nuclear and\nother weapons of mass destruction. The\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is, we\nbelieve, particularly important in ensuring that the goal\nof nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament is\nattained. We are concerned by the fact that although the\nTreaty was opened for signature and ratification seven\nyears ago, it still has not entered into force. The\nuniversal character of this Treaty is of great\nsignificance and we call on all States that have not\nacceded to the Treaty to do so as soon as possible.\nCroatia welcomes the efforts of the Secretary-\nGeneral and the United Nations to raise the level of\nawareness throughout the world of the importance of\nthe rule of law and of acceding to international\ninstruments in this area. As a member State of the\nRome Statute of the International Criminal Court,\nCroatia has actively participated in the pioneering\nendeavour of setting up a new international order\nsymbolized by the International Criminal Court, which\nhas rightly been termed the embodiment of our\ncollective conscience.\nCroatia is firmly set on the path of accession to\nthe European Union. Croatia, whose strategic national\ngoal is to join the European Union, remains dedicated\nto the continual promotion of friendly relations with all\nits neighbours and to the policy of open borders,\nallowing the flow of people, goods and services, but\nalso to that of keeping its borders firmly closed to all\nforms of transnational crime and illegal migration.\nCroatia will continue to actively participate in\nregional, European and worldwide initiatives and\norganizations, respecting all its international\nobligations. For us, the United Nations remains a\ncentral point for resolving problems in international\nrelations and for promoting the interests of mankind. I\nam certain that this year's General Assembly session\nwill reconfirm the importance of the United Nations\nand open a new chapter in our organization's activities\nin building peace and security.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, I\nwould like to join the international community in\npaying tribute to the late Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello,\nall United Nations personnel who lost their lives and\nthose wounded by the terrorist attack on the United\nNations headquarters in Baghdad. We strongly\ncondemn that cowardly terrorist attack and reaffirm our\ncommitment to supporting the United Nations in\npaving the way for the stability, security and\nsovereignty of Iraq.\nOn behalf of the Government and people of\nThailand, I wish to extend my sincere congratulations\nto Mr. Julian Hunte of Saint Lucia upon his election to\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-\neighth session. I am confident that, under his wise and\nexemplary leadership, this session, held at such a\ndifficult time, will lead to a fruitful conclusion. I also\nwish to take this opportunity to commend his\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, whose tireless efforts have\nsteered the United Nations along a constructive path\nduring a year of difficult challenges.\nThis session meets at a most critical juncture or,\nas the Secretary-General put it in his address: \u201cWe have\ncome to a fork in the road\u201d (A/58/PV.7). This road was\nmeant to build a multilateral system to ensure a better\nworld for the human race. It is at this critical juncture\nthat the threats and challenges to multilateralism of the\npast 12 months have underscored, more than ever, that\nin order to collectively confront these threats and\nchallenges to global peace, security and prosperity, the\n23\n\nworld cannot do without multilateralism. But, as\nechoed by many from this rostrum, the big question is:\nhow?\nAs the foremost multilateral institution, the\nUnited Nations needs to carry out its mission in the\ncontext of these realities. The Secretary-General has\nexpounded his far-sighted initiative for the proposed\nreforms of the institutions and the establishment of a\nhigh-level panel of eminent personalities. Thailand\nlends its support to the Secretary-General\u2019s noble\nendeavour and hopes that, during the next session, he\nwill come up with a proposal that will take us on the\nright path.\nMany different views, agreements and\ndisagreements have been expressed in this Hall in this\ngeneral debate. This illustrates that the international\ncommunity must learn to live with and be tolerant of\ndifferences. We may differ in culture, religion and\nvalues, but our differences and diversities must not\nbecome the sources of hostility. They must be a source\nof our combined strength to enhance partnership and\nmultilateralism. We believe that the promotion of true\npartnership and human security will help the United\nNations mission in fulfilling its noble goals.\nFrom Timor-Leste to Sierra Leone and Bosnia\nand Herzegovina, the international community can be\nproud of forging partnership in peacekeeping\noperations under the framework of the United Nations.\nThailand is proud to be one of the 89 countries\nparticipating in United Nations peacekeeping\noperations and wishes to reiterate its commitment to\ncontinuing this partnership wherever and whenever\nneeded through its participation in the United Nations\nstandby arrangements system. For its part, Thailand\nremains firmly committed to supporting United Nations\nreconstruction and peace-building efforts, as we have\ndone in the past in Timor-Leste and Afghanistan.\nThailand has already contributed $250,000 to Iraq\nthrough the International Committee of the Red Cross\nand is committed to providing another $500,000 for\ndried halal food. Military construction engineers and\nmedical personnel are also being dispatched to Iraq to\nprovide further humanitarian assistance. We hope that\npeace can eventually reign in the region.\nNo one deserves peace, stability and a prosperous\nfuture more than the peoples of the Middle East. Far\ntoo long have the people of that region suffered from\nviolence, acts of terror and despair. We call upon the\ninternational community to come together in\naddressing this problem. All sides must seize the\nopportunity to embark on the road towards a just and\ncomprehensive peace so that the people of Israel and\nthe people of Palestine can at last live in peace,\nsecurity and harmony.\nTerrorism spares no one, strong or weak, rich or\npoor. To succeed against terrorism, there is no other\nway but to be united. The Government of Thailand has\nworked very closely with the international community\nto rid the world of this scourge. Domestic legislation\nhas been amended in order to enable Thailand to cope\nwith terrorist activities and to suppress the financing of\nterrorism more effectively. We take no second chances\nin our fight against international terrorism.\nAs freedom from fear and freedom from want are\nthe two major components of human security, it is clear\nthat human security cannot be achieved simply because\na country wants to do it all alone. Rather, human\nsecurity is achieved because all countries decide to do\nit all together. It is achieved because countries are\nwilling to forge a partnership out of their differences to\nbuild strength for human security.\nThat is why Thailand considers its membership of\nthe Human Security Network an important partnership\nstrength, complementary to the core values of the\nUnited Nations for the promotion of peace and security,\neconomic and social development, human rights,\nhumanitarian affairs and international law. Only two\nweeks ago, Thailand was proud and honoured to have\nhosted the Fifth Meeting of States Parties to the\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and\non Their Destruction. It was the first time this Meeting\nhas come to Asia, where land mines are a threat to the\nsecurity of hundreds of millions of people. Throughout\nour presidency of the Convention until the first review\nconference in November 2004, Thailand will do its\nutmost to ensure much further achievements and\nconsiderable progress in the core objectives of the\nConvention: mine clearance, victim assistance,\nstockpile destruction and universal acceptance of the\nConvention.\nAcross the continent, as one of only three Asian\npartners for cooperation with the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, Thailand seeks to\nbuild bridges between Asia, especially the Association\nof Southeast Asian Nations, and Europe. We believe\n24\n\nthat not despite our differences in cultural and social\nvalues, but because of those differences, Asia and\nEurope will learn the art of living together, creating a\nworld of human security.\nNarcotic drugs and pandemics transcend all\nborders and become as much of a threat to human\nsecurity as terrorism. Like terrorism, decisive and\nresolute partnership actions at all levels are required to\ntackle these global problems to achieve sustainable\ndevelopment.\nThe Thai Government has declared war against\nnarcotic drugs since taking office in February 2001.\nThis year, we made it the peak of our campaign. Our\nbattle against the scourge of drug production and\ntrafficking, especially methamphetamines, must be all\nbut comprehensive. Within the permit of the law, we\nhave mounted an integrated strategic campaign,\nincorporating prevention, treatment and rehabilitation,\nand suppression. We hope to be able to declare a total\nvictory by the end of the year.\nWe have forged a more effective partnership with\nour neighbours and beyond to overcome this global\nscourge once and for all. This past June, Thailand\nhosted a five-nation meeting comprising Thailand,\nChina, India, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic\nand Myanmar to discuss combating transnational\ncrimes, including the issue of drug trafficking.\nFurthermore, Thailand is also forging partnership at the\nglobal level by working hand in hand with the United\nNations Office on Drugs and Crime as a partner with\nshared responsibility to counter drugs and crime in the\nglobal context.\nJust as drugs tear at the social fabric of societies,\ndiseases such as HIV/AIDS cripple human resources\nacross the globe. Thailand commends the convening of\nthe high-level plenary on HIV/AIDS on 22 September.\nWe support the ongoing efforts undertaken within the\nframework of the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS,\nTuberculosis and Malaria. We also remain steadfast in\nour partnerships with neighbouring countries,\nparticularly the Greater Mekong subregion, as well as\nwith related United Nations agencies, to help tackle the\nglobal challenge posed by HIV/AIDS. As host of the\nFifteenth International AIDS Conference in July 2004,\nwe look forward to high-level representation of the\nworld community to share the experiences, as well as\nto forging strong partnerships and cooperation to build\na united global front to deal with this pandemic.\nWith regard to Severe Acute Respiratory\nSyndrome (SARS) \u2014 the disease that crippled many\ncountries and affected the tourist industry so badly\nthroughout the world this year \u2014 we found that only\nthe prompt response and commitment of ASEAN and\nthe Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)\npartnership enabled us to keep the pandemic under\ncontrol and quell the panic and fear, which were worse\nthan the disease itself.\nThe non-traditional security threats of HIV/AIDS,\nSARS and narcotic drugs \u2014 \u201csoft threats\u201d, in the\nwords of the Secretary-General \u2014 demonstrate once\nagain that no matter what differences each country or\nregion may have, international cooperation and\npartnership are crucial in order to combat both\ntraditional and non-traditional challenges to human\nsecurity.\nGuided by the principle of deriving partnership\nstrength from diversity, Thailand has embarked on\nvarious initiatives to bridge socio-economic disparities\nat the regional and subregional levels with a view to\nenhancing peace and prosperity. The Asia Cooperation\nDialogue (ACD), which is only in its second year of\nexistence but already comprises 22 Asian countries,\nrepresenting East, West, South, North and Central Asia,\nis a prime example. Within one year of its inception,\nthe ACD had achieved considerable progress with\nregard to various cooperation programmes, even in the\narea of financial cooperation. The second ACD\nMinisterial Meeting in June this year adopted the\nChiang Mai Declaration on Asian Bond Market\nDevelopment. The Asian bond market has been\nheralded as the new financial architecture for the\n\u201cworld of differences\u201d.\nThailand continues to work for partnership based\non diversity and difference so as to promote socio-\neconomic development among nations. Given the\neconomic disparity among our immediate neighbours,\nthe economic cooperation strategy initiated by the\nPrime Minister, Mr. Thaksin Shinawatra, is the most\nrecent partnership aimed at narrowing the economic\ngap between Thailand, Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s\nDemocratic Republic and Myanmar, with a view to\ngenerating employment and income based on\ncomparative advantage and mutual benefits. It will\ncomplement other bilateral and regional cooperative\nframeworks, and serve as a building block towards\nadvancing ASEAN economic integration.\n25\n\nThailand has chosen the theme, \u201cA World of\nDifferences: Partnership for the Future\u201d, for the 2003\nmeeting of the economic leaders of APEC, scheduled\nto take place in Thailand in October. The convening of\nthat APEC leaders\u2019 meeting reflects the belief that,\ndespite the diversity and differences that exist\nthroughout the region, there is unlimited benefit and\npotential that can be tapped through effective\npartnership. The meeting will discuss five sub-themes:\na knowledge-based economy; the promotion of human\nsecurity; financial architecture for a world of\ndifferences; small and medium enterprises; and action\non development pledges. In addition, we will focus on\nthe issue of counter-terrorism with a view to promoting\neconomic stability in the Asia-Pacific region and\nbeyond. The choice of those sub-themes shows that,\ndespite the differences among APEC economies,\npartnerships on those issues can be forged for the\nbenefit of the region and of the world.\nLast year, at the fifty-seventh session, I gave a\ncomprehensive account of Thailand\u2019s dual-track\nstrategy to attain steady economic growth with social\nequity. Before concluding, I would like this morning to\nreport to the Assembly on the success of our efforts to\ncreate economic and social partnership. That success is\nthe result of combining the diverse strengths of both\nthe grass-roots economy and the export-led business\nsector as engines of growth. We are confident that our\neconomy rests on a secure and firm foundation that will\nlead us along the path of economic growth and\nsustainable development.\nLast year, the Thai economy registered a 5.3 per\ncent growth in gross domestic product, which was\nfollowed by 6.7 percent growth in the first quarter of\nthis year. That is our best economic performance since\nthe 1997 crisis. On 31 July, Thailand paid back all of\nits International Monetary Fund loans in full \u2014 two\nyears ahead of schedule. The Government is committed\nto the eradication of poverty, as defined by the United\nNations, by the year 2009. By placing human security\nat the forefront of the Government\u2019s policies, Thailand\nis stressing its determination to ensure for the Thai\npeople a society free from want and free from fear.\nLiving in a world of differences will entail misery\nif we keep forging conflict out of diversity. It will\nentail hardship if we keep exacerbating disagreement.\nIt will entail stagnation if we keep failing to make\nroom for compromise. It will entail human suffering if\nGovernments keep turning their backs on chances of\npartnership. And it will entail devastation if we use our\ndifferences as an excuse to always differ.\nBut we, Members of the United Nations, live in a\nworld of differences. It is incumbent upon all of us to\nensure that our world of differences has a future \u2014 a\nfuture that will not entail misery, hardship and human\nsuffering as a result of those differences. It is\nincumbent upon every one of us to work with United\nNations institutions so as to ensure that our differences\nare turned into a source of strength for our future.\nThailand is doing its part, and will continue to do so,\nfor such a future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffTwo hundred years after the first cry of freedom in\nLatin America, our peoples are propelled by new winds\nof emancipation. A fresh generation of leaders has\ntaken up the old flags of our heroes to demand real\nglobal interdependence through an economic order\ninspired by solidarity and by the building of a lasting\npeace.\nI would like to take this opportunity to\ncongratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\nfor the commendable work that he has done to uphold\nand promote the principles that were enshrined in the\nCharter 58 years ago.\nFor too long, Latin America had been on the\nmargins of history. It had been reduced to playing the\npart of providing inexpensive labour and raw materials\nto more developed economies, while its most brilliant\nminds were lured away and absorbed by large urban\nmarkets. Our region has also fallen victim to\nmercenaries, soldiers of fortune and heartless people\nrepresenting dehumanizing and destructive transnational\ncorporations that overthrew Governments, provoked\nwars between friendly countries and squandered our\ncountries\u2019 resources.\nNevertheless, we are not here to complain about\nthose ignominious days. Nor are we here to cling to the\nglories of the past. On the contrary, we have come to\nexpress our firm will to work together for a dignified\npresent and a secure future for those who are now\ndying from hunger, thirst, cold and easily preventable\nand treatable diseases. Our voices today arise from our\nroots, cultures and traditions, and proclaim a Latin\nAmerica that is integrated into the world, with a fresh\nsense of fraternity, to make the lives of our peoples\nmore humane and enriching.\nWe must seek a multipolar world in which\ncultures enhance rather than confront one another and\nregional production promotes peace and prosperity in\nthe world to save present and future generations from\nthe terrible scourge of new major conflicts. Let us\nmake a renewed commitment, without scepticism and\nwith the intrinsic dignity that God has bestowed on\nevery human being.\nIn Paraguay, a small but dignified country, we are\nmaking a major effort at capacity-building with respect\nto national and international communities. A sine qua\nnon is to revive production, attract investors back and\nsell our products on world markets.\nAlthough our peoples have suffered long years of\nrecession and deprivation because of the foreign debt\nburden, my Government has managed to redirect public\nresources towards education and to coordinate the\nefforts of civil society and the State to democratize\nyoung people\u2019s access to the world of knowledge. Only\neffective human capital, with ethical principles, will\nenable us to survive and grow in a climate of\nglobalization. Towards that end, we fervently hope for\na globalization that involves not simply economics but\nalso justice, science, technology and development. Our\nchallenge is to achieve global progress.\nI come from an island surrounded by land, as\nParaguay\u2019s renowned writer Augusto Roa Bastos so\naptly described the country. But with the advent of\ndemocracy, to the credit of the people\u2019s self-sacrifice,\nour country has restored its identity, memories and\ndreams. We Paraguayans accept our geographical\ndisadvantage as an opportunity to be creative and\nindustrious, as our development requires. For this\nreason, we appeal for international solidarity to help to\nimplement the plan of action of Almaty, which is\ndesigned to overcome the limitations of landlocked\ndeveloping countries, including Paraguay.\nWe have a strong ethical belief in this historic\nobjective. The inequality that impoverishes most of the\nworld is immoral. There is not a trace of Christianity in\nthe lack of solidarity with the destitute. In that regard,\nthe individual must be treated as a whole person, so\nthat he may in turn bring well-being to his family, for\nthe sake of all society. If leaders do not provide a moral\nexample, it will not be possible to advance towards a\ndemocracy that is embraced by the people and fosters\ntrue participation in a society that is distinguished by\nits moral capital, the essential basis of a humanistic and\nhumanizing economy. A world in crisis requires\nhumanism, not humanitarianism. The world seeks\nsolidarity, and not mere charity.\nWe must understand that the impoverishment of a\nlarge share of humankind jeopardizes world balance. It\nis true that many countries have become impoverished\nnot simply as a result of outside influences but also\nbecause of corruption and impunity on the part of local\nleaders. But it is equally true that without an ethical\nbelief in the international order and the strong will of\n5\n\nleaders to praise God and renounce historical patterns\nof greed of rich countries, the world that we leave to\nour children will not be fit for living.\nUnfortunately, while we are shaping a future\nbased on ideals and utopias in this hallowed chamber\nof world peace, we have not figured out how to end\nwar, since in various parts of the world the arms race\ncontinues, as does growing poverty. It bears repeating\nthat, as leaders of our respective countries, we must\ncease speaking in terms of friends and enemies, which\nhas a weakening and destructive effect. We must use\nthat energy and those resources to ensure just social\ndevelopment in economically less-developed countries.\nWithout pluralistic and equitable participation in\ncrucial international policy decisions discussed here in\nour Organization and a commitment to multilateralism,\nthe United Nations and, in particular, the Security\nCouncil, will inevitably fail in its noble objective of\nmaintaining peace in the world.\nIn this context, Paraguay supports the aspirations\nof Latin America and other continents to be\nrepresented in the Security Council, where the presence\nof Brazil as a permanent member would fulfil the great\nand legitimate interests of our region.\nParaguay would like to reiterate here its full\nsupport for the efforts and aspirations of the Republic\nof China on Taiwan to become a fully-fledged member\nof the international community through the United\nNations. In this regard, we appeal to the principles of\nuniversality contained in the Charter so that this long-\noverdue and heartfelt desire of the sister Republic of\nChina on Taiwan may be fulfilled.\nAs I said some weeks ago in my own country \u2014\nand as I reaffirm here \u2014 the ethics of fraternity and\nmutual respect must govern international relations\ntoday if humanity is to make progress towards lasting\npeace inspired by the rule of law and reason.\nWith the same vigour with which we advocate\nworldwide peace, we condemn terrorism in all its\nmanifestations and sources. In Paraguay, we have\npledged \u2014 a pledge we are resolutely fulfilling \u2014 to\ncombat the breeding grounds of terrorism and its\nfinancial support, drug trafficking. We shall not deviate\nfrom that commitment. Likewise, we energetically\ndenounce the terrorist action against the United\nNations headquarters in Baghdad that occurred\nyesterday and that of 19 August. We mourn the death\nof outstanding United Nations staff members, including\nthe distinguished Brazilian and Latin American citizen,\nMr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights. In that same line of\naction, in Paraguay we are dismantling organized crime\nand money-laundering, regardless of who promotes,\nconceals or commits those crimes.\nI reiterate that our country will no longer be a\nbridge, corridor or end point for such criminal\noperations. With the same energy with which we\ncombat crime and illegality, we reaffirm our\nunwavering commitment to respecting human rights,\nwhich is an increasingly important part of our domestic\nand foreign policies, promoting full enjoyment of\npublic and individual freedoms for the peoples of the\nworld.\nThe fight for freedom, democracy, social equity\nand world peace will be of no avail if we do not more\nresponsibly face the challenges for the preservation of\nour environment. Let us seek the well-being of our\npeoples today but not forget that our children will live\non this planet tomorrow. In Paraguay and Latin\nAmerica, we are determined to be the protagonists and\narchitects of a shared destiny of responsibility, justice\nand equality.\nFinally, may the new global order be more\nhuman, supportive, responsible and participative, and\nmay its essential purpose be to promote development,\nprogress and the well-being of all the peoples of the\nEarth in an environment that is truly more just, fair and\nbalanced. May God bless us and may we build together\nthe peace that our children and future generations need.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffDuring the\npast two years, the attacks of 11 September 2001 and\nthe wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as in Africa,\nhave brought turmoil to the world.\nThe United Nations has never been more\nnecessary, yet perhaps never has its efficacy been so\nquestioned nor, until the bombings last month in\nBaghdad, have its people been the object of such\nmassive direct attack.\nIn the Principality of Andorra, encircled by the\nhigh mountains of the Pyrenees, we have lived\npeacefully and democratically between our neighbours\nfor over 700 years. Since 1419, our Parliament has met\nto debate the problems of our people. It was not only\nour small size and isolation that kept us apart from the\nwars that ravaged Europe; rather, our desire for\nindependence, the unity of our people, and also our ability\nto get along with our powerful neighbours made Andorra\none of the oldest democratic States in the world.\nIn the past half-century, since the founding of the\nUnited Nations, the world has changed, and Andorra\nwith it. Less than a century ago it was only possible to\nreach Andorra by horse. Now roads bring us 12 million\ntourists each year. Telephones, computers, satellites\nand airplanes bring the world to Andorra and we in\nturn have reached out to the world. In the time of my\ngrandparents, Andorrans never travelled far from their\nmountains. Now we are world travellers.\nOne of the proud moments in the long history of\nour country was the day in 1993 \u2014 ten years ago \u2014\nwhen we became a Member State of the United\nNations. We joined with great hopes and all these years\nwe have believed in its crucial role, despite the crises\nthat may have cooled that belief.\nThe terrorist attack on the United States of\nAmerica marked the beginning of a very complex stage\nin relations among nations and of a difficult\nequilibrium among different areas of our planet. The\ninvasions of Afghanistan and Iraq were both set in\nmotion by this attack; one had the support of the\nUnited Nations while the other did not. While there is\nno point in returning to that debate, two questions must\nbe addressed.\nFirst, can the United Nations effectively respond\nto threats to world stability? Secondly, to what degree\nwill its Member States be willing to work within the\nframework of the United Nations? Perhaps a cooling of\npassions will enable us to address these difficult issues\nclearly.\nWe are all too aware of the difficulties and\ndangers that beset both the citizens of these countries\nand the troops of Member States who are working to\nbring stability to these places. We hope for a rapid\nsolution to the myriad difficulties involved in ending\nthe series of sad and painful events that have taken\nplace within these countries over the past few years.\nThe United Nations has a critical responsibility in\nfostering a constructive outcome for the Afghan and\nIraqi people and also in resolving tension throughout\nthe Middle East. In this regard I wish to express our\nconfidence in the United Nations to bring an end to this\ncomplex and cruel conflict, a crucial step for the\nstability of the region and an important matter for the\nfuture of mankind. The United Nations will know how\nto find new ways and adequate solutions and will play\na leading role in the establishment of new paths.\nAs politicians, we pride ourselves on our\nknowledge of the needs of our citizens. We are students\nat the university of the national will. The most\nsuccessful among us have cultivated a keen sense of\nthe everyday desires, frustrations, and goals that are\nimportant to our citizens. If we live in a democratic\nState, and ignore those needs, the voters will quickly\nlook for others who do not.\nThe United Nations is a different kind of\nuniversity. Here the lessons of national self-interest\nmust give way to an international understanding. In\nthis university of the world, our previous studies, by\nwhich I mean our own political careers, can only help\nus in the short term. But what we study together here\nare long-term lessons that can ensure the long-term\nsurvival of the world we share.\nAlthough Andorra is small in scale, like many\npartners in the United Nations, what we smaller nations\nhave to contribute is larger than our proportionate\ngeographic scale or the relative size of our population.\nIndeed, our small size has made us by necessity careful\nobservers of the needs of others and our centuries of\nindependence have taught us responsibility to our citizens\nand our neighbours. We have never forgotten the bonds\nthat link us to the world. Our history has taught us this.\nLegend has it that Andorra was founded by\nCharlemagne, who, let us recall, was one of the key\n18\n \nhistorical players in the battles between Islam and\nChristianity. In the thirteenth century, however, it was\nthe religious tension between the Count of Foix, who\nwas a Cathar sympathizer, and the Catholic bishop of\nUrgell that led to a balanced agreement resulting in the\nindependence of Andorra. Andorra came into existence\npartly as a buffer State between two powerful lords and\nbetween two approaches to Christianity: the orthodox\nand the Cathar.\nThe Cathars are only a distant memory now, but I\nraise this issue here because it points to the\nbattleground of belief. Whereas the Church once\nsummoned councils to struggle over the problems of\nheresy, we now gather at the United Nations not to\ninsist on one form of belief, but to recognize and\nsustain the common ethical base that unites all beliefs,\nall ideologies, under the unshakeable canopy of the\n1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nWe are now in the twenty-first century and not in\nthe Middle Ages, but those who then were\nfundamentalist Christians and who resolved everything\nwith anathemas, crusades and exiles have given place\nto those who practice other forms of religious\nintolerance of different persuasions. It is shameful to\nsee that, even today, people are being killed or kill in\nthe name of their God.\nThe work that the United Nations accomplishes,\ntherefore, does not simply pay lip service to diversity.\nWe need to advance, in all moral seriousness, an ethic\nof diversity that goes beyond recognizing the value of\ntolerance and multiculturalism and strives to\nimplement shared ethical values in the service of world\nunderstanding.\nIn 1278, the strategic importance of Andorra lay\nin its proximity to the border between Catholic Europe\nand al-Andalus, Islamic Spain. The road that led to the\ngreat city of Cordoba \u2014 where the philosophy of\nAristotle was retranslated from Greek and Arabic into\nLatin and re-entered the thought of the Christian West\nin the renaissance of the twelfth century \u2014 passed\nclose by our country.\nIn the centre of that city, the Muslim rulers built\nan astonishing mosque with a forest of columns, made\nall the more beautiful by the presence within it of a\nsynagogue. Such was its beauty that it was not destroyed\nwhen the Christians captured the city, but converted into a\nCathedral, just as the great basilicas of Constantinople\nbecame the great mosques of Istanbul when that city\nfell to the Ottoman empire a century later.\nWhat if we could learn from the events that have\nmarked history, making use of the lessons of peaceful\ncoexistence, avoiding past mistakes and appreciating\nthe moments of openness between cultures in previous\ncenturies?\nWe live in a world of vast contrasts where\ntechnological progress, used dangerously or simply\nwithout precaution, has made life more perilous on a\nglobal scale. Where once the great plague took years to\nmake its way across Europe, modern plagues \u2014 be\nthey biological viruses or computer viruses \u2014 travel\nacross the globe in a matter of hours.\nPollution and global warming concern us all. The\nstrange climactic shifts of recent years, the pollution of\nour great oceans and lakes, threaten our environment.\nPerhaps most dangerously, nuclear weapons threaten\nthe life of everyone on the planet. All of these\ncalamities, present or looming, demand international\ncooperation if we are to survive.\nIt is most sad that some of those who could do\nmost to prevent the degradation of life on Earth\ncontinue to look in another direction \u2014 at the balance\nsheets of the big companies that contaminate the Earth\nmost egregiously \u2014 and continue to apply an energy\npolicy based on the uncontrolled exploitation and low\ncost of limited resources.\nWe have become a little world. We have become\nlike a small country, rather like Andorra, where\neverybody knows everybody else\u2019s business. As we\nbecome smaller, the need to combat poverty and\nsuffering has become all the more important. We\ncannot forget that images from more fortunate\ncountries are beamed into the lives of people existing\nin difficult or even life-threatening circumstances\nacross the world. No matter that these images may be\npropaganda and distortions of the truth \u2014 our modern\ntechnology, the source of so many comforts and\nadvantages, is also demonstrating the full scale of our\ndifferences.\nWe must learn to treat all members of the world\nas we would like to see our own citizens treated. We\nneed to insist on a decent life for everyone, for all\nmankind.\n19\n \nAndorra is committed to aiding development\naround the world. Since 1995, we have regularly\nincreased our budgetary contributions and hope to\ndevote 0.7 per cent of our budget to third-world aid\nwithin two years. Our philosophy of development\nsupports the institutions of the United Nations, looking\nto small-scale solutions that foster self-reliance and\nlocal initiative. We are particularly enthusiastic about\nprojects aimed at children, education and those who\nhelp women to establish their own businesses. We are\nalso committed to encouraging sustainable farming\nbecause we recognize that proper farming practices\nprovide the best defence against catastrophic crop\nfailures. To that end, Andorra also proposes within the\nnext year to become a member of the Food and\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations.\nThe insignificant part of the Andorran budget\ndevoted to the purchase of weapons resulted in the\ncomposer and singer Pete Seeger dedicating a song to\nus in the 1960s. His verses still echo today, just as they\ndid when he made a whole generation sing \u201cWe shall\novercome. We shall live in peace\u201d. Many things have\nhappened since those days and Andorra no longer\nallocates so much as $4.50 towards its defence budget.\nWe do not spend a penny.\nIn this diverse and contradictory world, with all\nthat is squandered on new weapons and old, the whole\nof mankind could live decently. We could eliminate all\ndiseases. Education and culture would be made\navailable to all. Thus, we could end fanaticism and all\nthose who abuse the ignorance of the people would end\nup without victims or lackeys.\nLet us try and make some use of these long\ndebates and speeches which we applaud with\ndiplomatic courtesy, often without even hearing them.\nToo much is at stake for all of us.\n\n\n\n"

It is also my pleasure to express\nappreciation for the efforts of Mr. Jan Kavan, former\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic, in\npresiding over the fifty-seventh session and for the\ntireless efforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, in reaffirming the contributions and the role of the\nUnited Nations in addressing regional and international\nissues to fulfil the will of the international community,\nparticularly by carrying out its principal responsibility\nfor maintaining peace and security in the world.\nToday, the United Nations is nearing the end of\nthe sixth decade since its establishment after the\nSecond World War as part of a world order accepted by\nall humanity to avoid the catastrophic consequences of\nwar. Also today, the world is witnessing unprecedented\nthreats, conflicts and crises, and it faces challenges that\nthreaten the noble purposes and principles enshrined in\nthe Charter of the Organization, a body to which the\nworld's peoples look to avoid the perils of war, to free\nthemselves from the fear of force and oppression, and\nto seek justice, prosperity and stability.\nSince its inception, the United Nations has carried\nout the responsibilities set out in its Charter in a wide\nrange of fields that are relevant both to people's daily\nlives and to the international community. Those\nresponsibilities have included peacekeeping operations,\ndevelopment programmes, conferences on the\nenvironment, enhancing and expanding the role of\nwomen, protecting human rights, the resettlement of\nrefugees, combating disease and epidemics, dealing\nwith national disasters, spreading a culture of peace,\nand reaffirming international legality and the rule of\nlaw. However, those great achievements in people's\nlives and in Member States of the Organization will\ncount for nothing in the face of regional conflicts, civil\nwars and ethnic strife in many parts of the world.\nMany resolutions crucial to the maintenance of\npeace and stability continue to be ignored and therefore\nfail to serve the will of the international community.\nTherefore, all of us   leaders, peoples and Governments\n  have the moral responsibility to reactivate and\nimplement those resolutions. We must reflect on the\nreasons that they have not been implemented; we must\nobjectively consider why that has taken place; and we\nmust study the Organization's successes and failures in\nthat regard. In order to overcome these shortcomings in\nthe current world order, we must muster the necessary\npolitical will and mobilize the efforts of the States and\npeoples that the Organization has comprised since its\ninception. Only thus will we be able to bridge the\nchasm between hopes and realities and to correct the\nmisalignment between texts and ambitions and between\nresolutions and their implementation.\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain, under the leadership of\nHis Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa, has\nreaffirmed its strong belief in upholding the principles\nand purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and\nits confidence in the Organization's ability to shoulder its\nhistoric and legal responsibilities to build and maintain\npeace and to strengthen the foundations of peace.\nBahrain's leading regional and international role\nin comprehensive human development   both economic\nand political   has over the years been consistently\nsupported by United Nations statistics and reports. The\nlatest of those reports   the United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP) Human Development Report of 8\nJuly 2003   demonstrates that fact. At the political\nlevel, Bahrain has moved quickly forward with the\nconsolidation of constitutional democracy and the rule\nof law after the overwhelming popular approval of the\nNational Action Charter, promulgating its Constitution\nof February 2002 and establishing the two Chambers of\nthe National Assembly in October of that year. At the\nlevel of civil society and human rights and in order to\nincrease the pace of reform and development, Bahrain\ntook significant steps to enhance constitutional\nguarantees of civil and political freedoms and rights\nthrough a royal decree establishing the Constitutional\nCourt in 2002 and through the Workers Trade Union\nlaw of the same year.\nReaffirming their status and role in society,\nwomen in Bahrain are constitutionally entitled to vote\nand to run as candidates in elections, and to hold\nimportant positions in both the public and private\nsectors. In addition to that, women participate in the\n18\n\nbroad social activities of the Supreme Council for\nWomen, part of a coordinated and integrated system of\ndevelopment efforts that include mother and child care,\nachieving equality between men and women in a\nsociety that believes in the unity of the family, values\ngender equality and respects the rights of the family.\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain, a regional centre for\ntrade, with well-established social and economic\nfoundations based on a historic tradition of openness, is\ntoday a hub for trade in goods and capital, in a\nlegislative and social environment in which Bahrainis,\nnon-Bahrainis and visitors alike enjoy the stability\nrequired for investment and the movement of capital.\nThese laws guarantee that the country remain an\nattractive and successful location for residence and\nmovement for individuals and investors. Bahrain is\nalso a fine example of successful economic\nliberalization, which has made it an attractive point in\nthe Gulf area for regional projects and investment.\nAchieving economic integration and regional\ncooperation between the Gulf and Middle East regions\nand other major and free trading blocs depends upon the\nstrong foundation of a political and strategic environment\nconducive to achieving peace and cooperation.\nIn that context, the achievement of a just and\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East can be brought\nabout only through a recognition of the inalienable legal\nrights of the Palestinian people to self-determination and\nthe establishment of their independent State, a return of\nsovereignty over territory occupied since 1967 and\ncontrol over their economic resources, in accordance\nwith resolutions of international legality and the\nprinciples and aims of Middle East initiatives, and on\nthe basis of agreements between the two sides, which\nmust be fully respected and implemented.\nThe road map, which has gained consensus among\nthe international community, supports the establishment\nof an independent Palestinian State living in peace and\nsecurity, side by side with Israel, as envisaged by\nUnited States President George W. Bush in his peace\ninitiative of June 2002, as reaffirmed by the\ninternational Quartet comprising United Nations, the\nUnited States, the European Union and the Russian\nFederation, and as agreed upon by the Palestinian\nAuthority. This provides a unique, historic opportunity\nto achieve a balanced settlement that will restore the\nlegitimate rights of the people and achieve a delicate\nbalance between the obligations of the parties and their\nrights to security and peace.\nThe recent Israeli decision to remove in principle\nChairman Yasser Arafat, the elected Palestinian\nPresident, and its threats to eliminate him, are very\ndangerous matters that contravenes the principles of\ndemocracy and the rules of international law. This was\nreaffirmed by the adoption of resolution 10/12 at the\ntenth emergency special session of the General\nAssembly on 19 September 2003.\nBahrain, which expresses its concern at this\ndangerous Israeli decision, calls upon the Quartet and\nthe international community to pressure Israel to prevent\nthe implementation of this decision, whose repercussions\nwould weaken current peace opportunities.\nPeace in the Middle East must be comprehensive;\nit requires the full implementation of resolutions of\ninternational legality, particularly Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), which call for\nIsraeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories,\nincluding the Golan Heights, and Security Council\nresolution 425 (1978), regarding the Lebanese\nterritories remaining under occupation. The Middle\nEast today faces great challenges as well as unique\nopportunities and crucial moments that will determine\nthe future of the region for generations to come.\nThis peace must be a single and indivisible unit.\nThat applies both to the Middle East and to the Gulf\nregion. It is a fundamental and vital request by Bahrain\nand the Arab world that steps be taken by the\ninternational community, the United Nations and\ninfluential parties, in particular the United States, to\nnormalize political, economic and civilian life in Iraq,\nso that the country can regain its Arab, regional and\ninternational role.\nIn order for the Iraqis to determine their destiny,\nwithin a constitutional framework that provides for the\nrule of law and guarantees political freedom, peace and\nsecurity for all Iraq's citizens and ethnic groups   a\nvital legal requirement   the Iraqis themselves must\nbe allowed to rebuild economic, political and social\nfoundations, as well as civil society, within an Iraqi\nnational Government.\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain believes that the\nformation of a new national Government in Iraq is an\nimportant step for the brotherly Iraqi people towards\n19\n\ntaking over their own affairs for a better life and for an\nincreased regional and international role.\nWith regard to the Islands of the Greater and\nLesser Tunb and Abu Moussa, which belong to the\nbrotherly United Arab Emirates, we hope that the\ncurrent important dialogue between the United Arab\nEmirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran will lead to a\npeaceful settlement of this issue and contribute to\nsecurity and stability in the Gulf region.\nThe international commitment to fighting\nterrorism, political violence and extremism has become\nboth an international and a national responsibility,\nparticularly since the events of 11 September 2001,\nwhich claimed the lives of many innocent people.\nCombating terrorism has become an international\nobligation, in keeping with the United Nations\ncommitment to respect human rights, foremost of\nwhich are the rights to life and security.\nAccordingly, the Kingdom of Bahrain has backed\nall international and regional efforts to combat this\ndangerous scourge, which threatens us all and whose\neffects can be felt around the world. Most recently, we\nhave witnessed the evil attack on the United Nations\nheadquarters in Baghdad, in which Mr. Sergio Vieira de\nMello, Special Representative of the Secretary-General,\nand a number of other innocent people lost their lives\nwhile serving the cause of international legality.\nIn that regard, Bahrain condemns the vicious\norchestrated campaign waged against a sister State, the\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia, by some Western media. We\nwish to commend Saudi Arabia for its tangible and\nimportant contribution to the global campaign against\nterrorism, to which it itself was exposed. Bahrain fully\nsupports and endorses all the measures taken by Saudi\nArabia in its attempts to eliminate terrorism and to\nconsolidate regional security and stability.\nThe challenges of today's world order,\nrepresented by the United Nations, are greater than any\nparticular region or State, and encompass all areas of\nlife and society: the economy, education, health,\ntechnology and information, particularly following the\ninformation and communications technology revolution,\nin the context of the comprehensive globalization of\nthought, trade, politics, war and peace.\nToday, it is neither possible nor acceptable,\nwithin the globalization of international relations at\nvarious levels, for one region to have full prosperity\nand abundance while others suffer from poverty and\nwant, drought and desertification, and from incurable\ndiseases which science and medicines cannot yet tackle\nand to which countries and Governments are unable to\neffectively respond or provide medicine or care for\nmillions of victims.\nAgainst the backdrop of globalization, the\ninternational community cannot ignore these trends.\nThe summits, conferences and United Nations special\nsessions that have been held over the years to deal with\nissues such as human rights, the environment,\ndevelopment, women's rights, habitat, motherhood,\nchildren, culture and civilization reflect the degree to\nwhich those issues are connected to humanitarian,\ncultural, social and peace and security issues. Bahrain's\nactive role and contributions and effective participation\nin summits and General Assembly special sessions, and\nits involvement in the International Year of Dialogue\namong Civilizations in particular, clearly show that\nBahrain's national policies and programmes dovetail\nwith the priorities of the international community. An\nexample of that was Bahrain's hosting of high-level\ndialogues among religions and cultures in autumn\n2002. In the same vein, the Kingdom of Bahrain hosted\na meeting on Islamic-Christian dialogue in October\n2002, at which a number of valuable recommendations\nwere put forward that we hope will contribute to efforts\nmade in this area. Bahrain also recently hosted an\nIslamic forum, in which a number of Islamic scholars\nand clerics took part, to promote harmony among\nvarious Islamic schools of thought. Bahrain will\ncontinue to play the role of a haven for brotherhood\nand dialogue and a meeting place where various\nreligions and cultures live side by side in peace.\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain believes on the basis of\nconscientious and free national will that the world\ntoday urgently needs a strong and revitalized United\nNations, as was the case in the wake of the Second\nWorld War, to maintain international peace and security\nand effectively contribute to enhancing the dignity and\nwelfare of humanity. In its quest for peace, the\nKingdom of Bahrain is pursuing national policies of\ndevelopment and democracy to raise hope for a better\nfuture that will free the individual from fear and\ndespair, oppression, famine, poverty and ignorance,\nprovide him with a dignified life and protect him from\nnatural disasters. Our national and international policies\nare closely inspired by the work of the United Nations,\nparticularly in the development, social, economic and\n20\n\nhumanitarian fields. Those policies are based on\nconstitutional legality, democracy, transparency and\ngood governance and guarantee the respect of\nindividual rights and freedoms. Bahrain aspires to\npeace and security within the country, the region and\nthe world as a whole.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet\nme first congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the\npresidency of the fifty-eighth session of the General\nAssembly. Your election is welcome testimony of the\nequal sovereignty of States, a principle to which the\ndelegation of the Principality of Monaco attaches\nparticular importance. I assure you and the members of\n12\n \nthe Bureau of our support for your high mission at the\nservice of the international community.\nI also wish to congratulate the Secretary-General:\nall are aware of his tireless efforts to promote with\ncourage and lucidity the ideals our Organization\nembodies as it faces the challenges of our time. The\ntragic circumstances surrounding the heinous attack\nperpetrated in Baghdad last month call for us to pay\nspecial tribute to all United Nations personnel and\nsalute with respect and sorrow the memory of those,\nincluding Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello and his\ncompanions, who by sacrificing their lives, have\ndemonstrated the strength and grandeur of commitment\nto the values that only our Organization can\nlegitimately embody.\nWhen it joined the United Nations ten years ago,\nthe Principality of Monaco pledged to fully abide by\nthe obligations incumbent on all Member States and to\nparticipate, according to our means, in the promotion\nof the values that bring us together. We are all the more\nattached to that commitment because it is particularly\nimportant for small States such as Monaco that all are\nbound by the same rules in their international conduct\nand that all enjoy equal dignity and the equal right to\nrespect.\nOf course, there is a considerable and at times\nglaring divergence between the ambitions we collectively\nespouse and the actual situations we observe around us,\nwhich unfortunately afflict so many among us.\nAssuredly, it would be pointless to ignore the profound\ndifferences that may exist between States in terms of\nboth their characteristics and their influence in\ninternational affairs. But it is essential that we have a\nplace, a forum in which we are all compelled to judge our\nactions and conduct by the principles that are supposed to\nguide our actions and in which we are compelled to\nexamine our conscience \u2014 in short, a place where we, as\nmembers of the international community, are held\naccountable to the collective demands of that community.\nThat is why it is so important that we strive to\nmake the Organization more effective so that respect\nfor our principles and purposes prevails over the\nseeming ease of self-justification and so that a\ncollective approach based on dialogue prevails over\nunilateral action. As a question of principle and as a\nresult of reasoning, the Principality of Monaco\ntherefore supports all initiatives aimed at strengthening\nour collective mechanisms, in particular those\nundertaken by the Secretary-General pursuant to the\nMillennium Declaration as presented at the opening of\nthe present session.\nAccordingly, the Principality of Monaco attaches\nparticular importance to the effective implementation\nof the General Assembly resolution on the follow-up to\noutcomes of the major United Nations conferences and\nsummits in the economic and social fields. Indeed,\nwhat purpose would be served by these enormous\ngatherings in which all participants vie to demonstrate\ntheir magnanimity and generosity if the resulting\ncommitments are not followed up on or lack the means\nto monitor their implementation? The authority of the\nUnited Nations and the confidence placed in it would\nbe diminished, even as the Organization has\nconsiderably expanded the range of its activities in\norder to effectively tackle the problems of our time,\nacting from the global perspective of its own ongoing\nresponsibility to ensure peace, security and\ndevelopment. Would civil society, which today is\npresent in all the debates that involve it, not feel\nfrustrated and seek to take the lead on its own terms,\ncreating an environment of confrontation?\nWhile participating in the many activities pursued\nwithin the Organization, a small country such as the\nPrincipality of Monaco must reasonably assess the size\nof the contribution it is able to make to the action of\nthe international community. Thus, we have focused\nour efforts in the areas of sustainable development and\nhumanitarian action because we feel that our acquired\nexperience enables us, despite our human and material\nlimitations, to make a useful contribution since we can\ncount on very dynamic Monegasque non-governmental\norganizations, which benefit from particularly generous\nlocal support. I am happy to convey our appreciation to\nthose organizations.\nMonaco\u2019s priority areas are education, health, the\nprotection of children, development assistance and\nenvironmental protection. Its activities have resulted in\nnumerous achievements in the field, particularly in\nAfrica, where our aid has doubled following the\nadoption of the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s\nDevelopment. Monaco has also achieved much in the\nMediterranean region. All Monaco\u2019s initiatives are\ncomplemented by our active participation in the forums\nwhere those various situations are addressed.\nThe Principality of Monaco focuses on concrete\nprojects such as schools, occupational training centres,\n13\n \nhealthcare centres, investments in local communities to\npromote economic activity in village communities\nthrough micro-credit programmes. All those projects\nare aimed at directly improving the living conditions of\ntheir beneficiaries.\nIn the area of the environment, in which the\nPrincipality has long distinguished itself, especially in\nthe protection of the marine environment since one of\nMonaco\u2019s sovereigns, Prince Albert I, helped found the\nstudy of oceanography in the late nineteenth century.\nOur experience has led to us being chosen to\nparticipate in the next Governing Council of the United\nNations Environment Programme. The Principality of\nMonaco has also been the source of many initiatives\nrelated both to protecting its immediate environment,\nthe Mediterranean Sea, and to monitoring pollution and\npreserving biodiversity elsewhere, with a long-term\nperspective of support for sustainable development.\nResolutely committed to participating in the\nefforts of the international community to rise to the\nmost recent challenges with which it has been\nconfronted, Monaco has ratified the twelve main\ninternational instruments relating to terrorism, putting\ninto place appropriate administrative structures.\nFurthermore, it is the first State to ratify the United\nNations Convention against Transnational Organized\nCrime, which will enter into force in the next few days,\non 29 September. It is also preparing to host, next\nmonth, the Fifth International Summit on Transnational\nCrime, organized by the United Nations and the\nCouncil of Europe, which will bring together\nrepresentatives of Governments and the private sector.\nIn the same spirit, the Principality works with all the\nrelevant institutions to fight drugs and human\ntrafficking and the illegal financial flows they engender\nor sustain.\nNeed I also reaffirm the obvious commitment to\npeace and security of a country as sensitive to its\nenvironment as Monaco, even if, having no armed\nforces, it is unable to participate in collective actions\nunder the flag of the United Nations? It is in the\nhumanitarian field that Monaco consistently makes its\ncontribution by assisting civilian populations, victims\nof combat and the upheavals and atrocities that too\noften today characterize armed conflicts, as can be seen\nparticularly in Africa. In a symbolic solidarity, the\nPrincipality celebrates the International Day of Peace\non 21 September and associates itself with the Olympic\nTruce, given Monaco\u2019s involvement in the Olympic\nmovement as symbolized in the long-standing\nparticipation of Crown Prince Albert in the International\nOlympic Committee. We thus welcome the inclusion of a\nnew item on the agenda of this session, entitled\n\u201cInternational Year of Sport and Physical Education\u201d,\nwhose goal is to highlight what has always been our\nmotivation, the outstanding role of sport in developing\nrelations between peoples by promoting mutual\nunderstanding and intercultural dialogue, factors that\ncontribute to both peace and development.\nAs I conclude this statement, I hope I have\nsucceeded in communicating the profound attachment of\nthe Principality of Monaco to the world Organization that\nit joined 10 years ago at His Serene Highness Prince\nRainier III\u2019s initiative. He was convinced that his\ncountry would thereby gain a most effective\ninternational profile, protection in an uncertain world\nand an opportunity to usefully demonstrate its\nsolidarity. Since Monaco is naturally open to the\noutside world, it has easily found its place among you.\nOur Principality is grateful for what the United\nNations has given it and is striving in return and to the\nextent of its capacity to help the Organization achieve\nits objectives with the conviction that what the\ninternational community needs are reliable Member\nStates. And reliability is not a question of size but of\nwill. It is this will that inspires and guides us.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffPermit me\nat the outset to express to Assembly President Julian\nHunte the congratulations of my country, Gabon, on his\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at\nthis session. Indeed, his election has symbolic value,\nsince, through him, Saint Lucia has become \u2014 as he\nhimself said \u2014 the smallest country ever to have\noccupied that high office. Is that not a perfect\nillustration of the universal vocation of the\nOrganization, which recognizes the equality and rights\nof all its Members, small and large, but also their\ncommon responsibility in the conduct of the world\u2019s\naffairs? Gabon expresses to him its wishes for success\nin leading this session, and we assure him of our full\ncooperation. We also congratulate Mr. Jan Kavan, who\npreceded Mr. Hunte in his office, on the work that he\naccomplished. In addition, we thank the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the self-sacrifice and\n25\n\ncourage with which he is leading the Organization at\nthis time of grave world turbulence.\nThe extreme seriousness of the situation facing\nthe world today sometimes leads the United Nations,\nwhen States are unable to carry out responsibilities that\nin principle devolve to them, to assume those\nresponsibilities.\nAs the United Nations carries out its difficult\nmission, its authority, unfortunately, is quite often\nsorely tested, and the very lives of its personnel are\nthreatened. The tragic death of Sergio Vieira de Mello,\none of the torch-bearers of the ideals of the United\nNations, and other staff members in Baghdad on 19\nAugust is a dreadful reminder of just how fragile\ninternational peace and security are. Nevertheless,\ndespite the delicate nature of the situation, the\nactivities of the United Nations must be pursued in Iraq\nto assist in the reconstruction of the country.\nBeyond Iraq, the future of the entire Middle East\nregion must be at the centre of all our attention. The\nroad map remains, despite current threats to its\nenforcement, the sole hope to restore peace between\nthe parties to the conflict and sustainable regional\nbalance to the Middle East. Gabon urges the two\nparties to end the violence and resume their dialogue.\nDespite the persistence of some hotbeds of\ntension, the overall situation in Africa has witnessed\npositive changes. In the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo, the peace process has begun to be implemented\nwith the creation in June 2003 of a Transitional\nGovernment, whose chief mission is the establishment\nof new democratic institutions and preparations for\nelections.\nIt goes without saying that the security and\nstability of the country continues to depend on that of\nthe entire Great Lakes region. This is why Gabon\nardently desires the completion of the Arusha process\nin Burundi. After a period of uncertainty, the Central\nAfrican Republic is also restoring peace, particularly\nthanks to specific pacification measures taken by the\ncountry\u2019s new authorities.\nTo complement their efforts, the Central African\nEconomic and Monetary Community, which met in\nLibreville in June 2003, decided to make an ad hoc\ncontribution of 5 billion francs CFA to the Central\nAfrican Republic.\nFor its part, Gabon has always actively worked\nfor peacekeeping and peace-building in Africa. This\nwas recently demonstrated again in S\u00e2o Tom\u00e9 and\nPrincipe, where the good offices of President Bongo and\nhis African peers, particularly those from the Economic\nCommunity of Central African States, contributed to the\nrestoration of constitutional order in the country.\nUnfortunately, these welcome events are at\nvariance with our inability to react promptly to some\ncrisis situations that jeopardize collective security and\ncause gross violations of human rights. We must\nassume a two-fold duty today: to strengthen our\ncollective means of conflict prevention and, when\nthose efforts do not obtain results, to have the capacity\nto react swiftly to contain armed conflicts before their\nescalation brings about new humanitarian disasters, as\nwas recently the case in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo and Liberia.\nAfrican countries have shown their ability to\nmanage crises on many occasions. But their will is\nmost often impeded by the scarcity of human resources\nand lack of appropriate logistical means. To facilitate\nthe prompt deployment of peacekeeping forces in these\nregions, should we not establish, under the auspices of\nthe United Nation, a partnership between African\ncountries and the developed countries that provide\nlogistical support.\nBecause many conflicts are rooted in poverty, any\neffort to resolve them must be based on the quest for\nefficient solutions to the problems inherent in\nunderdevelopment. The Monterrey Consensus, reaffirmed\nduring the Johannesburg Summit, is based on the\nrecognition that financing for development is a crucial\nelement for an international strategy for sustainable\ndevelopment. The drop in private international\ninvestment in developing countries is liable to hinder\nthem from truly recovering. Moreover, many of these\ncountries, in particular those known as medium-income\ncountries like Gabon, continue to devote huge\nresources to repay external debt. Gabon remains\nconvinced that only a courageous strategy to defer or\ncancel debt would enable the economic recovery of the\ncountries involved.\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic, which has become a\ndevelopment problem, also deserves our attention. The\ndisease is now the leading cause of death among\nwomen and the young in Africa. In other words, its\nmain victims are our nations\u2019 hope. We welcome the\n26\n\nfact that the high-level plenary debate that took place\nlast week at United Nations Headquarters itself\nreaffirmed the commitment of the international\ncommunity to combat this horrifying disease.\nThe ills that the world is facing should prompt us\nto identify the structural causes and find the best way\nto respond. This is particularly true with respect to the\nfight against international terrorism. One vital stage in\nthis process is the establishment of a legal framework\nconducive to effective international cooperation.\nWe must finalize without delay the negotiations\nto adopt a universal convention against international\nterrorism in all its forms, including the issue of the\nacquisition of arsenals of weapons of mass destruction\nby terrorist groups.\nThe positive forces that drive our world towards\ngreater integration and solidarity are increasingly\njeopardized by growing threats. Because the new\nchallenges of our world have a global impact, we must\nrespond collectively. Only close coordination and\nactive multilateral cooperation will enable us to meet\nthem. It is within the United Nations, a high-level\nforum for dialogue and cooperation, that we can\nachieve this objective.\nTo do so, as we have stressed during the previous\nsession, we must strengthen our Organization,\nparticularly by restoring the role of the General\nAssembly and reforming the Security Council. We\nagree on the principle. May we thus have the courage\nand will to harmonize our views to attain this ideal of\nchange and strengthen the multilateral dimension of\nour Organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is indeed a\nsignal honour for me to extend to you, Sir and to the\nGovernment and people of the sister Caribbean\nCommunity (CARICOM) State of Saint Lucia our\nheartfelt congratulations on your election to the high\noffice of President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\neighth session. We are confident that, under your\nexperienced and pragmatic leadership, the Assembly\nwill address in a forthright manner the many and varied\nchallenges which confront the international community.\nMy delegation is equally confident, Sir, that the\ndeveloping-country perspective that your presidency\nwill bring to our deliberations will serve to highlight\nthe plight of the weak and the vulnerable among us, as\nwe struggle to come to terms with the realities of\ncontemporary international relations.\nMr. President, please allow me the opportunity to\nexpress our satisfaction at the astute leadership shown\nby your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Jan Kavan of\nthe Czech Republic, and at the many initiatives that he\npursued during his tenure, including those in the areas\nof institutional strengthening and the prevention of\narmed conflict, in an attempt to restore to this body its\ncentral role, as mandated by the Charter. I also applaud\nhis inclusive approach to advocacy, evinced by his\nshort but fruitful visit to Trinidad and Tobago in\nFebruary this year to engage in a brief, interactive\nhigh-level dialogue with the heads of State and\nGovernment of the Caribbean Community on the work\nof the Assembly and on some of the major issues\nbefore this global forum as they relate to small States.\nIt would be remiss of me if I did not compliment\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on his sterling\nperformance in the face of the myriad crises since our\nlast session. We have total confidence in his continuing\nstewardship of this unique world body. My delegation\nwishes to assure him of the total support of the\nGovernment and people of the Republic of Trinidad\nand Tobago for his untiring efforts to ensure the\ncontinued relevance of the United Nations in the\n10\n\npursuit and achievement of the Organization\u2019s\nobjectives.\nTrinidad and Tobago joins the rest of the\ninternational community in expressing our profound\nsorrow at the tragic loss of life suffered most recently\nby men and women of the United Nations while on a\nhumanitarian mission in Iraq, as a result of the\nbombing on 19 August 2003 of the United Nations\noffice in Baghdad. We shall forever remember them in\nour prayers, together with those others who, over the\nyears, have made the supreme sacrifice in selfless\nservice to the Organization and, by extension, to\nmankind. We are of the view that consideration should\nbe given to the erection of a fitting memorial here, at\nUnited Nations Headquarters in New York, to honour\nall those who have given their lives in the field in the\nservice of the United Nations.\nThe United Nations cannot retreat from its global\nresponsibilities in the face of even such an atrocity. We\nare firmly convinced that the United Nations \u2014 born\nout of the destruction wrought by the Second World\nWar and representing the collective hope of mankind to\nspare future generations from the scourge of war \u2014\nmust rise to this difficult challenge and continue to\nplay an even more central and proactive role in\nmanaging world affairs, particularly with respect to the\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\nThe challenge before us is to make the world\npeaceful and secure. That is a particular concern of\nsmall States, which must rely on the international rule\nof law, on the strict observance by all States of the\npurposes and principles laid down in the Charter of the\nUnited Nations, and on the collective security\nmechanism of the Security Council in order to\nguarantee their right to a secure, sovereign and\npeaceful existence. We must therefore work to\nstrengthen the rule of law worldwide as well as the\ncapacity of the United Nations to engage both in\nconflict prevention and in the management of global\ncrises that disrupt international peace and security. It is\nalso of paramount importance that all Member States\ncommit to and uphold the multilateral approach in our\ncollective efforts to attain those ends.\nNowhere is there a more pressing need for peace\nand security than in the Middle East. Clearly, a just and\nlasting peace is in the interests of both the Palestinians\nand the Israelis, who have been constant witnesses to\ndeath and destruction in their respective societies and\nwho have watched as their once promising economies\nhave been devastated by the unceasing instability in the\nregion. Peace continues to be elusive, notwithstanding\nthe latest best efforts of the Quartet, whose road map\nfor measured and reciprocal steps within a specific\ntime frame enjoys the support of the overwhelming\nmajority of the international community.\nThere can be no peace and prosperity for that\nregion without the political will of leaders on both\nsides of the conflict. Neither can there be progress on\nthe path of peace without focused and sustained effort\non the part of the international community in providing\nthe necessary political support to the parties directly\ninvolved. My delegation is of the opinion that, under\nthe present circumstances, consideration should be\ngiven to deployment of a United Nations force so that\nrealistic and mutually acceptable confidence-building\nmeasures can be put in place, thereby restoring some\nmeasure of security to Palestinians and Israelis alike.\nIn Iraq, the goals of the international community\nat this time must be the restoration of a climate of\npeace and security and the creation of the conditions\nthat are necessary for the building by the Iraqi people\nof a peaceful, secure and prosperous society. The\nUnited Nations has a pivotal role to play with regard to\nboth nation-building and the political transition in Iraq.\nWe therefore call for greater coherence among the\nmembers of the Security Council, and urge them to\nadopt such measures as are necessary in the security\ninterests of all concerned to bring that situation within\nthe parameters of international political legitimacy and\nso give free rein to the aspirations of the Iraqi people.\nThreats to international peace and security are\ncertainly not posed by State actors exclusively. The\nactivities of organized criminal groups engaged in the\nillegal drug trade and in the illicit trade in small arms\nand light weapons pose a serious threat to the peace\nand stability of some States, despite the efforts made at\nall levels.\nSince the events of 11 September 2001,\nGovernments the world over have joined forces even\nmore resolutely in their condemnation of terrorism and\nhave endeavoured to give effect to all the measures\ncalled for in the relevant decisions of the Security\nCouncil, including by subscribing to all international\ntreaties aimed at combating terrorism in all its forms\nand manifestations. The international community must,\nhowever, also turn its attention once more to\n11\n\naddressing the root causes of this now-global\nphenomenon with a view to alleviating \u2014 if not\nremoving altogether \u2014 the more pressing concerns that\nprovide a basis for acts of terror.\nEven as we remain resolute in the war on\nterrorism, and focus on the traditional issues of peace\nand security, we must be mindful of the need to make\nprogress on the internationally agreed Millennium\nDevelopment Goals, which world leaders outlined at\nthe Millennium Summit in 2000. The challenges we\nface are not confined to the issues of peace and security\nas defined in their traditional sense. Indeed, success in\ndealing with threats to international peace and security\nmay ultimately depend on the progress we make in\novercoming poverty and in dealing with injustice,\nintolerance, deprivation and diseases such as malaria,\ntuberculosis and the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic is one of those non-\nconventional threats that are fast approaching global\ncrises. Even though Africa remains the hardest hit, the\ndisease is spreading fast in Asia and in Eastern Europe.\nIn the Caribbean \u2014 which is second only to sub-\nSaharan Africa in HIV/AIDS prevalence rates \u2014\nHIV/AIDS is a major development challenge\nthreatening to reverse years of hard-won human\ndevelopment gains and increase poverty levels. The\nGeneral Assembly has just concluded a high-level\ndebate on HIV/AIDS, and my delegation trusts that that\nmeeting will provide the necessary impetus and lay the\ngroundwork for further meaningful support for the\nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.\nUnless those with the capacity to contribute come\nforward with additional resources, many, many more\nlives will surely be lost.\nWithout a secure and peaceful international\nenvironment, and in the absence of a sustained effort\non the part of our development partners to live up to\nthe commitments made at major United Nations\nconferences, there can be no meaningful and sustained\nglobal economic advancement for Africa as it seeks to\nimplement the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s\nDevelopment, or for the least developed countries, the\nlandlocked countries or the small island developing\nStates.\nTrinidad and Tobago continues to attach high\nimportance to the need for the international community\nto pay special attention to the unique challenges and\nproblems which confront small island developing\nStates and to full and effective implementation of the\nBarbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States. It is\nfor that reason that we participated actively last year in\nthe preparatory process for the World Summit on\nSustainable Development. We were pleased that the\nJohannesburg Plan of Implementation reinforced the\nview that small island developing States are a special\ncase in terms of both the environment and\ndevelopment.\nThe Johannesburg Summit also recognized that,\nalthough small island developing States continue to\ntake the lead in the path towards sustainable\ndevelopment, they remain increasingly constrained by\nthe interplay of adverse factors such as their small size,\nfragility, isolation and vulnerability.\nIt is for this reason that Trinidad and Tobago will\nplay host next week to the Caribbean small island\ndeveloping States regional preparatory meeting, one of\nfour regional meetings being held by small island\ndeveloping States in order to identify and develop\ninputs for the review of the Barbados Programme of\nAction. Implementation has been the Achilles heel of\nthe Programme of Action. Small island developing\nStates have taken the lead in our efforts to achieve\nsustainable development. We need, however, the\nsupport of the international community.\nWe trust that the international meeting to review\nthe Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, to be\nheld in Mauritius in 2004, will not only better enable\nus to evaluate the Barbados Programme of Action, but\nultimately lead to an enhanced level of political\ncommitment and increased financial and technical\nassistance for small island developing States on the\npart of the international community.\nAnother issue of the utmost concern to the\nGovernment of Trinidad and Tobago and, indeed, to all\nCARICOM Governments, is the continued trans-\nshipment of nuclear waste through the Caribbean Sea.\nThe reassurances of adequate safeguards do not\nconstitute guarantees against the potentially\ndevastating impact of an accident on our economies\nand ecosystems. We therefore once more call upon the\nStates concerned to cease this practice.\nRecent events have also pointed to the challenges\nfaced by many countries in the area of governance. The\nGovernment of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago,\n12\n\nwhich was elected in recent multi-party elections that\nwere peaceful, free and fair, is committed to efficient\nand transparent Government, to ensuring respect for\nhuman rights and the rule of law, to the devolution of\nresources and decision-making to the local levels of\ngovernment, and to the meaningful participation of all\nits citizens in the formulation of public policy.\nThe Government has also set itself the goal of\nachieving developed country status by 2020, with the\naim of providing to all its citizens by that date a high\nquality of life in all areas, including education, health,\nemployment, housing, transportation, telecommunications,\nwater and electricity. This the Government hopes to\nachieve by allocating a sizeable portion of its national\nbudget to programmes of human-resource development\nand of economic infrastructure and institutional\ndevelopment, as well as social programmes aimed at\nthe eradication of poverty.\nBut our national goals can only be achieved if our\ndomestic efforts are complemented by efforts at the\ninternational level to achieve greater international\neconomic stability and a more equitable distribution of\nresources among States, and if the benefits of free trade\nare more widely shared, particularly by those countries\nwhose incorporation into the world economy places\nthem at a disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis their developed\ncountry partners. The new opportunities occasioned by\nglobalization and trade liberalization, which we\nconsider to be a positive force for good, should be\navailable to all, and not to just a privileged few. We\nmust avoid further marginalization of the vulnerable\nStates among us. Given the central role of trade in the\nachievement of economic expansion, the failure of the\nrecent World Trade Organization meeting in Canc\u00fan to\nagree on issues critical to developing countries does\nnot augur well for our future economic well-being or\nfor that of the least developed, landlocked and small\nisland developing States among us. We are hopeful for\ngreater flexibility on the part of our developed\ncountries\u2019 negotiating partners in Geneva next\nDecember, which is necessary if any progress is to be\nachieved.\nThe quest for economic and social justice for all\npeoples cannot be divorced from the fervent desire of\nall peoples to live in freedom and without fear for their\nlives. The growing religious and ethnic diversity of our\nsocieties highlights the ever-present need for mutual\nrespect for and tolerance of the diversity that today is a\ncharacteristic of many communities. The lack of such\ntolerance and respect has fuelled once again in our\nlifetime the horrific crimes of genocide, crimes against\nhumanity and war crimes.\nTo deter the commission of such crimes in the\nfuture, and in order to deal with flagrant abuses of the\nfundamental human rights and freedom of the\nindividual, including the right to life, liberty and\nsecurity of the person, the international community\nestablished the International Criminal Court (ICC),\nwhich this year has made substantial progress in\nestablishing its principal organs, through the election\nof its Judges, Chief Prosecutor, Deputy Prosecutor and\nthe Registrar.\nThe ICC does not represent victor\u2019s justice, but a\nuniversal and shared symbol of morality based on the\nfundamental principle that those individuals who\ncommit the serious crimes within the jurisdiction of the\nCourt will, with the broad support of the international\ncommunity, be brought to trial before such a tribunal,\nbut only where their national Governments are unable\nor unwilling to do so.\nTrinidad and Tobago remains committed to the\nefficient and effective functioning of this permanent\nInternational Criminal Court, and deplores all efforts to\nundermine its integrity and the commitment of its\nStates Parties to carry out in good faith the obligations\ninto which they have freely entered through their\nadherence to the Rome Statute of the ICC. We call for\nwider adherence to the Statute by all States, so that it\nmay one day have universal application. Only a\nuniversal commitment by all States to strive to\neliminate the culture of impunity for such heinous\ncrimes will successfully stem the tide of the horrific\nevents that continue to mar our world.\nSeveral speakers in this general debate have\nreferred to the crisis in multilateralism and the need for\nthe reform of the United Nations to make it more\nrelevant to present day realities. It is in this context that\nthe Government of the Republic of Trinidad and\nTobago welcomes the call made by the Secretary-\nGeneral in his statement to the General Assembly on\n23 September for a thorough restructuring of the post-\nSecond-World-War institutional architecture of the\nUnited Nations through the reform and strengthening\nof its major organs. His stated intention to pursue an\napproach through the modality of a panel of eminent\npersons enjoys the full support of the Government of\nTrinidad and Tobago. We would not wish at this time,\n13\n\nto prejudge the outcome of the work of such a panel,\nbut would hope that it will recognize the role that small\nStates play in international affairs.\nWe expect the panel\u2019s final recommendations to\ntake the form of specific proposals for amendments to\nthe Charter that will be able to command the widest\npossible support of the international community at the\nhighest political levels. The reform exercise must have\nas its ultimate objective the strengthening of the United\nNations and an enhancement of its capacity to respond\nto the new global challenges.\nWe must also ensure that the long overdue reform\nof the Security Council takes place. Expansion of the\nCouncil\u2019s membership to make it more democratic and\nrepresentative can only confer greater legitimacy on\nthe Council and on the Organization as a whole.\nMost importantly, we must better empower the\nGeneral Assembly, the most representative of all the\norgans of the United Nations, to play its role more\neffectively as the chief deliberative and policy-making\norgan of the Organization.\nNo other institution has the inclusiveness or the\nlegitimacy that the United Nations has. We must\ntherefore spare no effort to make it a more effective\ninstrument in the service of all the peoples of the\nworld.\nIn conclusion, the stark international situation\ncalls for more, not less, international cooperation in\nfacing the countless challenges that confront countries\nlarge and small. We must seek to implement urgently\nnew and better policies aimed at the prevention of\narmed conflict. We must make fuller use of the few\nopportunities for economic and social progress that\npresent themselves. We must demonstrate the necessary\npolitical will to maintain a peaceful and secure\ninternational environment that is conducive to the\nuplifting and well-being of all humanity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me, first of all,\nto express once again to the Secretary-General and to\nall United Nations personnel the condolences of my\nGovernment and the people of Botswana for the\nterrorist attack on United Nations headquarters in\nBaghdad on 19 August. We are outraged that an attack\nof that magnitude was carried out against international\ncivil servants, whose sole mission in that country is to\nhelp Iraqis rebuild their country. The death of Special\nRepresentative Sergio Vieira de Mello and a number of\nhis staff is indeed a loss to the United Nations family\nthat we shall all feel for a long time to come.\nMay I now pay my respects to you, Mr. President,\nand congratulate you on your election as President of\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session. I\npledge to you the full support of my delegation. Let me\nalso pay tribute to our illustrious Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his dynamic leadership of the\nOrganization, in particular for his unshakeable\ncommitment to the reform of the United Nations. I\nassure him of the unwavering support of Botswana in\nthe discharge of his onerous responsibilities.\nThe fifty-eighth session is beginning at a time\nwhen we are faced with formidable challenges to the\ncohesion of the international community and to the role\nof the United Nations in maintaining international\npeace and security. We have just witnessed the war in\nIraq, which caused deep divisions and recrimination\namong the Member States of the United Nations. It is\nimportant that the Member States set aside their\ndifferences and promote the Organization as a force\nthat can rally nations, both big and small, around\ncommon causes. For the United Nations to succeed in\nits mission, it is important that all Member States\nrespect the Charter.\nAlthough now fewer in number, conflicts\ncontinue to bedevil the African continent. Fighting is\nstill going on in many parts of Liberia, although there\nis a semblance of peace in the capital, Monrovia. It is a\nwelcome development that the Security Council has\ndecided to send a peacekeeping mission to that war-\ntorn country. The peace process in C\u00d9te d'Ivoire,\nthough holding, is still fragile. Only recently, a military\ncoup took place in Guinea-Bissau. Botswana strongly\ncondemns the coup, which further tarnishes the image\nof Africa. We welcome the news that, through the\nmediation of the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States(ECOWAS) and the African Union, the\nmilitary in Guinea-Bissau has agreed to hand over\npower to a civilian interim administration until\nelections are held, in two years' time.\nThose conflicts continue to drain Africa's energies\nand to undermine the continent's capacity to focus on the\nequally challenging tasks of development and poverty\neradication. The vicious cycle of war, poverty, hunger\nand disease has left African people in despair. They\nwonder whether in this new millennium the dawn of\npeace and tranquillity that they so aspire to will ever\ncome. The inability of the international community\nthus far to act resolutely to address those conflicts will\nno doubt make it more difficult for the continent to\nimplement its major programmes, such as the New\nPartnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD).\nThe conflict in the Middle East continues to be a\nmatter of grave concern. All initiatives towards a\npeaceful settlement, including the road map promoted\nby the Quartet, have so far failed. The decision by\nIsrael and others to insist on determining who in the\nleadership of the Palestinians they will do business with is\nan unacceptable precondition for genuine negotiations.\nWorse still, the threat to expel the democratically elected\nleader of the Palestinians, Mr. Arafat, is a recipe for\nfurther strife that could result in more loss of life on both\nsides. That development should be condemned by all\nwho want to see peace in that land.\nIn Iraq, despite formal pronouncements that\nhostilities have ended, the country is still not at peace.\nInstead we see an escalation of violence, with many\npeople, including coalition troops, being killed every\nday. The situation clearly calls for an intervention by\nthe Security Council to ensure that the Iraqi people are\n29\n\ngiven the mandate to govern themselves and that the\nUnited Nations is given a bigger role to play in the\nreconstruction of the country.\nBotswana firmly believes that the various\nchallenges that the international community faces today\ncan best be tackled under a multilateral framework. The\nUnited Nations remains the foremost body for promoting\nthe Agenda for Peace. Small States such as my own\nplace great hope in multilateral partnership and\ncooperation, for on their own or in their small regional\ngroupings the challenges they face are formidable. We\ntherefore call upon Member States to rededicate\nthemselves to the noble ideals of the Organization.\nAs we direct our energies towards peace and\nsecurity, we must also remain focused on the twin\nchallenges of development and poverty eradication.\nThose are global challenges requiring global solutions\nand the active participation of all nations.\nOur performance in efforts to eradicate poverty\ncannot be considered successful by any measure.\nPoverty still remains a blemish on humankind's\nattempts at socio-economic upliftment. The policies,\nstrategies and programmes to address the situation have\nnot had the desired effect. It is estimated that about 1.2\nbillion people around the world still live in poverty,\nand a large proportion of them live in Africa. It is\nunacceptable that in this day and age, when billions of\ndollars are spent on armaments, space technology and\nother advances in human endeavour, such a large\nnumber of people are still poor and marginalized.\nWe should bear in mind that there is a clearly\nestablished link between poverty, on the one hand, and\nthe political instability and insecurity that the world is\nwitnessing today, on the other. Poverty breeds\nresentment, anger and despair. People condemned to\nthe margins of society feel that they have nothing to\ngain by participating in the democratic process of\ngovernance. Instead they believe that they have nothing\nto lose by using violent means in expressing their\ngrievances, for in their perception, the international\ncommunity is indifferent to their suffering.\nThree years after the Millennium Declaration was\nadopted by our heads of State, the General Assembly\nshould take full stock of the progress achieved towards\nthe fulfilment of the commitments contained in it.\nBotswana welcomes the report of the Secretary-\nGeneral on the implementation of the Millennium\nDeclaration. It is the intention of my delegation to\nparticipate actively in the debate on this matter.\nWe need to measure in concrete terms whether there\nhas been an increase in the flow of official development\nassistance. We need to measure whether we have been\nable to mobilize enough domestic and international\nresources for development, including foreign direct\ninvestment and private capital flows. We need to measure\nwhether we have resolved the external debt crisis. We\nneed to measure how far we have gone towards\nestablishing fair and equitable international monetary\nand trading systems. Above all, we need to measure\nhow much we have achieved in the global fight against\nthe HIV/AIDS pandemic. In that context, it is regrettable\nthat the recent talks in Cancun on trade, a key factor in\npoverty reduction and development, collapsed.\nEarlier, I referred to the need for the international\ncommunity to address the problem of poverty with all\nthe resources at its disposal; for the failure to do so will\nonly increase the level of frustration and anger and\nfeelings of powerlessness among the poor, which will\nin turn will provide fertile ground for radicalism and\nextremism.\nBotswana strongly condemns international\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Terrorism,\nlike poverty, is now the biggest threat to civilized\nnorms of international discourse. The recent senseless\nand deliberate attack on the United Nations office in\nBaghdad is a stark reminder that even the United\nNations servants of peace and humankind are not\nimmune from acts of terror. We must support the\nappeal by the Secretary-General for the adoption of\nurgent measures to provide protection and security to\nUnited Nations staff wherever they serve. We believe\nthat the United Nations must be empowered to play a\npivotal role in mobilizing international consensus\naround measures to curb the scourge of terrorism. In\nthat respect, Botswana remains ready to cooperate in\nany way possible with the relevant United Nations\nagencies.\nMy delegation was most pleased that a high-level\nmeeting of the General Assembly was convened on 22\nSeptember this year to focus on sharing best practices\nand the lessons learned in the fight against the\nHIV/AIDS pandemic. As one of the countries most\naffected by that scourge, my Government accords the\nhighest priority to tackling HIV/AIDS. My delegation\nfully supports the conclusions reached by the high-\n30\n\nlevel interactive panel on the critical issues that must\nnow be addressed, namely, political leadership; stigma\nand discrimination against people living with HIV/\nAIDS; the importance of broad-based partnerships; and\nresource mobilization on a very large scale. We call\nupon our development partners, both in Government\nand in the private sector, to dig deeper into their\npockets to support the efforts of developing countries\nstruggling so hard to meet their obligations to control\nthat scourge.\nTurning to the Secretary-General's reform\nproposals, while progress has been made in respect of\nthe rationalization of the functions of the Secretariat,\nespecially in the economic and social fields, formidable\nhurdles still remain in connection with the reform of\nthe Security Council. The Open-ended Working Group\non the Question of Equitable Representation on and\nIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council\nhas, in our view, done all that is humanly possible to\nsolicit a wide range of views and to try to bridge the\ndifferences that have emerged. But, regrettably, little\nprogress has been made. It is clear to us that this\nmatter, which is of vital importance to the whole\nOrganization, will only move forward if there is political\nwill on the part of some key Member States. This issue\ncannot continue to defy our collective wisdom after 10\nyears of deliberation. A compromise solution must\nemerge soon or history will judge us harshly.\nWe welcome what now seems to be an emerging\nconsensus towards the revitalization of the General\nAssembly. The speeches delivered in the Assembly\nhave been correctly observed by the Secretary-General\nin his report as being repetitive and sterile. The agenda\ntends to be too long, and often results in a duplication\nof issues. We share the proposal to keep the agenda\nshort and focused, with a number of issues clustered.\nLong speeches should be replaced by more focused\ndebates and interactive dialogue. We strongly believe\nthat those modest reforms would make the\ndeliberations of the General Assembly more interesting\nto our stakeholders. They would also enable issues of\nvital importance to be fully debated, and thus make it\neasier to implement the decisions reached.\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate Botswana's\ncommitment to the United Nations and its agenda. To\nus the United Nations is the embodiment of our\ncollective will to accomplish the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me, at the outset, to\njoin previous speakers in congratulating you, Sir, on\nyour election as President of the fifty-eighth session of\nthe General Assembly. We would also like to commend\nyour predecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, for the manner in\nwhich he guided the proceedings of the Assembly\nduring the previous session. I would likewise like to\ncommend the Secretary-General for his relentless\nefforts to turn the United Nations into an effective\ninstrument for international cooperation in the search\nfor, and the preservation of, peace and security.\nThe United Nations family has recently lost some\nof its best servants. We mourn, in particular, the tragic\ndeath of Sergio Vieira de Mello, a dedicated servant of\nour Organization. We would like to reiterate our\ndeepest condolences to the United Nations, the\nGovernment of Brazil and Sergio\u2019s family.\nWe also mourn the passing away of Anna Lindh,\nSweden\u2019s Minister for Foreign Affairs, who was an\noutstanding diplomat and defender of the United\nNations. Her departure is a major loss for humankind,\nas she fought for a world order in which every nation\ncould live in peace, harmony and prosperity. We wish\nto reiterate our heartfelt condolences to the people and\nGovernment of Sweden, as well as to her bereaved\nfamily.\n2\n\nI have come to this session of the General\nAssembly as a messenger of the peoples of\nMozambique, and of Africa as a whole \u2014 a messenger\nof peoples who are engaged in consolidating political,\neconomic and social reforms. Today more than ever\nbefore, the peoples of Africa believe in the strength of\ntheir will, cohesion and unity. They believe in realizing\nthe potential of their human and natural resources and\ncapacities. They believe in learning from past\nexperiences, good and bad, to restore peace and\nstability and to generate wealth and prosperity\nthroughout the continent. The peoples of Africa are\nemulating the experiences of countries like my own,\nMozambique, where after years of armed conflict a\nnew era of peace and gradual, but steady, development\nhas been taking place during the past 11 years. During\nthose 11 years, we have made continuous progress in\nconsolidating peace and democracy. We are now\nengaged in the process of preparing for our second\nmunicipal elections, which will be held on 19\nNovember 2003. In 2004 Mozambique will hold its\nthird general and multiparty elections to elect the\nPresident as well as members of Parliament. The peace\nand socio-economic stability that prevail in our country\nhave created an enabling environment for domestic and\nforeign investment, which are pivotal for the\ngeneration of employment and for the reduction of\npoverty.\nThe gross domestic product of Mozambique\u2019s\neconomy grew at an encouraging rate of 7.7 per cent\nlast year, which has resulted in increased social-service\nallocations in the national budget. That is all the more\nimportant given the fact that Mozambique, like many\nother countries in southern Africa, is still facing a\nhumanitarian crisis that is the result of continuing\nunfavourable weather patterns that have stricken the\nentire region for several years. We urge the\ninternational community to respond favourably to the\nrecently launched appeal for humanitarian assistance\nfor southern Africa.\nAs part of its efforts to fight poverty, the\nGovernment is implementing a plan of action for the\neradication of absolute poverty, which aims to maintain\nthe current average economic growth rate of 8 per cent\nand to reduce absolute poverty to below 50 per cent by\n2010. With the objective of creating a national vision\nfor development in the next 25 years, the Government\nof Mozambique has launched its Agenda 2025, a\nnational strategy for the future of the country based on\na constructive dialogue with all political parties and\nstakeholders.\nLast July, Mozambique had the honour of hosting\nthe Second Assembly of the Heads of State and\nGovernment of the African Union. During that\nAssembly, we took important decisions that laid down\nthe foundations of the African Union and that will\ncontribute to the effective implementation of the New\nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD). As\nexpressed in the Maputo Declaration, the commitment\nand political will of African countries to take effective\nand concrete measures towards the implementation of\nNEPAD reflects the recognition of the fact that the\nprimary responsibility for the implementation of that\ninitiative rests with the peoples and Governments of\nAfrica.\nIn the course of the past two years, in order to\ngive coherence to NEPAD matters within African\nGovernments, we have emphasized the creation of an\ninstitutional framework to oversee the implementation\nof NEPAD at the regional level so as to integrate\nNEPAD priorities into our national development\nprogrammes and create institutions to manage those\npriorities. In that connection, we must also highlight\nthe fact that NEPAD includes an African Peer Review\nMechanism, whose objective is to foster the adoption\nof policies, standards and practices conducive to\npolitical stability, high economic growth, sustainable\ndevelopment and accelerated regional and continental\nintegration. We have already assembled a \u201cpanel of\nwise persons\u201d to lend its assistance to the review\nprocess that will soon be under way.\nInternational support for the implementation of\nNEPAD is essential. NEPAD should be the framework\nwithin which the international community, including\nthe United Nations system, concentrates its efforts on\nAfrica\u2019s development. In that connection, Africa\u2019s\ndevelopment partners are urged to continue to lend\ntheir assistance, with a view to translating into reality\ntheir pledges of support to NEPAD.\nThat is the main agenda of the African Union,\nwhich seeks to build a strong foundation for\ndemocracy, good governance, peace, stability and\nsustainable development, as well as to create better\nliving conditions for all of Africa\u2019s peoples. We\nrecognize that that represents a colossal challenge for\npresent and future generations of African leaders, as it\nwas when we created the Organization of African\n3\n\nUnity (OAU) 40 years ago and committed ourselves to\nliberating Africa as our main goal.\nIn Maputo we have also dealt with the issues of\npeace and security, for they continue to be the major\nchallenge in Africa. It is for that reason that we have\nreiterated the importance of the entry into force of the\nPeace and Security Council, which will be an important\nbody of the African Union that will deal with issues\nrelated to conflict prevention, management and\nresolution.\nStep by step, and with the continued support of\nthe international community, Africa is steadily\ndischarging its responsibilities for the maintenance of\npeace and stability in the continent.\nIn keeping with the OAU Algiers Summit\ndecision of 1999 on unconstitutional change of\nGovernment, the coordinated action of the African\nUnion, the Community of the Portuguese-Speaking\nCountries, the Economic Community of Central\nAfrican States, Nigeria, South Africa and other key\nplayers, enabled President Fradique de Menezes of Sao\nTome and Principe to return to power, foiling an\nattempted unconstitutional change of Government.\nThe recent positive developments in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, including the\nformation of the Transitional Government and the\nParliament, the appointment of army command\nstructures and the deployment of the forces of the\nUnited Nations Organization Mission in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) in\nBunia, have lent new momentum to the peace process\nin that country. We must not allow that process to be\nderailed. All of us, including neighbouring countries,\nhave an obligation to support the Congolese people and\nits Government in their long struggle for peace and\nstability.\nFollowing the departure of President Taylor from\nLiberia, on 18 August 2003, we witnessed the signing\nat Accra, Ghana, of the Comprehensive Peace\nAgreement. That Agreement covers a wide range of\nissues, including the cessation of hostilities. More\nimportantly, it provides for the establishment of a\ntransitional Government that will assume its\nresponsibilities on 14 October 2003 until the holding of\ncredible general elections in October 2005.\nAllow me pay well-deserved tribute to President\nKufuor of Ghana and President Obasanjo of Nigeria,\nand indeed to all the member States of the Economic\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS), for\ntheir critical role in that process. Regional leadership\nand international support for the peace process in\nLiberia will be meaningless if Liberians themselves fail\nto meet their obligations regarding peace and stability\nin their country. We would also like to commend the\nSecurity Council for its action on Liberia in support of\nECOWAS efforts. We welcome the adoption of\nresolution 1509 (2003), which established the United\nNations Mission in Liberia.\nWith respect to Burundi, we Africans have\ndischarged our responsibilities by establishing an\nAfrican mission in Burundi. In that context, I am happy\nto inform the General Assembly that, prior to my\ndeparture from Maputo, I bid farewell to the\nMozambican contingent of peacekeepers to be\ndeployed to Burundi. They are joining South African\nand Ethiopian forces in a clear demonstration of our\ncommitment to peace and stability in Burundi and in\nthe subregion. In that regard, I would like to take this\nopportunity to express our gratitude to the British\nGovernment for the assistance it has extended to us.\nWe appeal to the Security Council to adopt a\nresolution formally endorsing that mission, and to take\nthe necessary measures to provide political, financial\nand logistical support to it. Failure to act decisively\nwill lead to a deterioration of the situation, with serious\nimplications for the stability of Burundi and the\nsubregion.\nThe African Union and ECOWAS took prompt\nmeasures after the recent coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Guinea-Bissau\nto help the people of that country to return to\nconstitutional legality. We are pleased to inform the\nAssembly that they have already selected by consensus\na President and Prime Minister, who are going to lead a\ntransitional Government. They have also developed\nother bodies to prepare the country for elections, which\nare to be held soon. We appeal to the international\ncommunity to render its valuable assistance to Guinea-\nBissau so that it will be able to overcome its dramatic\nsocial and economic situation as soon as possible.\nIn the Horn of Africa, we must continue to\nencourage Ethiopia and Eritrea to work together, with\nthe support of the United Nations, to strengthen peace,\nstability and good neighbourliness and to overcome the\ndifficulties that continue to exist. The ongoing peace\n4\n\nprocesses in Sudan and Somalia raise our hopes that\nlasting peace will soon be achieved in the region.\nWe welcome the lifting of sanctions against Libya\nand the settlement reached between all parties\nconcerned, which will enable us to bring that issue to a\nclose.\nThe stabilization of the situation in Angola,\nComoros and Sierra Leone are clear signs that, despite\nthe difficulties, Africa is making strides towards the\nattainment of lasting peace, stability and socio-\neconomic development.\nThe peoples of Africa are fully engaged in\nbuilding a continent of hope. The African Union, along\nwith the regional economic communities, is committed\nto addressing the challenges faced by the continent.\nAfrica is endowed with human and natural resources\nthat can contribute decisively to African development.\nWhat we need is an opportunity to integrate ourselves\ninto the world economy; an opportunity to benefit from\nglobalization and increased interdependence; an\nopportunity to benefit from liberalized trade, finance\nand investment, instead of suffering from\nmarginalization and exclusion; and an opportunity for\naccess to science and technology, in particular\ninformation technology.\nThat will be possible if, among other things, the\ninternational community continues to seek viable and\neffective ways and means to address the debt burden,\nthe low levels of official development assistance and\nforeign direct investment and the issue of market\naccess for African products in developed countries.\nWith regard to the latter, we are disappointed that the\nCanc\u00fan conference failed to produce positive results.\nThe recent tragic events that have claimed so\nmany innocent lives are a painful reminder of the fact\nthat international terrorism continues to represent a\nserious threat to peace and security in the world. Those\nevents have also further demonstrated that no country\nis immune from the scourge of terror and that we will\nhave to take concerted action to effectively address that\nissue. The United Nations remains the most appropriate\nforum to find the best ways and means to combat\nterrorism.\nIn recent times, some sceptical people have\nwondered whether the United Nations has lost its\ncredibility and relevance. The answer is clear: the role\nof the United Nations as the main instrument for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security has\ntoday been vindicated more than ever before. As the\nSecretary-General has correctly pointed out, it is\nthrough the United Nations that we can all find the\nmuch-sought legitimacy of action in tackling issues of\ncommon concern, including threats to peace and\nsecurity, and in addressing the challenges of\nsustainable development and HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis,\nmalaria and other infectious diseases.\nThe Millennium Development Goals remain the\nmost significant targets agreed by the international\ncommunity, as they cover the major areas of concern to\nthe peoples of the world.\nSince the adoption of the Millennium\nDeclaration, experience has shown that attaining its\ngoals requires greater international solidarity and\ncooperation.\nBy virtue of its universality, the United Nations\nhas shown that it has the political and moral authority\nto tackle not only the issues I have outlined, but also all\nother issues of concern to mankind. The Organization\nmust therefore be strengthened, safeguarded and\nadequately funded. It is for those reasons that we must\ncontinue to support the Secretary-General and the\nUnited Nations as they shoulder their responsibilities in\nlaying the foundations for a just and lasting peace and\nfor socio-economic development worldwide. We in\nAfrica reiterate our firm commitment to make our\ncontribution to the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I\nshould also like to express the gratitude of my\ndelegation to his predecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan.\nWe would like to express our appreciation for the\nimportant role that the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, continues to play in revitalizing the\nwork of the Organization. In this connection, we\nwelcome his ideas regarding the institutional reform of\nthe Organization. I would also like to take this\nopportunity to express to the United Nations our\nheartfelt condolences for the untimely deaths of Mr.\nSergio Vieira de Mello and his colleagues.\nWhen I addressed the Assembly from this\nrostrum last year, I made clear that my Government\nand my country were eager to achieve peace in the\nSudan. I am very pleased, therefore, to inform the\n23\n\nAssembly that our words have been matched with\ndeeds, and peace is now on the horizon \u2014 peace that\nwill put an end to an armed conflict that has\nsquandered the human and natural resources of the\ncountry and hindered the development of the Sudanese\npeople.\nMy country has continuously reiterated its desire\nfor dialogue and negotiation with the Sudan People\u2019s\nLiberation Army Movement (SPLM). Our efforts,\ntogether with those of the mediators, have been\ncontinuing for more than 10 years and have recently\nbeen crowned with success in the form of an agreement\nby both parties as a result of an initiative put forward\nby the countries of the Inter-Governmental Authority\non Development, under the patronage of the sisterly\ncountry, Kenya, and with much appreciated positive\nsupport by the IGAD partners.\nAt the most recent round of negotiations, His\nExcellency Mr. Ali Osman Mohamed Taha, First Vice-\nPresident, led the Government delegation, and Mr. John\nGarang led the SPLM delegation. Four days ago, it\nresulted in an agreement on security arrangements and\nthe extension of a ceasefire. It is expected that that\nagreement will pave the way for a final round of\nnegotiations that will lead to just and lasting peace\nthroughout the Sudan as soon as possible.\nI would like to take this opportunity to express\nour gratitude to the IGAD member countries for the\nrole they played in the Sudan peace process, under the\nstewardship of the President of Kenya and his special\nenvoy. Our thanks and appreciation also go to IGAD\npartners, namely the United States of America, the\nUnited Kingdom, Italy and Norway. We would like to\nexpress particular gratitude for the positive\nintervention of the Government of the United States of\nAmerica at the most critical juncture in the negotiation\nprocess. We also appreciate the considerable efforts\nthat Egypt and Libya have continued to make in the\ninterests of peace in the Sudan, as well as those of the\nArab League and the African Union.\nWe are confident that Members will understand\nhow important the ceasefire agreement is for the\nhumanitarian situation. The report of the Secretary-\nGeneral on the humanitarian situation in the Sudan\ndemonstrates the extent of the progress made in this\narea. Next month will mark the one-year anniversary of\nthe cessation of hostilities. Peace remains a basic\nrequirement for the rehabilitation of the areas affected\nby war and will allow for the transition from\nhumanitarian relief to comprehensive sustainable\ndevelopment.\nWe would like to reiterate our full conviction that\nthe peace, security and stability of the countries of the\nregion are directly linked with peace in the Sudan. That\nis why my country has endeavoured to heal the wounds\nof the past in its relations with neighbouring countries,\nin particular Egypt and Ethiopia. Our relationship with\nthose two countries has moved beyond the\nreconciliation stage; we now have exemplary strategic\nsecurity ties with them, thereby protecting the interests\nof our peoples and consolidating peace and security in\nthe entire region.\nWe would like to express gratitude to our friends\nand brothers and to the United Nations in general for\ntheir humanitarian assistance during the conflict. We\ncall upon the international community to help in the\npost-conflict reconstruction of our country and the\nrehabilitation of internally displaced persons and\nrefugees, and to assist in the achievement of\nsustainable development in support of the fledgling\npeace.\nIt gives me great pleasure to tell the Assembly\nthat we have made appreciable constitutional\nachievements that will open the door wide for\nparticipation by all the Sudanese people in all areas of\npolitical life. Economic plans and policies adopted by\nthe Government have started to bear fruit, whether in\nthe form of reduced levels of inflation, high rates of\ngrowth or the stabilization of exchange rates. We will\ncontinue to enhance those policies with a view to\nreducing poverty and achieving sustainable\ndevelopment within the framework of the 25-year\ncomprehensive development strategy for the period\n2003-2027.\nIn his report on the work of the Organization, the\nSecretary-General reminded us that, as the challenges\nfacing us change, so must we alter our methods of\ndealing with them. It is high time, therefore, that we\nsummon the political will to reform the Security\nCouncil by dealing with the double issues of\nmembership and the right of veto so as to make it more\nrepresentative and democratic in its membership and in\nits decision-making. While touching on Security\nCouncil reform, we warmly welcome Council\n24\n\nresolution 1506 (2003), which lifted the sanctions\nimposed against fraternal Libya. In that connection, we\nwish to stress the need to lift all unilateral sanctions,\nused as a means for the political and economic\ncoercion of States. We urge the Security Council not to\nbe quick to impose sanctions on countries, particularly\nthe developing countries, because of their adverse\nimpact on their people.\nThe high-level participation at this session to\ndiscuss various international issues is clear evidence of\nthe General Assembly\u2019s importance. We strongly\nsupport its efforts to rearrange its priorities and agenda\nitems, in order to improve the administrative and\nprocedural aspects of its work, to enhance its relations\nwith the Security Council, the highest organ in the\nUnited Nations, to contribute to the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security and to face ongoing\nchallenges.\nAnother challenge of great concern to us lately is\nthe increasing acts of terrorism. Terrorist acts that\noccurred in various parts of the world last year clearly\nprove that no country is immune to terrorism. All of us,\nregardless of our religion or beliefs, could be the\nvictims of such crimes. As I mentioned earlier,\nterrorism has no religion or country. Hence, in order to\nface this grave threat, we need to reach an international\nconsensus on its definition, root causes and means to\ncombat it, under the auspices of our international\nOrganization.\nIn that context, we express our support for the\ncall of His Excellency Mohamed Hosni Mubarak,\nPresident of the Arab Republic of Egypt, to convene an\ninternational conference, under the auspices of the\nUnited Nations, to address the issue of terrorism. In the\ncontext of its international and regional role, the Sudan\nwill have the honour next year to host the Non-Aligned\nMovement ministerial conference. We hope that the\nconference will consider issues of collective security\nand challenges.\nThe deteriorating socio-economic situation of the\nleast developed countries requires the international\ncommunity to make every effort to extricate them from\nthe labyrinth of poverty, hunger and disease. Our\nexperience in the Sudan has proved that, regardless of\ntheir endeavours, the least developed countries cannot\nachieve the objectives of the Brussels Programme of\nAction without substantial assistance from their\ndevelopment partners. I commend the tireless efforts of\nthe High Representative of the Secretary-General for\nthe Least Developed Countries in mobilizing\ninternational support for initiatives on the subject. We\njoin the appeal to the international community by His\nExcellency Joaquim Alberto Chissano, President of\nMozambique, as Chairman of the African Union, to\nextend support and assistance to the New Partnership\nfor Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD), the framework\nadopted by the African continent and endorsed by the\nUnited Nations and donor countries as a tool for coping\nwith development challenges in the continent.\nI am pleased to inform members that the Sudan,\nas Chairman of the Intergovernmental Authority on\nDevelopment (IGAD) and Common Market for Eastern\nand Southern Africa (COMESA), has tried its best to\nformulate policies and take steps that will further\nconsolidate and promote links of cooperation between\nEGAD and COMESA member States. Such efforts are\nin line with the NEPAD initiative aimed at achieving\npeace, development and prosperity for the peoples of\nthe entire African continent. To that end, a number of\nspecialized conferences have been convened in the\nSudan to address issues of economic cooperation,\ndisarmament and combating terrorism, as well as issues\nof internally displaced persons and refugees, all with\nthe aim of attaining the NEPAD goals.\nAnother agenda item subject that we think will\nnegatively impact the future of humankind if not\nproperly addressed is that of human cloning, which is\nnow at the centre of a heated scientific, religious, legal\nand ethical debate. The Sudan strongly supports the\ncall for an international convention against the\nreproductive cloning of human beings. We also\ncondemn all medical ventures that disdain human\ndignity and the sanctity of the Creator.\nStatements over the past few days clearly\ndemonstrate the keen interest of the international\ncommunity in maintaining international peace and\nsecurity. While adding our voice to those calling for the\nrevitalization of multilateral diplomacy, we also call\nfor the prompt handling of the critical security and\nhumanitarian situation in Iraq. Furthermore, we call for\nthe empowerment of our Iraqi brothers so that they\nmay exercise their right to sovereignty, as guaranteed\nto them by international law, and live in peace and\nharmony with their neighbours. It gives me pleasure to\nremind the Assembly of the important resolution\nadopted a few weeks ago by the Council of Ministers\nof the League of Arab States, which recognized the\n25\n\ntransitional Governing Council of Iraq. Such\nrecognition is a significant step that will, hopefully,\nenable Iraq to regain its sovereignty and to play its\nregional and international role.\nThe question of Palestine has been a deep\nconcern to the human conscience. For more than five\ndecades, it has been a major threat to international\npeace and security. We have been firmly convinced that\nIsrael\u2019s maintenance of a huge military presence, its\naggression and its killing and suppression of the\nPalestinian people, will only aggravate a situation that\nis already deteriorating. The only viable way to achieve\npeace is to adhere to the relevant resolutions of\ninternational legitimacy and international law. The\ninternational community, particularly the influential\nparties in the peace process, are urged to exert pressure\non Israel.\nThe conflict in Somalia has been a bleeding\nwound in the Horn of Africa and the time has come to\nstop that painful bleeding. We call upon the leaders of\nall Somali factions to join hands to preserve the unity\nand stability of their country, and to achieve\ndevelopment and prosperity for their people, in order to\nprotect them from the scourge of war and fighting. We\nremain confident that the neighbouring and other\ninterested countries will spare no effort to help reach\nan agreement that will preserve the unity, security and\nstability of Somalia.\nThe Sudan is now a genuine partner in the\ninternational efforts aimed at the prohibition of\nchemical weapons. One of the significant roles played\nby the Sudan in that regard was its hosting last August\nof the First Conference of the African National\nAuthorities of the Chemical Weapons Convention\nStates Parties. We are committed to implementing the\nrecommendations adopted at the conference,\nparticularly to creating a chemical-weapon-free zone in\nAfrica and to enhancing international cooperation in\nthe peaceful use of chemical materials.\nI call upon the international community to make\nrenewed efforts to declare the Middle East a zone free\nof nuclear weapons and of all other weapons of mass\ndestruction. That inflamed region must abide by\ninternational agreements banning nuclear weapons. The\nnuclear facilities of all States, without exception and\nwith complete fairness, must be subjected to the\ncomprehensive safeguards of the International Atomic\nEnergy Agency (IAEA).\nHere we recall, shortly after its fifth anniversary,\nthe unjust bombing of the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical and\nveterinary factory by the former United States\nAdministration which claimed that it was used to\nmanufacture weapons. It was a baseless accusation, as\nMembers are aware, that has been refuted by American\nscientific and academic institutions before relevant\ninternational organizations. The Sudan\u2019s complaint is\nstill alive in the Security Council. In that connection, I\ncall upon the current United States Administration to\nrectify the serious mistake that it inherited from its\npredecessor, by compensating the Sudan morally and\nfinancially.\nI hope that before the end of this session my\ncountry will finally bid farewell to the longest African\nconflict, an achievement that would enable the Sudan\nto play its role at the regional level and to contribute to\nthe stability and sustainable development of the\nAfrican continent.\nIn conclusion, I reaffirm our deep conviction that\nthe United Nations is the sole, irreplaceable mechanism\nfor administering and promoting international\ncooperation in all fields. Therefore, we should distance\nthe United Nations from serving narrow interests and\nfrom attempts to exploit it to pursue special agendas. In\nthat connection, we express our readiness and our\ncommitment to assist the United Nations system in\nachieving the lofty goals enshrined in the Charter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI\ncome before this parliament of humankind to present\nmy final report as a Head of State who believes in\ninterdependence and for whom sovereignty is not a\nclosed door separating nations, but rather an open\nwindow affording a glimpse into the identity of each\none, furthering the respectful interchange of\nexperiences and the quest for understanding and\nsolidarity among peoples.\nMy presence here reflects Guatemala\u2019s\ncommitment to the United Nations, whose presence in\nmy country has been crucial to the implementation of\nthe Peace Agreements concluded in 1996. It also gives\nme the opportunity to participate in the debate\nconcerning the main subjects that make up the\ninternational agenda, while at the same time allowing\nme once again to express our solidarity with the\ninhabitants of the great city of New York over the\ntragic events of two years ago.\nI wish to reiterate our energetic repudiation of the\ntreacherous attack against United Nations headquarters\nin Baghdad that took place just a few weeks ago. We\nespecially regret the loss of valuable officials of the\nOrganization, including the esteemed Sergio Vieira de\nMello.\nI also wish to express our gratitude to Mr. Jan\nKavan, of the Czech Republic, for his enlightened\nleadership of the previous session. At the same time, I\nwould like very sincerely to congratulate Mr. Julian\nHunte on having assumed the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at this session. We are pleased to see\na distinguished representative of our own region\noccupy such an important post. We have no doubt that,\nwith his proven abilities and his well-known\nexperience, he will be quite successful in conducting\nour deliberations.\nGuatemala, just like its brotherly countries in\nLatin America, has experienced a dramatic period at\nthe close of the twentieth century. That time has been\ncharacterized by a complex agenda involving various\nchallenges, including those of entering into the\nglobalization process, building peace with justice and\nconsolidating democracy in a way that includes good\ngovernance.\n13\n\nIn that regard, during the last four years we have\nsought to make progress in opening up Guatemala to\nthe world and in making it part of globalization\u2019s\ntechnological, financial and cultural currents. We\npromoted the democratization of institutions,\nmechanisms, practices and values capable of\ncommingling freedom with authority and effectiveness\nwith equality. We have also nurtured the concept of\npeace based on justice and respect for human rights.\nGuatemala is a country where several historical\ntasks remain to be completed or have been permanently\npostponed. When I assumed the presidency, in January\n2000, I resolved to thoroughly address some of those\npending issues. We have freed our country from its\ncaptivity by powerful economic interests. There are no\nlonger tax exemptions that favour individuals. Trade\npolicy is no longer manipulated to the detriment of the\nproduction of small farmers. Economic policy is now\nseen as an instrument of social development. After a\ncentury of captive markets, local monopolies are now\nexposed to competition.\nThe Peace Agreements bestowed on Guatemala a\nprogramme for democratization. With an eye towards\nthe twenty-first century, the Agreements constitute a\nproposal for a wide-ranging reinvigoration of\ncoexistence between Guatemalans. But the Agreements\nhave also presented us with the challenge of\nsimultaneously completing various tasks pertaining to\ndifferent historical processes that other societies have\ncarried out in stages.\nI am pleased to say that we have made progress in\nvarious substantive areas. However, I must also admit\nthat we have fallen short, or inadequately addressed,\nother areas.\nAgainst the opposition of powerful interests, we\nmade a determined effort to increase the tax rate. We\nachieved a historical level in the collection of taxes,\nbut without attaining the goal that had been set.\nWe carried out the most significant financial\nreform since 1945 in order to modernize the banking\nsystem, reduce the risks of speculation and restore to\nthe system its true mediation function.\nWe modernized the labour law, which since 1944\nhad suffered a series of setbacks. We consistently\nraised the minimum wage in real terms at an\nunprecedented pace. On average, workers in the\ncountryside now earn 50 per cent more than they did\nfour years ago.\nOur illiteracy rate has historically been shameful.\nWe therefore adopted plans that made it possible to\nreduce that rate by almost half. Special attention has\nbeen devoted to young girls. Through scholarships and\nschool feeding programmes, we have removed tens of\nthousands of children from child labour. We have also\nreformed curricula to include the philosophy of the\nPeace Agreements. And we have considerably\nincreased school enrolment.\nWith regard to basic health care, we have\nconfronted structural weaknesses in the critical areas of\nchild and maternal mortality rates and nutrition.\nHowever, much more remains to be done. We are\nin an unfavourable economic environment. The\ntraditional engines of growth and employment have\nweakened, and the necessary changes in production are\ntaking place slowly. We have therefore undertaken a\nmassive effort to stabilize the economy and have\nimplemented emergency measures, such as providing\nsmall farmers with agricultural supplies so that they\ncan sustain their productive capacity.\nThe issue of transforming the production process\nis so sensitive that it was a contributing factor in the\ncivil war that raged for almost 40 years during the last\ncentury. Recognizing the urgency of the issue, I\nintroduced reconciliation mechanisms in which all\nsectors participate in an effort to define the country\u2019s\nstrategic policies, including in the areas of economic\nand rural development.\nOur people have made significant advances in the\narea of participation in the past three years. We have\ncarried out the country\u2019s most significant reform by\ndecentralizing our institutions, strengthening local\ndevelopment councils and granting greater powers and\nfunctions to municipal governments. Indigenous\npeoples are now recognized as such and are able to\nparticipate in defining a new institutional landscape\ngrounded in their own cultures. Women also have an\nincreased public role and are developing innovative\nways of organizing.\nAll those efforts are aimed at reweaving our\nsocial fabric, which had been torn apart by the war.\nReconciliation is an essential task in that regard, and\nthe Government must foster a favourable climate for it\nto take place. That is why I assumed international\n14\n\ncommitments to counter violations of human rights.\nThat is also why we have begun a national\ncompensation programme that includes reparations for\nthe families of the more than 200,000 victims of the\nwar, most of whom were indigenous persons. We also\ntrust that the High Commissioner for Human Rights\nwill establish an Office in Guatemala.\nNevertheless, impunity continues to be a difficult\nissue to overcome. Judicial bodies continue to be weak,\nwhich is what led me to put forward an unprecedented\ntemporary measure to strengthen local institutional\ncapacity. I asked for the support of the United Nations\nin immediately establishing a commission to\ninvestigate illegal groups and clandestine security\nmechanisms, as several repressive groups of the past\nthat are now in league with organized crime are\nthreatening and intimidating human rights activists,\njudges and journalists.\nCivilian authority must be strengthened if we are\nto restore all aspects of democracy. Our efforts in that\nregard have been clear. We have established a civilian\nnational intelligence agency, as well as a civilian body\nresponsible for presidential security. We now have a\ndefence policy in keeping with the principles of\ndemocratic security that was the product of an open\ndebate among the members of our society. We have\ndesigned laws to provide for free access to information,\nthe declassification of secret State archives and the\nestablishment of civilian controls over security\nfunctions, which includes an advisory council on\nsecurity. Those efforts are well under way and should\nbe fully implemented during the next few years.\nPromoting a culture of peace has not been easy.\nThe trauma of war continues to hamper trust in our\nsociety. Political polarization also exists, as a result of\npowerful economic and military groups defending their\nprivileges. However, human life is less endangered and\nthe democratization process continues to move\nforward.\nI will fulfil two other basic commitments in the\nremaining 114 days of my presidency. One of them will\nbe to ensure that Guatemalans are able to take part in a\nfree and transparent electoral process that is closely\nmonitored by the international community and in\nwhich all political forces participate without exception.\nSuch an event will be taking place for only the second\ntime in our history during the past century.\nThe second commitment involves carrying out an\norderly transition of power that safeguards the reforms\nbegun in the context of the Peace Agreements. To that\nend, I have worked with my Government team to come\nup with a basic transition agenda that includes\nproviding for continuity in programmes and policies\nand the strengthening of institutions involved in the\npeace process.\nI would now like to turn briefly to some of the\nissues we will be dealing with during this session. In\nparticular, I would like to respond to the challenge that\nthe Secretary-General put before us this morning,\nnamely, how to rethink the United Nations in these\ntimes of fundamental changes.\nAs I have already said, we fully support the\nUnited Nations as the highest proponent of\nmultilateralism. We also firmly support the stewardship\nof Secretary-General Kofi Annan. We concur with his\nview that it is imperative that we adapt the\nOrganization to the exigencies of globalization. We\nwill also support efforts aimed at improving the\nmanagerial capacities of the Secretariat and at\npromoting the reform of intergovernmental bodies.\nWe therefore believe that we should not delay our\nefforts to make the Security Council more\nrepresentative, and its procedures more transparent.\nMoreover, we think that it is necessary to strengthen\nthe General Assembly and the Economic and Social\nCouncil in order that the three principal organs of our\nOrganization mutually support one another.\nWe reiterate our opposition to all forms of\nterrorism and we support the collective efforts of the\ninternational community to combat that scourge.\nWe believe that the United Nations should\ncontinue to give priority to the essential issue of\ndevelopment. Along with multilateral financial\norganizations, our Organization should dedicate itself\nto the task of ensuring that the benefits of globalization\nare widely shared among all the inhabitants of the\nworld. We also stress the singular importance of the\nMonterrey Consensus and the Johannesburg Plan of\nAction.\nWe express our disappointment at the lack of\nprogress made at the recent meeting of trade ministers\nheld in Canc\u00fan. As part of the G-21, we commit\nourselves to working constructively to bring together\nthe positions of all parties to produce a more open and\n15\n\ntransparent international trade regime that provides\nmore opportunities for developing countries.\nWe also underscore the need to give greater\nimportance in the international agenda to the situation\nof immigrants and migrant workers while focusing on\nundocumented immigrants, who constitute a vulnerable\ngroup vis-\u00e0-vis the need to protect human rights.\nI would especially like to refer to the subject of\nchildren and to the obligation of States to guarantee\ntheir rights and protection. A case in point is the effort\nthat is taking place in the context of the Convention on\nthe Rights of the Child to re-establish links between\nthree Guatemalan children and their mother, Gabriela\nArias.\nWe support all efforts to put an end to the tragic\nspiral of violence afflicting the Middle East and to\nachieve a just and lasting peace in that long-suffering\nregion.\nWe associate ourselves with efforts aimed at\nrestoring peace, security and the rule of law in Iraq, as\nwell as to reinstate that country\u2019s sovereignty. We share\nthe view that the United Nations should play a\nsignificant role in that undertaking.\nWe support the heartfelt aspiration of the 23\nmillion citizens of the Republic of China on Taiwan to\nbe represented in international organizations such as\nthe United Nations. Guatemala, like all of Central\nAmerica, believes those aspirations to be a positive\nforce for peace and democracy in the world.\nWe are making our best effort to strengthen the\nbonds of friendship and neighbourliness with Belize,\nwithout prejudice to the search for ways to peacefully,\nhonourably, equitably and permanently resolve our\nterritorial dispute. We express our complete willingness\nto continue to seek a negotiated solution to that dispute\nwithin the framework of the Organization of American\nStates.\nWe reiterate our devotion to, and support for,\nCentral American integration, as well as our solidarity\nwith, and commitment to, all of Latin America and the\nCaribbean.\nWe live in exceptional times that affect each and\nevery one of our countries, as well as the United\nNations as a whole. Such critical moments create\nopportunities for re-evaluation and change. I hope that\nGod will grant us the wisdom to take advantage of\nthose opportunities, thereby making it possible for us\nto overcome the obstacles that have served to distract\nhumankind from a future of solidarity and common\nwelfare.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffTwenty-four months ago, and\nyesterday in the memory of America, the centre of New\nYork City became a battlefield, and a graveyard, and\nthe symbol of an unfinished war. Since that day,\nterrorists have struck in Bali, in Mombassa, in\n9\n\nCasablanca, in Riyadh, in Jakarta, in Jerusalem,\nmeasuring the advance of their cause in the chaos and\ninnocent suffering they leave behind.\nLast month, terrorists brought their war to the\nUnited Nations itself. The United Nations headquarters\nin Baghdad stood for order and compassion. For that\nreason, the terrorists decided it must be destroyed.\nAmong the 22 people who were murdered was Sergio\nVieira de Mello. Over the decades, that good and brave\nman from Brazil gave help to the afflicted in\nBangladesh, Cyprus, Mozambique, Lebanon,\nCambodia, Central Africa, Kosovo and East Timor, and\nwas aiding the people of Iraq in their time of need.\nAmerica joins you, his colleagues, in honouring the\nmemory of Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello and the memory\nof all those who died with him in the service of the\nUnited Nations.\nBy the victims they choose and by the means they\nuse, the terrorists have clarified the struggle we are in.\nThose who target relief workers for death have set\nthemselves against all humanity. Those who incite\nmurder and celebrate suicide reveal their contempt for\nlife itself. They have no place in any religious faith,\nthey have no claim on the world's sympathy, and they\nshould have no friend in this Hall.\nEvents during the past two years have set before\nus the clearest of divides: between those who seek\norder and those who spread chaos, between those who\nwork for peaceful change and those who adopt the\nmethods of gangsters, between those who honour the\nrights of man and those who deliberately take the lives\nof men, women and children without mercy or shame.\nBetween those alternatives there is no neutral\nground. All Governments that support terror are\ncomplicit in a war against civilization. No Government\nshould ignore the threat of terror because to look the\nother way gives terrorists the chance to regroup, recruit\nand prepare. All nations that fight terror as if the lives\nof their own people depended on it will earn the\nfavourable judgement of history.\nThe former regimes of Afghanistan and Iraq knew\nthose alternatives and made their choices. The Taliban\nwas a sponsor and servant of terrorism. When\nconfronted, that regime chose defiance, and that regime\nis no more. Afghanistan's President, who is here today,\nnow represents a free people who are building a decent\nand just society. They are building a nation fully joined\nin the war against terror.\nThe regime of Saddam Hussain cultivated ties to\nterror while it built weapons of mass destruction. It\nused those weapons in acts of mass murder and refused\nto account for them when confronted by the world. The\nSecurity Council was right to be alarmed. The Security\nCouncil was right to demand that Iraq destroy its\nillegal weapons and prove that it had done so. The\nSecurity Council was right to vow serious\nconsequences if Iraq refused to comply. And because\nthere were consequences   because a coalition of\nnations acted to defend the peace and the credibility of\nthe United Nations   Iraq is free, and today we are\njoined by the representatives of a liberated country.\nSaddam Hussain's monuments have been\nremoved, and not only his statues. The true monuments\nof his rule and his character   the torture chambers,\nthe rape rooms and the prison cells for innocent\nchildren   are closed. And as we discover the killing\nfields and mass graves of Iraq, the true scale of\nSaddam's cruelty is being revealed.\nThe Iraqi people are meeting hardships and\nchallenges, like every nation that has set out on the\npath of democracy. Yet, their future promises lives of\ndignity and freedom, and that is a world away from the\nsqualid, vicious tyranny they have known. Across Iraq,\nlife is being improved by liberty. Across the Middle\nEast, people are safer because an unstable aggressor\nhas been removed from power. Across the world,\nnations are more secure because an ally of terror has\nfallen.\nOur actions in Afghanistan and Iraq were\nsupported by many Governments, and America is\ngrateful to each one. I also recognize that some of the\nsovereign nations of the Assembly disagreed with our\nactions. Yet, there was and there remains unity among\nus on the fundamental principles and objectives of the\nUnited Nations. We are dedicated to the defence of our\ncollective security and to the advance of human rights.\nThose permanent commitments call us to great work in\nthe world, work that we must do together. So, let us\nmove forward. First, we must stand with the people of\nAfghanistan and Iraq as they build free and stable\ncountries. The terrorists and their allies fear and fight\nthis progress above all because free people embrace\nhope over resentment and choose peace over violence.\nThe United Nations has been a friend of the\nAfghan people, distributing food and medicine, helping\nrefugees return home, advising on a new constitution\n10\n\nand helping to prepare the way for nationwide\nelections. NATO has taken over the United Nations\nmandated security force in Kabul. American and\ncoalition forces continue to track and defeat al Qaeda\nterrorists and the remnants of the Taliban. Our efforts\nto rebuild that country go on. I have recently proposed\nto spend an additional $1.2 billion for the Afghan\nreconstruction effort, and I urge other nations to\ncontinue contributing to that important cause.\nIn the nation of Iraq, the United Nations is\ncarrying out vital and effective work every day. By the\nend of 2004, more than 90 per cent of Iraqi children\nunder age five will have been immunized against\npreventable diseases such as polio, tuberculosis and\nmeasles, thanks to the hard work and high ideals of\nUNICEF. Iraq's food distribution system is operational,\ndelivering nearly a half million tons of food per month,\nthanks to the skill and expertise of the World Food\nProgramme.\nOur international coalition in Iraq is meeting its\nresponsibilities. We are conducting precision raids\nagainst terrorists and holdouts of the former regime.\nThose killers are at war with the Iraqi people. They\nhave made Iraq the central front in the war on terror.\nAnd they will be defeated. Our coalition has made sure\nthat Iraq's former dictator will never again use\nweapons of mass destruction. We are now interviewing\nIraqi citizens and analysing records of the old regime\nto reveal the full extent of its weapons programmes and\nits long campaign of deception. We are training Iraqi\npolice, border guards and a new army so that the Iraqi\npeople can assume full responsibility for their own\nsecurity.\nAt the same time, our coalition is helping to\nimprove the daily lives of the Iraqi people. The old\nregime built palaces while letting schools decay, so we\nare rebuilding more than a thousand schools. The old\nregime starved hospitals of resources, so we have\nhelped to supply and reopen hospitals across Iraq. The\nold regime built up armies and weapons while allowing\nthe nation's infrastructure to crumble, so we are\nrehabilitating power plants, water and sanitation\nfacilities, bridges and airports. I have proposed to\nCongress that the United States provide additional\nfunding for our work in Iraq, the greatest financial\ncommitment of its kind since the Marshall Plan.\nHaving helped to liberate Iraq, we will honour\nour pledges to Iraq, and by helping the Iraqi people\nbuild a stable and peaceful country we will make our\nown countries more secure.\nThe primary goal of our coalition in Iraq is self-\ngovernment for the people of Iraq, reached by an\norderly and democratic process. That process must\nunfold according to the needs of Iraqis, neither hurried\nnor delayed by the wishes of other parties. And the\nUnited Nations can contribute greatly to the cause of\nIraqi self-government.\nAmerica is working with friends and allies on a\nnew Security Council resolution, which will expand the\nUnited Nation's role in Iraq. As in the aftermath of\nother conflicts, the United Nations should assist in\ndeveloping a constitution, training civil servants and\nconducting free and fair elections. Iraq now has a\nGoverning Council, the first truly representative\ninstitution in that country. Iraq's new leaders are\nshowing the openness and tolerance that democracy\nrequires, and they are also showing courage. Yet every\nyoung democracy needs the help of friends. Now the\nnation of Iraq needs and deserves our aid, and all\nnations of good will should step forward and provide\nthat support.\nThe success of a free Iraq will be watched and\nnoted throughout the region. Millions will see that\nfreedom, equality and material progress are possible at\nthe heart of the Middle East. Leaders in the region will\nface the clearest evidence that free institutions and\nopen societies are the only path to long-term national\nsuccess and dignity. And a transformed Middle East\nwould benefit the entire world by undermining the\nideologies that export violence to other lands.\nIraq as a dictatorship had great power to\ndestabilize the Middle East. Iraq as a democracy will\nhave great power to inspire the Middle East. The\nadvance of democratic institutions in Iraq is setting an\nexample that others, including the Palestinian people,\nwould be wise to follow. The Palestinian cause is\nbetrayed by leaders who cling to power by feeding old\nhatreds and destroying the good work of others. The\nPalestinian people deserve their own State. They will\ngain that State by embracing new leaders committed to\nreform, to fighting terror and to building peace.\nAll parties in the Middle East must meet their\nresponsibilities and carry out the commitments they\nmade at Aqaba. Israel must work to create the\nconditions that will allow a peaceful Palestinian State\nto emerge. Arab nations must cut off funding and other\n11\n\nsupport for terrorist organizations. America will work\nwith every nation in the region that acts boldly for the\nsake of peace.\nA second challenge we must confront together is\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\nOutlaw regimes that possess nuclear, chemical and\nbiological weapons and the means to deliver them\nwould be able to use blackmail and create chaos in\nentire regions. Those weapons could be used by\nterrorists to bring sudden disaster and suffering on a\nscale we can scarcely imagine. The deadly combination\nof outlaw regimes, terror networks and weapons of\nmass murder is a peril that cannot be ignored or wished\naway. If such a danger is allowed to fully materialize,\nall words, all protests, will come too late.\nNations of the world must have the wisdom and\nthe will to stop grave threats before they arrive. One\ncrucial step is to secure the most dangerous materials at\ntheir source. For more than a decade, the United States\nhas worked with Russia and other States of the former\nSoviet Union to dismantle, destroy or secure weapons\nand dangerous materials left over from another era.\nLast year in Canada, the G-8 nations agreed to\nprovide up to 20 billion dollars, half of it from the\nUnited States, to fight this proliferation risk over the\nnext ten years. Since then, six additional countries have\njoined the effort. More are needed, and I urge other\nnations to help us meet this danger.\nWe are also improving our capability to interdict\nlethal materials in transit. Through our Proliferation\nSecurity Initiative, eleven nations are preparing to\nsearch planes, ships, trains and trucks carrying suspect\ncargo and to seize weapons or missile shipments that\nraise proliferation concerns. These nations have agreed\non a set of interdiction principles consistent with\ncurrent legal authorities, and we are working to expand\nthe Proliferation Security Initiative to other countries.\nWe are determined to keep the world's most destructive\nweapons away from all our shores and out of the hands\nof our common enemies.\nBecause proliferators will use any route or\nchannel that is open to them, we need the broadest\npossible cooperation to stop them. Today I ask the\nUnited Nations Security Council to adopt a new\nantiproliferation resolution. That resolution should call\non all Members of the United Nations to criminalize\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, to\nenact strict export controls consistent with international\nstandards and to secure any and all sensitive materials\nwithin their own borders. The United States stands\nready to help any nation draft these new laws and to\nassist in their enforcement.\nA third challenge we share is a challenge to our\nconscience. We must act decisively to meet the\nhumanitarian crises of our time. The United States has\nbegun to carry out the Emergency Plan for AIDS\nRelief, aimed at preventing AIDS on a massive scale\nand treating millions who have the disease already. We\nhave pledged 15 billion dollars over five years to fight\nAIDS around the world.\nMy country is acting to save lives from famine as\nwell. We are providing more than 1.4 billion dollars in\nglobal emergency food aid, and I have asked our\nUnited States Congress for 200 million dollars for a\nnew famine fund so that we can act quickly when the\nfirst signs of famine appear. Every nation on every\ncontinent should generously add their resources to the\nfight against disease and desperate hunger.\nThere is another humanitarian crisis, spreading,\nyet hidden from view. Each year, an estimated eight to\nnine hundred thousand human beings are bought, sold\nor forced across the world's borders. Among them are\nhundreds of thousands of teenage girls and others as\nyoung as five who fall victim to the sex trade. This\ncommerce in human life generates billions of dollars\neach year, much of which is used to finance organized\ncrime. There is a special evil in the abuse and\nexploitation of the most innocent and vulnerable. The\nvictims of the sex trade see little of life before they see\nthe very worst of life   an underground of brutality\nand lonely fear. Those who create these victims and\nprofit from their suffering must be severely punished.\nThose who patronize this industry debase themselves\nand deepen the misery of others, and Governments that\ntolerate this trade are tolerating a form of slavery.\nThis problem has appeared in my own country\nand we are working to stop it. The Protect Act, which I\nsigned into law this year, makes it a crime for any\nperson to enter the United States or for any citizen to\ntravel abroad for the purpose of sex tourism involving\nchildren. The Department of Justice is actively\ninvestigating sex tour operators and patrons, who can\nface up to 30 years in prison. Under the Trafficking\nVictims Protection Act, the United States is using\nsanctions against Governments to discourage human\ntrafficking.\n12\n\nThe victims of this industry also need help from\nMembers of the United Nations. This begins with clear\nstandards and the certainty of punishment under the\nlaws of every country. Today, some nations make it a\ncrime to sexually abuse children abroad. Such conduct\nshould be a crime in all nations. Governments should\ninform travellers of the harm this industry does and the\nsevere punishments that will fall on its patrons. The\nAmerican Government is committing $50 million to\nsupport the good work of organizations that are\nrescuing women and children from exploitation and\ngiving them shelter, medical treatment and the hope of\na new life. I urge other Governments to do their part.\nWe must show new energy in fighting back an old\nevil. Nearly two centuries after the abolition of the\ntransatlantic slave trade and more than a century after\nslavery was officially ended in its last strongholds, the\ntrade in human beings for any purpose must not be\nallowed to thrive in our time.\nAll the challenges I have spoken of this morning\nrequire urgent attention and moral clarity. Helping\nAfghanistan and Iraq to succeed as free nations in a\ntransformed region; cutting off the avenues of\nproliferation; abolishing modern forms of slavery  \nthese are the kinds of great tasks for which the United\nNations was founded. In each case, careful discussion\nis needed and, also, decisive action. Our good\nintentions will be credited only if we achieve good\noutcomes. As an original signer of the United Nations\nCharter, the United States of America is committed to\nthe United Nations and we show that commitment by\nworking to fulfil the United Nations stated purposes\nand by giving meaning to its ideals.\nThe founding documents of the United Nations\nand the founding documents of America stand in the\nsame tradition. Both assert that human beings should\nnever be reduced to objects of power or commerce,\nbecause their dignity is inherent. Both recognize a\nmoral law that stands above men and nations, but\nwhich must be defended and enforced by men and\nnations. And both point the way to peace   the peace\nthat comes when all are free. We secure that peace with\nour courage and we must show that courage together.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMay I congratulate you, Sir,\nfor assuming the mantle of the presidency for this\nsession of the Assembly and thank the outgoing\nPresident, Mr. Jan Kavan. I would also like to echo\nwhat other speakers have said about the death of the\ndedicated United Nations workers who lost their lives\nin the bombing of the United Nations headquarters in\nBaghdad last month, including Sergio Vieira de Mello,\nan outstanding international civil servant.\nWhen we met here last year, we were all\nconcerned about what would happen in Iraq. At the\nsame time, we were concerned about what role the\nUnited Nations would play in the resolution of the Iraq\naffair. Dramatic events since then have provided\nanswers to those questions. However, those dramatic\nevents have raised important and disturbing questions\nabout the very future of the United Nations. Central\namong them is the question, does the United Nations\nhave a future as a strong and effective multilateral\norganization enjoying the confidence of the peoples of\nthe world and capable of addressing the matters that\nare of concern to all humanity?\nQuite correctly, as we meet here this time, while\nstill preoccupied by the issue of the future of Iraq, I am\ncertain that none of us wants to rehash the debate that\ntook place on this matter in the period following the\nlast general debate in the General Assembly. While for\nsome time after that general debate we were concerned\nto provide answers to questions about the role of the\nUnited Nations in Iraq, today we have to answer\nquestions about the impact of the Iraq affair on the\nfuture of the United Nations. Matters have evolved in\nsuch a manner that to our limited understanding it\nseems extremely difficult to resolve the issue of the\nrole of the United Nations in Iraq, unless we answer\nthe question about the future of the United Nations as a\nlegitimate expression of the collective will of the\npeoples of the world and the principal guarantor of\ninternational peace and security, among other global\nissues.\nPut differently, we could say that what is decided\nabout the role of the United Nations in Iraq will at the\nsame time decide what will become of the United\nNations in the context of its Charter and of the\nimportant global objectives that have been set since the\nCharter was adopted.\nThis is not a case of the tail wagging the dog;\nrather, history has placed at our feet an urgent and\npractical test case that obliges us to answer the\nquestion: what do we, collectively, want the United\nNations to be? What do we do to distinguish the trees\nfrom the forest? In that regard we must make the point\ndirectly, that as South Africans, we are partners and\nactivists who campaign in favour of a strong and\neffective United Nations. We do so because of the\nplace our country and people occupy in the\ncontemporary world.\nWe believe that everything that has happened\nplaces an obligation on the United Nations to reflect on\na number of fundamental issues that are of critical\nimportance to the evolution of human society. We are\nconvinced that this General Assembly would\ndisappoint the expectations of the peoples of the world\nand put itself in jeopardy if, for any reason whatsoever,\nit did not address these issues.\nWe speak as we do because we represent the\npeople who are more sensitive to the imperatives of\nwhat the world decides, given our experience during a\nperiod when apartheid South Africa was correctly a\nmatter of focused and sustained interest by the United\nNations and the peoples of the world, including\nordinary folk, even in the most marginalized areas of\nour globe.\nThis Organization, and all of us singly and\ncollectively, has spoken and frequently speaks about\nthe phenomenon of globalization. Correctly, we speak\nof a global village driven by recognition of the fact of\nthe integration of all peoples within a common and\ninterdependent global society.\n24\n\nCertainly, humanity is more integrated today than\nit was when the United Nations was established more\nthan fifty years ago. However, many have drawn\nattention to the fact that, whereas objective social\nprocesses have led to the emergence of the global\nvillage, all of our political collectives have not yet\nsucceeded in designing the institutions of governance\nmade necessary by the reality of the birth of this global\nvillage.\nCorrect observations have also been made that the\nuse of the image and concept of the village does not\nimply that the residents of this village are equal. The\nreality is that the same processes that bring all of us\ncloser together in a global village are simultaneously\nplacing the residents of the global village in different\npositions. Some have emerged as dominant, and the\nrest as the dominated, with the dominant being the\ndecision makers and the dominated being the recipients\nand implementers of those decisions.\nTo the same extent that our political collectives\nhave not designed the institutions responsive to the\nevolution of the global village, so have they failed to\nrespond to the imbalance in the distribution of power\ninherent in contemporary global human society. We\nspeak here of power in all fields of human activity. Left\nto its internal and autonomous impulses, the process of\nglobalization will inevitably result in the further\nenhancement of the domination of the dominant and\nthe entrenchment of the subservience of the dominated,\nhowever much the latter might resent such domination.\nThis will include the perpetuation of the\ndominant positions by those who are dominant to\nensure the sustenance of their capacity to set the\nagenda of the global village in the interest of their own\nneighbourhoods within that village. Inherent within\nthis is, necessarily, reliance on the use of superior\npower, of which the dominant dispose, to achieve the\nobjective of the perpetuation of the situation of an\nunequal distribution of power.\nIn this situation, it is inevitable that the pursuit of\npower in itself will assert itself as a unique legitimate\nobjective, apparently detached from any need to define\nthe uses of such power. This also signifies the\ndeification of force in all its forms as the final arbiter\nin the ordering of human affairs.\nHowever, from the point of view of the\ndisempowered, the struggle to ensure the use of such\npower to address their own interests becomes a\nstrategic objective they cannot avoid. Necessarily this\nmeans that power would have to be redistributed. That\nwould be done to empower the disempowered and to\nregulate the use of power by those who are powerful.\nThus we come back to what I said earlier.\nBecause we are poor, we are partisan activists for a\nstrong, effective and popularly accepted United\nNations. We take those positions because there is no\nway in which we could advance the interests of the\npeople, the majority of whom are poor, outside the\ncontext of a strong, effective and popularly accepted\nUnited Nations. An autonomous process of\nglobalization, driven by its own internal regularities,\ncan only result in the determination of our future\nwithin the parameters set by those who enjoy the\nsuperiority of power. The powerful will do this in their\nown interests, which might not coincide with ours.\nWhen this Organization was established 58 years\nago, its objectives and institutions necessarily reflected\nboth the collective global concerns as then perceived\nand the then balance of power.\nAmong other things, our esteemed Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, has drawn attention to the\nfact that the United Nations started off as an\nOrganization of 51 States and is now composed of 191\nStates. Undoubtedly, the perceived and real collective\nglobal concerns of our day are, to some extent at least,\ndifferent from those that prevailed more than 50 years\nago, when the Organization was about a quarter of its\npresent size.\nFor more than a decade, this Organization has\nbeen involved in discussions about its transformation.\nOnce more, the Secretary-General has reflected on this\nchallenge. The truth is that our discussions have gone\nnowhere. Earlier this morning the Secretary-General\nannounced steps he will take to facilitate the adoption\nof decisions that will help all of us to effect the\nnecessary and inevitable transformation of the United\nNations. We support the decisions he announced.\nThe global resolve to defeat such organizations as\nal Qaeda has emerged out of our understanding that\ninternational aggression should not necessarily be\nexpected to come from formal and recognized State\ninstitutions. We have all come to understand that such a\nthreat coming from non-State institutions would\nexpress itself as the most inhumane and despicable\nterrorism, as was most painfully demonstrated on 11\nSeptember 2001.\n25\n\nOur collective experience   stretching from New\nYork and elsewhere in the United States on 11\nSeptember 2001; and reaching back to Nairobi and\nDar es Salaam, in Africa, earlier still; and, more\nrecently, to Bali, Indonesia; to Morocco; to the conflict\nbetween Israel and Palestine; to Algeria, India, Russia\nand elsewhere; and even our own country   tells us\nthat the United Nations, working in defence of the\ncollective interests of the peoples of the world, must\nensure that we act together to defeat the threat of\nterrorism, collectively defined.\nAt the same time, we have to take on board the\nconviction among some of our Member States that they\nconstitute special and particular targets of global\nterrorism. Understandably, the argument is advanced\nthat it would be unreasonable and irrational to expect\nsuch States not to act to deter such terrorist actions\nagainst themselves. None of us can defend\ninternational rules that prescribe that any one of us\nshould wait to be attacked knowing in specific ways\nthat we were going to be attacked by identified\nterrorists, and then act against those who had attacked\nus, with such horrendous costs as were experienced by\nthe United States during the 11 September attacks. I do\nnot imagine that any one of us would seek to impose\nsuch a costly and unsustainable burden on any of our\nMember States, which would also violate the self-\ndefence provisions of Article 51 of the Charter of the\nUnited Nations.\nWe also have no choice but to deal with the brute\nreality that the reform process of the United Nations\nand all its bodies, and other multilateral organizations,\nhas got to recognize the reality of the imbalance of\npower, as represented by different countries and\nregions. At the same time, we must proceed from the\nposition that such distribution of power is not\nnecessarily in the interests of the peoples of the world,\nor even in the interests of those who today have the\npower to determine what happens to our common\nworld. That includes acceptance of the fact that,\ndepending on the place we occupy in the global\ncommunity, we have different priorities. Among other\nthings, the rich are concerned about ways and means to\nmaintain the status quo, from which they benefit. In\npractical terms that means that all matters that threaten\nto destabilize the status quo must necessarily be\nanathema to such people. Such matters will therefore\nbe an issue of principal concern to them. Necessarily\nand understandably, they will then seek to get the rest\nof the world to accept their assertion that the\nmaintenance of the status quo must be a universal\nhuman preoccupation, precisely the kind of issue on\nwhich the United Nations must take a united position.\nOn the other hand, the poor are interested in\nchanging their conditions for the better. Accordingly,\nthey will not accept the maintenance of the status quo,\nwhich perpetuates their poverty. Accordingly, among\nother things, the poor billions of the world will argue\nfor action by the United Nations to ensure the transfer\nof resources to themselves, which will enable them to\nextricate themselves from their condition of poverty\nand underdevelopment, consistent with the\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals,\nthe objectives of the Johannesburg World Summit on\nSustainable Development and other international\nagreements. Inevitably, that will run counter to the\npropositions of those who are more powerful than the\npoor, namely, the Governments, peoples and countries\nthat keep them afloat with development assistance.\nThat will require   whether it is stated or not   that\nthe recipients of that assistance understand that such\nassistance can dry up.\nImportant shifts in the global balance of power\nand global objectives have taken place since the United\nNations was established, 58 years ago. The\nOrganization has not substantially changed, in terms of\nits structures and mode of functioning, to reflect those\nchanges. That has served as a recipe for an inevitable\ncrisis, a disaster waiting to occur. And so as we meet\ntoday we are confronted by global challenges that the\nglobal Organization cannot solve. Impelled by the\nurgent issues of the day, some of the powerful will not\nwait for all of us to respond to the problems we have\nraised, and which they face. They will act to solve\nthose problems; their actions will make the statement\nthat they do not need the United Nations to find\nsolutions to those problems. Simultaneously, that will\nmake the practical statement that the United Nations is\nirrelevant to the solution of the most pending problems\nof our day. The disempowered will continue to look to\nthe Organization, understanding, correctly, that they are\ntoo weak to advance their interests singly outside the\ncollective voice of the United Nations. In that regard,\nthey expect that the United Nations will be informed by\nits founding documents and other solemn decisions it\nhas taken since it was established, all of which have\nbeen approved by successive sessions of the General\nAssembly.\n26\n\nGlobal poverty and underdevelopment are the\nprincipal problems that face the United Nations.\nBillions across the world expect that the General\nAssembly will address that challenge in a meaningful\nmanner. The masses of people of our world expect that\nthe statements we will make at this session of the\nGeneral Assembly as representatives of various\nGovernments will indicate a serious commitment to\nimplement what we say. The poor of the world expect\nan end to violence and war everywhere. They want an\nend to the killing that is taking too many Israeli and\nPalestinian lives. They want Africans to stop killing\none another, continuing to convey the message that we\nare incapable of living in peace among ourselves. They\ndesire the realization of the democratic objective\nuniversally: that the people shall govern. They believe\nthat we are seriously committed to the objective of the\neradication of poverty and the provision of a better life\nfor all. They think that we mean it when we say that we\nwill not allow the process of globalization to result in\nthe further enrichment of the rich and the\nimpoverishment of the poor within and between\ncountries. They believe us when we say that our\ncollective future is one of hope, and not despair. They\nare keenly interested to know whether our gathering,\nthe United Nations General Assembly, will produce\nthose results.\nTo collectively meet those requirements will\nrequire that each and every one of us   both rich and\npoor, the powerful and the disempowered   commit\nourselves practically to act in all circumstances in a\nmanner that recognizes and respects the fact that none\nof us is an island sufficient unto ourselves. That\nincludes the most powerful. The latter face the\ninteresting challenge, important to themselves in their\nnational interests, that the poverty and\ndisempowerment of the billions will no longer serve as\na condition for their success and their possibility to\nprosper in conditions of peace.\nWhat we have said today may not be heard,\nbecause we do not have the strength to have our voice\nheard. Tomorrow we may be obliged to say, No more\nwater; the fire next time. As the fires burn, the United\nNations will die, consumed by the flames. So will the\nhopes of the poor of the world die, as they did at\nCancun, Mexico, not so long ago. We must act together\nto say in our words and in our actions, as countries and\nas the United Nations, that there will be water next\ntime, and not fire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt\ngives me great pleasure to extend to you, Sir, our\nsincere congratulations on your election to the\npresidency of the fifty-eighth session of the General\nAssembly. Allow me to wish you and the members of\nthe Bureau every possible success. I should also like to\nexpress our thanks and appreciation to your predecessor,\nMr. Jan Kavan, President of the fifty-seventh session, for\nhis great efforts in conducting the work of the General\nAssembly. It also gives me pleasure to recognize\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, who deserves our sincere\nthanks, respect and admiration for his tireless efforts.\nToday, the world is experiencing a difficult,\ncritical and highly complex phase in international\nrelations, marked by political and strategic changes\naffecting the elements and objectives of those relations.\nThis is the result of the emergence of a new,\ncomplicated and multifaceted set of problems and acute\nregional and international crises, whose root causes we\nmust deal with promptly and in a serious manner.\nMoreover, we must prevent such crises from worsening\nand spreading. We must therefore strive to strengthen\nthe role of the United Nations, enhance its institutions\nand provide it with the essential resources so it can\nfulfil its mission throughout the world.\nFirst, it is imperative that we mobilize the\npolitical will needed to enable the Organization to\nshoulder its responsibilities and carry out its duties.\nThat is particularly important for the permanent\nmembers of the Security Council because those\ncountries bear the primary responsibility for achieving\nthat goal, which will enable the Organization to\nperform its functions in a genuinely democratic spirit,\nreflecting the new international conditions and the\ninterests and aspirations of all peoples of the world\nwithout exclusion or preference.\nIn that context, we underline the need to reach\nagreement on a new formula for the composition of the\nSecurity Council and to modernize its working\nmethods, as it is the international body charged with\nthe primary responsibility for maintaining international\npeace and security. The Council\u2019s current composition,\nworking methods and decision-making process do not\nrespond to the needs of the international community or\ngive Member States an opportunity to speak on the\nvital and critical issues that affect us all.\nIn the State of Qatar, we were shocked and\nsaddened by the horrific attack on the United Nations\nheadquarters in Baghdad. That attack claimed the lives\nof many innocent victims: the United Nations staff\nmembers who were carrying out their humanitarian\nmission, foremost among them the Special\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Sergio\nVieira de Mello, and many Iraqis. That heinous act of\nterrorism illustrates in our view the nature of the\nchallenges and the seriousness of the threats besetting\nthe work of the United Nations and international\nhumanitarian organizations in Iraq and elsewhere. We\nalso strongly condemn the terrorist act targeting the\nUnited Nations headquarters in Iraq earlier this week.\nThe difficult and tragic circumstances now\nprevailing in the brotherly country of Iraq compel us to\ncooperate in order to help the Iraqi people overcome\nthat situation and its consequences.\nI must underline once again the fundamental\nprinciples underlying our position with respect to the Iraqi\ncrisis and the means necessary to deal with it. We have\nconsistently affirmed our commitment to the territorial\nintegrity, national unity and sovereignty of Iraq and to\nthe right of Iraqis to self-determination, to the restoration\nof their independence and sovereignty and to the\nreconstruction of their homeland, as well as to their right\nto live in dignity and freedom in their own land.\nIn that context, we look forward to the success of\nthe international efforts to strengthen security and\nstability in Iraq. We call upon the coalition forces to\n10\n\nachieve that essential objective and to intensify\ncoordination with the competent international bodies\nand institutions in order to pave the way for the\ncountry\u2019s return to normalcy. We call upon the\ncoalition forces to allow the Iraqi people, of all factions\nand political trends, to exercise their legitimate right to\nchoose their own political leadership through free,\ndemocratic elections, giving expression to their\naspirations, hopes and wishes.\nIn that regard, we also welcome the establishment\nof the Interim Governing Council and the interim Iraqi\nGovernment that emerged from it; they mark an\nimportant positive step, and we hope that they will\ncontribute to achieving the desired transition towards\nconsolidated democracy in the country and the\nreconstruction and rehabilitation of Iraqi State\ninstitutions. That should be accomplished by drafting a\nnew constitution, holding free democratic elections,\nputting an early end to the occupation through a\nspecific timetable and allowing Iraq to reclaim its\nrightful position in the region and in the larger\ninternational community.\nWe urge the United Nations to play an effective,\nessential role in helping Iraq achieve those objectives.\nMoreover, the international community is urgently called\nupon to help in Iraq\u2019s reconstruction and to meet the Iraqi\npeople\u2019s needs in various areas in order to build a new\nIraq of democracy, equality and respect for human rights.\nWith regard to developing Iraq\u2019s infrastructure of\nhigher education, it is noteworthy that the consort of\nHis Royal Highness the Emir of the State of Qatar, Her\nRoyal Highness Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser Al-Misnad,\nSpecial Envoy for Basic and Higher Education + 5 of the\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization (UNESCO), launched a lofty initiative in\na statement before the World Conference on Higher\nEducation, held in Paris at UNESCO headquarters. The\ninitiative called for the establishment of an\ninternational fund for Iraqi higher education, with the\nobjective of providing both immediate and long-term\nassistance for the rehabilitation of higher education in\nbrotherly Iraq. The State of Qatar has made the first\ncontribution to the fund, in the amount of $15 million.\nMy country has also been participating in\ninternational efforts to rebuild Iraq. It has developed a\nspecial programme that includes the building of\nhospitals and educational and residential units. In\naddition, we have a special programme in Afghanistan\nthat assists in the rebuilding of that country; the\nprogramme\u2019s cost has amounted to $62 million thus far.\nThe Arab-Israeli conflict and the question of\nPalestine are at the top of the list of the conflicts that\nneed concerted action in order to achieve a just, final\nand comprehensive solution, particularly in the light of\nthe continuation and acceleration of the bloody\nconfrontation that has raged between the Palestinian\npeople and Israeli occupation forces for so many years.\nIt must be noted that we in the State of Qatar have\nwelcomed the road map. We expressed our support for\nthe Quartet\u2019s efforts to have both sides begin\nimplementing the various stages of the road map, in\nkeeping with the vision articulated by Mr. George\nBush, President of the United States, as a basis for the\nfinal solution of establishing two States living side by\nside. We did so despite the many difficulties, obstacles\nand setbacks encountered by those efforts in the past\nfew weeks. We must also firmly stress that\nimplementation of the road map cannot be undertaken\nby only one side \u2014 the Palestinian people. It requires\nthat the Israeli side also fulfil its obligations and take\nthe necessary actions in that regard.\nAll of the aforementioned requires that the\ninternational community and the members of the\nQuartet \u2014 particularly the United States of America \u2014\nintervene, intensify their efforts and increase their\npressure on the Israeli Government so that it will do its\npart, in return for the Palestinians\u2019 commitment to do\ntheirs. Thus, Israeli occupation forces must refrain\nfrom carrying out assassinations, must lift the siege that\nthey have imposed on Palestinian territories, enable the\nPalestinians to live in security, peace and dignity on their\nown land and to move freely in their own areas, put an\nend to the policies of starvation, humiliation and house\ndemolition, and cease construction of the buffer wall\ncurrently being built by the Israeli authorities.\nIn that connection, I cannot fail to note the positive\ngesture that we witnessed a few days ago by the Libyan\nGovernment\u2019s closing of the Lockerbie file, an outcome\nthat was achieved in cooperation with the other parties\nconcerned and in the context of United Nations\ninstitutions. We should also note the positive response\nof the Governments of the United States, the United\nKingdom and France to that gesture, which bore fruit\nand ultimately led to the conclusion of an agreement.\nThe phenomena of terrorism and extremism\ncontinue to be among the most important challenges\n\n\nfacing the world. As we express our total rejection and\ncondemnation of those subversive phenomena \u2014 in all\ntheir forms and manifestations, and regardless of their\nsources or motivations \u2014 we reaffirm that we stand by\nthe side of the international community and that we\nsupport whatever efforts and measures are required to\neliminate terrorism and to strengthen the foundations\nof security and stability.\nDemocracy is an expression of responsible\nparticipation in political decision-making. It involves\nthe establishment of State institutions and adherence to\nthe rule of law within the State; it provides for\naccountability and for assessment of the performance of\ngovernmental institutions; it ensures good governance\nand safeguards the rights of citizens. As such, it is the\nbest way to achieve the priorities of national\ndevelopment and the objectives of modernization and\nreform, to which our peoples and societies aspire. On\nthe basis of those principles, the State of Qatar recently\nconducted a referendum on a political Constitution that\ngives women the right to political participation, both as\nvoters and as candidates for Parliament, which will be\nelected through the ballot box for the first time. The\nConstitution also governs the relationship between the\nGovernment and the people and provides for the\nseparation of the three branches of government.\nWith regard to human rights, an independent human\nrights commission has been established in the State of\nQatar. The commission submits its recommendations to\ncompetent State authorities with a view to developing\nand improving civil liberties. As promoting awareness\nof civil rights requires that we improve education and\nupgrade its standards \u2014 as well as expanding it to\ninclude all segments of society \u2014 we have restructured\nour educational system. Moreover, a number of well-\nknown universities based in developed countries have\nset up branches in the State of Qatar.\nIn conclusion, the fulfilment of our aspirations\nlies in affirming the role of the United Nations, in\nenhancing its position and in maximizing its potential.\nIt is through the Organization that we hope to establish\ninternational relations on the basis of understanding,\ncooperation and common interests. And it is through\nthe United Nations that we hope one day to succeed in\nsettling crises and disputes; eliminating threats of\nviolence, the use of force and terrorism; and ending the\nwasting of resources and energies on wars and\nconflicts, directing them instead to the service of\ndevelopment, progress and prosperity. Similarly, we\naspire to a new world built on the principles of justice,\nequality, liberty, democracy and peaceful coexistence\namong all the world\u2019s peoples, nations and cultures.\nThat is an aspiration that our peoples, our youth and\nour future generations fully deserve. It is an aspiration\nto which we are wedded and which we cherish, because\nthat vision occupies the highest priority in building the\nworld of the future: the world that we all seek and\ndesire. It is a world that we hope one day to attain as an\ninternational community \u2014 as one family living\ntogether on this planet, God willing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI am honoured to\naddress the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\nsession, on behalf of His Excellency President Kessai\nH. Note and the people of the Republic of the Marshall\nIslands.\nAllow me to extend my sincere congratulations to\nyou, Mr. President, on your election to your high\noffice. At the outset, I would like to take this\nopportunity to express our deepest condolences to the\nbereaved families that lost loved ones in the recent\nbombing attack on the United Nations offices in\nBaghdad. That tragic event was also a great loss to the\ninternational community. Such horrific acts of\nterrorism are utterly condemnable, and those\nresponsible should be swiftly brought to justice.\nMy delegation is especially pleased that this\nsession of the General Assembly will be presided over\nby the representative of a fellow member of the\nAlliance of Small Island States, and we wish you well,\nSir, in your endeavours throughout the session. We are\nhopeful that your presidency will help to highlight the\nspecial needs of small island developing States. It has\nlong been recognized that such States suffer particular\ndisadvantages in terms of both environment and\ndevelopment. This was recently reaffirmed by the\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development, which\ncalled for a full and comprehensive review of the\nBarbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States.\nThe coming year will be a particularly important\none for the Marshall Islands and for all small island\ndeveloping States as we prepare for the 2004\nInternational Meeting in Mauritius to review the\nimplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action.\nIn preparation for that Meeting, the Marshall Islands is\ncurrently completing an assessment of the\nimplementation of the Programme of Action at the\nnational level. I would like to take this opportunity to\nencourage the international donor and development\ncommunity to engage with the small island developing\nStates in the preparatory process and to actively\nparticipate in the International Meeting so that it can\nproduce successful and practical outcomes for all such\nStates.\nThe Marshall Islands is faced with challenges\nshared by many small island States. Our land\ncomprises small, scattered islands and atolls, spread\nover vast areas of ocean. Our unique environment is\nfragile and highly vulnerable to the threats posed by\nglobal warming and environmental pollution and\ndegradation. Our natural resource base is extremely\nnarrow, our economy very small and we are\ndisadvantaged by our remoteness from world markets.\nGiven these factors, in our interactions within the\ninternational community, the Marshall Islands is\nparticularly concerned about the following issues. The\nfirst issue is sustainable development. Pursuing the\nthree pillars of sustainable development \u2014 economic,\nsocial and environmental \u2014 poses many challenges for\nsmall island States. During last year\u2019s general debate,\nwe introduced our national blueprint for sustainable\ndevelopment. This document forms the basis of our\nlong-term sustainable development plans, which we are\ncurrently working hard to implement.\nIn this context, and in the follow-up to the World\nSummit on Sustainable Development, we continue to\nseek opportunities to form partnerships that will assist\nus in the practical implementation of projects under the\nPacific\u2019s 14 Type II Umbrella Initiatives. Areas of\nparticular importance for our people include the need\nfor greater access to fresh water, the availability of\naffordable, renewable and environmentally sound\nenergy sources and the development of waste\nmanagement systems that minimize hazardous impacts\non society and the environment.\nAlso in this regard, we welcome the new work\nprogramme of the Commission on Sustainable\nDevelopment. We are particularly pleased that small\nisland developing countries will be considered as a\ncross-cutting issue in relation to the themes of each\ntwo-year work cycle, and that the theme of the 2014-\n2015 work cycle will focus on small island developing\nStates issues.\nOur second main area of concern is the\nenvironment, and in particular the threats posed by\nglobal climate change and sea level rise. These threats\n23\n\nare felt most acutely by low-lying island and atoll\ncountries such as the Marshall Islands and many of our\nPacific neighbours.\nI am pleased to announce that the Marshall\nIslands has recently completed its ratification process\nfor the Kyoto Protocol. I take this opportunity to\ncommend those States that have ratified the Protocol,\nand I urge remaining States to do so without delay.\nThis matter is surely the most urgent facing the\ninternational community today. If we fail to act now,\nthe future will see the complete disappearance of many\nsmall island nations.\nIn relation to environmental matters, the Marshall\nIslands is particularly concerned about the state of the\nworld\u2019s oceans and fisheries. As a nation whose very\nlivelihood depends on the resources of the sea, the\nMarshall Islands Government reaffirms its unwavering\nsupport for the regime established under the United\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea. I am also\npleased to state that the Marshall Islands is now a party\nto the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement.\nThe Marshall Islands is seriously concerned about\ninstances of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing\nwithin its exclusive economic zone. Such fishing\ngravely undermines the livelihood of our people that\ndepend on these resources as their primary means of\nsurvival. Regional and international cooperation must\nfocus on addressing this issue.\nWithin our region, we are pleased to note the\nrecent progress of the Convention on the Conservation\nand Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in\nthe Western and Central Pacific Ocean. We are also\nparticularly pleased with the development of the\nPacific Islands Regional Ocean Policy and we look\nforward to broad participation in the upcoming Pacific\nIslands Regional Ocean Forum.\nAn ongoing issue of major concern for the\nMarshall Islands is that of nuclear weapons testing.\nThe people and the environment of the Marshall\nIslands continue to suffer as a consequence of the\nnuclear weapons tests that were conducted in our\nterritory between 1946 and 1958.\nAs we continue to seek resolution of this issue\nour people continue to suffer from ongoing health\neffects, the food chain still contains dangerously high\nradiation levels and our development capacity is\nrestrained by an inability to use contaminated islands\nand atolls.\nI have briefly addressed a few issues of major\nconcern to the Marshall Islands. There are, of course,\nmany other significant issues to be addressed during\nthe upcoming session.\nOne of the most important challenges facing the\ninternational community is the need for a\ncomprehensive, unified response to combat acts of\ninternational terrorism. I am pleased to be able to say\nthat the Marshall Islands has ratified all 12 of the core\nConventions against terrorism. We are continually\nworking to implement the provisions of Security\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001), and we have taken\nmany steps at the national level to combat money\nlaundering and terrorist financing. We reiterate our\nsolidarity with all Member States that are working to\neliminate terrorism in all its forms.\nAnother important issue facing this body is the\ncontinued exclusion of the Republic of China on\nTaiwan from the United Nations. The Marshall Islands\nGovernment reiterates its concern that the exclusion of\na nation of peaceful and law-abiding citizens is not\nconsistent with the inclusive ideal of the United\nNations. I therefore strongly urge every Member State\nto reconsider this matter.\nThe Marshall Islands welcomes the progress\nachieved by the International Criminal Court over the\npast year. Many positive developments have taken\nplace, not the least of these being the election of a\nprominent panel of judges and the chief prosecutor. We\nlook forward to the Court becoming fully operational\nand we are confident that the Court will prove to be a\nvaluable mechanism in the administration of justice at\nthe international level.\nFinally, in terms of the need for further United\nNations reform, the Marshall Islands Government\nwishes to reiterate its support for the expansion of the\nSecurity Council. We believe that the number of both\npermanent and non-permanent members should be\nincreased, and that such expansion should include\nmembers from both developed and developing\ncountries. This expansion is urgently needed to\nincrease the representative base of the Council and to\nenhance its legitimacy in the light of the geographic\nand political realities of the world today. We also wish\nto emphasize the need for further streamlining of the\nwork of the General Assembly and its six Main\n24\n\nCommittees in order to enhance the efficiency and\neffectiveness of the Organization."

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a\ngreat pleasure for me to address this important\ngathering. I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on\nyour assumption of the presidency of the General\nAssembly and to wish you well.\nAs is well-known, Canada has always believed in\na multilateral approach to global issues \u2014 not for\nideological reasons, but because it is a proven way to\nenhance security and to resolve those over-arching\nproblems that transcend national frameworks.\nThe present era provides us with enormous\nopportunities for action. We can improve health and\nextend life expectancy, especially in poor countries; we\ncan safeguard security and the rights of citizens; and\nwe can increase access to education and help people to\nfulfil their aspirations.\nThe present era also presents us with urgent\nchallenges: protecting the environment; rolling back\ndiseases such as AIDS and malaria; preventing conflict\nand ending impunity for crimes against humanity;\nputting a stop to terrorism and organized crime; and\ncontrolling weapons of mass destruction.\nEach Government is responsible for taking action\nwithin its own borders. In this global era, however,\nsuch issues cannot be successfully addressed by States\nacting alone. Multilateral cooperation is indispensable\nto ensure the well-being of citizens and to protect them\neffectively from harm. We need only consider the fight\nagainst terrorism. None of us has ever believed that\nterrorism could be controlled, let alone stopped,\nwithout the cooperation of all of us. The task of drying\nup the sources of terrorist funding also requires\ncoordination and effective legal regimes. Information-\nsharing is imperative if attacks are to be prevented.\nThe United Nations has been playing an\nextremely useful role in this fight. Since the tragic\nevents of 11 September 2001, the Security Council has\nbeen undertaking an extensive effort in support of the\nfight against international terrorism.\nWe could also consider the issue of health.\nDistance from the source of new viruses no longer\nprovides us with protection. The next virus may be just\nan aeroplane flight away. Multilateral cooperation is\nessential for the management of health threats. We risk\ndisaster if we do not share with each other all\ninformation that is are available to us and if we do not\ncoordinate efforts to combat epidemics. Coordinated\naction is also required for development in poor\ncountries and to ensure reasonable access to health\ncare.\nWe need only consider, furthermore, the ongoing\nproblem of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.\nThe proliferation of these weapons of mass destruction\namong States and terrorist groups represents a growing\nthreat. Such proliferation must be prevented through\ncoordination, the strict application of export controls,\nrigorous verification, the enforcement of multilateral\ntreaties and other forms of collective action under\ninternational law.\nWe all recognize that the United Nations has\nenabled us to successfully address many international\nchallenges. But we also recognize that we have failed\nin certain other cases. We have been slow to adapt the\nUnited Nations to changing circumstances. The time\nhas come to begin bold renewal at the United Nations.\nThis morning, the Secretary-General set out\nproposals that are timely, necessary and courageous. I\ncongratulate him on his remarkable statement, and I\ncan reaffirm that Canada subscribes fully to the\nobjectives that he proposes.\n22\n\nThe United Nations remains the principal\ninstrument for effective multilateral action. I call on\nmy fellow leaders to make meaningful United Nations\nreform a priority.\n(spoke in English)\nWe should not be pessimistic about our ability to\nsucceed. Consider some United Nations successes: the\n2000 Millennium Summit and, in Monterrey, Mexico,\nthe 2002 International Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment. We created a shared framework on\nsetting priorities for more effective aid; we set targets\nand key principles; we spelled out mutual\naccountabilities for developed and developing\ncountries. That spirit of accountability and shared\nresponsibility also lies at the heart of the New\nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development and of the Group\nof Eight Africa Action Plan. And it has led to policy\ninitiatives with respect to market access and the\navailability of pharmaceutical drugs to poor countries.\nFor instance, this year Canada eliminated virtually all\ntariffs and quotas on products from least developed\ncountries.\nAt the same time, the outcome of the World Trade\nOrganization meeting in Canc\u00fan is very, very\nworrisome. Agricultural subsidies of developed\ncountries must be radically reduced to give developing\ncountries \u2014 particularly in Africa \u2014 the chance to\nprosper. The developed world has an obligation to act,\nand to act quickly.\nColleagues, on no issue is progress more\nnecessary or more urgent than on the protection of the\ninnocent. Canada, in partnership with others, advocates\nputting the protection of people at the heart of the\nmandate of the Organization. Too often, conflicts are\nallowed to start, even when the whole world can see\nwhat the dreadful consequences will be. Too often,\ninnocent civilians are left to their fate.\nNext year will mark the tenth anniversary of the\ngenocide in Rwanda. In all conscience, we must ask\nourselves: are we any more ready now than we were\nthen to respond to another Rwanda? I fear the answer,\nunfortunately, is no.\nIt was with our collective failures in Bosnia and\nRwanda in mind that Canada sponsored the\nInternational Commission on Intervention and State\nSovereignty. The Commission has done excellent work,\nand in its report, it argues that sovereignty entails\nresponsibility as well as rights.\nThe most fundamental duty of a State is to protect\nits people. When a Government cannot or will not do\nso, the responsibility to protect them becomes\ntemporarily a collective international responsibility.\nSome question that idea because they fear intervention\non slight pretexts or with motives other than human\nprotection. Others, owing to their own tragic\nexperience, fear that there would be too little outside\ninvolvement. We need to reconcile those two concerns.\nWe believe \u2014 as does the Commission \u2014 that, in\nthe face of great loss of life or ethnic cleansing, the\ninternational community has a moral responsibility to\nprotect the vulnerable. The primary purpose must be to\navert and end human suffering. No entity is more\nappropriate than the Security Council to authorize\nmilitary action to protect the innocent. But the member\nStates of the Council have sometimes failed the\ninnocent. Past failures must motivate us to prepare\nbetter for future crises. We can reform how this place\nworks, improve its effectiveness, enhance its relevance\nand inspire its participants.\nBefore closing, I wish to comment on some of the\nchallenges to peace and security that we face. In\nAfghanistan, much has been achieved and much\nremains to be done. For our part, Canada has been\nengaged in the war on terrorism from the outset. We\nare the largest current military contributor to the\nInternational Security Assistance Force. We have\npledged 250 million Canadian dollars for humanitarian\nassistance and reconstruction. We are committed to\nhelping the Afghani people build a democratic,\npluralistic society. In Iraq, we have also joined the\ninternational effort to help the Iraqi people. We have\ndecided to contribute 300 million Canadian dollars, one\nof the largest single-country pledges we have ever\nmade. We are encouraged that the members of the\nSecurity Council are exploring how to elaborate upon\nthe United Nations role in the reconstruction and in\nprogress towards Iraqi self-government.\nThe situation in the Middle East preoccupies us,\nas it does the entire international community. Innocent\nlives on both sides are being lost. Israeli families and\nPalestinian families fear for their children and for their\nfuture. Terrorism and violence \u2014 in whatever form, to\nadvance whatever cause \u2014 simply creates more\nviolence and takes even more innocent life.\n23\n\nFor the international community, as for Israelis\nand Palestinians, despair is not an option. Our goal\nmust remain a political solution based on two viable\nStates, Israel and Palestine, within secure and\nrecognized borders. We need to support Palestinian\nefforts to develop modern, transparent and responsible\ngovernment. We need also to support those seeking to\npromote dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians in\nthe search for practical solutions to the core issues. It is\nour responsibility to help those who are preparing for\npeace, which must one day come.\nWhen the time is right, the international\ncommunity must be able to offer a robust international\npresence that will guarantee the safety and security of\nIsrael and of a Palestinian State, and we should be\ngetting ready to do so now. In addition, we should be\nlooking for lessons on how the international\ncommunity has acted in other places to stop\nviolence \u2014 as, for example, in Cyprus and in Kosovo.\nRegional tensions, the war on terror and efforts at\nreconstruction in recent hot spots must, nevertheless,\nnot distract us from continuing to help Africans realize\ntheir goals for trade and investment, democracy, human\ndevelopment and good governance.\nIn summary, multilateral cooperation remains\nindispensable. The United Nations remains at the heart\nof the multilateral system. New challenges demand\nnew structures, and a historic opportunity has emerged.\nLet us seize it, and let us realize the powerful\nidea that created the United Nations \u2014 the idea that\nnations can unite to save their people from the scourge\nof war. Let future generations say of us that we did not\nbetray that idea \u2014 that we realized the potential of this\ngreat body, supported it, renewed it and re-energized it\nto better serve humanity.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like first of all to congratulate you,\nSir, on being unanimously elected to chair the fifty-\neighth session of the United Nations General\nAssembly. On behalf of the Kingdom of Morocco and\nof the Group of 77 and China, I wish to assure you of\nour full support for making a success of this important\nsession.\nRealizing what a delicate phase our Organization\nis going through, many heads of State and Government\nhave accepted the invitation extended to them by\nMr. Kofi Annan, the United Nations Secretary-General.\nI should like to take this opportunity to express my\nappreciation to him, once again, for the relentless\nefforts he is making to shore up the efficiency of the\nOrganization.\nThis is an emotionally charged moment for me, as\nI stand on this prestigious rostrum and recall the appeal\nand initiatives launched by my late grandfather and\nfather, Their Majesties King Mohammed V and King\nHassan II, urging concerted action by the international\ncommunity to speed up decolonization, especially in\nthe Arab Maghreb and on the African continent, and to\nuphold the principles of peace, coexistence, openness\nand tolerance.\nWhat we have done, at the international level, has\nalways been guided by the same ideals that inspired the\nfounders of our Organization. It seeks to contribute to\nthe significant cultural accomplishments made by\nmankind thanks to this institution, to preserve human\ndignity, and to ensure equality in rights and\nobligations, not only between men and women, but also\namong nations, large and small, in full respect of\ninternational legality, and in a spirit of freedom and\nsolidarity.\n30\n\nWe certainly value the positive and concrete\nachievements of the Organization. However, in keeping\nwith our firm commitment to its noble mission, we ask\nourselves: to what extent has the Organization\nmanaged to make peace prevail and to contribute\nsignificantly to sustainable development and to the\nsettlement of conflicts arising, more often than not,\nfrom colonization, which tore apart entire peoples and\nnations, especially across our African continent?\nMoreover, I should like to assure our brothers and\nsisters from African States of Morocco's constant and\nunwavering solidarity as well as of its determination to\nfurther expand cooperation with them on political,\neconomic, social and security matters and to support\nconstructive African initiatives. In that context, the\ninternational community is called upon to provide\ntangible support to the African strategy, the New\nPartnership for Africa's Development, which targets\nthe sustainable development of the African continent,\nmostly through interaction on the part of its\nsubregional entities.\nThe Millennium Declaration marked a turning\npoint in carrying out the mission unanimously\nentrusted to the United Nations in the area of\nsustainable development. Indeed, for the first time,\nheads of State and Government agreed on specific\nobjectives and targets in the social, economic and\neducational fields up to the year 2015. As early as\nJanuary this year, I made a point of assigning to the\nChair of the Group of 77 and China the priority task of\nensuring follow-up to those commitments and\nmonitoring their integrated implementation. On our\nGroup's initiative, the General Assembly unanimously\nadopted a resolution to that effect last June, pending a\nglobal assessment in 2005.\nAlthough the Group of 77 and China has sought\nto keep development issues high on the Organization's\nagenda, one must admit that the main thrust of our\nefforts has focused on the serious threats posed to\nworld peace in the Middle East region. Despite the\nefforts undertaken for the settlement of the Palestinian\nquestion   whether by the United Nations or by the\ninternational Quartet, through the road map   the\nlogic of violence and intransigence continues to\nhamper the restoration of peace. The sufferings,\ndeprivations and injustices endured daily by the\nbrotherly Palestinian people call for stronger\ncommitment on the part of the international community\nto achieving irreversible implementation of the road\nmap.\nAs Chairman of the al-Quds Committee, I wish to\nsay that I am fully prepared to help to find a just and\nfinal solution leading to the establishment of a viable\nPalestinian State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital,\nliving side by side with the State of Israel, in a just,\ncomprehensive and lasting peace. With the settlement\nof that issue   which is contingent upon the\nwithdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab\nterritories   the region will regain its original status as\na land of religious and cultural coexistence.\nSimilarly, Morocco calls for concerted\ninternational action that would enable the brotherly\nIraqi people to live in security, stability and freedom\nand to rebuild their country, while ensuring that their\nchoices are fully respected and that their State's\nsovereignty, national unity and territorial integrity are\npreserved.\nThe Mediterranean region is particularly affected\nby the crises I have just mentioned. We therefore\nbelieve that the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue is an\nelement that is key for the region's stability, security\nand development. In that context, the Kingdom of\nMorocco has made the strategic choice of opting for\nthe construction of the Arab Maghreb as a region\nwhere peace and development may be fostered for the\nbenefit of its members, where there must be no\ntendency towards balkanization and where the\nfundamental national attributes of each Member State\nare fully respected.\nThe Kingdom of Morocco, guided by that\nMaghreban ideal and committed to safeguarding its\ngood-neighbourly relations, has agreed to ease the\ntension fomented on its borders and is endeavouring in\nall good faith to find an international consensus on the\nissue of the Moroccan Sahara. The attempts that have\nbeen made thus far to reach a solution show that the\nonly way to resolve the issue once and for all is to\ncome up with a realistic and final political solution in\nkeeping with democratic principles, while fully\nrespecting the Kingdom of Morocco's sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity, as the United Nations itself\nrecommended in June 2001. In that connection, I\nshould like once more to officially proclaim Morocco's\npledge to cooperate with the United Nations to bring\nabout such a political solution.\n31\n\nEver since the tragic events of 11 September, the\ninternational community has been involved in a\nresolute fight against international terrorism, which\nposes a threat to mankind's most sacred values. Last\nMay, the Moroccan nation was itself the target of the\nodious plague of terrorism in a desperate attempt to\nchallenge the democratic model that Morocco has\nchosen and to undermine its strong commitment to the\nvalues of freedom, tolerance and openness. We should\ntherefore like to insist on the need for intensified\ninternational cooperation to eradicate this scourge.\nHere, I should like to strongly denounce the\nconfusion deliberately created by those who\npersistently associate terrorism with Islam, thus\nchoosing to ignore the fact that Islam advocates peace\nand respect for human life and flatly rejects injustice\nand aggression.\nThe United Nations system is now confronted\nwith a deeply troubled international environment and\nfaces new and major challenges. If the United Nations\nis to play its role as the sole regulator of relations\nbetween and among States, it is imperative that we\nrestore to the concept of universalism its original\nmeaning: the obligation shared by all to comply with\nthe same ethics and rules of law and with effective\nsolidarity among all peoples and nations. To attain that\nobjective, mankind must find new reasons to rekindle\nhope. We must also have faith and confidence in the\nUnited Nations to help it recover its standing and its\neffectiveness. Let us therefore make a common pledge\nto build up its resources and to strengthen its action.\nThe Assembly may count on the help and support of\nthe King of Morocco so that, together, we may build a\nsafer, more equitable and more humane world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is my\nhonour to greet the President on behalf of the people of\nHaiti, and I congratulate our dear friend and brother\nMr. Julian Hunte, President of this session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nAfter having celebrated in 1992 500 years of\nIndian, black and popular resistance, the Republic of\nHaiti will celebrate on 1 January 2004 the bicentennial\nanniversary of its independence. From this moment on,\nthe first black republic of the world most warmly\nwelcomes you to that celebration of freedom. A\nuniversal value, that freedom, won in 1804 by our\nancestors, must direct us, day and night, towards peace.\nBecause of the genocide inflicted first on the\nIndians, then on 15 million Africans, wrested from\ntheir native land and thrown in chains of slavery onto\nthe soil of Haiti in 1502, there could be no peace.\nDuring those three centuries of genocide, our continent\nprovided 70 per cent of the entire world's gold, or\n2,849 tons of gold, valued at $36 billion.\nOf course, slavery is a crime against humanity. It\nis therefore the binding obligation of our generation to\nenshrine in the museum of civilization the gold book\ndedicated to reparation and restitution.\nYesterday there was trafficking in blacks. Tomorrow\nwill be the celebration of blacks   of blacks who are free\nand free forever so that peace will finally reign.\nTherefore, 1 January 2004, will be a celebration\nfor all freedom-loving blacks and whites; a celebration\nand a holiday for all peoples who thirst for freedom and\npeace. Thus, we wish to proceed from this bicentennial\nof freedom to achieve a millennium of peace.\n7\n\nIn that context, the Republic of Haiti is aiming at\nsustainable development, to make it possible to achieve\nthe Millennium Development Goals adopted here in\n2000 by the world's heads of State and Government.\nThe reduction by half, by 2015, of the percentage of\nthe world's population whose income is less than one\ndollar a day is indeed an enormous challenge. Yes, it is\nan enormous challenge to be met, given the\nacceleration of economic globalization.\nIn this vast space of freedom, where,\nunfortunately, it has not yet been possible to break the\nchains of abject poverty, four fifths of the world's\ninhabitants are users of only one fifth of the planet's\nentire resources. While global production of basic food\nproducts represents 110 per cent of global needs, 30\nmillion people die of hunger every year. To achieve the\nMillennium Development Goals in Haiti, the exercise\nof power entails respect for fundamental freedoms,\ntolerance and good governance; a war on the evils of\ncorruption, drug trafficking and impunity; investment\nin human beings, security for all, and the holding of\nfree, honest and democratic elections.\nFor the birth of a new Haiti and the advent of a\nbetter world, we are opposed to the extinction of\nfreedom, as well as to that of our species and\necosystems. In the Caribbean and in Latin America, the\ndeterioration of the environment is affecting 300\nmillion hectares of land and nearly 30 per cent of coral\nreefs. Over the past three decades, of 400 million\nhectares of natural forest that have perished throughout\nthe world, 40 per cent are in the Caribbean and Latin\nAmerican regions. It goes without saying that the\npoorest segment of our peoples consequently suffer,\nand their suffering is our pain.\nWhile scientists at the Stockholm summit\nemphasized the extermination of 150 species of birds\nand the threat of extinction of 1,000 others, the burning\nissue today focuses on life or the gradual extinction of\nthe human species. That is demonstrated by the\nHIV/AIDS pandemic. There are 42 million infected\npersons throughout the world; 3.1 million deaths; 13\nmillion orphans whose parents have been decimated by\nthe virus; and 6,000 young people who are infected\nwith HIV every day.\nThe attempt to effectively combat this pandemic\nmeans opting inevitably for the eradication of poverty.\nThe First Lady of the Republic has written that the\nburden of the foreign debt and economic sanctions are\nobviously not paving the way for such eradication.\nIndeed, in the Caribbean and in Latin America,\nthe foreign debt entails an average net transfer of 25\nbillion dollars annually to the North. In other words,\nthe aggregate value of that debt exceeds half of the\ngross domestic product (GDP) of the region.\nThroughout this collective and historic march\ntowards the Millennium Goals, we hope that the\ncontribution of the rich countries to sustainable\ndevelopment will rise from 0.2 to 0.7 per cent of their\ngross national product (GNP).\nNumerous observers have expressed their\ngratification at observing the reduction in global\nmilitary spending on a worldwide scale during the last\ndecade of the twentieth century. From 1985 to 1998,\nthose expenditures declined from 1,210.5 billion to\n803.7 billion dollars. The drop in military spending and\nthe rise in spending for human development will, we\nbelieve, promote both human and economic growth.\nThe Republic of Haiti will continue, unceasingly, to\nfight against violence and terrorism. It hopes, however,\nthat this uncontrollable need will not lead to stepping\nup an arms race or the proliferation of deadly weapons\nthroughout the world.\nTerrorism and bio-terrorism are by no means\nmere hallucinations. To live in freedom and to live in\npeace there is a need to eradicate violence wherever it\nmay come from. May we finally see the dawn of an era\nof peace in the Middle East, in Afghanistan, in Africa,\nin Asia and in Iraq, wherever wars are inflicting untold\nsuffering on mankind. Since 1989, the end of the cold\nwar, there have been more than 60 armed conflicts\nclaiming the lives of hundreds of thousands of\nindividuals and creating more than 17 million refugees.\nViolence and slavery are sources of darkness.\nPeace and freedom are sources of light. Our world is\nseeking that light. That light, like freedom, is\nabsolutely indispensable for life on earth.\nImpoverished, but aware of its human, cultural and\nhistoric riches, Haiti shines beyond the darkness of\ncolonization like a beacon of freedom.\nLet us humbly say:\nThe first black republic of the world\nIs and continues to be the geographical axis of\nfreedom for blacks.\n8\n\n(Spoke in Haitian Creole)\nHaiti is the mother of liberty,\nHer sons and daughters are the fruits of human\ndignity.\n(Spoke in French)\nHaiti is the mother of liberty,\nHer sons and daughters are the fruits of human\ndignity.\nMay it shine, may it shine day and night, that\nlight of freedom! Thanks to Albert Einstein, we know\nthat light is made up of particles and therefore implies\na flow of photons. Thanks to Toussaint Louverture, we\nknow that liberty is a radiant source of light, giving off\nphotons of dignity, justice and peace. May the blazing\nlight of liberty shine throughout the world.\nOur ancestors and your ancestors freed the slaves\nfrom their chains. Today, let us unite to free the world\nfrom the chains of inhuman poverty. Then we shall see\na reign of happiness, justice and peace at the heart of\nall nations and in Haiti, where you will be all warmly\nwelcomed to celebrate the bicentennial of our\nindependence.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is\nalways a special opportunity for the leader of his\ncountry to speak to this General Assembly. My speech\nwill be brief and may be summed up at the very outset\nin very few words as follows: I am speaking to you as\nthe President of a European democratic country\ninvolved in sustainable development. My compatriots\nespecially value the existence of freedom and respect\nfor the law as factors for progress in Spain. We think\nthese two values, freedom in all areas of life and\ncompliance with the law comprise the best recipe for\nprogress among peoples.\nThe last twenty-five years of progress in my\ncountry have fortunately coincided with the change in\nthe millennium. Freedom of opinion, peaceful political\nchoice and the broadening of fundamental rights have\nbecome values which enhance us. Of course, this has\nnot been accomplished without effort and risks along\nthe way. However, I now have the satisfaction of\nspeaking of that progress. The culture of community\nupon which this democracy is based is openly\nexpressed by the Spanish people of the Iberian\nPeninsula and we are celebrating this during the\ncommemoration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of our\nConstitution. We are an open country, trusted\nthroughout the world, and we wish the same principles\nand situation for others. The determination to increase\nfreedom throughout the world and the concern to\nensure that laws of the international community are\ncomplied with are values that guide our international\npolicies. We share this position with many countries\npresent here.\nThe world would be a better place if the rules we\nmake for ourselves are complied with and if those who\nbreach them know that their non-compliance will not\nprevail. The United Nations embodies international\nlegality. Compliance with its resolutions is in the\ninterest of all. This is the best way to build a world in\nkeeping with law rather than tyranny, with freedom\nrather than oppression.\nIt is probably for this purpose that the Security\nCouncil and the Organization require reform. Without\ndoubt, this is a complex issue and we support efforts\nbeing made in this connection by the Secretary-\nGeneral. In any case, we bear in mind that increasing\nthe number of Security Council Members will not\nnecessarily increase the effectiveness of the Council.\nBut above all, the United Nations needs its own\nMembers to respect its resolutions. A resolute effort on\nthe part of all countries is necessary to ensure a more\nsecure, yet freer world.\nAlthough violations of Security Council\nresolutions exist, all of us must ensure that the\nresolutions are complied with. All of us must lend a\nhand because it is in the interest of all for the ideals of\nthe United Nations to become a reality. Thus, we are\ncommitted to security, stability and the reconstruction\nof Iraq. We also are committed to returning sovereignty\nto the Iraqi people. We spare no effort and do not wish\nto dwell on the past. We believe that successful results\nin Iraq will be due to the efforts of the entire\ninternational community. We think that the pledging\nconference to be held in Spain on 23 and 24 October\nwill be a big stride. I would like, from this rostrum, to\ninvite all of you to participate in that conference.\nAllow me to present some more concrete ideas.\nOur efforts must be directed towards restoring the\nsovereignty of the Iraqi people in a way which will\nenable them to freely enjoy their own resources. For\nthat purpose there should be an agreement reached to\nestablish a multinational force with the clear mandate\nof guaranteeing peace and security. Given the situation\ntoday in Iraq with its high risk of terrorism, this task\ncannot be entrusted to a mere interposed force, but\nrather to one that will specifically ensure peace,\nsecurity and stability.\nAn additional agreement on the civil\nadministration of Iraqi resources and public services\nfor the people would be easier to obtain after that. I am\nreferring to a civil administration directed by the\nUnited Nations with the participation of the new\nleaders who would be representing a peaceful and\npluralistic Iraq.\n37\n\nPeace, security and freedom have always had\nenemies and we cannot close our eyes where such\nthreats exist. We have been the victims of blind\nterrorist violence in this Organization. We cannot\nforget that vile and cowardly attack in Iraq by which\nterrorists hoped to expel the United Nations from Iraq\nand close it off from the world. The States who flout\ninternational law are threatening what is dearest to us,\nour lives and our freedom.\nProliferation of weapons of mass destruction\nwould be even more dangerous. I firmly believe that\ncommitment and true cooperation between all States\nwill make it possible to win victory over terror. Last\nMay, Members of the Security Council shared some\nconsiderations concerning the fight against terrorism to\nwhich I refer now. We will continue to work on\npreparing a list of terrorist organizations \u2014 things\nshould be called by their proper names \u2014 and there\nshould be no political or moral quarter given to\nassassins. Our priorities must be set. We will shut down\nthe sources of financial support to terrorists and will\nprevent their access to weapons of mass destruction.\nThe treaties on disarmament with regard to nuclear,\nchemical and biological weapons will help with this\ntask. To prevent and intercept the trafficking of\nweapons of mass destruction, a group of countries has\nimplemented the Proliferation Security Initiative whose\nfirst meeting took place in Madrid last June. I invite\nyou also to join that Initiative.\nWe would like to give a voice to the victims of\nterrorism and for this, three things are required. We\nmust restore truth, regain dignity and pay tribute to the\nvictims of terrorism. If terrorists have sometimes used\npublic tribunals, it is a moral necessity to give an\ninstitutional forum to the victims where they can be\nheard. We must unmask the terrorists and truly listen to\nthe victims.\nIt has been rightly said, Sir, that the United\nNations has not been established to create paradise in\nthe world, but rather to keep the world from falling into\nan abyss. There is no paradise on earth. Efforts are\nbeing made to ensure that the world will be freer and\nmore peaceful and to distance us from the abyss,\nefforts which make it possible for this Organization to\nmake its lofty ideas a reality. It is hoped that no effort\nwill be spared in this undertaking.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, I\nshould like to convey to you, Sir, our warmest\ncongratulations on your election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-eighth session. I am\nconvinced that your great wisdom and wealth of\nexperience will guarantee the success of our work. I\nwould also like to thank your predecessor, Mr. Jan\nKavan, former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for\nForeign Affairs of the Czech Republic, who guided the\nwork of the previous session with great skill and\nability.\nI would also like to express congratulations and\ngreat appreciation to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, and all his associates, for their\noutstanding and tireless efforts to achieve the noble\nideals of our Organization. I would also like to express\nour satisfaction with the action taken since the previous\nsession of the General Assembly, in particular the\nmeeting in New York of the Commission on\nSustainable Development, which addressed measures\nand priorities envisaged for implementing\nrecommendations of the Monterrey Conference on\nFinancing for Development, the decisions of the\nJohannesburg Summit and the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals.\nI note particularly the efforts to facilitate access\nfor poor countries to quality medicines to combat\nendemic diseases.\nThe hideous murder of Mr. Sergio Vieira de\nMello, Special Representative of the Secretary-\nGeneral, together with a number of his closest\nassociates, in the terrorist attack on the United Nations\nheadquarters in Baghdad profoundly shocked and\ndistressed us. The increase of terrorism and its\nconsequences in terms of fear and human and material\ndestruction require the international community to step\nup consultations, cooperation and coordination and\nstrengthen efforts to tackle the dangers that threaten all\nhumankind.\nAchieving the objectives of development,\nsecurity and stability hinges strongly on how\neffectively we handle the challenges of extremism and\nterrorism. My country, while stating its commitment to\nrelevant Security Council resolutions, reiterates its\nabsolute and firm condemnation and denunciation of\nviolence and terrorism in all its forms and reaffirms its\nsupport for all regional and international efforts and\ninitiatives to combat this scourge.\nGiven the global nature of terrorism, the fight\nagainst it must necessarily be global in nature and be\nunderpinned by an intellectual and cultural dimension\nbased on the complementarity of civilizations and\nabsolute rejection of any clash or conflict between\nthem.\nWe also must not overlook the impact of\nimbalance in the development levels of rich and poor\ncountries, since poverty and social, scientific and\ntechnological under-development are primary causes of\ntension and sources of violence and extremism.\nThere can be no doubt that maintenance of peace\nand security around the world requires a greater role\nfor the United Nations and the strengthening of\ninternational law. My country therefore notes with\nsatisfaction the acceptance by the Palestinian Authority\nand the Israeli Government of the road map as\nsubmitted by the Quartet. This framework offers a\nfresh opportunity to establish a just and lasting peace in\nthe interest of all peoples of the region, ensuring the\nrestoration of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian\npeople, including the right to establish an independent\nState with Jerusalem as its capital, pursuant to the\ndecisions of the Madrid Conference, the principles of\nland for peace and Security Council resolutions 242\n(1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978).\nMy country stresses the importance it attaches to\nthe demand that Israel withdraw from the occupied\nArab territories and that negotiations be resumed\nimmediately, as the only way towards peace and\nsecurity in the Middle East.\nOn the question of Iraq, we welcome the\nestablishment of the new transitional Iraqi\nGovernment, while stressing our concern for the\nindependence of that fraternal country, its sovereignty,\nthe safety and security of its people and its territorial\nintegrity.\nRegarding the question of the Western Sahara,\nMauritania supports the steps taken by the Secretary-\nGeneral and his personal envoy, Mr. James Baker,\naimed at seeking a permanent solution that guarantees\nstability in the region and enjoys the agreement of all\nparties.\n28\n\nAs regards the positive developments in the\nLockerbie crisis, we express our satisfaction at the\nsolution reached between the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya\nand the parties concerned. We also welcome the lifting\nof sanctions against Libya by the Security Council.\nRegarding the African continent, we welcome the\nestablishment of African Union institutions and organs\nwhich will help resolve conflicts in the continent and\nrespond to the aspirations of African peoples to\nprogress and development. We also wish to express our\nsatisfaction with the New Partnership for Africa's\nDevelopment (NEPAD), which is aimed at enhancing\nregional cooperation in order to achieve economic\nintegration in the continent. We are also pleased by the\nsupport given to this initiative by our development\npartners.\nThe Islamic Republic of Mauritania, under the\nleadership of the President of the Republic,\nMr. Maaouya Ould Sid' Ahmed Taya, is peaceably\npursuing its course towards progress and development,\ninspired by the comprehensive and coherent vision of a\nsocietal project that meets national aspirations and\noffers real prospects for social advancement,\nmodernization and openness within the context of a\nState governed by law, justice and equality.\nThat strategy focuses on combating ignorance and\nilliteracy, and on spreading scientific and other\nknowledge by promoting books and reading as part of a\nlarge-scale national programme entitled Knowledge\nfor all', launched by His Excellency the President of\nthe Republic, to which, over the past few years, 3 per\ncent of the State budget has been allocated annually.\nThat leading-edge programme, regarded around the\nworld as one of the best cultural projects, involves in\nits first stage the establishment of 1,000 libraries in\nmajor population centres, particularly in rural areas,\nequipped with books and reference works relating to\nvarious fields of professional, cultural and social life.\nThis significant network of cultural institutions is\nstriving to instil the habit of reading among all\nsegments of society and within all age groups. It also\nhelps to disseminate a civic spirit to promote sound\nthinking, combat ignorance   illiteracy and\nprofessional and cultural ignorance   in order to\nstrengthen and supplement the efforts made in that area\nby the competent agencies. The implementation\nexecution of that programme follows a participatory\napproach that offers the populations concerned and\ncivil society organizations a basic monitoring and\nfollow-up role. All the major societal forces have\nmobilized under the programme, and our citizenry\nunderstands its scope and the importance.\nBy opting for that strategic approach, our country\nis embracing a vision in which human dignity, freedom,\nequality and social justice, the consolidation of noble\nhuman values, the preservation of safety and security\nand social peace around the world and comprehensive,\nfair and balanced development are all noble objectives\nthat can be achieved or maintained only through the\ntotal eradication of ignorance, illiteracy and cultural\nand intellectual underdevelopment.\nThe basic focuses of this strategy also include the\nprotection of women's rights as a dynamic factor of\nsociety, and increasing the participation of women in\nthe various fields of national life. The same is true of\nchildhood development and the protection of the rights\nof children. In that context, appropriate legal\ninstruments have been promulgated and a policy of\ndevelopment has been built around those priorities,\nwhich have accelerated the pace of human and social\ndevelopment indicators.\nIt has been possible through substantive reforms\nto launch private enterprise and to create a favourable\nclimate for investment, despite the impact of the\ncurrent world economic situation. The national strategy\nto combat poverty has made it possible to improve the\nliving standards and conditions of the population, with\nthe widespread provision of basic social services such\nas health, education, water, energy and\ntelecommunications. It should be noted that those\nresults could not have been achieved without a climate\nof security and stability promoted by a regime of\npluralistic democracy that has eliminated all forms of\nexclusion, opened the path to effective citizen\nparticipation, promoted all individual and collective\nfreedoms and given particular attention to the\npromotion of human rights.\nThe United Nations Charter reflects the common\naspirations of the peoples of the world to achieve their\nfundamental objectives, including safeguarding\ninternational peace and security. The profound changes\nin the international scene call for the revision of the\nstructural organization of the United Nations, in order\nto adapt it to the new realities and in keeping with its\nobjectives. In that regard, it would seem pertinent to\n29\n\nreconsider the system of representation within the\nSecurity Council.\nWe sincerely hope that the international\ncommunity will pool its efforts to enhance international\nsolidarity and build a new international order based on\nlaw and justice, one that safeguards peace and security\nand guarantees a decent life for all.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to\npreside over the fifty-eighth session of the General\nAssembly, and to wish you every success in your\nimportant position. It is a pleasure to see as President a\nrepresentative of Saint Lucia, the smallest country ever\nto hold the office. That fact upholds the Charter\nprinciple of the sovereign equality of nations in this\nimportant world body, as well as the desirability of\nuniversal membership in the United Nations, where all\ncountries, large and small, have something to\ncontribute.\nI also take this opportunity, Sir, to thank your\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, for his work and efforts\ndevoted to the activities of the United Nations\nthroughout the past year. It was a great honour for the\nCzech Republic to preside over the General Assembly\nand to use that unique opportunity to further enhance\nthe United Nations capacity and ability to respond to\ncurrent global challenges.\nLet me also express my country's deepest\nsympathies to all who have lost loved ones in terrorist\nattacks, including the attack on the United Nations\nbuilding in Baghdad, which claimed the lives of the\nSecretary-General's Special Representative in Iraq,\nSergio Vieira de Mello, and a number of his co-\nworkers. We view that horrible act as an attack against\nthe principles of freedom, democracy and peace, the\nprinciples on which our Organization is built.\nThe United Nations effort aimed at the\nstabilization, democratization and reconstruction of\nIraq has the full support of my country, and I\nappreciate the bold and selfless work done by the staff\nof the United Nations. The United Nations plays an\nirreplaceable role in that field. We therefore support the\nidea of adopting a new Security Council resolution that\nwould provide a framework for the widest possible\nparticipation of other countries. The Czech Republic\nwill actively participate in that process, and is\ndetermined to continue its engagement.\nThe recent terrorist attacks in Iraq and other\nregions of the Middle East strengthen our conviction\nthat the international community must not give in to\nterrorist threats. On the contrary, we must combine and\nintensify our efforts to combat them. The success of\ncooperation between the United Nations, the Coalition\nProvisional Authority and Iraqi representatives in\nstabilizing the situation in Iraq and handing over the\ncountry's administration to the Iraqi people will be the\nessential step in that direction. The Czech Republic\ntherefore welcomes the establishment of the Governing\nCouncil, the appointment of provisional ministers and\nthe continued work on drafting a constitution, and is\ninterested in the speedy creation of a stable\nGovernment in Iraq that will honour its international\ncommitments and respect human rights and freedoms\nand the fundamental principles of democracy. But that\nis not something than can happen overnight, as we\nknow from our own experience. The transition from\ndictatorship to a functioning democracy takes some\ntime.\nWe believe that progress in the Middle East peace\nprocess based on the road map must be at the centre of\nthe efforts of the whole international community. We\nshould not allow extremist and terrorist groups to\ndominate its agenda, as recent developments have\n12\n\nshown. At the same time, we call upon all parties\ninvolved to exercise maximum restraint in taking\nactions that may contradict the achievement of a\npeaceful political settlement of the crisis, especially\nextrajudicial killings and suicide bombings.\nThe Czech Republic supports activities aimed at\nreviving and continuing the implementation of the\npeace plan. In their talks, the Quartet and the parties\nconcerned must take stock of the peace plan and\nidentify obstacles on the road to peace, as well as\noutstanding tasks before the Government of Israel and\nthe Palestinian Authority. Without proper\nimplementation, the road map will suffer the same fate\nas those of the numerous peace initiatives we have seen\nin the past.\nThe problems of the Middle East are very\ncomplex. My country would like to emphasize three\nbasic issues in this fragile phase that we consider\ncrucial for the implementation and success of the road\nmap for peace, namely, the security aspects of a peace\nsettlement, the consistent suppression of all\nmanifestations of terrorism and the consolidation and\nstrengthening of the position of the Palestinian\nGovernment and its process of reform, including\nconcrete steps to confront terror and violence.\nIn our view, tangible changes in the situation on\nthe ground should be an inseparable part of those\nefforts. At the same time, with their vision of their own\nindependent State, Palestinians should feel that their\neconomic and humanitarian situation is improving. The\nCzech Republic is prepared to assume its share of\nresponsibility in the efforts to improve the economic\nsituation of Palestinian autonomous territories at both\nthe bilateral and multilateral levels.\nThe restoration of ethnic peace, the strengthening\nof stability and economic growth remain the main\nobjectives of the international community in the crisis\nregions of the Balkans. In the present circumstances,\nthe maintenance of an international presence in the\nregion is still a necessary prerequisite for the\ndevelopment of democracy and the strengthening of\npeace. The United Nations and other international\norganizations must exercise their control function even\nmore systematically, use their experience in assisting in\nthe transformation of society, ensure the active\nparticipation of all ethnic groups in the area of\nadministration, create conditions for the safe return of\nrefugees, help with development of local economies\nand curb organized crime.\nI am convinced that Mr. Harri Holkeri, the new\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General for\nKosovo, will further contribute to the achievement of\nthe declared objectives. The transfer of competencies\nfrom the United Nations Interim Administration in\nKosovo to local authorities must, at the same time,\ninclude the transfer of responsibilities for the\nachievement of the objectives set by the international\nadministration and, above all, the creation of\nconditions for the safe return of refugees. For the sake\nof the functioning of a multi-ethnic society, it is also\nnecessary to ensure the active participation of all ethnic\ngroups in the administration of the province.\nThe Czech Republic supports all international\nefforts in the field of disarmament and arms control,\nincluding verification of the non-proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction and their means of\ndelivery. That process is a long-term priority of Czech\nforeign policy. The Czech Republic devotes\nconsiderable attention to the relevant international\ntreaties and conventions in that regard and takes an\nactive part in addressing security problems. We are\nconvinced that it is necessary to promote and\nstrengthen universal adherence to the three major\nmultilateral agreements relating to weapons of mass\ndestruction, namely, the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the Chemical\nWeapons Convention and the Biological and Toxin\nWeapons Convention. In that connection, we also\nsupport the promotion of an early entry into force of\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Particular\nemphasis should be placed on establishing effective\nverification mechanisms, namely, for the Biological\nand Toxin Weapons Convention.\nWe consider the Additional Protocol to the NPT,\nwhich creates an integral part of the International\nAtomic Energy Agency's safeguards system and\nstrengthens the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to be\na very important element of the verification system.\nThat is why it is urgent for the States that have not\nentered into safeguards agreements with the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency to do so and to\nfulfil their obligations under article III of the Nuclear\nNon-Proliferation Treaty. We believe that the\nAdditional Protocol should be made the standard for all\nNPT signatory States.\n13\n\nThe problems associated with the current\nconflicts severely affecting civilian populations are\nclosely connected with the issue of conventional\nweapons, especially as regards small arms and light\nweapons. The Czech Republic supports the\ninternational community in its efforts to prevent the\nillicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons and\ntheir uncontrolled proliferation.\nThe Czech Republic very much welcomes the fact\nthat the international community is increasingly\nsensitized to the observance and protection of human\nrights. There is a growing body of globally recognized\nhuman rights and most cases of human rights violations\nare strongly criticized by the democratic international\ncommunity. Nevertheless, it would be too daring to\nassume that criticism by the international community\ncan always mitigate the consequences of a human\nrights violation. However, the fact that most entities in\ninternational law lay stress on human rights is\nunquestionably a positive aspect. I would therefore like\nto take this opportunity on behalf of the Czech\nRepublic to call for the release of all prisoners of\nconscience in various parts of the world, as well as to\ncall for the observance of their fundamental human\nrights.\nIn the light of recent developments, I consider it\nnecessary to again mention the Nobel Peace Prize\nlaureate from Myanmar, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, and\nthe numerous Cubans who were sentenced to many\nyears in prison in the political trials of March and April\n2003. Those and similar cases only deepen the isolation\nof the countries concerned and do not solve the\nexisting situations.\nThe Czech Republic remains fully committed to\nthe United Nations and is aware of the fact that the\nUnited Nations is a universal international organization\nthat plays an irreplaceable role in the present\nglobalized world. We support the Millennium\nDeclaration as the basis for the reform of the entire\nUnited Nations system and as a further step towards the\nstrengthening of the Organization's authority,\noperational capability and effective functioning. We\nsupport in particular the initiatives of the Secretary-\nGeneral aimed at improving the management and\nadministration of the United Nations. Another\nimportant task is to proceed with the revitalization of\nthe General Assembly, including such areas as the\nclustering of agenda items.\nThe reform of the Security Council represents a\ncrucial element in the development of international\nrelations in the new millennium. The Czech Republic\nshares the majority view that the composition of the\nCouncil is outdated, that it reflects the realities of the\nSecond World War rather than those of today and that it\nshould be adjusted to the current state of affairs. The\npresent situation is unsustainable and undermines the\nlegitimacy of the United Nations, and therefore calls\nfor urgent action. The Czech Republic will continue to\nsupport inevitable reform steps, including the\nenlargement of the Council in both categories of\nmembership. In particular, we support the aspirations\nof Germany and Japan for permanent seats, as well as\nthe allocation of another three new permanent seats for\nAfrica, Asia and Latin America.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to\ninform the General Assembly of the decision of the\nGovernment of the Czech Republic Government to\npresent its candidature for a non-permanent seat on the\nSecurity Council for the period 2008-2009 as our\ncontribution to safeguarding international peace and\nsecurity.\nI welcome the President's intention to focus the\nAssembly's attention on the implementation of the\noutcomes of the United Nations summits and\nconferences held during the past decade and on the\nUnited Nations development agenda, including the\nMillennium Declaration Goals. The Czech Republic\nemphasizes the importance of the implementation of\nthe Millennium Development Goals as an overarching\nplatform for specific actions to achieve specific goals\nand targets. Actions at the national, regional and\ninternational levels are necessary to fight poverty,\nimprove access to health services and water, combat\nthe spread of HIV/AIDS, provide education, bridge the\ndigital divide and preserve the environment, to name\nonly a few of our many concerns. At the same time,\nefforts to achieve development goals complement\nefforts to achieve sustainable development, including\nits economic, social and environmental aspects. The\nCzech Republic believes that a focus on multilateral\nand international cooperation is indispensable to the\nsuccess of the United Nations development agenda. We\nare therefore prepared to continue to contribute to that\nimportant process.\nAs regards the strategic document entitled the\nNew Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD),\nin which, for the first time in their history, African\n14\n\nStates assumed responsibility for their further\ndevelopment, the Czech Republic is well aware that\nsupport for that document must be translated into\naction as soon as possible. An active and constructive\napproach should be reflected in all horizontal activities\nof the international community. That is why the Czech\nRepublic regards the principle of good governance as\none of NEPAD's key principles that can substantially\ncontribute to the establishment of suitable conditions\nfor the integration of African States into ongoing\nglobalization processes and to the creation of a\nfavourable climate for the continent's further\ndevelopment.\nAs an acceding country to the European Union,\nthe Czech Republic is prepared to assume its part in the\nimplementation of the African policy that is part of the\nEuropean Union's Common Foreign and Security\nPolicy.\nIn conclusion, let me stress that the challenge\nposed by security has likely been the most bitter and\nforceful to arise in the global community in the past\ntwo years. In that regard, we face a real test of our will\nand ability to cooperate, and in that connection the\nUnited Nations remains an irreplaceable forum for\nconflict prevention and a legal platform for the taking\nof multilateral steps to preserve the world's security\nand peace. In that respect, we very much support the\nSecretary-General's call for the strengthening of\nmultilateralism, as international security cannot be\nfully achieved by single States or coalitions dealing\nwith threats for the rest of the world.\nHumankind has not been challenged in such\nterms in all of its history. I am not referring solely to\nterrorism or nuclear threats, but also to various\nepidemics, poverty and the worsening environment,\nwhich are themselves the root causes of conflicts.\nFurthermore   and we are now witnessing this in\nIraq   reactive military actions, both targeted and of\nshort duration, are part of the solution, but they do not\nprovide the whole remedy. There is an irreplaceable\nrole for the world community to play. We, the Member\nStates of the United Nations community, should\ntogether therefore focus our utmost attention on\nefficient measures to make our planet secure and\nprosperous for present and future generations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "At\nthis crucial moment, when it is debating questions vital\nto the United Nations and all humanity, the General\nAssembly has unanimously decided to elect you, Mr.\nPresident, to preside over the deliberations of its\nsixtieth session. I therefore congratulate you very\nwarmly and offer you my best wishes for success. I\nalso congratulate your predecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, and\nthank the Secretary-General for his efforts for peace,\ndevelopment and agreement among nations.\nOur world has been radically transformed since\nthe end of the cold war \u2014 that sombre period that still\nhas continuing effects. New threats have appeared,\nwhile other, older ones remain. New kinds of\nchallenges loom, even as the international community\nis falling behind in finding appropriate responses to\nexisting challenges, which are getting worse. New\nconflicts are erupting violently today, while the\ninternational community still struggles with the\nflashpoints that appeared following the Second World\nWar, as well as those that arose out of the ensuing\nprocess of decolonization.\nHumanitarian disasters, whether man-made or\nnatural, and the problems of refugees, famine, the\nAIDS pandemic and malaria, exacerbated by persistent\nunderdevelopment have contributed more than ever to\nstretch beyond strictly military issues our definition of\ncollective security, which our Organization, since its\nbirth, has been asked to promote. The mission to\nprotect remains today an unattainable goal.\nA vital threat seen daily throughout the world is\nthe growing threat of international terrorism, which\nrespects no borders and violates the most fundamental\nhuman rights. It is not enough to vigorously denounce\nthe killing of innocent victims. To combat terrorism,\nwe must oppose it with relentless determination. In that\ncontext, there is no alternative to resolute international\ncooperation that recognizes, above all, that an effective\nresponse to transnational terrorism is necessarily a\ncollective effort.\nAlgeria believes it urgent to implement existing\nagreements on the fight against terrorism and to\nconclude a comprehensive convention on terrorism that\ncan overcome the difficulties in reaching an agreed\ndefinition of terrorism while not providing pretexts for\nthe oppression of peoples seeking to realize their\nlegitimate rights. Active cooperation has been long\nawaited, but it is not sufficient.\nBilateral, regional and multilateral cooperation\nmust be expanded and improved as we strengthen\ninternational legal instruments, such as the\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of Acts\nof Nuclear Terrorism, adopted last April.\nAt the same time, given the justifiable revulsion\nterrorism provokes, we must guard against attributing\nsuch acts to any religion or civilization. On the\ncontrary, we must emphasize that the aspiration to\npeace and the search for agreement and exchange\n13\n\namong peoples are values common to the various\ncivilizations we represent. That leads us to express our\ncomplete rejection of terrorism and spurs our collective\nreaction against it.\nWe cannot hide our concern at growing\nintolerance and the echoes we sometimes hear of\npseudo-theories and false analyses that show ever less\nrestraint in directly blaming Islam, which, for the\noverwhelming majority of a billion believers, is a\nreligion that calls for fraternity, solidarity and\ntolerance. To blame Islam - as some small but\ninfluential groups do - is to forget that before\nterrorism was recognized as an international\nphenomenon, it also struck, in particular, at Muslims\nwho had rejected the perpetrators and denied their\nclaims that they represented all Muslims.\nI strongly reaffirm that those criminals have placed\nthemselves outside Islam and have no claim to it. I say\nthis on behalf of a country that has suffered a decade of\nterrorism and which has found precisely in its religion\nthe endurance and the will to triumph over barbarism,\nstaunch its wounds, renew its hope and take the path of\nreconciliation and brotherhood, which are at the very\nheart of the community of people and its leaders, as we\napproach the national referendum of 29 September.\nAlthough the situation today confirms some of\nour earlier doubts and concerns, our only concern now\nis to see the people of Iraq \u2014 the heirs to an ancient\ncivilization that is admired by the whole world \u2014\nreturn to peace and stability through the recovery of its\nfull and complete sovereignty over a territory whose\nintegrity is best preserved by exorcising the divisive\ndemons generated by the present circumstances.\nThe Arab world is today the site of promising\ndevelopments for the development of democracy and\neconomic prosperity for its people. It would be wrong\nto see in these developments merely a response to\nexternal pressure. First and foremost, it comes from\npeoples wishing to participate, finally and actively, in\ntheir future, and who are eager to make their specific\ncontribution to the conduct of affairs in a world where\nnothing that happens should be alien to them.\nThis desire for reform brought the Arab heads of\nState together in Algiers, last March for a summit\nmeeting, over which we were honoured to preside.\nReaffirming that desire, the leaders made firm\ncommitments and we have proceeded to implement\nthem.\nAs diverse as the Arab countries may be in their\npolitical, economic and social realities, we still have\nthe same aspiration, which is bearing us towards a\nfuture of peace and progress to be shared by all if\npossible. In other words, we are fully aware that no\npeace and no sustainable economic momentum can be\nbuilt in the Middle East unless the Palestinian people\nrecover their full and complete sovereignty in the\noccupied territories, including Al-Quds Al-Sharif,\ncapital of their independent State.\nIt is a positive thing that the risks of nuclear\nproliferation have received heightened international\nattention in the last few years. The seventh Conference\nto review the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty held\nlast May should have provided us with a special\noccasion to develop and adopt appropriate measures to\ndeal with the problem on a consensual basis. However,\nwe must note that our expectation was not met,\nparticularly with respect to the 13 measures on nuclear\ndisarmament agreed to at the preceding Conference.\nAlgeria, which has adopted and supported the\nAdditional Protocol on the International Atomic\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) safeguards regime, also fully\nsupports total and complete disarmament, as well as\nthe total elimination of weapons of mass destruction.\nBut we cannot conceal our concern that an exception to\nthe treaty that has been tolerated, even allowed, in a\nregion as riven by conflict as the Middle East only\nfurther underscores the discriminatory approach that\nprevails with respect to non-proliferation.\nThe African landscape has been profoundly\ntransformed since the formation of the African Union\nand the launching of the New Partnership for Africa's\nDevelopment (NEPAD). So it is with new energy that\nAfrica, having established its Peace and Security\nCouncil, has decided to tackle the conflicts that afflict\nit and to take up the resolute promotion of their final\nsettlement. Anyone who looks at Africa objectively\ncannot ignore the endemic diseases, all of the visible\nand latent crises, the natural and man-made disasters,\nthe famine and illiteracy. But today\u2019s Africa, we must\nnote, has never had so many democratically elected\nregimes and so many economies undergoing promising\nreforms. Much still needs to be done, and the African\ncountries are the first to recognize that.\nOut of a sense of solidarity and also out of self-\ninterest, developed countries should accompany Africa\nin its determination to make a radical change in its\ncircumstances so as to allow the African continent to\n14\n\nbecome part of the world economy, gain prosperity and\nmake its contribution to the prosperity of the world in\ngeneral. This cannot be done unless we take specific\nactions that have been amply identified by NEPAD, by\nthe Commission for Africa established by Tony Blair\nand by the report of the Secretary-General of our\nOrganization.\nAs you know, the main points are to erase the\ndebt and raise official development assistance (ODA)\nfrom the current $25 billion to $50 billion and then to\n$75 billion between now and 2010, to establish an\ninternational finance facility and to raise ODA from the\ndeveloped countries to 0.7 per cent of their gross\ndomestic product by 2015.\nIt is also in Africa, near Algeria, that we still see\none of the last remaining uncompleted processes of\ndecolonization. I am referring to the conflict in the\nWestern Sahara, where Morocco and the Polisario\nFront are adversaries. The United Nations has\nidentified this territory as being non-autonomous, and\nit is a situation that is actionable under the Declaration\non the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries\nand Peoples. There is a peace plan that has been\napproved unanimously by the Security Council, calling\nfor a framework and modalities for a final settlement\nthrough a free consultation of the Saharawi people\nregarding their destiny.\nMy country believes that the Baker Plan is the\nonly framework able to lead to a settlement of the\nconflict, which pits Moroccans against the Polisario.\nAlgeria fully supports the efforts of the United Nations to\nthis end. We are pleased in this respect to see Mr. Peter\nvan Walsum appointed as Personal Envoy of the\nSecretary-General and we assure him of our support in his\nmission, just as we do the new Special Representative of\nthe Secretary-General for the Western Sahara.\nResolving the conflict in the Western Sahara in\nkeeping with norms of international legality and within\nthe framework of the United Nations would have the\npositive effect of giving critical momentum to the\nbuilding of the Greater Arab Maghreb, which Algeria\nhas always called for.\nWe can only agree with the Secretary-General\nwhen he puts development at the centre of his concept\nof a new international economic order and gives it\npriority attention within the United Nations agenda. A\nfew days ago, Member States evaluated progress made\nsince the September 2000 adoption of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), and we must admit that\nthe results are not that encouraging, the case of Africa\nbeing rather instructive. With regard to the\nimplementation of the eight goals of the 2000\nDeclaration, we would say that some of them, such as\npoverty reduction, have been deferred to a dangerously\nremote future.\nThe requirement of adapting to new international\nrealities makes reform an obligation for our\nOrganization. Such reform must be thoroughgoing and\nbalanced and serve and preserve the interests of as\nmany as possible. We cannot just have specific\namendments for the ambitions of a small number of\nMembers, legitimate though those ambitions may be.\nThe reforms to be undertaken must, above all, satisfy\nthe majority and serve the collective interests and\ncommon aspirations of all.\nThe special attention given to the expansion of\nthe Security Council is certainly justified, given the\ndominant role played by the Council in maintaining\ninternational peace and security, but we must not let\nthis cause us to lose sight of the legitimate demands of\nAfrica, nor of the need to maintain balance among the\nvarious bodies. Given the fact that most of the African\ncountries were excluded from the Conference for the\nUnited Nations at San Francisco because they were\ncolonies, it would be paradoxical, anachronistic and\nineffective if developing countries were now invited to\nvalidate reform proposals that ignore their interests and\nconcerns.\nIn this exercise that we are undertaking under the\nwatchful eye of our peoples, let us work together and\nembrace a common vision that will ensure a future of\npeace and prosperity shared by the Member States that\nthe United Nations has the duty to guarantee."

        "file_text": "I convey my\ndelegation\u2019s felicitations on your election,\nMr. President, on leading this historic session. I also\nwish to express our deep appreciation to Ambassador\nJean Ping, whose leadership and wisdom proved to be\nthe key to the successful negotiation and adoption of\nour outcome document.\nSixty years ago, enduring peace was foremost in\nthe minds of the founders of our Organization. Scarred\nfrom war and stunned by mankind\u2019s capacity for death\nand destruction, they did not consider failure an option.\nOur common humanity demanded that we build a\nbetter and peaceful world. To do that, representatives\nfrom 50 nations gathered in San Francisco, in a\nbuilding dedicated to those who defended and fought\nfor freedom, to draft a charter that would unite the\nnations of the world for peace. General Carlos P.\nRomulo, the head of the Philippine delegation,\narticulating the hopes of mankind, said then at the\nUnited Nations: \u201cLet us make this floor the last\nbattlefield.\u201d\nMr. Zarif (Islamic Republic of Iran), Vice-\nPresident, took the Chair.\nThe leading lights attending the founding of the\nUnited Nations are still familiar to us \u2014 Joseph Paul\nBoncour of France, Wellington Koo of China, Andrei\nGromyko of Russia, Lord Halifax of the United\nKingdom, Edward Stettinius of the United States, His\nRoyal Highness Faisal ibn Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia,\nSir Ramaswami Mudaliar of India, Jan Smuts of the\nUnion of South Africa, Jan Masaryk of\nCzechoslovakia, Herbert Evatt of Australia, Exequiel\nPadilla of Mexico, and many others. Those visionaries\nled the historic and daunting task of writing the United\nNations Charter.\nA third of mankind was still under colonial\ndomination. Only three Asian nations were in\nattendance. Most of Africa were not yet independent\nnations. In a forum dominated by colonial Powers, the\nPhilippines fought to ensure the notion that the goal of\nthe Trusteeship Council should not only be self-\ngovernment but independence.\nWhen the United Nations emblem was being\ndrawn, General Romulo asked that the Philippines,\nalthough still a commonwealth, be included. He was\ntold that the Philippines would only be a small dot on\nthat now familiar map. He demanded nevertheless that\nthe dot be placed on the map.\nThe Philippines insistence on its place on the\nworld map, albeit just a dot, symbolized for many\nsoon-to-be independent and developing nations the\nchallenge facing the United Nations. The clear\nchallenge facing the United Nations at its inception,\nand particularly developing nations, was to ensure that\nfreedom from want, freedom from fear and freedom to\npursue human dignity would be at the heart of the\npolitical independence of the States.\nSixty years after San Francisco, we continue to\nface the challenge of freeing all our peoples from want\nand from fear and allowing them the true dignity that\nthey deserve as independent nations. The fight for the\npolitical and legal independence of States is over, but\nthe fight to win for all peoples their freedom from fear\nand want and to pursue human dignity continues.\nFor the Philippines, as a developing country,\nfreedom from want is of utmost concern. Poverty, the\nenergy crisis and insufficient financial resources,\ncompounded by debt, are the pressing challenges\n5\n\nfacing my country and its people. We also face serious\nsecurity threats, particularly from terrorism \u2014 with\nmany of our citizens victimized by terrorist attacks. We\nrecognize the economic and social underpinnings of\nsuch acts.\nIn the not too distant past, my country also had to\nconfront the threat of the severe acute respiratory\nsyndrome (SARS). Our national experience prompts us\nto agree with the Secretary-General that these global\nthreats are all interrelated, and our different\nperceptions of the imminence of the threats facing us\nshould not deter us from cooperating to address them.\nThis brings me to my central theme \u2014 that we\nshould let the bond of our broad vision of our common\nhumanity inspire us all to work towards a stronger\nUnited Nations for a better world.\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that no\nnation can defend itself against threats entirely on its\nown. We agree that development, freedom from fear\nand human rights concerns are interrelated and should\nbe equally considered in designing the solutions to the\nthreats we face. We believe that because of this\ninterrelation, these concerns should be addressed in a\ncomprehensive and integrated manner.\nThe world is facing the problem of unbridled\nspiralling of oil prices. International cooperation on\nenergy is increasingly becoming an imperative as the\ncapacity and capability of countries, particularly non-\noil producing developing countries, to meet their\ndevelopment objectives, including the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), are affected. This\nunavoidably impacts on security.\nThe Philippines welcomes the 100 per cent debt\ncancellation for the 38 heavily indebted poor countries.\nHowever, the debt situation is expected to worsen, as\nmiddle-income countries go deeper in debt with the\nthreat of rising world oil prices. Once more, the need\nfor other innovative and creative means of international\ncooperation for debt relief also becomes imperative.\nThe Philippines has proposed the consideration of\nthe adoption of a debt conversion scheme\nincluding \u201cdebt-for-equity\u201d or \u201cdebt-for-Millennium\nDevelopment Goal projects\u201d. The scheme calls for the\nconversion of 50 per cent of the debt service into\nequity for MDG projects of at least equal value with an\nincome earning potential.\nDebt for development projects can focus on areas\nthat would achieve MDG benchmarks such as hospitals\nand health care, schools, classrooms, information\ntechnology, clean water, electricity, reforestation, eco-\ntourism and many others that should help us achieve\nour MDGs by 2015.\nThe nexus between development and\ninternational migration cannot be overlooked.\nMigration brings challenges and opportunities to\ncountries of origin, destination and transit. This is\nanother multifaceted issue that requires international\ncooperation to be addressed in a coordinated and\ncoherent manner. A comprehensive and effective\ninternational mechanism for cooperation should be\ndrawn up to address its politico-security, social,\ncultural and economic development dimensions.\nAs one of the major sending States, the\nPhilippines stands ready to cooperate with all countries\nin contributing towards the formulation of effective\nmechanisms that would help ensure a smooth\nmanagement of the migration phenomenon.\nThe Philippines knows only too well the fear that\nterrorism instils in the civilian population and the\nanguish it brings to victims and close relatives. We\ntake cognizance of terrorism\u2019s political, social and\neconomic underpinnings.\nOur national experience has shown us the value\nof dialogue in our approach to consider all those\nfactors. The Philippines wants to share this positive\nvalue of dialogue and therefore has taken the lead in\ndrawing attention to the need for interfaith dialogue as\nan integral part for the promotion of the culture of\npeace. My President recently convened a successful\ninformal summit on interfaith dialogue and cooperation\nhere in the United Nations. The summit adopted a\ndeclaration calling for greater interreligious,\nintercultural and intercivilizational dialogue and\ncooperation to ensure a lasting and durable peace and\nunderstanding at the global, regional and national\nlevels. We invite all who agree with its principles to\nconsider endorsing the declaration.\nWe all acknowledge that the world has reached an\nunprecedented stage when there are virtually no more\nbarriers, whether of space or time. Communication\ntechnology has made possible the dissemination of\ninformation instantaneously to practically all parts and\ncorners of the globe.\n6\n\nAs the nineteenth century brought us the\nindustrial revolution, the twentieth century brought us\nto the technology revolution ushered in by\ncomputerization. The twenty-first century now offers\ninfinite possibilities to further advance the information\nage. At no other time has the saying \u201cno man is an\nisland\u201d rang truer. As the Secretary-General has said,\nwhat affects one affects all in this globalized world.\nHowever, the information age is a two-edged\nsword, as experience has shown us. While it opened\nopportunities, it also brought challenges that we all\nhave to cope with. Our concern however is that just as\nthe limitless opportunities it offered could be used to\nbenefit humanity, it could also be used destructively.\nInformation technology enables companies to search\nfor lowest cost factors of production globally, operate\nmore efficiently and pass on the benefits to consumers.\nHowever, this same technology also enables\ndisillusioned and desperate members of society to\nbecome agents of terror and recruit adherents to their\nway of thinking as well as to fund their destructive\nactivities. It is therefore in our common interest to\nbring together our collective strengths to take\nadvantage of the opportunities before us as well as to\nconfront common threats.\nFor 60 years, the United Nations has provided us\nthe forum to draw up norms of conduct that take on\nboard all our concerns. From its inception with 51\nMember States in 1945, the membership has almost\nquadrupled to its present 191 States.\nWhile the United Nations has, time and again,\nadopted some reforms, at no other time has the\npressure for far-reaching change been starker than it is\nnow. The evolving global and regional security\nenvironment, ongoing conflicts in many countries that\nhave multidimensional root causes and other\nflashpoints have to be addressed. It is clear that in\npursuing our shared interest to preserve our common\nhumanity, the United Nations continues to serve as our\nindispensable tool. It is therefore also our shared\ninterest to strengthen it.\nEven before San Francisco, some key decisions\nhad already been reached among the major Powers,\nprimarily on the power of the veto, or what was\nreferred to then as the \u201cunanimity rule\u201d. Our\ndelegation, in concert with others, pressed for an\nincreased role of the General Assembly. We felt that\nthis was the balance necessary to safeguard the\neffectiveness of the United Nations in maintaining\ninternational peace and security. We also urged wider\nand more equitable representation in the Security\nCouncil \u2014 an aspiration that has yet to achieve\nrealization, and thus an advocacy that my country\ncarries to this day.\nThe outcome document of the High-level Plenary\nMeeting provides the substance upon which to\nstrengthen the United Nations system. It should guide\nus well in our discussions on institutional reform.\nSix decades after San Francisco, our common\nhumanity remains at stake. We have today another\nopportunity to make our United Nations succeed.\nWhether the issue is United Nations reform or freedom\nfrom want or fear, we must act now to ensure that the\nprinciples committed to by our leaders at this year\u2019s\nsummit be implemented effectively and efficiently.\nAllow me therefore to present at this point some\npractical strategies that may assist us in ensuring that\nwe achieve our goals.\nFirstly, the agreed commitments should be broken\ndown into tangible steps. Concrete benchmarks and\npragmatic indicators of progress must be set.\nSecondly, with concrete international\nbenchmarks, national strategies can be geared to\nachieving them. All concerned national actors in\ndomestic procedures and actions should be involved.\nThis is necessary to put into effect and implement\nmultilateral commitments. Ideally, national actors\nshould be privy to developments in the negotiating\nprocess and have the opportunity to provide their own\ninputs with respect to the national position to be taken.\nThis is expected to ensure implementation and follow-\nup to the commitments made by our leaders.\nThirdly, we must not lose sight of the need to\nincrease congruence among national, regional and\ninternational plans of action. Keeping these in sight\ncontributes to a faster rate of achieving these goals.\nNational plans of action can be elevated to the regional\nlevel, whenever feasible.\nFourthly, we must rethink our existing modes of\ninternational cooperation. There will be value in\nassessing how we have been collaborating bilaterally,\nregionally and multilaterally. Let us assess the\neffectiveness of our current modes of cooperation.\n7\n\nIn adopting practical measures and in discovering\nnew opportunities and addressing new threats, we must\nbe mindful of the old hopes and enduring dreams that\nled to the birth of our United Nations. As a child, I\nlistened with all innocence as my family closely\nfollowed the work of the Philippine delegation in San\nFrancisco. I felt proud that my nation, the\nPhilippines \u2014 the Benjamin among the founders \u2014\nwas part of this historic event.\nWe were rebuilding our shattered lives and\nmourning our dead. Yet we held on to hope. We had\nhope that no country would ever again crush us with\ntheir bombs, trample us with their tanks or defile our\nmothers, sisters and daughters. As a nation devastated\nby war, we placed great hope in the United Nations. I\nstill remember the words that made us dare dream of a\nbetter, more peaceful world \u2014 words heard by a child\nthrough the crackle and static of an old radio, words\nspoken by General Carlos P. Romulo in addressing the\ndelegates in San Francisco in 1945. He said:\n\u201cWords are more powerful than guns in the\ndefence of human dignity. Treaties are stronger\nthan armamented boundaries. The only\nimpregnable line is that of human\nunderstanding.\u201d"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the\ndelegation of the Democratic People's Republic of\nKorea, please allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on\nyour election to the presidency of the sixtieth session\nof the General Assembly. I should also like to\ncongratulate your predecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, Minister\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Gabonese Republic, on his\ncommendable work as President at the previous\nsession. I look forward to the successful outcome of\nthis session. My appreciation also goes to Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan for his tireless efforts aimed at\nreforming the Organization to bring about\nmultilateralism centred on the United Nations in\nconformity with the demands of the current changed\nsituation.\nFive years ago, when the Millennium Summit\nadopted its Declaration of peace, poverty eradication\nand respect for human rights, humankind sincerely\nhoped that, with the dawn of a new century, peace and\nprosperity would take hold around the world. However,\ndespite the adoption of that Declaration and the\naspirations of humankind, the world is today being\ndrawn further into a vortex of instability and fear due\nto unilateralism and the highhandedness of the super-\nPower. On one side of the world, voices yearning for\npeace, poverty eradication and sustainable\ndevelopment continue to grow; while on the other side\nprovocative acts such as armed invasion and the threat\n27\n\nof pre-emptive nuclear attack are being committed\nopenly against sovereign States.\nIn North-East Asia alone, with the Korean\npeninsula at its centre, adventurous military attempts\ncontinue unabated, aggravating tension in the region,\nas does the strengthening of strategic military\nalliances, the large-scale introduction of highly\nsophisticated weapons and operational equipment, the\nestablishment of missile defence systems and Ulchi\nFocus Lens-05 military exercises for pre-emptive\nstrikes.\nThe current situation is becoming increasingly\nacute due to arbitrariness on the part of unilateralist\nforces. That urgently requires that Member States\nundertake a joint effort to bring about multilateralism\ncentred on the United Nations on the basis of respect\nfor the principles of sovereignty, equality, territorial\nintegrity and mutual benefit.\nAs is well known, peace and stability on the\nKorean peninsula are directly linked to peace and\nsecurity in the North-East Asian region and the rest of\nthe world. As we have seen in recent years, the\nsituation on the Korean peninsula is once again part of\na vicious circle of tension and d\u00c8tente that is\npreventing the establishment of durable peace and\nstability. The primary cause for that lies in the national\ndivision forced upon us by foreign forces and the\nextremely hostile policy of the super-Power towards\nthe Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\nThe Democratic People's Republic of Korea's\npolicy of Songun Jongchi - which is to say, to give\npriority to military affairs - is aimed primarily at\ncoping with the attempts of the United States to\nsuffocate the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,\nwhich constitute a real threat. The Songun policy\nadministered by the respected General Kim Jong Il is\nthe basic safeguard for our sovereignty from the\nconstant threat of the United States and for preventing\nanother war on the Korean peninsula, thereby ensuring\npeace and security in North-East Asia.\nThis year, the north and the south of Korea\ntogether significantly commemorated the fifth\nanniversary of the announcement of the 15 June North-\nSouth Joint Declaration, as well as the sixtieth\nanniversary of Korea's liberation, thereby setting a new\nstage for the attainment of overall national unity and\nthe realization of the cause of national reunification\nindependently and peacefully under the theme \u00ecOur\nnation itself\u00ee. The Government of our Republic will\nalso make every possible effort in the future to bring\nabout independent national reunification as soon as\npossible, achieve lasting peace and stability on the\nKorean peninsula and bring about the nation's common\nprosperity by thoroughly implementing the 15 June\nNorth-South Joint Declaration.\nWith a view to facilitating better understanding\non the part of Member States and making positive\ncontributions to the work of the current session, I\nwould like to refer to the principled position and\nsincere efforts of our Republic regarding a fair solution\nof the nuclear issue between the Democratic People's\nRepublic of Korea and the United States.\nThe Government of our Republic has consistently\nadhered to its position of addressing the nuclear issue\npeacefully, through dialogue and negotiations. As\neveryone knows, the nuclear issue is a direct product of\nthe hostile policy of the United States against the\nDemocratic People's Republic of Korea during more\nthan half a century. Given that, driven by extreme\nhostility towards the Democratic People's Republic of\nKorea, the United States has gone as far as designating\nour country as part of an \u00ecaxis of evil\u00ee and making it a\npotential target for pre-emptive nuclear strikes, thereby\nmilitarily threatening our security, our country has\nbeen compelled to possess a self-defensive nuclear\ndeterrent as a means of safeguarding our national\ndignity and sovereignty. In circumstances in which the\nUnited States, the sole world super-Power, is looking\ndown on us and threatening to use nuclear weapons,\nthe Democratic People's Republic of Korea - a\ncountry with a small territory and population - has no\nalternative but to possess a strong and legitimate means\nof self-defence.\nAs we have clarified time and again, the ultimate\ngoal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea\nwith regard to the nuclear issue is the denuclearization\nof the Korean peninsula. The denuclearization of the\nKorean peninsula was called for by President Kim Il\nSung, the fatherly leader of our people. The 1992\nNorth-South Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization\nof the Korean Peninsula and the 1994 Agreed\nFramework between the Democratic People's Republic\nof Korea and the United States are manifestations of\nthe invariable political will of the Government of the\nRepublic to denuclearize the Korean peninsula by all\nmeans.\n28\n\nDuring the recent fourth round of six-party talks\nin Beijing, we approached discussions seriously and\nwith magnanimity and a principled, fair and above-\nboard position to achieve our consistent final goal of\nthe denuclearization of the Korean peninsula at any\ncost, thereby enabling the talks to come up with an\nagreement on the principles to that end as part of a\nbroad framework to overcome all challenges. The joint\nstatement issued at that meeting reflects our principled\nposition on the resolution of the nuclear issue. At the\nsame time, it also clearly specifies the obligations of\nthe United States and South Korea as the parties\nresponsible for the denuclearization of the entire\nKorean peninsula.\nAs we have clarified more than once, there will\nbe no need for the Democratic People's Republic of\nKorea to keep a single nuclear weapon if relations are\nnormalized between our country and the United States,\nbilateral confidence is built and the Democratic\nPeople's Republic of Korea is not exposed to the\nUnited States nuclear threat any longer. What is most\nessential at this stage is for the United States to provide\nlight-water reactors to the Democratic People's\nRepublic of Korea as soon as possible as evidence of\nthe former's substantial recognition of the latter's right\nto peaceful nuclear activities.\nWe shall watch closely how the United States acts\nin reality during the \u00ecaction for action\u00ee phase. Our\ncountry's Government will continue to be patient and\nto do its best to bring about the denuclearization of the\nKorean peninsula.\nIf the United Nations is to fulfil its mission to\nensure international peace and security and economic\nand social development, it should be reformed in\nconformity with the demands of the new century. That\nis the unanimous view of the international community.\nIn that regard, it is important that we take a\nmultilateral approach centred on the United Nations\nand in line with the purposes and principles of the\nCharter. To that end, efforts should be made to, inter\nalia, prevent unilateralism and high-handedness\nleading to violations of the Charter and of international\nlaw, and to ensure that the functions and role of the\nUnited Nations in addressing major international issues\nremain pivotal.\nDisputes should be resolved peacefully, through\ndialogue and negotiation. The unilateral use of force\ncan never be justified in any case. Such actions as\nauthorizing specific countries to launch pre-emptive\nattacks on the pretext of preventing conflicts should\nnot be viewed as strengthening the collective security\nsystem of the United Nations and should therefore be\nrejected, as they are dangerous attempts to ignore both\nthe principles of non-interference in others' internal\naffairs, as well as respect for sovereignty, as stipulated\nin the Charter.\nSecondly, all important international issues\nshould be addressed fairly and reasonably, in the\ninterests of the overwhelming majority of Member\nStates. We should not allow them to be dominated or\ndealt with by the super-Power or by a few powerful\ncountries. In this context, we have been consistent in\nour insistence on the establishment of a system that\nmandates the General Assembly to review and endorse\nSecurity Council resolutions relating to sanctions and\nthe use of force that can affect international peace and\nsecurity.\nThe Security Council should be reformed on the\nbasis of the principle of ensuring the full representation\nof the non-aligned and developing countries, which\nmake up the overwhelming majority of Member States.\nWe should never tolerate the permanent membership of\nJapan, which refuses to liquidate its past crimes against\nother countries, distorting its history of aggression and\ndriving the regional situation towards confrontation.\nThe reform of the United Nations human rights\nmachinery should take place in accordance with the\ndemands of the majority of countries. In reforming the\nhuman rights machinery, the Organization should\nconsider its most pressing task and ultimate goal to be\nputting an end to infringement on national sovereignty,\nthe politicization of human rights and the application\nof double standards and selectivity, which are the most\nserious human rights violations at present. Like the\nreform of the Security Council, that reform effort\nshould be carried out on the basis of the principle of\nensuring the full representation of the non-aligned and\ndeveloping countries that make up the overwhelming\nmajority of the United Nations membership.\nIf that principle is ignored, the reform of the\nhuman rights machinery will remain just empty talk.\nWorse still, if the establishment of the Human Rights\nCouncil is aimed at legitimizing the high-handedness\nof a few countries on the pretext of human rights\nprotection, the discussion itself will be completely\nmeaningless.\n29\n\nThe Government of the Democratic People's\nRepublic of Korea will continue to make an active\ncontribution to the efforts of Member States to build a\nnew, peaceful and prosperous world by further\nstrengthening its friendly and cooperative relations\nwith all countries that respect our national sovereignty\nin accordance with the ideal of independence, peace\nand friendship."

        "file_text": "Let me begin by\ncongratulating President Jan Eliasson on his election.\nAllow me to assure him of Poland\u2019s readiness to\nsupport him in his efforts during this session. I would\nalso like to join the European Union presidency \u2014 to\nwhose statement we fully adhere \u2014 in expressing my\nwords of gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping for\nhis leadership during the preparations for the sixtieth\nanniversary summit.\nThis year in Poland we are commemorating the\ntwentieth anniversary of the Solidarity movement. In\nthe history of Europe since the Second World War,\nthere have been few events that can be celebrated with\na similar sense of pride and satisfaction. The history of\nSolidarity \u2014 and in particular its rebirth in 1989 \u2014\nopened the way to profound historic changes in Europe\nand the entire world, including the fall of the Berlin\nWall and the collapse of the Communist bloc. I hope\nand believe that Solidarity\u2019s message still remains an\ninspiration not only for Poland, but also for the entire\nworld \u2014 wherever there are people who uphold or\naspire to freedom and solidarity. In that spirit, I would\nlike to repeat our call to celebrate 31 August as a world\nday of freedom and solidarity. In our opinion, global\nsolidarity should be the central value in and the key\ntool for achieving a new sense of community and\nrealizing our common interests.\nPoland\u2019s dedication to the concept of solidarity\nalso draws strength from the fact that Poland itself\nbenefited from foreign aid and support. Today, we are\nundergoing an important transition in our status: from\naid recipient to donor. We hope that Poland\u2019s active\ncooperation for development will serve as a catalyst for\nfurther change and help lay the foundation for\ndemocracy, sustainable development, human rights and\nthe rule of law.\nFor us, however, the concept of responsible\nsolidarity is not solely limited to humanitarian\nendeavours; it means more than assisting the poor and\nunderdeveloped. Solidarity is an operational principle,\nwhich generates cooperative attitudes among countries\nin need, including those plagued by terrorism, natural\nand manmade disasters, weak State structures and other\ncalamities. Solidarity means rescue rather than relief,\nremedy rather than alleviation. It should be driven by\nneed \u2014 not by right \u2014 and cut across dividing lines. It\nis solidarity that can help to bridge religious and\nideological divides and overcome the difficult legacy\nof the past. Indeed, if we want to build a world without\ndivisions we must first suppress all disputes that feed\non past grievances. We have to find a way to reconcile\ndivergent points of view without sacrificing our\nprinciples.\nThe recently concluded High-level Plenary\nMeeting was a product of enormous efforts to forge a\nnew global consensus on development, security, human\nrights and United Nations institutional reform. The\nagenda of the summit was long and ambitious. The\npreparatory process, as well as the summit itself,\noffered many insights, ideas and useful\nrecommendations that merit further serious\nconsideration. However, despite the great\ndetermination and expectations, we failed to achieve\nunity in confronting all of the world\u2019s most menacing\nproblems.\nThe United Nations is a ponderous institution and\ndoes not embrace change easily. Thus, we should not\nexpect that each and every summit will provide us with\nrevolutionary changes. Real breakthroughs are usually\nthe result of a lengthy process. Consequently, our\noutcome document should be regarded not as the end\nof reform, but as a guide for the further practical steps\nthat need to be taken. In that context, I call on\nMembers to devise a plan to implement our summit\ndecisions and to submit it to the General Assembly for\nadoption. This time, we must break the vicious circle\nof inaction and ensure a proper follow-up to the\nsummit. Finding workable forms and mechanisms for\ncooperation has never proved easy and will remain a\nserious challenge for the months ahead.\nThe United Nations operates in a constantly\nchanging international environment. We have already\nidentified major new threats, risks and challenges: the\nfanaticism of international terrorism, the proliferation\nof weapons of mass destruction, organized crime,\nStates in crisis and failed States. Although we claim to\nknow their nature, we will never be quite able to\npredict how, where and when those threats will\nmanifest themselves. At the same time, such threats\ncannot overshadow the importance of addressing their\nroot causes, such as development gaps, poverty, social\nexclusion, natural disasters, discrimination and\nintolerance, among others.\n19\n\nWe are passing through a transitional stage with\nall its strains and stresses. International institutions and\nmechanisms \u2014 designed to serve the old international\nsystem \u2014 must face the challenge of reform and\naccommodation. The United Nations is not an\nexception. As a consequence, we have had to find ways\nand means to respond to the swiftly changing nature of\nsecurity threats and risks. Thus, the challenge remains\nthe same as for all of us: how do we manage that\nchange?\nIn this era of globalization and rapid change, no\ncountry alone can fully ensure its own security. State\nsecurity is more than ever before dependent on external\ndeterminants. What we need is an innovative and\nimaginative approach to security, both in the realm of\nstrategy and in its constituent processes. Moreover, we\nhave to develop a new security paradigm according to\nwhich the security of individuals is as important as the\nsecurity of States.\nLikewise, we need a new concept of sovereignty\nthat attaches greater importance to protecting the rights\nof people than to the prerogatives of State power. We\nmust place the human being at the centre of the\nactivities of international institutions.\nIt is true that the first duty of a Government\nshould be to protect those living within its jurisdiction\nfrom genocide, mass killing and human rights\nviolations. However, in certain instances, the\nresponsibility of the international community to take\naction must be ensured.\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\nis a longstanding problem that has afflicted the\ninternational community for many years. However, in\nthe light of the particularly threatening nexus of\nterrorism and weapons of mass destruction, it has taken\non a new dimension. No State is immune to it or is\nprotected from its consequences. At the same time,\nexisting systems of national control and international\nnon-proliferation agreements are not completely\neffective and are undermined by loopholes and lacunae\nwhich enable States and individuals to bypass the\nregime. It is all the more disappointing, therefore, that\nthe United Nations summit failed to reach an outcome\non non-proliferation and disarmament.\nTo address that challenge adequately, we have to\nstrengthen the three pillars of the nuclear-arms-control\nregime: non-proliferation, disarmament and the\npeaceful use of nuclear energy. We should, however,\nensure that it works in a harmonious and self-\nsustaining way.\nAnother issue is that of enforcement. Legal norms\nthat are not effectively enforced obviously do not serve\ntheir purpose. We have to seek ways and means to\nensure effective verification and to enforce respect for\nexisting non-proliferation and disarmament obligations.\nWe cannot count solely on persuasion and containment.\nMore fundamentally, we need a comprehensive\nreview of the existing negotiating machinery. With that\nin mind, two methods of action are possible. One\nwould be to establish a group of experts; the other \u2014\nperhaps a better solution \u2014 would be to request that a\nrespected international independent research centre \u2014\nsuch as, for example, the Stockholm International\nPeace Research Institute \u2014 prepare a report containing\nrecommendations on how to make existing United\nNations institutions and mechanisms more effective,\noperational and efficient.\nOur concerted efforts to strengthen the United\nNations will be doomed to failure if we continue to\nbelieve that only security issues matter. They certainly\ndo matter, but security is a much broader concept. It\ndoes not involve only the absence of hard or soft\nthreats. It is, above all, about the absence of threats to\nfundamental human values. Likewise, the eradication\nof poverty is essential not only to peace and\ndevelopment, but, first and foremost, to the\npreservation of human rights and standards. Ensuring\nsocial justice and reducing inequalities do not involve\nonly the allocation of scarce resources to guarantee\nsecurity; they also presuppose both human freedom and\nhuman dignity.\nIn that context, Poland welcomes the proposed\nchanges to the United Nations human rights machinery,\nespecially the decision to establish a Human Rights\nCouncil. We believe that such an organ would enable\nus to promote respect for human rights in a more\nefficient and responsible way.\nWe should also promote democracy through the\nUnited Nations in order to protect human rights and\nexpand democratic freedoms. No one can claim that\ndemocracies are free of contradictions and injustices.\nBut it is democracies that best serve to defend the\nvalues we want to protect and promote.\nIn that spirit, on behalf of the citizens of Poland, I\nwould like to reiterate our sincere and strong support\n20\n\nfor the Democracy Fund, established to assist countries\nin their transition to democracy. I truly believe that this\nnew mechanism will help to address differences among\nand within societies in a spirit of true respect and\nunderstanding.\nPoland\u2019s commitment to the community of shared\nvalues does not mean that we disregard the institutional\nand technical aspects of reform. Institutional\nadaptation should be characterized by openness,\ntransparency and effectiveness. These are precisely the\nprinciples that have guided us in the process of\nanalysing Security Council reform and establishing the\nPeacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights\nCouncil.\nReform of the Security Council is proving to be\nan enormously complex and divisive issue. Although\nnecessary, it should not be conducted at the cost of\ncompromising the Council\u2019s capacity to meet its\nCharter responsibilities. The Republic of Poland\nbelieves that the effectiveness and efficiency of the\nSecurity Council rests on the assumption that\nmembership not only grants additional privileges but\nalso increases responsibilities.\nFurthermore, Poland fully recognizes the\nimportance of the ongoing process carried out by the\nSecretary-General, which is aimed at enhancing\neffective management of the Organization. We strongly\nencourage continuing such efforts to strengthen United\nNations accountability and its oversight mechanisms as\nwell as to promote the efficient use of its human\nresources. System-wide coherence, particularly\nregarding operational capabilities and humanitarian\nassistance, should be high on the reform agenda. We\nhope that such an approach will enhance the\nOrganization\u2019s capacity to carry out its new tasks and\nmeet its new challenges, thus enhancing the authority\nof the United Nations and its role in the international\nsystem.\nPoland\u2019s commitments in the framework of the\nUnited Nations are not made based on tactical\nconsiderations. We are not calculating what we can\ngain from this or that choice. We do not expect to make\npolitical profits or economic gains. But we share a\nsense of solidarity and responsibility with respect not\nonly to our own country but also to the entire\ninternational community.\nA system based on values and principles may not\nbe perfect, but it is likely to be more peaceful and, in\nthe long run, more conducive and responsive to the\nneeds of peoples. In that spirit, I hope that this\nanniversary session will provide a strong impetus to\nrebuild the community of shared values and enable us\nto replace the global psychology of competition with a\nspirit of cooperation."

        "file_text": "I extend to you, Sir,\nour warmest congratulations as you assume the high\noffice of the President of the General Assembly at its\nsixtieth session. We wish you all the best and assure\nyou of Sri Lanka\u00eds support and cooperation in your\nwork. I convey gratitude to Mr. Jean Ping for his astute\nleadership of the fifty-ninth session.\nThis sixtieth landmark session of the General\nAssembly is doubly significant for Sri Lanka, as this\nyear we mark the fiftieth anniversary of our\nmembership in the United Nations. As a small nation\nthat has kept the flame of democracy burning through\nmany tribulations, we take modest pride in the fact that\nwhat we said at the first session of the General\nAssembly we addressed can still be recalled with\nundiminished relevance. Prime Minister Bandaranaike,\nrepresenting Sri Lanka, said on that occasion:\n\\\"This is an Organization which expresses itself\nmost effectively by bringing to bear a certain\nmoral force - the collective moral force and\ndecency of human beings. That is a task in which\nthe weak as well as the strong can render a useful\nservice, and I give the Assembly the assurance,\non behalf of my country, that as far as we are\nconcerned, every endeavour that we can make in\nall sincerity to assist in the achievements of those\nnoble ideals for which this Organization stands\nwill always be forthcoming in the fullest\nmeasure.\\\" (Official Records of the General\nAssembly, Eleventh Session, Plenary Meetings,\n590th meeting, para. 42)\nFive decades on, I have the pleasure to say that\nmy country has kept that promise by regularly\ncontributing to consensus-building in the Organization\nin areas ranging from the law of the sea to\ndisarmament and from human rights to the issue of\nterrorism. We remain fully committed to the United\nNations.\nWe continue to believe that the collective moral\nforce of this Organization is indispensable for a secure,\npeaceful and humane world. We are convinced that\nsuch a world can be realized through the honest\ncommitment of every Member State to its individual\n2\n\nand collective responsibilities. Our peoples live in the\nhope and expectation that we shall deliver.\nOn the morning of 26 December 2004, Sri Lanka\nand several other countries around the Indian Ocean\nregion woke up to a natural disaster of unprecedented\nmagnitude. Towering tsunami waves struck two thirds\nof the coastal areas of our island nation, leaving in its\nwake death and destruction on a scale hitherto\nunknown by the world. Moved by the enormous scale\nof that calamity, Governments, the United Nations and\nother international organizations, civil society\norganizations and countless well-wishers across the\nworld rushed to help my country and its people to\nrecover, rehabilitate and rebuild. It was a magnificent\ngesture of human solidarity. Citizens of the world\nreached out beyond the confines of geopolitical and\nother man-made barriers in one magnificent gesture of\nhuman generosity. That rekindled in us new confidence\nin the power of peoples acting in unison across the\nworld to move Governments to act in the best interests\nof humankind for a new and better world.\nOn behalf of my people and my Government, I\nwish to convey my profound appreciation and gratitude\nto all those who assisted and sympathized with us and\ncontributed generously to rebuild our country. Let me\ntake this opportunity to extend a special word of thanks\nto President Clinton, the United Nations Special Envoy\nfor Tsunami Recovery, for his commitment and\nleadership in coordinating the ongoing international\neffort for sustainable recovery.\nJust as my country was in national distress in the\naftermath of the tsunami disaster, we are now in\ndistress in the face of an ominous renewal of terror on\nour soil. One month ago, my dear colleague Lakshman\nKadirgamar, the Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka, was\nassassinated by a calculated and barbaric act of\nterrorism. One more hero who fought relentlessly for\nfreedom and justice has been felled by the enemies of\npeace and unity. As Foreign Minister, the late\nMr. Kadirgamar argued powerfully and worked\ntirelessly against extremist racist ideologies that\nemploy violence to gain their divisive objectives. He\nwas bold enough to expose to the world the true face of\nterrorism inflicted upon my country. For 11 long years,\nfrom this very podium, Mr. Kadirgamar warned the\nAssembly about the threat posed by terrorism to the\ndemocratic way of life, not only in Sri Lanka but\nacross the world.\nFor over two decades, Sri Lanka has been under\nsustained assault by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil\nEelam (LTTE), an armed group that employs brutal\nmethods and suicide bombings in its campaign of terror\nto obtain a separate State. Disregarding the\nimplementation of the ceasefire agreement, that group\ncontinues to engage in numerous illegal and terrorist\nactivities. Those include the conscription of children as\nsoldiers - in callous disregard for promises given to\nmany, including the Special Representative of the\nSecretary-General on Children and Armed Conflict -\nand the assassination of democratic opponents, as part\nof their policy of eliminating Tamil political leaders\nand human rights activists, with disdain for all\ninternational law and practice and despite sustained\nefforts by my Government and Norwegian facilitators.\nI tend to doubt that the Security Council\u00eds recent\nidentification of that group in connection with child\nconscription would suffice to deter such activities.\nTargeted sanctions such as those proposed by\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan in his report to the\nSecurity Council should be imposed on those armed\ngroups that undermine national and international peace\nand violate human rights.\nI firmly believe that terrorism cannot be\neliminated through military suppression by State\nmachinery. The socio-economic and cultural roots of a\nconflict must be sought and effectively redressed. We\nrecognize that a lasting solution to ethnic issues and to\nterrorism in my country, or anywhere else, can only be\nfound through negotiation and dialogue. Accordingly,\nmy Government was the first, in 1994, to offer a\nnegotiated settlement in place of an armed conflict, as\nwell as an extensive devolution of power instead of a\nseparate State. In February 2002, the Government\nentered into a ceasefire agreement with the rebel group\nand began talks, with the facilitation of the\nGovernment of Norway.\nHowever, two and a half years ago, the LTTE\nwalked away from the peace talks for the sixth time in\n18 years. All efforts to have the talks renewed have so\nfar failed. As a measure of good will after the tsunami\ndisaster struck us, I agreed to an arrangement with the\nrebels for joint action in tsunami reconstruction work.\nThat was yet another measure in a long series of efforts\nto engage and work with the rebels, particularly in\nhumanitarian ventures, despite their obdurate\ninsistence to remain armed and remain uncontested by\nany other democratic Tamil political party.\n3\n\nMy Government has reaffirmed its commitment\nto the ceasefire and the peace talks. We continue to do\nall that is required by a democratic Government to\nensure that we do not return to armed conflict,\nfulfilling the wishes of all our people.\nA peace process cannot, and does not, operate in\na vacuum. People demand that a process of peace\nshould include the commitment and good conduct of\nall parties to a conflict. When a belligerent group - a\nnon-State actor - exploits the unique position offered\nto it by a peace process to utilize the freedom\nguaranteed under a democratic system of governance to\nstrengthen itself through infiltration and the coercion\nof civilians, organizations and political parties, that\nimpinges seriously on the ability of an elected\nGovernment to move forward effectively in its efforts\nat reconciliation and peace.\nThe restoration of democracy, the creation of\nspace for dissent and the promotion of human rights in\nthe affected areas in the north and the east of our\ncountry are now essential prerequisites for a successful\nand meaningful peace process in Sri Lanka. A lasting\npolitical solution can come to fruition only when the\nrebel group becomes a democratic civilian\norganization. That deserves the fullest support of the\ninternational community.\nAs we have been for many long years, Sri Lanka\nremains firmly committed to the global endeavour to\nfight terrorism in all its aspects. No cause justifies the\nindiscriminate unleashing of terror upon the innocent.\nSri Lanka has accordingly signed and ratified all\nUnited Nations conventions aimed at combating\nterrorism. We earnestly hope that at this session it will\nbe possible to conclude work on the comprehensive\nconvention on international terrorism, in order to\ncomplete and strengthen the international legal\nframework to combat terrorism through collective\nmeasures. Sri Lanka will continue to provide its\ncontribution to facilitate a consensus in its capacity as\nChair of the United Nations Ad Hoc Committee on this\nsubject.\nSri Lanka has pledged to meet the United Nations\nMillennium Development Goals by the year 2015. We\nhave already achieved the targeted goals in primary\neducation and in infant and maternal mortality. We are\ncommitted to further promoting the political and\neconomic empowerment of women so that gender\nequality becomes a matter of human rights and social\njustice.\nOur National Child Protection Authority\nimplements many programmes to eliminate abuse and\nviolence against children and to ensure their protection\nas well as their right to freely enjoy life's most\nprecious gift, childhood. Our success is due to the\noutcome of sustained efforts in policy planning and\nimplementation.\nThose benchmarks and other indicators\nmanifesting the high physical quality of life enjoyed by\nour people will be further elevated as we strive to meet\nthe Millennium Development Goals by 2015. However,\npoverty remains a major challenge for us. To eradicate\nthis scourge, we are now taking further steps through\nthe adoption of economic and social programmes, in\ncooperation with our bilateral and multilateral\ndevelopment partners.\nIf we look at the current world health situation,\nalthough smallpox has been eradicated and polio is on\nthe verge of being eliminated, there are other\ndiseases \u00f3 often associated with poverty - that\ncontinue to take a heavy human toll, especially in\ndeveloping countries. Every year, 6 million children\ndie from malnutrition before their fifth birthday. More\nthan 50 per cent of people in Africa suffer from water-\nrelated diseases such as cholera. HIV/AIDS kills 6,000\npeople every day. Each year, more than 300 million\npeople are infected with malaria. New challenges, such\nas severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian\ninfluenza, indicate that national borders offer little\nprotection against such proliferating pandemics. In the\nface of unparalleled advances, both in technology and\nin human mobility, it is unconscionable to let some in\nour nations suffer from diseases that can be controlled,\nif not eliminated.\nIn my view, there are three evils plaguing our\nworld today that can have no place in the modern\nglobalizing era of the twenty-first century: poverty,\ndisease and terrorism. Today, these evils affect the\nsocial, cultural and economic well-being of a majority\nof humankind. No country can deal with them on its\nown. International cooperation is in our self-interest\nand needs to be mustered. We share the strong belief\nthat the United Nations, on the occasion of its sixtieth\nanniversary, should seriously undertake comprehensive\nreforms so that the Organization is fully equipped to\n4\n\nmeet new challenges, taking into account the current\nglobal realities.\nWe acknowledge with appreciation the valuable\ncontribution made by the Secretary-General and his\nteam to the ongoing reform process, which made\npossible the adoption of the outcome document\n(resolution 60/1) at the recent summit of the\nOrganization. We urge all Member States to work\ntogether to build on that framework in order to\noperationalize what has been agreed and to work\nfurther on what remains to be achieved.\nRecovery after the tsunami disaster taught us the\nvalue and potential of humanity acting in unison when\nfellow human beings are in distress. We now hope that\nthe same human spirit and common interests will\ncontinue to prevail in addressing the socio-economic\nand security challenges we face. Let us resolve to\ncommit ourselves collectively, on this solemn occasion\nof the sixtieth anniversary of the Organization, to act\ntogether in the interest of humankind in order that we\nmay strive to eliminate the three scourges of poverty,\ndisease and terrorism."

        "file_text": "I\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, most warmly on the\noccasion of your election to this important post. The\ntireless support of Bulgaria for your mission will be\namong the most active, and I would like to express the\nprofound gratitude of my country to your predecessor,\nMr. Jean Ping, for his remarkable work and his real\ncourage.\nFollowing the best traditions in Bulgarian foreign\npolicy, the new Bulgarian Government is deeply\nattached to the principle of multilateralism in\ninternational relations, and thus believes in the central\nnature of the United Nations as the only\nintergovernmental organization that is completely\nuniversal and extremely representative of the peoples\nof the world. Bulgaria is participating in the sixtieth\nsession of the General Assembly as a country that has\nsigned the Treaty of Accession to the European Union\nand acts with the status of active observer in the bodies\nand institutions of the European Union. My country\nhas unreservedly supported the positions of the\nEuropean Union during the preparatory work for the\nsummit that has just taken place, and we fully support\nthe analysis of the outcome document made by the\nUnited Kingdom presidency.\nThe main purpose of this debate is to implement\nthe decisions of the summit. I hope that each Member\nState will help to push forward reform in the United\nNations, as set out in the outcome document\n(resolution 60/1). Substantial progress has been made\nin many key areas, and this is a good basis for the work\nof the sixtieth session. However, we are obliged to note\nwith regret that some of the ambitious and innovative\nideas in the report of the Secretary-General, \u201cIn larger\nfreedom\u201d (A/59/2005), welcomed and endorsed by\nBulgaria, could not be adopted. We need to redouble\nour efforts so that these ideas can come to pass.\nBulgaria supports the efforts of Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan in this respect and expresses the hope that his\nvaluable contribution will continue.\nIn parallel with the sixtieth anniversary of the\ncreation of the United Nations, my country is also\ncelebrating the fiftieth anniversary of its membership\nin the United Nations family. Over the last 50 years,\nthe challenges facing humanity have increased in\ncomplexity and diversity, and the threats facing us tend\nto interweave and compound each other in a manner\nnever seen before. However, just as 50 years ago, it is\nthe human being who is at the centre of our attention as\nthe supreme value, the human being with his individual\nsecurity and his right to a life of dignity and happiness.\nThe summit that has just concluded in New York\nhas revived hope that the struggle to eradicate poverty,\nhunger and epidemics and to protect the environment\ncan be won. The condition is that we need to mobilize\nthe maximum amount of efforts and the maximum\nresources so that we can implement a real global\npartnership between the developed and developing\ncountries. We support the European Union\u2019s position of\nincreasing official development assistance.\n22\n\nAs a candidate for membership in the Economic\nand Social Council for 2007 to 2009, Bulgaria has\ndecided to make its contribution to activities of the\nUnited Nations in the social and economic areas.\nThe summit outcome document defines\nHIV/AIDS as being one of the greatest threats to\nhumanity. Efforts of the entire international community\nare required in order to counter it. Children and young\npeople are the most affected. The case of the Libyan\nchildren, contaminated with the HIV/AIDS virus in a\nhospital, is a tragedy deserving our compassion and our\nsupport. Bulgaria welcomes the adoption of\nappropriate measures to avoid such tragedies in the\nfuture. It will participate actively in the European\nUnion\u2019s plan of action, which it has just published,\naimed at limiting the consequences of the epidemic of\nHIV/AIDS in Libya.\nMy country supports the emergence of a new\nconsensus in the United Nations relating to the chief\nthreats to international peace and security and\ncollective action against such threats. Bulgaria\ncategorically condemns terrorism in all of its forms and\nmanifestations. No cause can justify violence against\ninnocent people. The United Nations has a leading and\nirreplaceable role in creating a global environment of\nintolerance and rejection of terrorism.\nFor that reason, my delegation will support\nunconditionally the adoption during the sixtieth session\nof an anti-terrorist strategy. It is in the context of this\nstrategy that we should seek lasting and long-term\nsolutions to the political, economic and social causes\nfuelling this phenomenon. Bulgaria also insists that a\ncommon definition of terrorism be developed, making\nit possible to adopt a convention on international\nterrorism. It is clear that in order to combat terrorism\neffectively we need to neutralize all ideologies\nadvocating terrorism. In that respect, we actively\nsupport initiatives that facilitate coexistence and\ndialogue between different civilizations, religions,\nethnic groups and cultures.\nBulgaria profoundly regrets that the problem of\nthe non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\nwas not included in the summit outcome document,\nand we associate ourselves with the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s appeal to continue efforts in this priority area\nfor our collective security.\nBulgaria has wholeheartedly supported the idea\nof creating a Peacebuilding Commission since its\ninception. The creation of this body is one of the most\nimportant decisions of the summit. Allowing the\nCommission to begin its work as soon as possible will\ngreatly increase the ability of the United Nations to\nconsolidate the positive effects of peacekeeping\noperations. In each specific case, the Peacebuilding\nCommission cannot but benefit from the contribution\nfrom neighbouring countries and also from interested\nregional organizations.\nAs a country in South-Eastern Europe, Bulgaria\nhas been working tirelessly over the last few decades\nfor the transformation of the potential for conflict in\nthe Western Balkans into good-neighbourliness,\ncooperation and development. We are convinced that\nstability and prosperity in this region are ultimately\nindissolubly linked with the European perspective for\nthe Western Balkans. The risks of military\nconfrontation are decreasing, and what we have seen\nrecently is the emergence of new forms of cooperation\nbetween States with the consolidation of democratic\ninstitutions, civil societies and rule of law in the\ncommon fight against organized crime and corruption.\nFor my country such forms of cooperation are a\npriority also as regards the States of the region of the\nBlack Sea, the Caspian Sea and Central Asia.\nThe international community is on the threshold\nof a crucial decision for the future of Kosovo. The\nsituation there is an example of a long and sometimes\npainful post-conflict settlement with the leadership of\nthe United Nations, and in partnership with the\nEuropean Union, NATO and the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe. Reaching a just\nand lasting solution cannot ignore European norms and\nvalues. It must guarantee the rights of all of the\ninhabitants of the region without distinction as to their\nethnic origin, their religious beliefs and language. This\nsolution must be based on a respect of the territorial\nintegrity of neighbouring countries and must contribute\nto regional security and stability. For Bulgaria the\nfuture of Kosovo lies in a unified Europe, and this can\nbe achieved solely through the implementation of\nstandards established by the Security Council.\nBulgaria supports the efforts of the Government\nand the people of Iraq on the difficult road to peace,\nsecurity and economic recovery. The conclusion of the\nconstitutional process provided for by Security Council\nresolution 1546 (2004) is the sole means of achieving\nthis. We have no doubt that the adoption of the new\nIraqi constitution will make it possible to overcome\n23\n\nexisting divisions and will be a cornerstone for\nconstructing an Iraqi State that is unified, democratic\nand guarantees the rule of law. For its part, Bulgaria\nwill continue to give its support to the Iraqi people in\ntheir efforts to build a democratic, completely\nindependent future.\nMr. Zarif (Islamic Republic of Iran), Vice-\nPresident, took the Chair.\nMy country welcomes the positive trends that\nhave been emerging in the process of consolidating the\nAfghan State, which the recent parliamentary elections\nhave strikingly confirmed. Bulgaria will continue its\ncontribution to the efforts of the international\ncommunity to stabilize Afghanistan. We are continuing\nour assistance to the Afghan army.\nWe agree with those who highlight the need to\nfocus the attention of the international community on\nAfrica. There is no doubt that a priority for the United\nNations must be the settlement of regional and local\nconflicts on this continent, combating poverty, and the\ntransition to sustainable development. The role of the\nAfrican Union here is irreplaceable.\nFor Bulgaria the protection and the promotion of\nhuman rights are priorities of the United Nations, as\nare the problems of development and security. We\nwelcome the decision taken by the summit to create a\nHuman Rights Council. In our view this Council\nshould sit permanently and be elected directly by the\nGeneral Assembly with a set majority. Its status should\nbe higher than that of the existing Commission on\nHuman Rights. The role of this new body would be to\ndevelop and improve the current practices of the\nCommission, particularly by regularly reviewing the\nstate of human rights in all countries of the world while\nbeing ready to react in cases of grave and serious\nviolations of human rights. In this respect Bulgaria\nrepeats its support for the Democracy Fund, which\ncould encourage the democratic process in countries\nthat need it and that wish to be helped in this area. My\ncountry is now evaluating its national contribution to\nthis Fund.\nOver the last few days in this Hall we have had a\ndiscussion on the protection of human rights\nworldwide. In this respect I cannot but mention a case\nthat is of particular concern for Bulgarian public\nopinion. This involves the destiny of the five Bulgarian\nnurses and one Palestinian doctor condemned to death\nby a Libyan court in Benghazi. The innocence of the\naccused has been categorically confirmed by leading\nscientists in the field of HIV/AIDS. Bulgaria still\ninsists that a just and fair decision be taken by the\nSupreme Court of Libya on 15 November.\nThe consensus that has emerged on the concept of\nthe \u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d during the negotiations\non the outcome document of the summit is a real\nbreakthrough. It makes possible joint action by all\nMembers of the United Nations in cases of genocide,\nethnic cleansing and other mass crimes against\nhumanity when national authorities refuse to act or are\nunable to protect their citizens.\nI am convinced that we are on the threshold of\nthe most important and boldest reforms of the United\nNations in its history. Only the collective will of all\nMember States can open the way to real change. The\nstakes are enormous: allow the United Nations to\nestablish its reputation as the universal world\nOrganization capable of proving once again its vitality\nin the face of the challenges of globalization."

        "file_text": "Let me begin, Sir,\nby paying tribute to your predecessor, Jean Ping, for\nhis extraordinary work \u2014 above all on the world\nsummit, but also throughout his year as President \u2014\nand by offering my congratulations to you on\nbeginning your year in office.\nI should also like to express, on behalf of the\nEuropean Union and all its member States, our deepest\nsympathy and solidarity to the people of the United\n27\n\nStates, particularly those in the Gulf states, in their\nhour of need.\nIn early July, my first duty in the presidency of\nthe European Union was to go to Srebrenica to mark\nthe tenth anniversary of the massacre there, the worst\nin Europe since the end of the Second World War.\nMore than 8,000 people, mainly Muslim, were taken\naway and killed as the international community just\nstood to one side. To be sure, we had shown the right\nconvictions in words, but shamefully, we had failed to\nact. The lesson of that massacre \u2014 and of the even\ngreater horror of Rwanda a year before \u2014 was that we\nall needed better means to turn our collective will into\ndecisive action. I think that we in the European Union\nhave learned in the intervening period. Today, the\nUnion is on the ground as a military, police or civilian\npresence in Bosnia, in Aceh, in Iraq, in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo and, with the African Union, in\nDarfur.\nI also think that the United Nations has learned\nthe lessons of the past decade. At the summit this\nweek, we agreed on the further steps that we need to\ntake for the Organization to be even more effective. Of\nall that was agreed at the summit, I believe it will be\nthe agreement on our \u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d that\nwill be seen in the future as having the greatest\nsignificance of all. If we follow through on the\nresponsibility to protect, then never again will\ngenocide, ethnic cleansing and crimes against\nhumanity be allowed to take place under our noses\nwith nothing done.\nThe responsibility to protect is, of course, a\nreflection of our common morality. But it is also a\nrecognition that the world in which we now live is too\nsmall for us to be unaffected by, or indifferent to, the\ninnocent victims of murder and oppression. This\nshrinking of the world has been as sudden as it has\nbeen profound. When the Berlin wall fell, a generation\nof ideological certainties was swept away. People could\nsuddenly see partners where before they had only\nglimpsed adversaries. And as that very visible barrier\nwas noisily being breached, a revolution in information\ntechnology was quietly erasing the barriers of distance\nand time. Continents and cultures are now cabled\ntogether and bound by trade and services in a way that\nwas unimaginable even a decade ago.\nIn this new world, we can no longer safely\ntolerate the general threat that can come from a\nparticular human tragedy, wherever it takes place. To a\ngreater extent than ever before, we share the same\nworld: the same threats and responsibilities, the same\nopportunities and interests. And precisely because the\nboundaries of our world have contracted, the\nhorizons \u2014 the ambitions \u2014 of many people around\nthe globe have infinitely expanded. For the first time in\nour history, mankind has the ability to realize the\npotential of individuals in societies of all kinds and in\nevery region through an open exchange of goods,\ninvestment, technology and, above all, ideas.\nNot least in all of this, it is the rise of India and\nof China that is reordering the world economy.\nHundreds of millions there and elsewhere have been\nlifted out of poverty. A new global market has been\ncreated that ignores the divide \u2014 which seemed so\nfundamental for so many decades \u2014 between East and\nWest.\nCurrently, not everyone has the chance to share in\nall of that. Much of sub-Saharan Africa remains\nblighted by poverty, disease and conflict. The\nEuropean Union has now set a clear timetable to\nachieve the 0.7 per cent target for aid. Debt relief, trade\nreform and development aid are all vital, but none of\nthem can work alone. Fundamental to making poverty\nhistory are the Governments of the developing world\nthemselves. And where Governments fail, their own\npeoples are the victims, as United Nations Special\nEnvoy Anna Tibaijuka\u2019s damning assessment of the\nsituation in Zimbabwe only too graphically shows.\nSub-Saharan Africa is not alone in having yet to\nachieve its potential. The American author Thomas\nFriedman, in his recent book The World Is Flat,\nhighlights an extraordinary anomaly: it was the Arab\npeoples whose forebears devised algebra and the\nalgorithms upon which our entire digital age is based,\nbut those peoples are now right at the rear of today\u2019s\ntechnological revolution, with, for example, fewer than\n2 per cent of those populations having Internet access.\nThree United Nations Development Programme Arab\nHuman Development Reports have now set out clearly\nhow limited economic prospects and stunted political\nfreedoms have led young and talented people towards\nalienation and disillusionment.\nThe answer, however, does not lie in easy\nstereotypes about some clash of civilizations. It is only\nthe terrorists and the preachers of hate who want us to\nbelieve that Islam and the West are fundamentally\n28\n\ndifferent. Theirs is a philosophy of mistrust and\ndespair, and we reject it utterly. Indonesia and\nTurkey \u2014 to name just two \u2014 are both striking\nexamples of how countries with predominantly Muslim\npopulations can embrace democracy and modernity.\nWe in the European Union have seen the vibrant\nMuslim communities in our own countries, and from\nthat experience have seen how Islamic and Western\ncultures can be partners in a global society.\nEveryone knows that the Arab peoples want\nprosperity, freedom and democracy every bit as much\nas anyone in Europe or America. So the fact that the\nArab world has the lowest scores in regional\nmeasurements of democratic practices, civil freedoms\nand good governance is not some cultural inevitability,\nbut a temporary failure of human will. In that regard,\nthe international community has a clear responsibility\nto encourage regionally led political, social and\neconomic reform. The European Union strongly\nsupports such reform and will continue to do so.\nEqually, it has been our active foreign policy that has\nplaced us in the lead with regard to Iran, especially on\nthe nuclear dossier.\nWith our High Representative Javier Solana and\nmy French and German Foreign Minister colleagues,\nwe have made detailed proposals for the relationship\nbetween the European Union and Iran to be based on\ncooperation and respect for international norms and\ntreaties.\nOur proposals envisage a high-level, long-term\npolitical and security framework between the European\nUnion and Iran, in which we would work together in\npolitical, economic, scientific and technological areas,\nincluding the civil nuclear field, in return for Iran\nproviding guarantees about its intentions and\ncapabilities concerning nuclear weapons. So, we will\nlisten very carefully to and reflect on this afternoon\u2019s\nspeech by the new President of the Islamic Republic of\nIran, Mr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\nOn Iraq, the European Union now has a\ncomprehensive programme of engagement and has put\nbehind it divisions over the military action two and a\nhalf years ago. We are supporting the goal of a\npeaceful, prosperous, democratic and stable nation.\nWe are also giving very active support to the\nQuartet\u2019s efforts to secure a just and lasting peace\nbetween Israel and the Palestinians, with two States\nliving side by side. We salute Prime Minister Sharon\u2019s\nbrave decision to withdraw from the Gaza Strip, and\nwe salute President Mahmoud Abbas\u2019s work to build\nthe first stage of an effective, viable State of Palestine.\nIn July, the European Union again suffered the\nhorror of a major terrorist atrocity. This time the target\nwas my country, the United Kingdom: its capital,\nLondon. But none of us is safe from the threat of terror.\nInternational terrorism requires an international\nresponse; otherwise, we all pay the price for each\nother\u2019s vulnerabilities. The ratification of a\ncomprehensive treaty on terrorism is, therefore, at the\nhighest priority.\nBut the threat from terrorists and the political\ninstability they bring is made worse by the easy\navailability of weapons in what has become an\nanarchic, unregulated international trade. These same\nweapons fuelled the killings in Rwanda and in Bosnia a\ndecade ago and are fuelling the conflicts in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and in Darfur today.\nWe already have international instruments to regulate\nchemical, biological and nuclear weapons. We in the\nEuropean Union have a comprehensive arms control\nregime. But I suggest to the General Assembly that the\ntime has now come for this Organization to embrace\nthe idea of an international arms trade treaty, which\nwould build on and strengthen existing initiatives.\nIt was in the killing fields of Europe, in two\nsuccessive wars, that the twin ideas of the United\nNations and of the European Union became imperative.\nToday, the European Union\u2019s commitment to the\nUnited Nations is profound; it has never been stronger.\nAnd it is reflected in what we give in voluntary\ndonations and to the regular budget and peacekeeping\noperations.\nThe fundamental purpose of the United Nations\nremains today what it was at its foundation: to remove\nthe scourge of war, to reaffirm the worth of the human\nperson and to promote social progress and better\nstandards of life. In this changed and changing world,\nit is the responsibility of us all to ensure that this\nOrganization has the powers and the resources to\nachieve all these aims."

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to preside over\nthe General Assembly at its sixtieth session. Given\nyour role at this critical moment, Guinea-Bissau, in its\ncapacity as a Vice-President at this session, will spare\nno effort in supporting you in your work.\nI also extend my warmest congratulations to your\npredecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, Minister of State and\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the sisterly Republic of\nGabon, on the commitment and skill he demonstrated\nduring his presidency of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-ninth session.\nI also congratulate the Secretary-General, Mr.\nKofi Annan, on his excellent work at the head of our\nOrganization to strengthen its credibility, promote\nessential international solidarity, and achieve consensus\non major issues relating to security, counter-terrorism,\ndevelopment and human rights.\nThe world awaits the dawn of a new order, which\nwill require a more realistic and democratic international\npolitical framework, global commitment, and the\ncollective will of all Member States to meet the\nchallenges facing humankind in the context of\nincreasing interdependence. We endorse the\nconclusions and recommendations contained in the\nSecretary-General's report, and I reiterate my country's\nreadiness to contribute to all global agreements that\nwill allow us to meet the current challenges of\ndevelopment, security, the fight against international\nterrorism, respect for human rights, and institutional\nreform of the United Nations, in particular that of the\nSecurity Council, where Africa should enjoy the\nlegitimate right to hold two permanent seats.\nTo carry out these reforms, it is important that\nthere be political will, based on the collective action of\nStates, which is the foundation of this international\nsystem. I cannot overemphasize the fact that\ncooperation which could lead to this collective action\nwill be possible only if the policies of our countries\ntake account of the needs of our own citizens, as well\nas the needs of others, because we are part of the same\nhuman family, forced to live together on this same\nplanet, and we have an obligation to share it and\nprotect it.\nIn this regard, I would express my concern vis-a-\nvis the phenomenon of globalization. We are aware of\nthe enormous potential and advantages of a well-\nmanaged globalization and all that it has to offer in the\neconomic, financial, commercial, technological and\ncommunication fields. However, it is equally\nimportant, at this stage of globalization, to recognize\nthat it has not been sufficiently inclusive. Exclusion\nand marginalization in international relations are the\nnegative effects of globalization. These are factors that\ncontribute to the existence and proliferation of conflicts\n- situations which require properly-coordinated, global\nresponses, as well as multilateral frameworks for\ndialogue, agreement and effective interaction.\nInter-State conflict, civil wars, organized crime,\nterrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction and the illicit trafficking in small arms and\nlight weapons are phenomena which threaten\ninternational security. But such threats are not limited\nsolely to these spheres. They also involve poverty,\npandemics and natural disasters affecting the planet.\nThe growing link between security and\ndevelopment is proof that the gesture of solidarity\ndesired with regard to financing for development of the\npoor is needed more than ever. This responsible and\n4\n\npositive attitude is one of the main pillars in our efforts\nto pursue the Millennium Development Goals, a\nchallenge which mankind cannot fail to meet. I hope\nthat there will be sufficient political will so that the\nnew partnership for development which we wish to see\nestablished among States in the very near future will\ndispel any doubts and fulfil the hopes raised during the\ninternationally-organized conferences within the\nframework of the United Nations in the economic,\nfinancial and social and related spheres.\nThe outcome document we have just adopted at\nthe conclusion of the recent High-level Plenary\nMeeting is still insufficient, but it is forward-looking.\nWe must underscore the fact that discussions,\nagreements and negotiations need to be pursued in a\ntransparent fashion in order to achieve desired results\nby all Member States.\nAfrica has rightfully been the recent subject of\nincreased attention on the part of the international\ncommunity. I am pleased to express our satisfaction at\nthe decision recently adopted at the Summit of the G-8\nregarding debt cancellation for some African countries,\nand the possibility of extending this measure to other\npoor countries, including my country, Guinea-Bissau.\nOn 1 October, Guinea-Bissau will continue and\nconclude the process of complete return to\nconstitutional normalcy through presidential elections.\nThe success of this political transitional period that\nbegan in September 2003 is the fruitful result of\nbalanced relations among institutions of the Republic,\nbased on the separation of powers and characterized by\ngood governance.\nWe must recognize that this has not always been\neasy, and quite often we have faced situations which go\nbeyond our national capacity to resolve. The\nframework for constant cooperation and agreement\nwith the international community has been an\nimportant instrument in following up the socio-\neconomic situation and the political internal process.\nWe wish to express our thanks to the Member States of\nthe Economic Community of West African States, the\nEuropean Union, the international community and\nPortuguese-speaking countries for contributing to the\npolitical transitional process in our country. Without\nthis support for Guinea-Bissau it would have been\ndifficult for us to face the numerous constraints during\nthe transitional phase.\nThe role played by the United Nations system -\nthe Economic and Social Council's ad hoc group and\nthe Group of Friends of Guinea-Bissau in particular -\ndeserves special mention and our most heartfelt thanks.\nThe support of the international community has\nbeen very important in the success of the transitional\nperiod in Guinea-Bissau. However, more decisive\naction is required to meet the challenges of\nreconstruction and the rebuilding of the infrastructure\nin my country, to improve the economy and create\nminimal conditions for governability and to strengthen\nthe foundation of a democratic State, which we wish to\nsee in Guinea-Bissau. These factors are essential for\npeace and for political and social stability.\nOnce again, I would call from this rostrum for the\nsupport of the international community in the\nNovember Donor Round-Table Conference with\npartners in peace for development in order to adopt\ntogether a document on the national strategy to reduce\npoverty. This goal is in line with the concerns of the\nUnited Nations aimed at more effective assistance to\ncountries in post-conflict situations, contained in the\nproposal to create a Peacebuilding Commission, which\nwe fully support.\nWe recognize respect for the rules of democracy,\nfor human rights and good economic and financial\ngovernance. We feel that they are the foundation for\nthe rule of law. We reaffirm the commitment of my\nGovernment, in strict compliance with our constitution,\nto work in close cooperation with all institutions of the\nRepublic to create conditions aimed at promoting\nnational reconciliation, peace and domestic political\nstability, to consolidate our relations of friendship,\nbrotherhood and solidarity with our neighbours and to\nrestore a climate of trust, credibility and effective,\nlasting partnership with the entire international\ncommunity for socio-economic development in our\ncountry."

        "file_text": "May I begin by extending my congratulations on your\nelection as the President of the General Assembly at its\nsixtieth session. I am confident that under your\nguidance this session will achieve fruitful results. I also\nwish to take this opportunity to express my sincere\nrespects to Mr. Jean Ping, President at the previous\nsession, and to the Secretary-General.\nThis year marks the sixtieth anniversary of the\nend of the world war against fascism and the founding\nof the United Nations. Just a few days ago in this Hall,\nworld leaders solemnly adopted the outcome document\nof the High-level Plenary Meeting (resolution 60/1).\nNow, it falls to us to fulfil the important and pressing\ntask of working towards a harmonious world of lasting\npeace and common prosperity by translating that\ndocument into action and turning fine words into\nreality. This session should serve to promote peace,\nharmony and common development.\nWe want peaceful development. Progress of\nmankind needs a peaceful environment. Stability and\nsecurity of one country cannot be built on the\nturbulence or crisis of another. Only a new security\nconcept featuring mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality\nand coordination will enable us to develop in peace and\nsafeguard peace through development.\nWe want harmonious development. To build a\nbetter future is the long-cherished dream of mankind.\nAny development strategy should be guided by a long-\nterm and holistic perspective instead of immediate and\nsectoral benefits. Therefore, we should work together\nfor more democratic and law-based international\nrelations and a harmonious environment in which\ncountries respect one another, treat one another as\nequals, and in which different cultures can emulate and\ninterchange with each other.\n18\n\nWe want common development. No model of\ndevelopment that benefits only a few countries or a\nsmall group of people is acceptable or sustainable.\nCountries should cooperate with each other more\nclosely so that economic globalization may yield\nsuccessful results, benefit-sharing and common\nprosperity.\nThis session should serve to push forward\nreforms of the United Nations and strengthen its role.\nHaving weathered 60 years of vicissitudes, the United\nNations needs multifaceted and multidimensional\nreforms so as to be able to make a greater contribution\nto mankind\u2019s noble cause of peace and development.\nThe position of the United Nations as the core of\nthe world collective security mechanism must be\nstrengthened so that it can perform its duty of\nsafeguarding peace in a more effective way. China\nsupports the efforts to enhance the Organization\u2019s\ncapacity on conflict prevention, mediation and good\noffices. We also favour a greater role by the Secretary-\nGeneral in this respect and the fostering of a preventive\nculture.\nWe support the efforts to strengthen United\nNations peacekeeping operations, particularly with\nregard to rapid deployment capacity and strategic\npreparedness, as well as the capacity to fully mobilize\nregional organizations and their resources under the\nleadership of the Security Council.\nChina supports the establishment of a\nPeacebuilding Commission to more effectively\ncoordinate United Nations efforts in the areas of\npeacekeeping, post-conflict rehabilitation and\ndevelopment. In that respect, the Economic and Social\nCouncil and other development assistance agencies\nshould have an important role to play in the\nCommission.\nIt has been our consistent position to oppose the\nuse or threat of force in international relations. We do\nnot support the reinterpretation or revision of the\nprovisions in the Charter of the United Nations related\nto the right of self-defence. Should an occasion arise\nthat calls for the use of force, it is the Security Council\nthat should make sound judgements and take prudent\ndecisions as to the merits of the situation.\nThe international community should continue to\npress ahead with the international process on arms\ncontrol, disarmament and non-proliferation; safeguard\nand enhance the authority and effectiveness of existing\nmultilateral treaties; give full scope to the role of the\nUnited Nations and other international organizations in\nthe area of non-proliferation; and seek solutions to\nrelated issues by political and diplomatic means.\nThe United Nations should be able to cope more\neffectively with non-traditional security threats. We\nwelcome the comprehensive strategy on counter-\nterrorism proposed by the Secretary-General, and we\nhope to see the early conclusion of a comprehensive\nconvention on international terrorism, taking full\naccount of the concerns of various parties, particularly\ndeveloping countries.\nIn the effort to reduce and prevent large-scale\nhumanitarian crises, the international community\nshould strictly observe the United Nations Charter,\nrespect the opinions of the countries or organizations\nconcerned and, with the Security Council\u2019s\nauthorization, explore, to the greatest extent possible,\npeaceful settlement within the United Nations\nframework. We oppose any rash intervention carried\nout on the basis of the claim that a nation is unable or\nunwilling to protect its own citizens.\nDevelopment should be a main focus of United\nNations reform. Although China is a low-income\ndeveloping country, it is prepared to contribute as\nmuch as it can to international cooperation for\ndevelopment. As President Hu Jintao announced at the\nsummit, China will take substantive steps in five areas.\nWe will join hands with all Members to advance\nreforms in the area of development so as to facilitate\nthe resolution of development issues. The United\nNations should put in place a fair and rational\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) review\nframework to assess progress made in various\ncountries and to monitor follow-up of international\ncooperation and aid commitments. We support the\ncoordinating role of the Economic and Social Council\nin development-related areas.\nThe Doha Round should embody development in\nits focus, paying more attention and taking actions to\naddress the concerns of developing countries,\nparticularly with regard to agricultural produce and\nspecial and differential treatment. China has decided to\ngrant zero-tariff treatment to some commodities from\n39 least developed countries, which will cover the\nmajority of China\u2019s imports from those countries.\n19\n\nChina is in favour of incorporating the prevention\nand treatment of HIV/AIDS and the building of the\npublic health sector into the development programmes\nand activities of various countries and of the United\nNations. We will be submitting at the current session a\ndraft resolution on strengthening global capacity-\nbuilding in the area of public health. In the next three\nyears, we plan to provide more aid and medicine to\ndeveloping countries for preventing and treating\nmalaria and other communicable diseases and to help\nthem establish and reform their public health systems\nand train medical personnel.\nThe international community \u2014 particularly\ndeveloped countries \u2014 should take substantive steps to\nhelp developing countries break the vicious circle of\ndebt. Such steps include substantial debt reduction and\nthe streamlining of debt relief procedures and\nrequirements. In the next two years, China will write\noff or otherwise cancel the overdue portions, as of the\nend of 2004, of interest-free or low-interest\nGovernment loans owed by all heavily indebted poor\ncountries having diplomatic relations with China.\nWe call on the United Nations to give priority to\nhelping developing countries to strengthen their\ncapacity-building. China will help developing\ncountries train 30,000 people for various professions in\nthe next three years.\nMy country also favours setting a timetable for\ndeveloped countries to allocate 0.7 per cent of their\ngross national income to official development\nassistance. New fund-raising methods should be\nexplored so as to put more funds into development.\nChina pledges $10 billion in concessional loans\nto developing countries in the next three years within\nthe framework of South-South cooperation.\nThe Charter of the United Nations grants the\nSecurity Council the primary responsibility for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security. A\nhighly efficient, responsible and representative Council\nserves the long-term interests of the United Nations\nand the common interests of all its Member States.\nChina supports reform of the Security Council\naimed at strengthening its authority and efficiency and\nimproving its working methods. The representation of\ndeveloping countries, particularly African countries,\nshould be increased so that small and medium-sized\ncountries would have more say in the Council\u2019s\ndecision-making. No reform proposal can work that\naddresses only the concerns of a few countries,\ndisregarding the interests of the majority of countries,\nand treats developing countries in Africa and in other\nparts of the world unfairly.\nChina supports the principle of cooperation based\non democratic consultation. As reform will affect the\nfuture of the United Nations and the interests of\nvarious parties, there should be no artificial timeframes\nor attempts to force decisions through a vote. Instead,\nMember States should seek consensus through dialogue\nand consultation and in accordance with the principle\nof democratic international relations.\nChina embraces the spirit of unity and\ncooperation. The United Nations family has 191\nMembers. Unity is the source of strength. We want\nunity, not division. As long as Member States respect\none another\u2019s interests, accommodate one another\u2019s\nconcerns and show pragmatism and flexibility, we will\nbe able to find a reform path that is acceptable to all.\nThe current session should focus on Africa.\nAfrican countries make up a quarter of the United\nNations membership, and their populations account for\n13 per cent of the world\u2019s total population. If there is\nno stability in Africa, the world will have no peace. If\nAfrica remains poor, there will be no development for\nthe world. The outcome document of the summit calls\nfor efforts to meet the special needs of Africa. I believe\nthat that is correct and necessary.\nDespite the gratifying progress made in Africa in\nrecent years, conflicts in some of its regions have\npersisted. The Security Council should pay special\nattention to African problems and give them priority on\nits agenda. That means not only devoting more Council\nmeetings to African issues, but also, and more\nimportant, taking concrete actions to heed Africa\u2019s\nvoice, respect its views and accommodate its concerns.\nChina applauds the mediation and good offices of\nthe African Union and other regional organizations\naimed at conflict settlement in Africa. We support\nclose cooperation between the Security Council and\nthose organizations by providing them with funds,\nlogistics and technical assistance to strengthen their\npeacekeeping and post-conflict reconstruction\ncapacities.\nAfrican countries face difficulties in the area of\ndevelopment, particularly in attaining the MDGs. More\n20\n\nthan 300 million people are still living under the\npoverty line. One third of all children are\nmalnourished. More than 30 million people are\nsuffering from HIV/AIDS. With less than 2 per cent of\nthe world\u2019s economic aggregate, Africa is weighed\ndown by debts amounting to $300 billion. All of that\nposes a challenge to the conscience of mankind.\nThe international community should reach a\nglobal consensus on African development and help the\ncontinent to achieve the MDGs on schedule by\nimplementing the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s\nDevelopment. Those who provide assistance must do\nso in all sincerity and respect the right of African\ncountries to make their own decisions. Assistance must\nalso have a clear aim: to meet the basic and long-term\nneeds of the African people. Assistance is by no means\ncharity or a gift; it is a response to the call for mutual\nbenefit and common development. Furthermore, it is\nour moral duty to help the needy and redress injustices.\nIn the twentieth century, Africa shook off\ncolonial rule and achieved national liberation. That was\nan epoch-making event. The twenty-first century will\nbring peace and development to Africa \u2014 it is\nhistorically inevitable. The Chinese people will\ncontinue to stand beside their African brothers and\nsisters on that journey of historic significance.\nThe recently concluded Six-Party Talks in Beijing\non the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue have reached an\nimportant consensus and issued a joint declaration,\nmarking an important step forward in the Talks and a\ncrystallization of the political will and diligence of the\nparties concerned. It also reflects the common\naspiration of the international community. Because it\nwas so hard-won, this result needs to be especially\nprized. We hope that the parties will continue to work\ntogether to promote further progress in the Six-Party\nTalks, resolve the nuclear issue on the Peninsula\nthrough dialogue and by peaceful means, ensure lasting\npeace and stability in the region and realize its\ncommon goals for development and prosperity. The\nChinese Government will continue to make a positive\ncontribution in that regard."

        "file_text": "The people \nof Ecuador wish to express their deepest condolences \nand fraternal solidarity to the South-East Asian nations \naffected by the tsunami, as well as to all our brothers \nand sisters living in the southern United States who \nwere so severely affected by Hurricane Katrina. \n Faced with the danger of natural disasters, \nEcuador is committed to the implementation of the \nHyogo Framework for Action and to support the \nInternational El Ni\u00f1o Research Centre, based in \nGuayaquil. \n Today, the nations of the globe have come \ntogether to celebrate 60 years of human hopes, 60 years \nafter the proclamation of the founding Charter of the \nOrganization that represents every man, every woman, \nand every child. Six decades have passed since we \ninaugurated this institution and its essential objectives \nof human coexistence, peace and the international rule \nof law. After six decades we can rejoice with old \nNeruda, who lives on in our hearts, along with \nStravinsky, Garcia Marquez and Mother Teresa. Let us \ncelebrate, but let us also take stock of the dream yet to \nbe fulfilled. Sleeplessly, we face threats and challenges \nthat affect the survival of our species. When the second \nmillennium ended \u2014 quite unlike the first \u2014 our world \nwas not threatened by the terror-filled visions of the \napocalypse and the seven trumpets that would \ntransform a third of the world into blood, darkness, \nsmoke and locusts. However, our new millennium \nfaces the reality of increasing poverty in two thirds of \nthe planet. Water is becoming scarce, there are holes in \nthe ozone layer and, along with biodiversity, the \nAmazon is being destroyed. Entire nations are being \ndisinherited and condemned to roam the earth, mortal \nillnesses hover over humanity and terrorism lurks in \nevery corner. \n I have come from the middle of the world to \nspeak of faith in the renewal of the dream. Ecuador is a \nsmall nation in South America sharing an identity with \nalmost 400 million human beings living in an area of \n8 million square kilometres. We have more than one \nfourth of the fresh water of the world and immense \nenergy, mineral and food resources; we boast the \ngreatest tropical rain forest in the world and colossal \nmountains, deserts and prairies. Yet, our region remains \na realm of social injustice. \n  \n \n2 05-51226 \n \n The world order that governs us is not the one we \nwant. It is unjust, inefficient and inhuman. We must \ntherefore set in motion factors that were unimaginable \nin the middle of the twentieth century. The economy, \ninternational law and biology constitute a fundamental \ntriangle from which the future of the human being can \nbe projected. I set out for the Assembly the idea of \nbuilding a new world order based on this trilogy. \n First, with regard to international law, Ecuador \nreaffirms its commitment to the San Francisco Charter \nand the principles of non-intervention and the self-\ndetermination of peoples, the peaceful settlement of \ndisputes, and the rejection of all forms of colonialism, \ndiscrimination or segregation. In accordance with these \nprinciples my country believes in the need to \nstrengthen the Organization, transform it and \ndemocratize it. The United Nations must develop new \nmechanisms to protect the survival of our species and \nof all forms of life. \n Secondly, the economy must eliminate \nmarginalization and redress the unequal nature of \nopportunities, among both nations and individuals. \nThis is the conflict. In 1945, the vital need to establish \npolicies to promote a just and progressive distribution \nof surpluses was proclaimed. Nevertheless, 60 years \nlater we see ever more regressive patterns of \ndistribution and growing gaps at all levels, basically \nproduced by the tragedy inherent in the accumulation \nof foreign debt, which represents such a heavy burden \nfor developing nations. The burden of the debt has \npauperized our peoples. It has put a brake on \nproductive development and cancelled out the \naspiration of all to have access to food, health, shelter, \nsafety and education. The ethical mandate of our time \ndemands a change in the collective conscience of social \nwelfare. Heavily indebted middle-income countries \nmust organize their efforts to arrive at joint agreements \nwith the world\u2019s creditors. \n Thirdly, the incorporation of biology into the new \ninternational order obliges the United Nations to \ntransfer its focus from man to biology. The presence of \nthis new factor \u2014 biology \u2014 brings with it the need to \nraise the level of ethics and international law to the \nhighest degree of respect for biodiversity and the \npreservation of all forms of life. Ecuador attaches \nparticular importance to this topic and is therefore \nconcerned at the controversial spraying of glyphosate \nas a herbicide to eliminate illegal crops along border \nareas between Colombia and Ecuador. Studies on this \nsubstance suffer from technical and methodological \nshortcomings. Ecuador therefore calls upon the United \nNations system to promote a comprehensive, reliable \nand credible study on the actual impact of this \nspraying. Ecuador considers that it is essential to apply \nthe precautionary principle that has been recognized in \nmany international agreements and other instruments, \nin particular the Rio Declaration on Environment and \nDevelopment. Consequently, Ecuador has asked its \nneighbouring Government of Colombia to suspend \naerial-spraying activities in a 10-kilometre strip north \nof our border. \n As I said in my statement during the High-level \nPlenary Meeting (see A/60/PV.5), in my country\u2019s \nopinion the Millennium Development Goals constitute \na well-honed and effective tool for this century to carve \nout a path towards a more just humankind. I am firmly \nconvinced that ethical regulations to preserve the \nbiological heritage of the planet constitute the \nparamount goal for this third millennium. With \nconviction and resolve, my country has adopted a date \nfor its future: 2015. Copies of the reports on my \nGovernment endeavours to attain the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals are available in the General \nAssembly Hall. \n I should now like to talk about migrants. \nGlobalization is creating urgent demands for the new \ncentury. One of these arises from the pain that is giving \nrise to a new exodus. Today the United Nations must \ntake over the role of a new Moses. It must lead the \npeople to their homeland and provide the bread to calm \nthe hunger of the wretched of the world. More than 175 \nmillion human beings have been forced to leave their \nhomeland in search of better days. Today migrants are \ntreated worse than capital or commercial goods: we are \nalways looking to provide freedom of transit for these. \nThe mere existence of this fact forces us to recognize \nthat for the hungry of the third world there is no liberty \nand even less the equality and fraternity symbolized \ntwo centuries ago by the French revolution. The link \nbetween the migrant issue and development is \nundeniable and must be handled in a transparent \nmanner based on a vision of shared responsibility on \nthe part of all nations involved. \n On migration routes we must overcome the police \nstigmatization of the undocumented. Regularization \nrequires that the rights of migrants be viewed as a \nfundamental human right and must be reflected in \nevery State\u2019s population policy. The Government of \n \n \n05-51226 3 \n \nEcuador calls upon this forum to address the problem \nof migrants in terms of equality for all nationals. We \npropose that this problem be addressed at the high-\nlevel dialogue on international migration and \ndevelopment, to be held in 2006. \n We in the Government of Ecuador, aware of the \nneed for migration and its consequences to be treated \nin an integral and responsible manner, have approved a \nlaw revising our criminal code to define crimes of the \nsexual exploitation of minors and the trafficking of \npersons. In addition, we have placed before our \nNational Congress a new proposal to punish all forms \nof trafficking in human beings. \n I should like to talk about indigenous peoples and \npeoples of African descent. The International Decades \nof the World\u2019s Indigenous People, proclaimed by the \nGeneral Assembly, have been a valuable opportunity to \nincrease awareness of the situation of our brothers and \nto promote respect for their identity and the chance to \nfind viable solutions to their problems. The biology of \nthe new world order requires recognition of their rights \nas protagonists of history and as leading actors in \nsociety. In the Ecuador of the last decade, indigenous \npeoples have been significant components of our social \nand political life. That is recognized in our \nConstitution and in International Labour Organization \n(ILO) Agreement 169.  \n In recent years, Ecuador has witnessed a serious \ndeterioration in its democratic institutions. Faced with \nthat situation, my Government has pledged to restore \nthe rule of law by means of profound political reform \nlegitimized through a referendum of the Ecuadorian \npeople. We are determined to firmly fight the \ncorruption that erodes democratic structures. Only \nthree days ago, on 15 September, my Government \ndeposited its instrument of ratification as the thirtieth \nState party to the United Nations Convention against \nCorruption, which made it possible for the Convention \nto enter into force. \n The voice of my people, the people of Ecuador, \nechoes the deep-throated clamour of Latin America. \nWe want to be part of a greater nation, South America, \na human assembly that can make its voice heard and \nfollow the path to genuine, just development \naccompanied by greater solidarity on behalf of the \nprinciples that we have recalled here.

        "file_text": "Burkina Faso is delighted to see this\nimportant session of the General Assembly being\npresided over by an illustrious son of a great country,\nSweden, with which we have maintained exemplary\nand fruitful relations of friendship and cooperation for\nseveral decades.\nI hasten to assure the President of the full\ncooperation of my delegation. It is also my pleasure to\npay a tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, whose\ntalents as a seasoned and effective diplomat we have\nbeen able to appreciate throughout the fifty-ninth\nsession of the General Assembly.\nI would like to associate in this tribute the\nSecretary-General, a man of great vision, who has been\nthe architect of this new United Nations that we have\nso earnestly sought and who has had the courage to lay\nits foundations.\nThe current session will receive specific notice in\nthe annals of the United Nations. Apart from its\ncoinciding with both the midterm review of the\nMillennium Development Goals and the reform of the\nOrganization, this session is also being held at a\nwatershed in world history and international relations.\nIn Africa, despite the constant efforts of States\nand regional groupings, the persistence of numerous\nconflicts and hot spots continues to be a subject of\nmajor concern. I am thinking particularly of the\nsituation in the Great Lakes Region, Darfur, Somalia\nand C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. In the Middle East, the struggle for\nsurvival is the daily battle of the Palestinian people. It\nis our conviction that only the strict implementation of\nthe Road Map will make peace possible in that sorely\ntried region.\nThe numerous terrorist acts throughout the world\nclaim our attention and remind us of how vulnerable\nwe are in the face of terrorism. We must, henceforth,\nrealize that no strategy, no matter how energetic it\nmight be, will be able to wipe out this scourge, unless\nit attacks the underlying causes, which are injustice,\nexclusion, humiliation and poverty. It is quite obvious\nthat desperate behaviour stems from those sources.\nMore than ever, the quest for democracy, good\ngovernance and respect for human rights has become\npart and parcel of the daily behaviour of peoples and\nnations. It is this vision that makes it so necessary that\nunprecedented reform be carried out of the United\nNations, which, 60 years after its creation, is duty\nbound to take full account of the new challenges and\nnew problems that have arisen. In this connection, once\nagain we should welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s\nlucidity and farsightedness, whose report \u201cIn Larger\nFreedom\u201d (A/59/2005) gives us a thought-provoking\nframework, indicating that comprehensive and\nthorough reform is essential for our Organization.\nFurthermore, the African position on this reform,\nparticularly that relating to the Security Council, is\nnow well known. Burkina Faso is convinced that\njustice must be done to Africa and has fully joined the\nother members of the African Union to formulate a\ncommon platform that will make it possible for Africa\nto reclaim without hesitation its legitimate place in the\nessential United Nations decision-making bodies.\n7\n\nNevertheless, however committed and however\npassionate our debate is on the reform of the United\nNations, it is of paramount importance that we give\neven greater priority to the question of development.\nSpeaking of development, as is so aptly pointed\nout in the final document of the High-level Meeting\nthat we have just adopted, it is not so much promises\nand commitments that are lacking but rather their\ndiligent and consistent fulfilment, given the urgency\nand acuteness of the problems we face. Under these\ncircumstances, Burkina Faso willingly associates itself\nwith all activities that promote genuine international\nsolidarity.\nThat is why we have associated ourselves with\nPresident Lula da Silva\u2019s anti-hunger initiative. That is\nalso why we support President Jacques Chirac\u2019s\ninternational solidarity contribution initiative involving\nan airline ticket levy, which is aimed at helping to\nfinance the struggle against AIDS, tuberculosis and\nmalaria; Prime Minister Tony Blair\u2019s International\nFinance Facility; Qatar\u2019s Fund for Development and\nHumanitarian Assistance; and President George W.\nBush\u2019s Millennium Challenge Account, of which my\ncountry has just become a beneficiary.\nBurkina Faso also welcomes the G-8\u2019s recent\ndecision to cancel the multilateral debts of a number of\ndeveloping countries. We hope that additional\ncountries will be included on that list.\nThere can be no doubt that trade relations\nbetween industrialized and developing countries\ncontinue to be marred by inequality \u2014 even inequity. It\nis therefore essential to recall the need to respect the\nrules of the multilateral trading system, which are the\nfoundation of the World Trade Organization.\nIt should therefore be clear why Burkina Faso\ncontinues to demand an end to the unfair export\nsubsidies of the countries of the North, particularly as\nconcerns cotton.\nBurkina Faso is a staunch proponent of\ndemocracy, good governance, respect for human rights,\nand peace and development in Africa and throughout\nthe world. In that context, it is actively involved in\npeacekeeping operations in Africa and in other regions.\nFurthermore, my country, which currently holds the\nchairmanship of the Community of Sahelo-Saharan\nStates and of the International Organization of La\nFrancophonie, is proud to serve the cause of regional\nintegration and of international brotherhood and\nsolidarity.\nWe believe that working for peace also means\nrespecting international conventions. We therefore\nbelieve it to be our duty to discharge our international\nobligations by acceding to most of the relevant\nagreements and treaties, such as the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which Burkina Faso has\nsigned and ratified. I should like to take this\nopportunity to encourage other countries to do likewise\nin order to speed up the coming into force of that legal\ninstrument, whose importance for world peace and\nstability is fully evident.\nI hardly need recall that the current session\u2019s\nleitmotif is the democratization of the United Nations.\nIt is therefore rather difficult to understand how we can\ncontinue to disregard the rights of 23 million\nTaiwanese people. The time has come to deal justly\nwith that people, which for decades now has\ndemonstrated its commitment to democracy, peace and\ninternational solidarity.\nToday more than ever, the fate of humankind is in\nour hands. Moving in concert, in the same direction\nand inspired by the same principles, we must assume\nour new common responsibility: to build a world in\nlarger freedom, with development, security and dignity\nfor all."

        "file_text": "I\nam returning to the Assembly Hall after 10 years. In\nSeptember 1995, I had the honour of being elected\nPresident of the General Assembly. I well know,\ntherefore, what a difficult task it is, and I congratulate\nyou, Mr. President, Ambassador Jan Eliasson, on your\nrecent election. I wish you every success in discharging\nyour lofty functions. I would also like to compliment\nthe outgoing President, Mr. Ping, on the exceptional\nwork that he did during the previous session.\nI offer my best wishes to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan. My country greatly values the\nexcellent work that he has done so far, and the\nPortuguese Government wishes to express its solidarity\nwith him in connection with the difficult times that has\nbeen through, as well as its continued support for the\nenormous tasks and challenges that lie ahead.\nWe share some of the disappointment felt by the\nSecretary-General regarding the failure to approve\nmany of the proposed reforms of the Organization that\nhe set out in his excellent report, \u201cIn larger freedom\u201d.\nThe entire process started 10 years ago, in 1995-96,\nunder my presidency, and I can assure the Assembly\nthat one year later, when I left office, there were\nalready many consensus-based solutions that could\nhave been approved. But insufficient use was made of\nthe 10 years that have since passed.\nWe are left with the conviction that progress\ntowards sound reform will be viable only if it\nmaintains, as its reference, the objectives set out in the\nproposals of the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan.\nWhat is sound reform of the United Nations? In\nmy opinion, such reform would fulfil, at least, the\nfollowing five prerequisites.\nFirst, such reforms must respect and reaffirm the\nfundamental principles and values of the Charter.\nSecondly, they must create better conditions for the\nmaintenance and re-establishment of peace,\nguaranteeing security and dealing with the offenders in\neither case. Thirdly, they must include strong measures\nin support of development so as to improve the living\nconditions of the world\u2019s poorest countries and reduce\nthe enormous gap that exists between the countries of\nthe North and those of the South.\nFourthly, such reforms must promote democracy,\nhuman rights and the rule of law, internationally, as\nwell as within each State. Fifthly, they must establish a\nbasis and the necessary conditions for a better\nunderstanding among peoples, for a dialogue among\ncivilizations, for an understanding of cultural and\nreligious diversity, and for a spirit of tolerance,\ncooperation and friendship among nations,\nGovernments and individuals.\nIn addition to those five prerequisites, there is\nstill a need to consider reorganizing the Secretariat,\nwhich is an important instrument for attaining the\nobjectives of the United Nations. Make no mistake: I\nhave enough personal experience to be able to state\nthat the staff of this Organization is, generally\nspeaking, highly competent, dedicated and\nprofessional. But we must all understand that, in a\nlarge Organization such as this one, like in any other,\nthere will always be a need for constant modernization.\nLast week the United Nations reform was set in\nmotion. We must continue to work hard, year after\nyear, phase by phase, with the energy and the spirit of\ncompromise that is the hallmark of diplomacy and\nwhich must therefore not be absent from the \u201ctemple of\ndiplomacy\u201d that is the United Nations.\n24\n\nFirst and foremost, the tasks to be accomplished\nin the coming months \u2014 which have Portugal\u2019s\nunreserved support \u2014 will be to do what is necessary\nto make the Peacebuilding Commission operational; to\nimplement the already approved concept of the\n\u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d; and to establish the new\nHuman Rights Council.\nDevelopment is an urgent task that cannot be\npostponed. The poorest countries call for justice, and\nthey deserve it; the richest countries insist on a code of\nethics, and they must therefore fulfil the duties that\nderive from it.\nIn that regard, Portugal fully endorses the vision\nexpressed and reaffirmed by the United Nations which\naccords priority to development \u2014 understood to be\ncomprehensive development, as expressed in the\nMillennium Development Goals \u2014 and which is\nclosely linked to security and the rule of law.\nDemocracy and security constitute the sine qua non\ncondition for effective, sustained and equitable\ndevelopment.\nIn terms of official development assistance,\nPortugal hopes to reach the agreed target of 0.51 per\ncent of gross domestic product in 2010, in order to\npave the way to achieving the ambitious goal of 0.7 per\ncent in 2015.\nThe efforts of Portugal have been mainly \u2014 but\nnot exclusively \u2014 directed towards the least developed\ncountries, and sub-Saharan Africa in particular.\nWe therefore reaffirm the need to pay active and\ncommitted attention to the special needs of Africa. In\nthat way, we will fulfil effectively the commitments\nundertaken to strengthen cooperation with the New\nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development and with\nregional and subregional organizations.\nThe report of the Secretary-General rightly\nreminds us that every country is primarily responsible\nfor its own development, in a framework of good\ngovernance, which is a prerequisite in this context.\nBasically, it is a matter of implementing the\neighth Millennium Goal: to create a global partnership for\ndevelopment, whose importance in promoting a more\nequitable and just world I would like to stress here.\nThat is why I have no hesitation in stating that we\nmust remain actively committed to the implementation\nof the Millennium Development Goals, including\nstrengthening action in priority areas. Our common\nfuture is at stake, and I would like to take this\nopportunity to announce that Portugal has decided to\ncontribute to the United Nations Democracy Fund.\nFor Portugal, environmental concerns are a clear\npriority; addressing them must promote, not detract\nfrom, development. In that domain, we will actively\nparticipate in international efforts to combat climate\nchange, honouring our commitments and limiting\ngreenhouse-gas emissions, so that the European Union\ncan attain the goals agreed in the context of the Kyoto\nProtocol. We hope that the next Conference, to be held\nin Montreal, will mark the launching of a negotiating\nprocess on climate-related issues for the post-2012\nperiod.\nOne of the most serious threats to peace and\nsecurity today is terrorism. It must be fought with\nresolve, within the framework of the rule of law and\nwith respect for human rights. There can be no doubt\nthat one of the aims of terrorists is to weaken and\ndistort even the most elementary of the universal\nvalues adopted by States and their peoples. Because we\nare fighting back in self-defence, they say that our\nactions \u2014 theirs and ours \u2014 are morally equivalent.\nPortugal strongly rejects that view.\nThere can be no ambiguity in fighting terrorism.\nWe must be clear on this and state, quite bluntly, that\nall acts that aim to kill or seriously injure civilians or\nnon-combatants are acts of terrorism.\nWe believe that the United Nations provides a\nframework of reference for combating terrorism, and\nwe therefore urge that a global convention on terrorism\nbe adopted. Similarly, we welcome the counter-\nterrorism strategy drawn up by the Secretary-General,\nand we appeal for its effective implementation.\nIn that context, Portugal will sign the\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of Acts\nof Nuclear Terrorism during this session of the General\nAssembly.\nWe must recognize that the largest cluster of\nthreats to international peace and security today lies in\nthe broader Middle East. Regardless of countries\u2019\npositions on the Iraq war, it is now essential to do all\nwe can, based on the clear existing mandates of the\nUnited Nations, to see that peace, democracy and\nhuman rights triumph. That could take a number of\nyears, as in Afghanistan.\n25\n\nRegarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it is\nimportant that, taking advantage of the current positive\nmomentum, we hold serious negotiations aimed at\nreaching bilateral and multilateral agreements. The\nroad map cannot be forgotten or indefinitely\npostponed. Just as Israel has an unquestionable right to\nlive in peace within secure borders, the Palestinian\nState also has an unquestionable right to exist. Only\nthrough what is called the two-State policy can there be\npeace in the Middle East.\nAs for Iran, I should like to stress and support the\nefforts of the European Union to avert, through\nnegotiations, another dangerous case of nuclear\nproliferation. The international community as a whole\nand the Iranian people themselves owe a great deal to\nthe intelligent approach of the European Union in this\nmatter. We are, and will continue to be, united in\nsolidarity. Negotiations must continue.\nPortugal is committed to strengthening\ncooperation among regions and civilizations in order to\npromote international peace and stability. Accordingly,\nthe high-level political dialogue between Europe and\nAfrica must be further strengthened, including through\nthe convening of the Europe-Africa summit, towards\nwhich Portugal has been working tirelessly.\nI reiterate Portugal\u2019s appeal to all interested\nparties to join in our effort to re-launch the Cairo\nprocess, which we believe could be instrumental in\nestablishing that strategic partnership.\nI also wish to publicly place on record my\ncountry\u2019s support for Spain\u2019s Alliance of Civilizations\ninitiative. The European-African dialogue is also a\ndialogue among civilizations, as is the Ibero-American\nprocess, to which Portugal, Spain, Andorra and the Latin\nAmerican countries are committed. That process will be\nformalized at the Salamanca Summit in October.\nOver the past nine years, the dialogue among the\neight States members of the Community of Portuguese-\nSpeaking Countries \u2014 which represents 200 million\npeople living in four continents \u2014 has been intensified,\nwith great success. Portugal participates in the dialogue\nwith countries from Europe, Africa, Latin America and\nAsia, a dialogue that it would like to see broadened as\nan indispensable tool for civilizations to live in peace\nand not be at war.\nI would like to conclude by reaffirming\nPortugal\u2019s faith in the centrality, legitimacy and\nindispensable role of the United Nations. While not\nforgetting our setbacks, but learning from them so that\nthey are not repeated, we should bear in mind our\nmany successes. Timor-Leste, which is here with us\ntoday as a full Member State, is one example of a\nUnited Nations success story.\nIn conclusion, I would like to remember the wise\nwords of our second Secretary-General, Dag\nHammarskj\u00f6ld, who said:\n(spoke in English)\n\u201cThe pursuit of peace and progress cannot end in\na few years in either victory or defeat. The\npursuit of peace and progress, with its trials and\nits errors, its successes and its setbacks, can never\nbe relaxed and never abandoned.\u201d"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to congratulate the\nPresident on his well-deserved election to preside over\nthe sixtieth session of the General Assembly. The\nsession that he is chairing is special because of its\nscope and the importance of its issues, particularly in\nview of the unfinished mandates and unfulfilled hopes\nof the 2005 summit.\nWe cannot conceal our dissatisfaction with the\nsummit\u2019s outcome. In some areas, such as development\nand human rights, the outcome document reflects less\nthan the international community\u2019s least common\ndenominator. In others, such as disarmament and\nimpunity, the final document is a real step back.\nNevertheless, this does not mean that we should\nneglect our commitment to the reform of the United\nNations.\nWe must avoid past mistakes in order to ensure\nthe success of the next round of negotiations. The\nGeneral Assembly must set realistic goals, avoiding\nexpectations that cannot be met or accepting artificial\ndeadlines that create undue pressure on the\nnegotiations and must not be distracted by secondary\nissues. The negotiation process must be open, inclusive\nand transparent, so that all States may be free to\nparticipate and contribute actively. We must not yield\nto the temptation of creating closed negotiating groups\nthat can make private and non-transparent\narrangements. We must prevent small groups of States\nfrom imposing their own national ambitions upon\nothers. The Secretariat must remain totally impartial.\nAnd finally, we must see to it that decisions are made\nby democratic means in conformity with the rules of\nprocedure.\nSuch principles must be borne in mind\nparticularly when we consider the possible reform of\nthe Security Council. In the last few months, we\ndevoted a disproportionate amount of time and effort to\nthe question of Security Council reform, to the\ndetriment of other equally important issues. During the\npresent Assembly session, we must give equal\nemphasis to the Human Rights Council, the\nPeacebuilding Commission and the negotiation of the\ncomprehensive convention on terrorism, in addition to\nthe reform of the Security Council. We deem it\nnecessary to revitalize the Working Group on the\nreform of the Security Council so that we may work\ntogether towards a consensus solution.\nWe reaffirm our commitment to Security Council\nreform in order to make it more democratic and more\ntransparent and effective, on the basis of the principles\nof sovereign equality among States, rotation, periodic\nelections and accountability. Therefore, we cannot\naccept having new permanent members which, due to\ntheir permanent status, cannot he held to account and\nwhich cannot be replaced if their performance is found\nwanting. We would only favour an increase in the\nnumber of non-permanent members of the Council,\nwith a possibility of re-election.\nAt the same time, we support reforming the\nSecurity Council\u2019s working methods so that it may be\nmore responsive to the requirements and needs of the\ngreat majority of Member States. It is indispensable to\nlimit the undemocratic instrument of the veto, which\nerodes the legitimacy and effectiveness of the Council.\nThe veto is unacceptable, especially in cases of\ngenocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and\nmassive violations of human rights. Regrettably, the\nproposal to eliminate the veto in such cases was not\nincluded in the summit\u2019s outcome. This question will\nhave to be reconsidered in the coming months in the\ncontext of Security Council reform.\nWe should focus also on the accountability of the\nSecurity Council to the broader membership. Insofar as\nthe Council acts on behalf of all Member States, it\nshould submit special reports to the General Assembly,\npursuant to Article 24, paragraph 3, of the Charter,\nevery time that it establishes or substantially modifies\nthe mandate of a peacekeeping mission, every time that\nit imposes sanctions or other measures of general\napplication under Chapter VII of the Charter, and every\ntime that a draft resolution is vetoed. The General\nAssembly should consider such reports with a view to\nfurther action when necessary.\n17\n\nFurthermore, the Security Council must adopt\nmeasures to ensure full respect for human rights and, in\nparticular, the right to due process of persons included\non lists of sanctions committees. The work of the\nSecurity Council must serve as an example of the\nhighest standards of human rights and due process at\nthe international level.\nMy delegation wholeheartedly supports all efforts\nto strengthen the international mechanisms for the\npromotion and protection of human rights. We fully\nsupport the idea of transforming the Commission on\nHuman Rights into a Human Rights Council. We had\nhoped that the outcome document would contain\nspecific provisions on the structure and mandate of the\nnew Council. In their absence, we should devote the\nnext few months to designing this new institution. We\nparticularly deem it necessary to ensure that the\ncomposition of the new Council reflects an equitable\ngeographical distribution and that its mandate may\nfavour expert consideration of issues, avoiding\nunnecessary politicization. It is also necessary to draw\na distinction between the mandate of the new Council\nand the work of the General Assembly\u2019s Third\nCommittee.\nWe support the idea to increase substantially the\nbudget of the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights. We are greatly\ninterested in the idea of submitting a single report to all\nof the monitoring mechanisms established under the\nvarious human rights treaties. In order to protect\npersons with disabilities, we believe it necessary to\nconclude as soon as possible the convention on\nprotection and promotion of the rights and dignity of\npersons with disabilities.\nIn the next few months, this General Assembly\nshould also devote itself to the establishment of the\nPeacebuilding Commission. In our view, this new\nCommission should be a subsidiary body of the\nGeneral Assembly, maintaining an appropriate\nfunctional relationship with the Security Council. Its\nmembers, we believe, should be elected, and the body\nshould be open to all States that are making an\neffective contribution to peace. Therefore, we are\nopposed to having permanent members of the Security\nCouncil automatically become members of the new\nCommission. Such an unjustifiable privilege would be\none more example of the cascade effect. Similarly, we\nare opposed to extending the right of veto to the work\nof the new Commission. We believe that in its\ndecision-making the Commission should apply the\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly.\nWe are convinced that the United Nations should\nplay a key role in the efforts to fight international\nterrorism. Pursuant to the summit\u2019s outcome document,\nin the coming months the General Assembly should\ndesign a comprehensive strategy against terrorism and\nadopt concrete measures to strengthen and enhance\ncoordination in the Organization on this matter. In this\ncontext, we would like to repeat the proposal made last\nyear by the President of Costa Rica, His Excellency\nMr. Abel Pacheco de la Espriella, to create a United\nNations High Commissioner on Terrorism, as an\nindependent, professional and permanent mechanism at\nthe heart of the Secretariat to ensure greater\ncoordination and better use of the resources available\nat the global level to fight terrorism.\nWe also support the conclusion of the\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism\nby the end of this year. That draft convention already\ncontains a technical and precise definition of the crime\nof terrorism, which will enhance judicial and police\ncooperation on the basis of the principle of \u201cprosecute\nor extradite\u201d.\nWe highlight the importance of law and justice in\ninternational relations, and thus we reaffirm our\nconfidence in the International Court of Justice as the\nbest mechanism for the peaceful settlement of disputes.\nThus, we urge all nations to accept, without any\nconditions, the jurisdiction of the Court. We call upon\nStates that may have entered reservations in their\ndeclarations of acceptance of the jurisdiction of the\nCourt to withdraw them.\nWe reaffirm our support for the International\nCriminal Court as an indispensable mechanism to\nprevent and punish the most serious crimes against\nmankind. We are particularly pleased at the fact that\nthe delegation of Costa Rica will in the next few\nmonths preside over the Assembly of States Parties to\nthe Rome Statute.\nThis year\u2019s negotiations on disarmament and non-\nproliferation have yielded unsatisfactory results. In\nparticular, we believe that the General Assembly\nshould begin preparations for the review conference of\nthe United Nations Programme of Action to Action to\nPrevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in\nSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects,\nwhich will be held in mid-2006. That conference\n18\n\nshould incorporate, in the implementation of its\nProgramme of Action, a human rights perspective and\nthe six global principles of the draft framework\nconvention on international arms transfers.\nRegarding development, we reiterate our appeal\nto implement the Millennium Development Goals and\nurge developed countries to fulfil their commitments to\nallocate 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to\ndevelopment assistance and to do away with all\nbarriers and subsidies that have a negative impact on\nthe exports of developing countries.\nSpecific measures must be adopted to enhance\nprevention and assistance in case of natural disasters.\nIn this context, I would like to recall that the Sachs\nreport identified Central America and the Caribbean as\nthe region with the highest vulnerability indices to\nnatural disasters. Similarly, it is indispensable to bear\nin mind the importance of economically sustainable\ndevelopment. In this context, I would like to highlight\nthe initiative of creating a \u201cRainforest Coalition\u201d, led\nby Costa Rica and Papua New Guinea, with a view to\nprotecting all forests and ensuring payment for the\nenvironmental services that they provide. We must\nrecall that tropical forests benefit mankind as a whole\nby sequestering the carbon dioxide produced by\nindustry. Unfortunately, the Kyoto Protocol does not\nprovide incentives to developing countries to protect\nprimary tropical forests. We believe that this omission\nin the Kyoto Protocol must be remedied.\nRegarding management, and with a view to\nsafeguarding the unique legitimacy of this\nOrganization, we deem it indispensable to strengthen\nthe United Nations monitoring and inspection\nmechanisms, and we request that the General Assembly\nconsider in depth the recommendations of the Volcker\nreport. It is indispensable to face with absolute\ntransparency the cases of mismanagement and alleged\ncorruption that have surfaced within the Organization\nin recent months.\nWe believe that the General Assembly should\nseriously consider the question of the representation of\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan in the United\nNations. There is no doubt that the Republic of China\non Taiwan could contribute to the work of the\nOrganization. Incorporating the Republic of China on\nTaiwan into the community of nations is also necessary\nso that it may fully assume the rights and duties that\narise from the various legal regimes of global\ngovernance in areas as varied as collective security,\ndevelopment assistance, the fight against terrorism,\nsustainable development and the various international\nhealth mechanisms.\nI would like to conclude by reiterating Costa\nRica\u2019s unconditional commitment to the principles and\npurposes of the Organization, reaffirming our faith in\nthe United Nations as the principle instrument of the\ninternational community to maintain peace, and\nrenewing our full confidence in the Organization\u2019s\ncapability to promote human rights and the well-being\nof all peoples."

        "file_text": "I would like to offer my congratulations\nto the President on his election. In doing so, I assure all\nour fellow members of Brunei Darussalam's continued\nstrong support for the United Nations.\nMuch of the attention at almost every great\ninternational meeting for the past four years has been\ngiven to the inhuman acts of global terrorists.\nInevitably, this has focused on specific events. That is\nunderstandable, of course, and we in Brunei\nDarussalam again add our voices to the condemnation\nof all such actions. We offer our deepest condolences\nto the families of all who have suffered losses.\nNevertheless, as we meet our respected fellow\nMembers of the United Nations, we again state what\nwe have continuously said since the onset of the\ncurrent wave of global terrorism. These brutal attacks\nextend beyond personal grief and national\n13\n\ncondemnation. They are symptomatic of many grave\nthreats the people of the world face today. As such,\nthey constitute nothing less than an attack on world\norder.\nFor this reason, we believe it is high time the\nworld order asserted itself in modern terms. In other\nwords, a new, revitalized United Nations is called\nfor \u00f3 not for us as Heads of State, or for our\ndiplomats, or for any of us who are privileged and have\nthe means, the education and the opportunity to live in\nhope and confidence. A new United Nations is needed\nby the ordinary citizens we are privileged to represent here.\nIf world order is indeed under attack, that means\nordinary people and their families are also under\nattack. In far too many ways, it is not merely an attack.\nIt is an all-out assault. It comes not merely from\ncriminal terrorists: it comes from many aspects of\nglobalization, from international crime, from new\ntechnology, from social and cultural disruption, from a\nrapidly degrading environment and from the grave\nthreats posed by the possible spread of fearful new\ndiseases. In real, immediate human terms, it comes\nfrom fear, from injustice, from a loss of absolute values\nand from sheer rage. It is revealed in feelings of\nhopelessness and an almost total loss of confidence.\nMany of us here, especially those from small\ndeveloping nations, are, therefore, convinced that\nworld order must be dramatically strengthened. As I\nstated at the High-level Plenary Meeting two days ago\n(see A/60/PV.6), there is no greater way to begin this\nprocess than for each of us to achieve the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). For this reason, we in\nBrunei Darussalam will do whatever we can to achieve\nthem in our own country and to help our neighbours do\nlikewise.\nIn setting the Millennium Goals, we recognized\nthat, in order to re-establish world order, the root\ncauses of anger, despair, injustice and hatred must be\naddressed. I would, therefore, once more like to\ncommend the Secretary-General and his staff and the\nUnited Nations agencies, both professional and\nvolunteer, for all they have done in the field to deepen\nour understanding of those causes. The causes have\nbecome clearly defined in all their urgency. They are\npolitical, social, cultural and economic. In each case,\nwe do not believe that solutions can be imposed. When\nthe international community is so gravely divided on\nmatters such as nuclear development, arms\nproliferation, globalization, the environment and social\ninjustice, this body must be the judge of whether\ninternational conduct is acceptable. Solutions to\ninternational problems must come from truly united\nnations acting in concert. In other words, the United\nNations must be an efficient world organization\ncommitted to tackling root causes and insisting on\ndialogue and negotiation as the sole means of settling\ndisputes, no matter how long it takes and no matter\nhow frustrating the process may be.\nThe global crisis arising from the search for the\nbest way to deal with modern, technology-fuelled\nterrorism highlights that need. For many years, we\nhave maintained that understanding root causes must\nbe a very important part of any long-term approach to\ntackling terrorist activities.\nOf course, every possible form of bilateral and\nmultilateral cooperation is needed to deal with the\ncriminals involved. But condemnation is not enough,\nand legislation is never sufficient. All attempts to\njustify acts of terrorism must be resolutely countered,\nnot by exchanges of opposing definitions of evil but by\ndetermination to eradicate all possible root causes,\nwhich some may wrongly see as justifying such acts.\nThat is very difficult. It requires consensus here\nat the United Nations on what constitutes injustice,\nespecially historical injustice, and on what constitutes\nunfairness. That, in turn, demands a new, reformed\nUnited Nations.\nWe are a small nation. Our interest lies in\nworking closely with all other Members. For that\nreason, we shall offer whatever help we can to building\nthe broadest possible consensus on all the many far-\nreaching decisions that the Organization is currently\ncalled upon to make.\nThe most important of those decisions at present\nconcerns the question of United Nations reform. Like\nmany of our fellow Members, we have long given our\nstrong support to reform. In recent months, we have\nheld discussions with many colleagues that go far\nbeyond matters of principle; they have dealt with\nspecific proposals. Most of them aim at redesigning the\nstructure of the Organization, including the Security\nCouncil. Our response has been the one we have\nalways offered. We will listen with respect. We will\nacknowledge the good faith of all our fellow Members,\nand we will help in any way we can to achieve the\nbroadest possible consensus. That, we think, is not a\n14\n\nway of avoiding the hard decisions that have to be\nmade. On the contrary, we believe it serves to\nrecognize how hard those decisions are and how\nimportant this body is to the world.\nThe consensus that was reached 60 years ago was\na strong one. It served the world well for many\ndecades. It now appears very clear that, although the\nstructure of the United Nations remains in place, the\nworld has changed enormously. A new consensus is\nbeing sought. Unlike the consensus reached at the end\nof the Second World War, it is not directed at the\nmeans to maintain peace; it is aimed at creating the\nconditions for lasting peace. We see that as the only\nway for the United Nations to block all forces of\nviolence and inhumanity by means of a strong and just\nworld order.\nWhen it is time for the Assembly to decide, we in\nBrunei Darussalam will consider all proposals in that light."

        "file_text": "Malaysia, as the Chairman\nof the Non-Aligned Movement and in its own name,\nwishes to convey our congratulations to you, Sir, on\nyour election as the President of the General Assembly\nat its sixtieth session. I am confident that, under your\nable stewardship, the work of the Assembly will reach\na successful conclusion. I wish to assure you of the\nfullest cooperation of the Non-Aligned Movement and\nof the Malaysian delegation.\nLet me also pay tribute to your predecessor,\nMr. Jean Ping, for his dedication and for the successful\nmanner in which he conducted the work of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-ninth session, which was an\nexceptionally challenging one. The consultations and\nnegotiations led to the successful adoption of the final\noutcome document at the world summit last Friday.\nSix decades ago, the peoples of the world,\nincluding those under oppression and colonialism,\ncelebrated the creation of the United Nations. The\nUnited Nations, as envisaged by its founders, was a\nbeacon of hope for the world following the death and\ndestruction wrought by the Second World War.\nMalaysia fully and consistently subscribes to the\ncentrality of the United Nations and thus to the\nmultilateral principles which have allowed the\nevolution of an international order predicated on rule-\nbased interaction among States, thus creating a\npredictable and stable international environment.\nWithout multilateralism, small or weak States could\nnot hope for a democratic international order within\nwhich they could aspire to independence, peace and\nstability, development and prosperity.\nToday, even as we meet here, multilateralism has\ncome under increasing threat. We believe that attempts\nto unilaterally rewrite or redefine the normative\nframework is a dangerous experiment. Without the\nstabilizing effect of such a framework, we would only\ncreate uncertainty and confusion in the international\norder.\n22\n\nThe challenge confronting humankind in our time\nis to address, comprehensively and collectively, the\nmultifaceted threats to our survival and well-being in\nthe areas of peace and security, poverty and\ndevelopment, human rights and democracy.\nIn that regard, the outcome document has sought\nto give a fresh lease on life to multilateralism, both in\nsubstance and in structure. As we continue our\ndiscussions to reshape and redirect the Organization,\nwe must ensure that the General Assembly remains the\ntrue embodiment of the will of the world community.\nAll of us must be committed to strengthening the\nGeneral Assembly so that it reflects the true voice of\ndemocracy, transparency and accountability. At this\njuncture, let me voice Malaysia\u2019s support for the\nchecklist of items to be implemented during the current\nsession, as mapped out by the Secretary-General in his\naddress last Saturday. I hope that, by the time we meet\nagain next year, the Secretary-General\u2019s report will be\nable to illustrate a marked improvement in the world\nsituation, in particular towards achieving the\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015 and\nthe greater efficiency and effectiveness of the\nSecretariat.\nDriven by a common sense of purpose and\ndetermined political will, we must operationalize the\ncommitments we have undertaken at the major United\nNations conferences and summits of recent years. Our\nwords must be matched by our actions. This must\nrepresent the beginning of the collective redoubling of\nefforts that is necessary to secure a more peaceful and\njust world. Where we had been unable to push the\nagenda on certain issues, we must now pursue them as\npart of an ongoing process in the reform of the United\nNations. Where efforts to reach agreement have failed\naltogether, such as on the issue of disarmament and\nnon-proliferation, we must now focus our energies in\norder to keep the issues alive until we achieve\nconsensus.\nMalaysia is disappointed by the absence of any\nreference to disarmament and non-proliferation in the\noutcome document. I hope that this is not construed as\na loss of interest by the international community or as\nan indication that it has since fallen off our radar of\nconcern. Our collective call for nuclear-weapon States\nto effect complete and general disarmament as well as\nto ensure the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons\nmust not be compromised.\nIt is indeed regrettable that the 2005 Review\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) earlier this\nyear failed. That failure will intensify the adverse\nrepercussions on the disarmament regime,\npainstakingly negotiated since the end of the Second\nWorld War. We must therefore, at this session, reiterate\nand, indeed, reaffirm the importance of the full and\nnon-selective implementation of the three pillars of the\nNon-Proliferation Treaty, namely: nuclear\ndisarmament, nuclear non-proliferation and the\npeaceful use of nuclear technology.\nWe must also rededicate our efforts towards the\ntotal elimination of all weapons of mass destruction.\nThe world spent an estimated $1 trillion on global\nmilitary expenditures last year. Doubtless, much of that\nwent to strengthening the military arsenals of States\nthat feel constantly under threat; yet some of that must\nalso have been contributed by terrorists purchasing\narms for their condemnable acts. The sale of small\narms and light weapons has wrought untold suffering\non unsuspecting peoples everywhere. The international\ncommunity must collectively call on States to divert\nsuch military spending to achieving the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals and to strengthening the\ndevelopment infrastructure. This would go far towards\ncreating a just and equitable order, which in turn would\nlead to a safer world.\nSince the adoption of the MDGs five years ago,\nthe burdens and obstacles faced by developing\ncountries seem to have increased, with almost no\namelioration of the problems that already existed at the\ntime. Eight years ago, East Asia was battered by a\nfinancial crisis, which in turn had trans-regional\nrepercussions, adversely affecting the health of the\nglobal economy. Appeals by developing countries to\nreform the international financial architecture fell on\ndeaf ears. As a result, the international financial\narchitecture continues to be vulnerable to similar\ncrises.\nNow, even as that and other equally important\nproblems remain unresolved, we are faced with yet\nanother threat \u2014 a prolonged and sustained increase in\noil prices, which, even as we speak, threatens to\nimperil the global economy. Continuous increases in\noil prices are placing a disproportionate burden on\ndeveloping countries, thereby impoverishing them even\nfurther. It is morally reprehensible that the poor are\n23\n\nexpected to absorb the cost of instabilities of\nproduction. In many quarters of the global community,\nthe unbridled free market in particular is viewed as\nrapacious and unfeeling.\nIf the United Nations is to remain relevant to the\nworld at large, it must be able to discuss and decide on\nprecisely issues such as these, which not only have an\nimpact on our day-to-day lives but also have long-term\nimplications, including for peace and security. If wars\nin the past were fought over ideology, conflicts in the\nfuture will be due to competition for markets and\nscarce natural resources, blurring the lines between\neconomics, development and security. Accordingly, the\nUnited Nations must be prepared to address the\ninterrelated and cross-cutting issues that give rise to\nsuch conflicts.\nGlobalization, with its myriad challenges and\nopportunities, has left many in the developing\ncountries unable to compete in an open and free-market\nsystem. Following the current trajectory, the\ninternational economic system will continue to remain\nunjust, punishing the poor for being unable to\ninfluence, much less dictate, their destinies. Much\nremains to be done to equalize the field between the\nrich and the rest. Aid and debt cancellation, while they\nare welcome and reduce the burden on developing\ncountries, have in the long term only limited effect. It\nis trade that needs to be expanded and made more fair\nand equitable. We must press ahead towards a\nuniversal, rule-based, open, non-discriminatory, fair\nand equitable multilateral trading system. It is widely\nrecognized that trade has a multiplier effect and is able\nto lift poor communities towards becoming self-\nsustaining ones. Trade can create competitive markets\nthat benefit all.\nMalaysia condemns all acts, methods and\npractices of terrorism. As terrorism is a global\nphenomenon that transcends national boundaries,\nfighting terrorism demands effective international\naction in accordance with the Charter and universally\nrecognized principles of international relations and\ninternational law.\nIn countering terrorism, the use of conventional\nmilitary force alone is insufficient. To truly address the\nscourge and prevent its re-emergence elsewhere over\ntime, we must deal with the root causes of terrorism in\norder to provide a lasting solution that will deny those\ncommitting such acts of violence sympathy and keep\nthem from gaining new recruits. While countering their\nactions, we must at the same time win the hearts and\nminds of the people in order to ensure that our victory\nwill not be short-lived.\nNo one group acting alone will be able to achieve\ntotal success. Clearly, success requires a sense of\ncommon purpose. The portrayal of any particular\ngrouping of peoples as fanatical terrorists led by a\nreligion of war is, therefore, irresponsible and would\nderail any attempt at forging a common and united\nfront against terrorism. It is our collective duty to\nrespond effectively to the legitimate grievances of\naffected communities, wherever they may be, so as to\novercome their feelings of marginalization,\ndeprivation, oppression and injustice. The international\ncommunity as a whole must take a stand to stop actions\nthat contribute directly or indirectly to the perpetuation\nof injustice, oppression or aggression.\nMisunderstanding and fear of \u201cthe other\u201d must be\nreplaced by respect, dialogue, understanding and\ntolerance. In this context, we can build a universal\nculture that respects diversity so that goodwill and\nharmony can thrive.\nThe interests and concerns of minority groups\nmust not be sidelined in favour of the majority.\nMinorities too have rights that must be protected by\ntheir Government. Over time, the grievances of\nminority groups over their being sidelined will\nnecessarily seek an outlet.\nThere is a national as well as an international\ndimension to the issue of peaceful and cooperative co-\nexistence. Understanding and respect between\nreligions, cultures and civilizations become necessary\nprerequisites for dialogue and the avoidance of\nconflicts. If Governments can succeed in instituting a\nculture of tolerance and moderation among people at\nthe domestic level, it will become easier for nation\nStates to cooperate in promoting tolerance and\nmoderation among nationalities and cultures at the\ninternational level. We must institute the precepts of\njustice, respect and understanding in our day-to-day\ndealings. This would, in turn, lead to fairness, goodwill\nand harmony in our relations.\nThe ideas of good governance, democracy and\naccountability to God and our peoples are not\nantithetical to Islam. They are clearly embodied in the\nKoran and the traditions of the Prophet Mohammed.\nFor our own part in Malaysia, we believe that the\n24\n\nobligation to act based on religious imperatives can be\ndirected towards good, progress and development. We\ncall this approach Islam Hadhari, literally civilizational\nIslam, which is an approach towards a progressive and\nhumanistic civilization that is consistent with the\nobjective of creating a stable international world order.\nThe approach that Malaysia has taken emphasizes\nthat progress, development, knowledge and good\ngovernance as enshrined in the teachings of Islam, are\ncompatible with modernity and yet are firmly rooted in\nthe ethical, moral and universal values that will\nguarantee the future of humankind. It is an approach\nthat values substance over form and promotes tolerance\nand understanding, moderation and peace, and\ncertainly, enlightenment.\nIn our preoccupation with the reform of the\nUnited Nations, we must not lose sight of the need to\naddress and resolve, on a priority basis, one of the most\nimportant outstanding issues confronting this\nOrganization: the question of Palestine. While we all\nwelcome the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, it should be\npart of the Road Map and should be quickly followed\nby similar measures in the West Bank. The issue of\nsettlements must not be left unresolved, including in\nand around Jerusalem, as well as the construction of\nthe Separation Wall, which has already been\npronounced illegal by the International Court of\nJustice. Such activities must cease forthwith. The\ninternational community, particularly the United\nNations, must continue to remain engaged with this\nissue until the goal of an independent and sovereign\nState of Palestine is realized.\nRich or poor, strong or weak, whatever our\nreligion or belief, one fact is inescapable: we inhabit\none world, our global village. Sixty years ago, the\nfounders of our universal Organization came together\nafter witnessing horrors hitherto unimaginable and said\nthat never again could human life be so wantonly\nextinguished. They also proclaimed that humankind\nwould forevermore work and live together in peace,\nharmony and common respect. On this historic\noccasion, my plea is that we return to those hopes and\nideals."

        "file_text": "I should like first of all to express\n13\n\nheartfelt congratulations to you, Sir, on behalf of my\ndelegation and on my own behalf, on your election to\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its sixtieth\nsession. We wish you every success in the discharge of\nyour important functions. Your election to the\npresidency is, of course a reflection of your great\npersonal qualities and experience. But it is also a\ntribute to your country, Sweden, which has always\nbeen committed to United Nations activities, in\nparticular development assistance.\nI would like to take this opportunity to express to\nyour predecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, Minister for Foreign\nAffairs of Gabon, my deep admiration for his\noutstanding work as President, including the\nconsiderable efforts that he made throughout his term\nof office with a view to ensuring the success of the\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting, which took place from\n14 to 16 September. As an African and as a\nrepresentative of a country member of the Economic\nCommunity of Central African States, I cannot but feel\ngreat pride in his achievements.\nJust a few days ago, a major event took place\nhere at the United Nations \u2014 an event comparable to\nthe Millennium Summit, in which leaders from all over\nthe world took part.\nI am sure that we all remember how the President\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session\ninvited us to focus our discussion on the theme, \u201cA\nstronger and more effective Organization: follow-up to\nand implementation of the High-level Plenary Meeting\nin September 2005\u201d.\nOn Friday, 16 September, late in the evening, a\ncompromise document was adopted, which was\nacceptable to my delegation, even though it did not\nrespond to all the concerns expressed in the courageous\nreport of the Secretary-General, to whom, once again,\nmy country would like to pay a well-deserved tribute.\nSome of the bold proposals that he made, in particular\nthose relating to the need to reform the Organization,\nseem to us still to be entirely relevant, since they\nwould make the United Nations stronger and more\neffective by adapting it to the challenges of twenty-first\ncentury.\nThe delegation of the Central African Republic\nbelieves that the debate on the reform of the\nOrganization, in particular the reform of the Security\nCouncil, is far from over. This is not simply a matter of\njustice for all those who were not present in San\nFrancisco 60 years ago when the Organization was\ncreated. The African continent, which really began to\nmake itself heard internationally from 1960 onwards,\nrightly claims its place within the Security Council on\nan equitable basis. We can rest assured that the young\npeople of Africa are paying attention to the activities of\nthe United Nations and to our discussions here, and\nthey find it increasingly difficult to understand why our\ncontinent is the only one not to have a permanent seat\nin that body, which is responsible for taking the most\nimportant decisions affecting peace and security\nthroughout the world, including in Africa.\nIn a statement made from this rostrum on\nThursday, 15 September 2005, during the debate in the\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting, His Excellency\nMr. Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9, President of the Central African\nRepublic, underlined the extent to which we, the small\ndeveloping countries, in particular those that have gone\nthrough or that are currently going through major\nconflicts or political crises, need a strong and effective\nUnited Nations.\nThe recent history of our country makes clear the\nextent to which international solidarity, coordinated by\nthe United Nations and its specialized agencies,\nsucceeded in helping us to get back on our feet. After\nalmost a decade of chaos, on 15 March 2003 an\nupsurge of patriotism enabled us to make a consensus-\nbased transition, and we have benefited from the\nsupport, advice and expertise, as well as the financial\nand material assistance, of all of our external partners.\nFor two years, we were assisted by the United\nNations Peacebuilding Support Office in the Central\nAfrican Republic, the United Nations Development\nProgramme and other specialized agencies, and by our\nbilateral and multilateral partners, including France,\nChina, the United States of America, the European\nUnion, the International Organization of la\nFrancophonie and, of course, our high-ranking African\ncolleagues, among them the countries of the Central\nAfrican Economic and Monetary Community, under\nthe chairmanship of El Hadj Omar Bongo Ondimba,\nPresident of Gabon.\nTherefore, the success of our consensus-based\ntransition is to a large extent the success of\ninternational solidarity as mobilized by the United\nNations. Of course, the national will, expressed first\nand foremost by the citizens of the Central African\nRepublic at all levels \u2014 who are weary of violence and\n14\n\nchaos and yearn for peace \u2014 and supported by our\npolitical elite as reflected in governmental actions by\nPresident Boziz\u00e9 himself, this national will has been\nthe prime factor enabling us to bring our transitional\nperiod and electoral process to a successful conclusion.\nIn this sense, and rightly so, the international\ncommunity has paid unanimous tribute to the wisdom\nof the Central Africans, who have chosen to return to\npeace and national concord.\nBut international solidarity was a necessary\ncondition that led us successfully to a consensus-based\ntransition and a successful electoral process. That is\nwhy, on behalf of President Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9 and the\nCentral African Government and people, I should like\nto reiterate to all of our partners an expression of our\ngratitude.\nAs the head of State said in his statement on\nThursday, 15 September 2005, the Central African\nRepublic is starting on a second stage in its process of\nreturn to peace and security, and that is the stage of\nreconstruction. This is a tremendous challenge in a\ncountry that was ruined and subject to chaos for many\nyears. As Central Africans, we are well aware of our\nprime responsibility, of our collective responsibility as\na nation, for the disaster that our country lived through.\nIf only for that reason, the bulk of the efforts and\nsacrifices to be made in the reconstruction must fall to\nus. We are fully convinced of that. But we must\nhonestly admit that in the face of the enormity and\ncomplexity of the tasks involved in reconstruction, the\nneed for solidarity is still great. In saying that, we wish\nsimply to recall precedents where the international\ncommunity understood that the best way to avoid a\nstep backwards was to support reconstruction in a\nstrong way. The real victory over violence and disorder\nis achieved when extreme poverty, which is the prime\ncause of the frustrations that lead to confrontation, is\nrolled back. Successful elections and democratic\ninstitutions that begin to function and cope with the\ncountry\u2019s problems are certainly an important advance\nalong the lengthy and difficult path toward peace and\nstability. But all this remains basically precarious, as\nlong as the legitimate expectations of the population\nare not satisfied and their hope to benefit from the\ndividends of peace is not realized. How can this be\ndone in a country that has been bled white, that does\nnot even have the minimum required for life, and on\nwhich donors impose the same conditions as they do on\ncountries that are functioning normally? How, when a\ncountry is painfully emerging from a long period of\nchaos, can it find the resources to repay the debt so that\nit can hope to benefit from additional economic\nassistance?\nThese issues and others face the international\ncommunity as part of its responsibility for managing\nthe emergence from crisis. This raises the question of\nthe ways and means of consolidating peace to emerge\nfrom a period of chaos in order to avoid the risk of a\nreturn to square one. The Secretary-General very\nrightly underlined this in his report. The outcome\ndocument of the High-level Plenary Meeting also\nmentions that. The creation of a Peace-building\nCommission is, therefore, very timely. This is a sign\nthat there is uncertainty in conflict management, as to\ndischarge a sick person when convalescence is only\njust beginning often leads to a relapse. It would be a\ngood thing if this uncertainty could be removed. The\nmoving appeal made by the President of the\nTransitional Government of Somalia strengthens us in\nour belief that the best way to avoid relapses, which\nare very difficult and costly to manage, is to provide\nstrong support for reconstruction.\nWhenever a country that has plunged into the\nabyss starts to raise its head again, it is a victory for the\nwhole of humanity, and humanity cannot stand by\nwhile one of its members drowns, however small it is.\nEmergence from a crisis stands, therefore, as a new\nchallenge for the United Nations. It is a matter of\ncreating the conditions under which a country that is\nstarting on the return to peace and stability can avoid\ntumbling back into a state of chaos. The solution\ninvolves, in our opinion, an additional demonstration\nof solidarity and generosity from its development\npartners to support the efforts of the convalescing\nsociety.\nOur country is convinced that a lasting return to\npeace involves the participation of people at all levels\nof Central African society. The quest for peace and\nstability is not only the concern of professional\npoliticians. Of course, it is important that politicians\nwork tirelessly to develop arrangements that are in\nkeeping with the national interest and that they avoid\nany radicalization of their political positions in order to\ngive peace a chance. This is the behaviour Central\nAfrican politicians have exhibited and it explains to a\nlarge extent the peaceful outcome of the consensus-\nbased transitional process and the successful electoral\nprocess.\n15\n\nBut this is not enough to consolidate peace.\nThose who pay the highest price for the failures of\npolitics must also have their say. Young people,\nwomen, peasants, urban employees, private\nentrepreneurs and the media all have a great interest in\nbeing closely involved in efforts and actions aimed at\npeacebuilding and we should therefore pay tribute to\nthe model of cooperation initiated by the United\nNations in the Great Lakes region of Africa. This\ncooperation, which regularly brings together the heads\nof State and their ministers as well as various segments\nof civil society, ensures that discussions related to the\nquest for peace involve non-politicians as well. This\ninitiative, moreover, has the merit of bringing to the\ntable other countries, either closely or less closely\ninvolved in the Great Lakes problems. In fact, no crisis\nis limited to just one country, there are direct or\nindirect effects on neighbours. That is why the\ntremendous work done by Professor Ibrahima Fall\nshould be encouraged and supported.\nAs far as the Central African Republic is\nconcerned, the priorities of the Government of\nNational Reconciliation formed after the election were\nclearly identified in the Declaration of General Policy\npresented to the National Assembly in early August by\nPrime Minister Elie Dote. There are three focal points\nfor the short and medium term. First, the re-\nestablishment of security throughout the whole\ncountry; secondly, the control and stabilization of\npublic finances; and thirdly, the rehabilitation and\nrelaunching of various sectors of the national economy,\nsuch as the mining industries, lumber, agriculture and\nlivestock.\nWith regard to the first point, it goes without\nsaying that no progress is possible without eradicating\nthe endemic insecurity caused by armed bands,\nespecially those who set up roadblocks. Reconstruction\nof the security and defence forces, which has already\nbegun, and the re-equipment of those forces are matters\nthat the Government is working to resolve. Subregional\ncooperation is also an important asset, with the active\npresence of the multinational force of the Economic\nand Monetary Community of Central Africa and\noperations carried out by forces from the Central\nAfrican Republic, Cameroon and Chad along their\nshared borders. In this connection we should pay\ntribute to the initiative taken by the United Nations\nPeacebuilding Support Office in Bangui, which\norganized a meeting of subregional diplomats and\ndefence experts in Yaound\u00e9, from 26 to 27 August. We\nshould also pay tribute to the contribution of France,\nwhich is providing the multinational force of the\nEconomic and Monetary Community of Central Africa\nwith valuable logistical support.\nBeyond short-term considerations, the major\nlong-term challenges facing the Central African\nRepublic are those of health and education. Education\nand health care are among the principal objectives of\nthe Millennium Development Goals. The Central\nAfrican Republic hopes to achieve those Goals by\n2015. We know that lasting development cannot be\nestablished without strengthening our national\ncapacities.\nHaving suffered in various ways in recent years,\nthe people of the Central African Republic sincerely\naspire to peace and stability. They are determined to\nstrive and sacrifice in order to leave the painful past\nbehind. They need the understanding and support of\ntheir partners, chief among which is the United\nNations."

        "file_text": "I wish to congratulate\nyou, Mr. President, on your election. I am confident\nthat you will carry forward the able legacy left by your\npredecessor, Mr. Jean Ping. Our warm tribute is also\ndue to the Secretary-General as he strives to\nreinvigorate our Organization.\nWe meet in the wake of the High-level Plenary\nMeeting, where bold decisions were made to promote\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals.\nOur problems transcend national boundaries. Solutions\nneed a global consensus. All of us must emphatically\nreaffirm the central role of the United Nations in the\ncooperative management of the world\u00eds problems.\nWe are constitutionally committed to uphold the\nCharter and its legitimacy based on the rule of law. In a\nglobalizing world, no nation is an island. None can\nprosper alone. The United Nations remains the only\nbastion of peace, justice and development in the world.\nReform of the United Nations is vital. We must\nfocus on its effectiveness and ability to deliver quickly.\nIts agenda and mandate must be meaningful. Its\nadministration must be reformed. Its budget must be\npurged of waste. Its major organs need to be\nreconstituted and revitalized to serve purposeful\npriorities. Expansion of its major organs is necessary\nbut must be tailored to the efficacy of the Organization.\nThe dynamics of today\u00eds world have been created\nby immense forces of change. Among them are\nadvances in science and technology and widespread\nawareness of individual rights. The resulting\nglobalization and progression of humanitarian law have\ngiven rise to a world where the very concept of\nsovereignty is being challenged, where the dimensions\nof security are in a flux, where the nature of conflict\nhas seen a seismic shift and where social exclusion has\nadded complex uncertainty. The need for constructive\nengagement, dialogue, tolerance and understanding is\nimperative. Development and the rule of law must take\ncentre stage.\nNew challenges confront us today. While\nterrorists sow panic and xenophobia in our societies,\ndeprivation, hunger, disease and environmental\ndegradation continue to fuel insecurity and\ndestabilization. The recent bombings in London and\nEgypt shocked us all. They have hardened our resolve\nto face this menace unitedly. Bangladesh condemns\nterrorism in all its forms. We have acceded to all anti-\nterrorism conventions of the United Nations and\nrelevant regional organizations. We support the early\nconclusion of a comprehensive United Nations\nconvention on terrorism. I would like to underscore our\nconviction that terrorists do not belong to any one\ncountry or religion.\nIn Bangladesh, sustained efforts are being made\nto pursue the twin objectives of responsibility at home\nand a contribution abroad. Despite enormous\nconstraints, we have made good progress to advance\ndemocracy, development and human rights. We\nrecognize that those goals are linked with one another.\nWe have moved slowly but surely to shore up a\ndemocratic ethos. The late President Ziaur Rahman led\nBangladesh out of the morass of a failed democracy in\n1975. He introduced a multi-party system, freed the\npress and opened up the economy. In 1990, a popular\nuprising against an entrenched military dictatorship\nbrought the first real push towards sustained\ndemocracy. We have not looked back. Three\nconsecutive free and fair elections have been held\nunder a neutral caretaker Government. That unique\nconstitutional innovation has ensured the peaceful\ntransfer of power on an alternating basis. Democracy\nhas become firmly rooted in Bangladesh. A key\nelement of the last election, in 2001, was the\nparticipation of more than 70 per cent of the electorate.\nWomen voters outnumbered men. They voted not for\nsymbols but for issues.\n32\n\nA quiet revolution is under way in Bangladesh in\nthe field of development. The progress is visible on six\nkey fronts: stable growth of the gross domestic product\n(GDP) at a rate of 5 per cent or more for over two\ndecades; higher per capita income; food security;\nincreased resilience in the face of natural disasters;\nimprovement of the human development index; and\nbetter social and health outcomes. Our performance in\nthose areas compares favourably with the results in our\nown region and elsewhere. A set of pragmatic, targeted\npolicy approaches have made that progress possible.\nWe have completed a full-fledged poverty reduction\nstrategy paper through an extended consultative\nprocess. It sets out a road map to meet country-specific\nMDGs. The fundamental principle of the poverty\nreduction strategy paper is to promote employment-\ngenerating economic growth and to invest significantly\nin priority sectors such as education, health and social\nsafety-net programmes. It is a matter of some\nsatisfaction that Bangladesh has achieved two of the\nMDGs: the elimination of gender disparity in primary\nand secondary schools and access to safe drinking\nwater. We are close to achieving two more goals: the\nreduction of extreme poverty and under-five child\nmortality rates.\nBangladesh is committed to upholding the dignity\nof individuals and promoting human rights. Bangladesh\nis a party to all United Nations human rights\nconventions. We are moving steadily to strengthen\ngood governance through strong democratic\ninstitutions, establish the rule of law and eliminate\nintolerance in our society.\nDeeply entrenched pockets of poverty continue to\nexist around the world. The most vulnerable are the\nleast developed countries. Their products should be\ngranted immediate duty-free and quota-free access\nglobally. As reaffirmed at Monterrey, the specific\nallocation of 0.15 to 0.2 per cent of the GDP of\ndeveloped countries must be earmarked for official\ndevelopment assistance to least developed countries.\nFinancing for development is a critical issue.\nInnovative initiatives in that regard, which have been\nthe subject of discussion, need to be pursued in earnest.\nThe devastation caused by natural disasters\naffects all countries, rich and poor alike. How can we\nmeet the challenge of effective relief, rehabilitation and\nreconstruction, as well as pre-disaster warning and\npreparations? That continues to the responsibility of\nthe United Nations.\nWe are profoundly shocked at the huge toll of\ndamage caused by Hurricane Katrina on the Gulf coast\nof the United States. Natural disasters do not\ndistinguish between rich and poor countries, and the\nhuman misery and suffering caused are the same. We,\nin Bangladesh, have weathered many severe floods and\ncyclones, and the toll in terms of life and property has\nbeen huge. We can therefore feel the torment that the\naffected people have undergone, and we offer our\nheartfelt sympathies. We know that the American\npeople can overcome the disaster and move on with\ntheir lives.\nAll countries, including Bangladesh, must seek\nways and means to contribute effectively to the United\nNations, whether through peacemaking, peacekeeping\nor peacebuilding. Active participation, innovative ideas\nand best practices in shoring up development together\ncan enhance our combined capacity to address the\nworld\u00eds problems, especially those that no one country\ncan tackle alone. We, in Bangladesh, are particularly\nproud of our contribution to peacekeeping on many\nsimultaneous fronts across the globe. In all, we have\ncontributed more than 39,000 troops to 24 missions\nand are currently among the largest contributors. Sixty-\nseven of our blue-helmeted soldiers have died in that\ncause. Our commitment to peacekeeping remains\nunflinching. We also fully support the establishment of\nthe Peacebuilding Commission.\nA priority concern for us is our close identity\nwith Africa. Through our peacekeeping efforts, we\nhave established special bonds of friendship. The New\nPartnership for Africa\u00eds Development is particularly\nencouraging. We believe that South-South cooperation\nhas specific relevance in that context.\nBangladesh reaffirms its support for the early\nestablishment of a sovereign independent State in\nPalestine, in accordance with the relevant United\nNations resolutions. The road map for peace in the\nMiddle East needs to be implemented fully and\nurgently.\nWith respect to Iraq, we believe that the present\nsituation should be resolved by preserving the interests\nof the Iraqi people, in particular their territorial\nintegrity, and by ensuring the long-term peace, security\nand stability of the region.\nBangladesh\u00eds constitutional commitment to\ngeneral and complete disarmament is the reason for our\nprogressive support of international and regional\n33\n\ntreaties and agreements covering all the Atomic Bomb\nCasualty Commission (ABCC) weapons. We are a\nparty to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty. We give precedence to human over weapons\nsecurity.\nEach year we come to the Assembly to reaffirm\nour faith in the United Nations. This sixtieth\nanniversary year is of profound significance. We must\nprovide a renewed mandate to the United Nations to\nmeet the challenges of the new millennium \u00f3 to rid\nthe world of poverty and injustice, to usher in the rule\nof law, to promote the cause of development, to\neradicate terrorism and, above all, to promote peace\nand security. We can prevail only if we act responsibly\nand together. Support for the United Nations and its\nlegitimacy remains a paramount priority."

        "file_text": "The\nrecently convened High-level Plenary Meeting at the\nlevel of heads of State or Government can rightly be\nreferred to as the major historical event of the\nbeginning of the new millennium. It is important that,\nat the summit, the international community not only\nreiterated previously undertaken commitments but also\ntook new, concrete decisions for their practical\nimplementation. Most importantly, world leaders\nclearly stated that there is no alternative to the United\nNations as an international Organization that can\ncoordinate efforts to address the challenges faced by\nhumankind.\nThrough the common political will of world\nleaders, a unique opportunity has arisen to strengthen\njoint efforts towards peaceful and sustainable social\n23\n\nand economic development and the achievement of the\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs); to progress\ntowards the eradication of poverty and disease; to\novercome humanitarian crises; and to provide a better\nworld for present and future generations.\nFurther progress requires united, concerted and\nconsistent action on the part of the international\ncommunity as a whole. There is no doubt that the\nUnited Nations must play a key role in mobilizing and\ncoordinating such efforts. We share the view that it is\nnecessary to strengthen the Organization and its\nspecialized agencies, including through the urgent\nreform of the Secretariat and of other United Nations\nbodies.\nTajikistan welcomes the outcome of the\nSeptember summit and is prepared to meet all the\ncommitments and implement all the decisions outlined\nin its outcome document. We view them as a pledge by\nthe international community to devote the necessary\nattention to human development challenges and, to that\nend, to channel additional financial resources to\ncountries in extreme need, such as Tajikistan.\nThe Millennium Development Goals must remain\nthe focus of our efforts. There is no doubt that, at the\nnational level, the pace of, and priorities in, the\nimplementation of the MDGs must be adapted to the\nconditions prevailing in particular countries, each of\nwhich has its own way of doing things and its own\nparticular characteristics.\nTajikistan aims to achieve maximum progress in\nthe implementation of the Millennium Development\nGoals. Despite the difficulties we face, we have made\nreal progress towards attaining them. According to the\nWorld Bank, noticeable positive changes have occurred\nin the area of poverty reduction: in recent years the\nnumber of people living below the poverty line has\ndecreased by 16 per cent.\nIt is clear that progress has been made in ensuring\nfood security, which is among the key priorities in\nTajikistan. The Government\u2019s objectives include the\ndevelopment of agriculture and the creation within it of\na viable private sector, and, at a minimum, a threefold\nincrease in the income of rural households.\nWe fully agree with the conclusions reached in\nthe Millennium Development Goals Needs Assessment\nreport submitted to the Secretary-General by a team of\nexperts led by Jeffrey Sachs, which state that Tajikistan\nhas a unique opportunity to achieve the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals, in the context of their major\nparameters, by 2015. Successful achievement of the\nenvisaged targets will allow Tajikistan to become, in\nCentral Asia, an example of an emerging democracy\ncharacterized by equality and prosperity.\nTajikistan is currently at a turning point in its\ndevelopment. The armed conflict was resolved within a\nshort period of time, and the complex peacebuilding\nphase, which is being successfully implemented with\nUnited Nations support, is approaching its conclusion.\nOver the last five years, with the involvement of the\nUnited Nations Office in Tajikistan, the country has\nsuccessfully travelled the difficult road of national\nreconciliation, enhancing its stability, establishing\ndemocratic institutions, promoting the rule of law and\nensuring respect for human rights.\nStability and the implementation of first-\ngeneration reforms have brought about a speedy\nincrease in gross domestic product, with an annual\nincrease of 9.3 per cent over the past five years. The\nrehabilitation of the country's economy is progressing.\nAt the same time, the Republic's authorities have a\nclear idea of the scale and complexity of the problems\nfacing the country and are fully aware of their\nresponsibilities in addressing social and economic\nproblems, and they are undertaking every possible\nmeasure for their resolution.\nTajikistan is one the first countries in the world to\nhave generated, with the assistance of the United\nNations, an estimate of the overall costs and resources\nrequired for the implementation of the MDGs. The\nMillennium Development Goals Needs Assessment\nidentified the fundamental structural and institutional\nreforms needed in Tajikistan to create an enabling\nenvironment for achieving the MDGs; policy priorities\nin respective sectors; and financial schemes for funding\nthe development of rural areas, the educational and\nhealth systems, the water supply and sanitation\ninfrastructures, and the environment.\nAccording to The Millennium Development\nGoals Needs Assessment, Tajikistan will need about\n$13 billion over the next 10 years to achieve the\nrequired progress in the implementation of the MDGs.\nHowever, the Millennium Development Goals\nNeeds Assessment is only the first concrete measure.\nBased on that document, a National Strategy for\nDevelopment for 2006-2008 and a more detailed\n24\n\nStrategy for Poverty Reduction for 2006-2008 are\ncurrently being elaborated in Tajikistan. These\nmeasures, undertaken by the Government of Tajikistan,\nfully accord with the decisions of the summit on the\nelaboration of national strategies for development.\nTajikistan's social and economic development\nwill depend largely on the international community's\napproach to addressing existing challenges, including\npoverty eradication; development financing; the\ncreation of an equitable system of world trade; the\nalleviation of the consequences of natural disasters;\nand the resolution of demographic problems. That is\nwhy the summit's decisions on such a crucial issue as\ndevelopment financing are of pivotal importance for\nTajikistan.\nAllow me briefly to touch on some key issues.\nI turn first to needs related to official assistance\nfor development. In cooperation with United Nations\nexperts, we assessed our needs in this area in a detailed\nand transparent manner. Currently, our financial\nrequirements for sustainable development considerably\nexceed the available federal and external resources. Of\nthe $930 million that international donors have\ncommitted to allocate to Tajikistan during the period\n2003-2005, only 40 per cent has actually been\nprovided. We call on the international community to\ndouble, at a minimum, existing aid for the\nimplementation of the MDGs.\nReducing the burden of foreign debt is of special\nimportance for us, since the funds released can be\ninvested in development. Due to the efforts undertaken\nby the Government to reduce the burden of servicing\nforeign debt, some progress has been achieved in the\nrestructuring of bilateral debts in recent years.\nHowever, in the near future, the debt burden will\nremain heavy. According to estimates, this year debt\nwill equal more than 40 per cent of gross domestic\nproduct, and it will continue to pose a threat to the\nmacro-economic stability of the country and to plans\nfor development.\nThe economy and trade in Tajikistan depend to a\nlarge extent on favourable conditions in the world\nmarket. Tajikistan hopes for the successful completion\nof the Doha round of trade negotiations within the\nWorld Trade Organization, in order that it may fully\nrealize its potential in the field of development and so\nthat progress can be made towards an open and\nequitable system of world trade.\nLack of access to the sea and remoteness from\nworld markets significantly increase transit\ntransportation expenditures, make it harder for the\ncountry to participate in world trade and directly affect\nthe poverty rate in the country. In that context, the\npromotion of regional cooperation, primarily with\nneighbouring countries, is a key factor for the\nachievement of the MDGs in Tajikistan.\nOur region faces specific problems, given that the\nestablishment of an environment conducive to\ndeveloping trade relations and the promotion of\neconomic relations as a whole depends, in many\nrespects, on the success of the stabilization and\npeacebuilding processes in neighbouring Afghanistan.\nWith respect to the country's post-conflict\nrehabilitation, it is clear that, at the regional level,\nactive involvement by the States of Central Asia\nneighbouring Afghanistan in its development will be\nkey to the success of the efforts undertaken there.\nIn this connection, Tajikistan believes that it is\nabsolutely essential that Afghanistan share in the\nmultifaceted process of regional cooperation. We\nexpect our region's leading international partners to\nprovide appropriate support for that process. Indeed,\nthat issue could be considered by the new United\nNations Peacebuilding Commission.\nAlthough we rely on international assistance, the\nGovernment of Tajikistan is making increased efforts\nto utilize the country's own capacity to the fullest\nextent. Tajikistan's water resources offer enormous\nadvantages in terms of the implementation of the\nMDGs. Unfortunately, less than 5 per cent of their\npotential is currently being exploited.\nRational and fair management of water resources\nwill contribute directly to progress towards the MDGs\nby helping to address challenges related to, inter alia,\nfood security, employment, sanitation, the reduction of\ndisease and increased school attendance. Our common\ngoal is to develop a qualitatively new pattern of\nsustainable water resource management and to address\nwater economy challenges at the national, regional and\ninternational levels by bringing together international\ncommunity support and national efforts, while ensuring\nthat the countries themselves and even subregions\nfacing water supply problems play the leading role.\nWe expect all countries and all of the specialized\nagencies of the United Nations to take an active part in\nevents relating to the International Decade for Action\n25\n\n\\\"Water for Life\\\", the success of which will depend on\njoint activities being undertaken. That should make a\ncommon, tangible contribution to the future of\nhumankind.\nAs a country that has lived through civil conflict,\nTajikistan considers progress in the implementation of\nthe MDGs to be of special significance. The successful\nsocial and economic development of the country is the\nkey to preventing a recurrence of such conflict. Our\nexperience teaches us that creating conditions that can\nprevent the resumption of conflict and strengthen the\nprocess of advancing social and economic development\nin countries that have lived through such conflict must\nbe among the key goals of the international\ncommunity. In this connection, we fully share the\nconviction that the United Nations must focus on\novercoming and preventing conflict and on post-\nconflict rehabilitation and development. We hope that\nthe new United Nations Peacebuilding Commission\nwill expand the capacity of the international\ncommunity to respond to the needs of post-conflict\ncountries and allow a direct link to be made between\nsecurity and development. The Economic and Social\nCouncil is called upon to play its role in that process.\nTajikistan, which suffered in its struggle for\nindependence, has resolutely set out on the democratic\nroad towards development, and will not turn back. The\ninternational community, first and foremost the United\nNations, has made an enormous contribution in that\nregard, and for many years we have benefited from its\ngenerous assistance and selfless support.\nWe are convinced that the United Nations should\nremain the key body for regulating international\nrelations in the new millennium. We are working on\nthe assumption that the consolidating function of the\nUnited Nations should be enhanced. The reform of the\nOrganization should be rational, and the renewed\nUnited Nations itself should be strong and capable of\nresponding to world events in a swift and proper\nmanner so that it can effectively counteract the many\nglobal challenges and threats of a new generation.\nTajikistan will make its own contribution in that area\nwith a view to strengthening the United Nations and\nenhancing its role in the modern world."

        "file_text": "This is the\nfirst time that a representative from the island of\nBarbuda has had the honour to address the General\nAssembly. For my country, the nation of Antigua and\nBarbuda - and, more important, for my fellow\nBarbudans - this is indeed a historic and significant\nmilestone.\nThe Government and the people of Antigua and\nBarbuda have full confidence in the multilateral\nsystem, and in the United Nations as the primary\ninstrument of multilateralism. Further, we believe that\nonly through cooperation at the international level can\nmicro-States like Antigua and Barbuda begin to\naddress the global threats and challenges that\njeopardize our existence, our way of life and our ability\nto make progress.\nAntigua and Barbuda attaches great importance to\nthe work of the United Nations and to the outcome of\nthe collective decisions of the family of nations. We\nlook forward to safeguards for small developing States\nin all stages of multilateral processes, and specifically\nin the outcome document of the 2005 world summit\n(resolution 60/1).\nTaking stock of the achievement of the objectives\nof the outcome of major United Nations conferences\nand summits is a task we approach with trepidation.\n15\n\nAntigua and Barbuda is attempting to achieve and\nsustain a decent standard of living for our people and\nfor future generations. Our progress report is a mixed\none, tinged with both hope and frustration. We are\nhopeful because we have achieved a lot with our\nmeagre resources. In the face of severe economic\nhardship, we have managed to achieve a literacy rate of\nover 90 per cent among young people aged 15 to 25\nyears. Access to primary and secondary education is\nmandatory and is provided free of cost by the\nGovernment to all students aged 5 to 16. All public\nschool students are provided with school uniforms and\nthe required textbooks free of cost. To accommodate\nour expanding student population, only this week we\ncommissioned a new school on my island of Barbuda.\nPoor people need access to the necessary\nresources so that they can take charge of their own\ndevelopment. That is why the Barbudan people are\nextremely proud of what we consider to be a very\nprogressive land policy for the ownership of land on\nour island. The Barbuda Lands Act, which is scheduled\nto be introduced in Parliament shortly, stipulates that\nall land on Barbuda be owned in common by the\nBarbudan people.\nIn the area of health care, we in Antigua and\nBarbuda have a national medical benefits programme\nthat provides low-cost access to health-care services\nand prescription drugs. Our child mortality rate is\namong the lowest in developing countries, and our\nnutrition level for children aged 5 years and under is\namong the highest.\nThe promotion of gender equality and the\nempowerment of women has been a priority area for\nAntigua and Barbuda. We signed and ratified the\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of\nDiscrimination Against Women, and are currently\nworking on the ratification of the Convention's\nOptional Protocol. With regard to the Millennium\nDevelopment Goal pertaining to the empowerment of\nwomen, Antigua and Barbuda has made noteworthy\nstrides. Our first woman was elected to Parliament in\nthe last general elections. Our Speaker of Parliament\nand our President of the Senate are women, and there\nare two women in our Cabinet. Concerted efforts have\nbeen made to promote women's political participation\nat all levels.\nIn spite of such progress, however, we continue\nto experience a high level of frustration with regard to\ndevelopment. That is because the progress we have\nmade thus far is at risk of being wiped away. As a\nmiddle-income small island developing State, we are\ncontinually handed the sharp edge of the sword to hold\nwhen it comes to a number of issues of international\ndevelopment. It is as if we were being punished by the\ninternational community for having achieved some\nmeasure of progress with very meagre resources and\ndespite severe external challenges.\nThe Monterrey Consensus represents a pact\nbetween developed and developing countries, the\nobjective of which is the scaling up of financing for\ndevelopment. Yet there is nothing in the Monterrey\nConsensus that so-called middle-income countries can\nbenefit from. We have fulfilled the responsibilities\naccorded to Governments of developing countries as\nstipulated in the Monterrey Consensus. We continue to\ngo beyond those responsibilities to consolidate the\nprinciples of accountability, transparency and good\ngovernance in laws we introduced in Parliament in the\nseventh month of the first term of the incumbent\nGovernment of Antigua and Barbuda.\nAll of that took place against a backdrop of a\ndeclining trend in the flow of official development\nassistance (ODA) to the Caribbean region. It is\nnecessary for international agreements on financing for\ndevelopment, such as the Monterrey Consensus, to\ninclude all developing countries, and not sideline those\nthat have achieved some measure of progress. Our\nfrustration with the Monterrey Consensus, and with\nfinancing for development in general, would not be so\nacute were it not been for the brutal challenges we face\nin other areas that are potential engines for economic\ngrowth and development.\nWe have been forced to ask ourselves if a pro-\ndevelopment trade regime is something the\ninternational community really wants. Our neighbours\nin the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) have been\ndragged through brutal trade battles, struggling to keep\nalive their agricultural sector, namely, the banana and\nsugar industries. The Caribbean Community has for\nyears been lamenting the importance of those two\nsectors to the livelihood of our people. A pro-\ndevelopment trade regime would not amputate the feet\nof such small vulnerable players and leave them to\nhaemorrhage. And that is exactly what has transpired\nwith regard to our banana- and sugar-producing\nCARICOM neighbours.\n16\n\nAs if that were not enough, we in Antigua and\nBarbuda now find ourselves under attack in yet another\nsector. Last week, during the 2005 world summit, the\nPrime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda (see\nA/60/PV.4) spoke of the need for us to seek the\nintervention of the World Trade Organization in the\ndispute with the United States over Internet gaming.\nWith trade in agriculture proving continually difficult\nfor developing States in general, and for small island\nStates in particular, the services sector is just about the\nonly option we currently have for diversification. For\nAntigua and Barbuda, the tourism sector has been good\nto us, but it is extremely volatile, and our high levels of\nenvironmental and economic vulnerability necessitate\nstrategically identifying other options for economic\ngrowth and development. One such option is Internet\ngaming. But due to the unfair trade practices of highly\ndeveloped countries, notably the United States, we are\nfinding it increasingly difficult to realize development\nbenefits from Internet gaming.\nIn addition to that, the principle of special and\ndifferential treatment for countries with special needs,\nsuch as small island developing States, is under\nperpetual assault by highly developed countries. After\ncareful consideration and evaluation, we are forced to\nconclude that there is nothing tangible for small\ndeveloping States in the Monterrey Consensus. We are\nlosing the battle on the issue of trade, and so we\nattempt to hitch our proverbial wagon to foreign direct\ninvestment as a means of stimulating economic growth\nand development. But once again, our efforts meet with\nfrustration. Why? Because of unsustainable debt.\nOur experience has shown that highly indebted\ncountries find it extremely difficult to attract private\ninternational finance. The international community\nnow realizes the importance of debt reduction and debt\nforgiveness to development. We urge that the situation\nof heavily indebted middle-income countries be given\nserious attention by the international community. If\nmore is not done to address the debt problem of\nmiddle-income countries, we risk reversing our\ndevelopment gains. Instead of a reduction, the net\nresult may actually be increasing levels of poverty.\nAntigua and Barbuda fully supports all efforts to\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).\nWith regard to environmental sustainability, small\nislands like Antigua and Barbuda face the challenge of\nvery limited land space and fragile ecosystems, and are\nhighly vulnerable to natural disasters and the effects of\nclimate change. Compounding those challenges is our\nheavy dependence on the natural environment to\nsupport our tourism product, which accounts for almost\n80 per cent of our gross national income. Two thirds of\nthe island of Barbuda is merely a few feet above sea\nlevel. Threats to our natural environment are threats to\nour very way of life and existence. We therefore\nwelcome paragraphs 51 to 53 in the 2005 world\nsummit outcome document on the issue of climate\nchange.\nThe devastation wrought by the increased\nintensity of hurricanes has set us back years, even\ndecades, on the development scale. Antigua and\nBarbuda stresses the need for policies to mitigate the\neffects of hurricanes and other natural disasters on\nsmall developing States, as well as the establishment of\nan effective system of long-term support for countries\nrecovering from disasters.\nInternational drug trafficking has major security\nimplications for our islands. Drug traffickers often use\nour shores and surrounding waters as trans-shipment\npoints for their illegal cargo, resulting in an increase in\nthe criminal element within our fragile societies. Those\ncriminals operate within very sophisticated networks\nthat are beyond the reach and capacity of our\nresources. It is a situation that puts the security of the\nentire region at risk. This is one area that begs for\ngreater international attention.\nAntigua and Barbuda is in agreement with many\nof the recommendations to strengthen the United\nNations, as contained in the outcome document of the\n2005 world summit. We support those reform\nproposals, the objective of which is to make the United\nNations more democratic, increase its legitimacy and\nenhance its work.\nAt a time when multilateralism is coming under\nattack, we, as small developing States, remain ever\nmindful of the need for the United Nations. We share\nequally in the quest for peace and security and are\nheartened by the growing recognition that there can be\nno peace and security without development. We call for\nfurther and unambiguous acknowledgement of the\nsecurity-development nexus and for the economic\ndevelopment of all countries to be accorded equal\npriority as international peace and security."

        "file_text": "I bring warm\ngreetings, Sir, from the Government and people of\nSolomon Islands, and I wish to congratulate the\nPresident on his election to lead the General Assembly\nat its sixtieth session. I would like to assure him of\nSolomon Islands\u2019 support and cooperation during his\nterm in office as he guides the work of the Assembly\nover the next 12 months.\nMy delegation would also like to commend and\nregister its deep appreciation to his predecessor, our\ncolleague, the Honourable Jean Ping, Foreign Minister\nof Gabon, for his invaluable contribution and able\nleadership of the proceedings of fifty-ninth session of\nthe General Assembly.\n28\n\nSolomon Islands also extends its gratitude to\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan for his vision,\ndedication and leadership in making the United\nNations relevant and responsive to today\u2019s threats.\nThis Organization rose out of the ashes of the\nSecond World War with the sole purpose of ensuring\nthat never again would the world allow crimes against\nhumanity to flourish. Sixty years on, genocide,\nterrorism, HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and hunger\ncontinue to claim millions of lives annually. According\nto a recent World Health Organization report,\npreventable disease, such as malaria, claims more lives\nthan today\u2019s conflicts put together. Of 300 to 500\nmillion clinical cases annually, 1.5 to 2.7 million lives\nare lost. In this connection, Solomon Islands suffers\nhigher rates of malaria and maternal mortality than any\nother country in the Pacific region. My delegation is\npleased to see the summit agree on the establishment\nand implementation of \u201cquick win\u201d initiatives, such as\nfree distribution of treated bed nets and antimalarial\nmedicines. But more needs to be done; a\ncomprehensive malaria eradication programme on\npublic and environmental health must be initiated and\nimplemented simultaneously.\nDespite these overwhelming facts, the world\ncontinues to spend even more on military programmes\nand equipment. The lack of progress on disarmament\nand non-proliferation, with the continuing threat of\nterrorism, begs the question as to whether the world\nhas indeed become safer, more stable and protected, as\nthe founders of the United Nations Charter envisioned.\nIt further raises the question whether international\nframeworks and cooperation agreements have, in fact,\ncontained today\u2019s threats.\nSolomon Islands condemns terrorism in all its\nforms. In this regard, we are embarking on a legislative\nprocess, with New Zealand\u2019s support, to increase our\nnational capacity in enhancing regional security\narrangements through the Nasonini Declaration on\nRegional Security and the Honiara Declaration on Law\nEnforcement Cooperation, particularly as concerns\nthreats posed by international terrorism and\ntransnational crimes.\nIn keeping with this year\u2019s theme, \u201cFor a stronger\nand more effective United Nations: the follow-up and\nimplementation of the High-level Plenary Meeting in\nSeptember 2005\u201d, we are faced with the challenge of\ncontinuing the reform process. As my Prime Minister\npointed out last week during the high-level summit, we\nmust not solve today\u2019s problems with yesterday\u2019s\nsolutions, but rather with a new vision that will build a\nstronger multilateral system to confront threats and\nchallenges in the twenty-first century. Solomon Islands\nnotes and supports the Summit Outcome (resolution\n60/1) as a starting point for change.\nCurrent reforms to rejuvenate the multilateral\nsystem must occur at three levels \u2014 international,\nregional and national. The forthcoming Doha process,\nbeginning in December of this year, will provide\nanother opportunity for the international community to\nequitably spread the fruits of globalization, take to task\nthe imbalance that exists within the economic\ninternational system and address the challenges of\nvulnerable and fragile States. The Doha development\nagenda must accord stable and predictable market\naccess to all least developed countries\u2019 products,\ntechnology transfer and human resources development.\nFor Solomon Islands to share the fruits of the\nmultilateral trading system in a meaningful way, it\nmust first address the domestic bottlenecks that impede\nits full participation, such as supply-side restraints and\nother \u201cbehind-the-door\u201d complementary policies that\nare not conducive to a business-friendly environment.\nThe Brussels Declaration and the Programme for\nAction for the Least Developed Countries will be\nreviewed beginning next year. The lack of\nimplementation of the Brussels Programme speaks of\nthe international community\u2019s commitment to 700\nmillion of the world\u2019s most vulnerable persons.\nSolomon Islands is off track in terms of meeting its\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) obligation;\nhowever, as a least developed country in the Asia/\nPacific region, it is committed to meeting its MDGs\nand seeks international support and attention in this\nendeavour. Poverty has no boundaries, and we\nacknowledge and support the Jakarta Declaration. For\nthe MDGs and other benefits to be realized and\nsustained, Solomon Islands will need to grow its\neconomy. Solomon Islands also calls for a greater in-\ncountry presence on the part of the United Nations to\nwork in partnership with us to meet the Goals.\nSolomon Islands supports the proposal to\nestablish the Peacebuilding Commission. The\nCommission will play a difficult and important role in\nassisting countries that are emerging from conflict\nsituations to reintegrate, reconstruct and rebuild State\ninstitutions in order to maintain peace, security and\n29\n\neconomic stability. In that light, the Regional\nAssistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) is\na shining example from which the Commission could\ndraw lessons. It has demonstrated that, with courage\nand determination, the principles and institutions of\ndemocracy and human rights can be safeguarded and\nprotected. A two-pronged approach of law and order\ncomplemented by economic security and carried out in\nthe spirit of true partnership will create an opportunity\nfor peace to prosper. Solomon Islands also welcomes\nthe Assembly\u2019s endorsement of the concept of the\nresponsibility to protect populations from genocide, war\ncrimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, as\ncontained in the summit\u2019s outcome document.\nSolomon Islands would like to express its deep\nappreciation to Australia, New Zealand and our good\nfriends and neighbours, the Pacific Island countries for\ntheir continued support and contribution to Regional\nAssistance Mission. We could not have done it without\nthem, and I thank them.\nSolomon Islands needs to progress beyond the\ninitial crisis of law and order, but the challenge\nremains to nurture the country and build an economy to\nsustain it. Per capita income in Solomon Islands has\ncurrently dropped to more than 20 per cent below the\n1995 level. To repair that situation, Solomon Islands\nmust address harmful past policies of economic\nmismanagement, a lack of fiscal discipline, faulty\ngovernance and capacity constraints at all levels.\nSolomon Islands is well endowed with natural\nresources and a young population that can form the\nbasis of a good labour supply, but it lacks both human\ncapital and physical capital, with poor infrastructure to\nlift productivity and deliver sustainable growth that is\nbroad-based, rurally focused and people-centred.\nThat is why the Government is initiating a\nstrategy to attract and build capital. The strategy hinges\non establishing a stable macroeconomic environment,\ncreating simple business-friendly tax and regulatory\nregimes and improving infrastructure and good\ngovernance. With respect to establishing a credible\nfiscal policy, we have returned the budget to surpluses.\nRevenues have been enhanced. Expenditures have been\ntightened and prioritized. Monetary policies are being\nfine-tuned and aligned. State-owned enterprises\ncontinue to be reformed, with steps taken to remove\nbarriers and improve efficient shipping networks,\nwhich are critical for island nations. Those initiatives\nwill be coupled with a new draft investment law, a\ncredible budget for 2006 and the introduction of a fair\nand simple tax reform bill, which will be submitted to\nthe Parliament at its next sitting.\nDebt levels remain crippling, amounting to more\nthan 100 per cent of the gross domestic product of the\nSolomon Islands. Talks with creditors have begun to\nestablish a workable debt strategy. The innovative\napproach advocated by the Philippines of a debt-for-\nequity swap to finance MDG projects is worth looking\ninto.\nCapacity-building in governance that is free from\ncorruption is vital for rural development, health and\neducation. Leadership and governance, which are\ncritical for stability and economic development, are\nbeing improved by clarifying rules and expectations\nand by adopting an outcome-oriented approach. That\nwill improve the transparency of public processes and\nthe effectiveness of institutions.\nSolomon Islands acknowledges the contributions\nof Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Japan,\nthe European Union, Taiwan, the Asian Development\nBank and the World Bank, among other donor partners,\nin support of Government initiatives to rebuild our\nfragile and shattered State. Solomon Islands must\nconsolidate the gains achieved in the past two years on\nthe security and economic fronts and move forward\nconstructively. Much is yet to be done.\nOn climate change, the world continues to\nexperience changing weather patterns and has seen an\nincrease in the frequency and intensity of natural\ndisasters. Small island developing States (SIDS), such\nas Solomon Islands, are more vulnerable and\nsusceptible to natural disasters, and we call for the\ninternational community to renew its focus on, and\nconcrete commitment to, the issue of climate change,\nin line with the summit\u2019s outcome document. My\ndelegation welcomes the entry into force of the Kyoto\nProtocol in February this year and calls on those\ncountries that have not yet ratified the Protocol to do\nso at their earliest convenience.\nIn the light of the Asian tsunami of last\nDecember, it would be cost-effective for the world to\ninvest in mitigation measures, in particular renewable\nenergy resources. The Hyogo strategy of the Kobe\nConference and the Mauritius Strategy of January this\nyear provide an excellent starting point. Sadly,\nhowever, the Group of Eight meeting on climate\n30\n\nchange did not take decisive action. For that reason,\nSolomon Islands, as a member of the Alliance of Small\nIsland States, urges the Group of Eight to reconsider\nthe issue, because the environment has an impact on\nthe physical survival of small island developing States.\nCloser to home, Solomon Islands wishes to\nacknowledge the completion of the United Nations\nObserver Mission in Bougainville, Papua New Guinea,\nwith the successful election in Papua New Guinea\u2019s\nnewly autonomous province of Bougainville. We wish\nour closest Melanesian neighbour every success in\nbuilding on the political gains made so far, and we\nassure Bougainville of our commitment to all bilateral\ncooperative arrangements. Solomon Islands also\nacknowledges Papua New Guinea\u2019s ongoing bilateral\nassistance to Solomon Islands.\nWith respect to Security Council reform,\nSolomon Islands believes that the membership of the\nCouncil should reflect the political and economic\nrealities of our time. In that regard, Solomon Islands\nsupports the expansion of the Security Council and\nfeels that a country such as Japan, which has strong\nbilateral links with Solomon Islands, should be\naccorded a permanent seat on the Council. Japan\u2019s\ninclusion will contribute to bridging the divide between\nthe multilateral institutions and Member States.\nThis year marks the tenth anniversary of the\nBeijing Platform for Action. The results have been\nmixed. Solomon Islands believes that improving the\nwelfare of women is an indispensable requirement for\nsustainable security. At the regional level, issues\nrelating to the empowerment of women are being\nincorporated into the Pacific Plan, which will be\ndiscussed by Pacific Islands Forum leaders in October\nthis year.\nThe United Nations was founded on the principle\nof maintaining international peace and security. Over\nthe years, some threats continue to receive more\nattention than others. The Anti-Secession Law enacted\nby the People\u2019s Republic of China in March this year\nhas threatened peace and security on the Taiwan Strait.\nThe situation creates a security vacuum that, if left\nunattended, will continue to fester and will put in\nquestion the credibility of this premier multilateral\ninstitution. There is no mechanism to address such threats\nwithin the parameters of the United Nations Charter.\nSolomon Islands therefore renews its call to have\nthe issue debated in the General Assembly. The time\nhas now come for this body to allow Taiwan, a major\nplayer in the international economic system, to take its\nrightful place in the United Nations. The Assembly\ncannot continue to ignore the plight of the 23 million\npeople of Taiwan. Solomon Islands regrets the manner\nin which the Assembly has dealt with the issue,\nallowing certain countries to dictate the agenda.\nWith respect to the reform of the Secretariat,\nSolomon Islands would like to see the Secretariat\nreflect the diversity of its membership. The current\nrecruitment process of having external, rather than in-\ncountry, examinations has deterred potential applicants\nfrom small island developing States from applying,\ngiven the associated expenses.\nIn conclusion, Solomon Islands supports\nmultilateralism, and I assure the President of our\nongoing support for United Nations reform."

        "file_text": "Before proceeding \nwith my remarks, I wish to begin by indicating that my \ndelegation fully subscribes to the statement delivered \nby the presidency of the European Union.  \n At the outset, Sir, let me express my sincere \ncongratulations to you on your election to the \npresidency of this session of the General Assembly and \nmy sincere gratitude to Mr. Jean Ping, President at the \nfifty-ninth session, for his tireless efforts during a very \ncrucial year for the United Nations. \n With the end of the summit, we have entered a far \nmore crucial phase, that of the follow-up and \nimplementation of its outcome and the furtherance of \nthe progress achieved, especially in terms of those \ntargets which have been subject to an enforcement road \n \n \n05-51226 11 \n \nmap since the Millennium Summit. The realization of \nthe content of the summit outcome document \n(resolution 60/1) in conjunction with reforming the \nUnited Nations, may very well decide the \nOrganization\u2019s relevance and standing in decades to \ncome and with it the fate of our attempts to render \neffective multilateralism the cornerstone of \ninternational order. Beyond the wide spectrum of \nissues covered in the summit\u2019s outcome document, we \nmust not lose sight of those realities on which the \nUnited Nations must \u2014 and is expected to \u2014 remain \nprimarily focused. For these, we must go back to the \ngenesis of the Organization. In the wake of the Second \nWorld War, a vision emerged to establish a system of \ncollective security and institutionalized mechanisms \nthat would ensure the maximization of conflict \nprevention and the minimization of the duration and \nimpact of a conflict.  \n Not only has the new century inherited many of \nthe challenges and problems of the previous one, but \nnew scourges have emerged that jeopardize the \nlegitimacy and the very existence of our system of \ncollective security. These require an urgent response \nfrom the international community through an action-\noriented strategy encompassing the appropriate \ninstitutional framework, appropriate decision-making \nmechanisms and the efficient implementation of our \ncommitments. Fulfilling our pledges in a timely \nmanner is not a responsibility applicable only to \ntraditional security threats. Terrorism, transnational \ncrime and many other security deficits require our full \nattention in the form of elaborating result-oriented \naction plans. Regarding, for instance, weapons of mass \ndestruction, although we are aware of the inextricable \nlink between disarmament and non-proliferation, we \nhave not yet been able to strike the kind of balance that \nwould allow us to pursue them equally and \nsimultaneously. And while we have identified \nunderdevelopment and poverty as key enemies of \nstability, this realization is not yet adequately reflected \nin our actions.  \n The assessment of the current state of the world \nthrough the comprehensive report of the Secretary-\nGeneral on the work of the Organization, which we \nhave before us in document A/60/1, leads to the \nconclusion that long-standing conflicts, with all their \nramifications, remain a primary source of concern for \nthe international community. Africa is a prime example \nof this. Today more than ever, and rightly so, it remains \nat the core of our mobilization. Our endeavour to make \na difference there in terms of conflict resolution, \npeacekeeping and peacebuilding and fighting poverty, \nunderdevelopment and deadly diseases will be the \nlitmus test of the effectiveness of our commitment to \nmeet the Millennium Goals. \n The Middle East is another test case. In recent \nweeks it has been proven that reciprocal gestures have \nthe capacity to construct common ground, even where \nthat does not seem on the surface to exist. Israel\u2019s \nwithdrawal from Gaza and parts of the northern West \nBank is an important development that should lead to \nthe implementation of the Quartet\u2019s road map. Israel\u2019s \nparadigm of removing settlers is one to be followed by \nother occupying Powers using settlers as a means of \nwarfare. Even though the security situation is still \nfragile, and even though the political negotiation might \nnot always be moving forward, the parties are offered a \nclosed course in the form of the road map, which has \nthe potential to steadily lead to progress. Furthermore, \nwe firmly believe that the gathering momentum would \nbe aided by strict adherence to international law and \ninternational humanitarian law, including the 4 July \n2004 advisory opinion of the International Court of \nJustice on the construction of the barrier. \n Let me now turn to the Cyprus problem. Almost \n18 months have elapsed since the April 2004 referenda \non the Annan plan. Let me stress once more that in \nrejecting that plan the Greek Cypriots rejected neither \nfinding a solution that would reunify Cyprus nor the \nurgency of achieving this. They rejected that particular \nplan because it did not provide for and could not bring \nabout the reunification of the country, its society, its \neconomy and its institutions. During this time we have \nnot remained idle. Our priority has been to revisit the \ncontent, product and shortcomings of the last \nnegotiation process which led to the referenda. \nSimultaneously, emphasis was placed on dispelling \ncertain misconceptions that were solidified as a result \nof the last negotiation process. \n One such misconception was that our constant \nand keen pursuit of peace and of achieving the \nreunification of our country has been diminished or \nthat we have come to terms with the unacceptable \ndivision of our country which was imposed in 1974 by \nthe invasion and occupation of 37 per cent of our land. \nThe second misconception concerns the role of the \nUnited Nations in offering and continuing its good \noffices mission mandated to the Secretary-General by \n  \n \n12 05-51226 \n \nthe Security Council. The Secretary-General\u2019s mandate \nfor the good offices mission has not come to an end but \nhas entered a new phase with the end of the referenda. \nRegardless of its level of activation at different times, \nthis mission is an ongoing and sustained process. \nThrough it we expect the Organization to broker a \nnegotiated settlement without any arbitration. The \nactive contribution of the European Union in this \nregard would be catalytic. Only an agreed settlement \nendorsed by the leadership of the two communities can \nbe put to referenda. The timetable for seeking a \nsolution should genuinely and exclusively be \ndetermined by the parameters of the Cyprus problem, \nand as such there should be no deadlines embedded in \nthe process that are dictated by exogenous elements. \nWe remain committed to holding negotiations under \nthe umbrella of the United Nations and to working for \nthe creation of those conditions that will render fruitful \nnegotiations feasible. In this context we have been \nimplementing substantial practical measures on the \nground with the aim of building confidence and \npromoting the economic development of the Turkish \nCypriots. We hope that enhancing cooperation between \nGreek and Turkish Cypriots will be conducive to \nmaking progress on different aspects of the Cyprus \nproblem, especially the elements composing its \nhumanitarian dimension such as the fate of missing \npersons and the welfare of those in enclaves. \n The divisive character of the most recent plan, \nwhich essentially led to its rejection, epitomized its \nremoteness from the essence of the problem. Another \nsource of great concern is the apparent willingness of \nactors involved in the process to concede a \ndisproportionately large number of politically driven \ndemands at the expense of those principles that should \ngovern the solution. It should be clarified that a \nsettlement should be formulated on the basis of the \nconcerns and expectations of the people of Cyprus as a \nwhole and should not aim at accommodating the \ninterests of foreign Powers on the island. The Cyprus \nproblem is at a critical juncture. Time may not be \nworking in favour of reaching a settlement, but we \nmust keep in mind that we cannot afford any more \nfailed attempts. We should be particularly cautious but \nresolute. Revival of the talks requires thorough \npreparation and an honest assessment that the prospect \nof success is at least credible. This in turn requires \nconfirmation that the Turkish political aims have now \nchanged and that Turkey has reconciled itself to the \nfact that achieving a settlement is synonymous with the \nconcept of a single, reunified State. \n We have always hoped that Turkey\u2019s accession \ncourse to the European Union would radically shift its \nmentality, a prospect that would mark the single \nbiggest development in the Cyprus problem in decades. \nThe fulfilment of Turkey\u2019s obligations emanating from \nits accession course to the European Union will ipso \njure rid the Cyprus problem of some of its most \nintractable components and facilitate a settlement. \nSimultaneously, the existence of the United Nations \nnegotiating framework cannot serve as a pretext for \npostponing or refusing to fulfil these obligations.  \n For our part, we remain committed to a bizonal, \nbicommunal federal Cyprus in line with what we \nconsider to be the pillars of the survival of this model \nof settlement \u2014 the high-level agreements, United \nNations resolutions, international law and the acquis \ncommunautaire. We anticipate that these will safeguard \nthe right of all Cypriots to preserve their fundamental \ninterests while simultaneously taking into account their \nmost basic concerns. \n Aside from procedure, the time has come to go \nback to basics and realize that as long as the basic \naspects of the problem are not truly tackled, progress \nwill be difficult. Without dealing with the core \ncomponents of the problem by putting an end to the \nmilitary occupation, the massive violations of human \nrights and the plight of the refugees and by effectively \naddressing the question of settlers deliberately and \nillegally transported to the occupied part of the island, \nthere can be no solution. At the same time, for progress \nto be realized on the ground all secessionist attempts \non Cyprus must be terminated immediately, in \naccordance with the relevant Security Council \nresolutions, and a single vision based on the unification \nof the island must prevail.  \n Unfortunately, however, we have not been \nmoving closer to these imperatives. Instead we have \nbeen witnessing for well over a year a tendency to \nentrench the faits accomplis on Cyprus, particularly \nthrough an outburst of illegal exploitation of Greek-\nCypriot-owned property in its occupied part. \n In establishing the new constitutional and \ninstitutional set-up we should avoid artificial structures \nthat will require an abnormally long transitional period \nto be absorbed by the people and the institutions at a \ngreat socio-economic cost. We visualize that seeking a \n \n \n05-51226 13 \n \nsettlement will increasingly centre on and fall under \nthe establishment of a functional, working democracy \nthat does not require exceptionally taxing efforts for \nbasic governance. We also visualize that with Cyprus\u2019s \nmembership of the European Union taking solid root, a \nsettlement would encompass an integration of the \ncurrently occupied area to the characteristics of a \nEuropean society and the standards of the acquis \ncommunautaire in full harmony with the rest of the \nisland, and leading to a process of osmosis there.

Finally, we commend the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his courageous and tireless\ninitiatives to renew and revitalize the United Nations\nsystem.\nThe sixtieth session of the General Assembly is\ntaking place in an international situation characterized\nnot only by recurrent wars but also by the resurgence\nof terrorist acts that spare no region in the world and\nby natural disasters that have plunged many families\ninto mourning.

A Human Rights Council would,\ntogether with the International Criminal Court, enhance\nthe effectiveness of mechanisms to promote and defend\nhuman rights.\nInstitutional reform of the United Nations -\nencompassing, of course, all its principal organs,\nincluding the General Assembly, the Security Council,\nthe Economic and Social Council and the\nSecretariat - like reform of the internal management\nof our Organization, is both a political and a moral\nimperative that would enable the United Nations to\nmove with the times and to prepare more effectively to\nface the coming decades.\nThe Congo regrets, however, that the serious\nissue of disarmament was not even mentioned in the\noutcome document because of a lack of consensus,\neven though nuclear weapons, weapons of mass\ndestruction and the illicit trade in small arms and light\nweapons are the greatest threats to humanity. The\nCongo reaffirms its full support for the objective of\ngeneral and complete disarmament and the total\nelimination of weapons of mass destruction.\nAfrica has always been a source of concern for\nthe United Nations, and the Security Council with good\nreason spends most of its time on Africa. We have\nreason to be pleased that some degree of progress has\nbeen made in several countries.\nIn Burundi, we welcome the efforts of the\ninternational community, which a month ago led to the\nsuccessful completion of the electoral process in that\ncountry. We welcome the Central African Republic\u00eds\nreturn to constitutional order after several years of\ncrisis and instability. These countries deserve increased\nsupport from the international community so as to\nconsolidate situations that are still fragile.\n13\n\nIn the Sudan, we welcome the reconciliation\nbetween the Sudan People's Liberation Movement\n(SPLM), the central Government and the new\nGovernment of national unity, which has just been\nestablished. But the reconciliation between the north\nand the south in Sudan should not lead us to forget the\ntragedy that has for two years been affecting another\nsegment of the population in the west of the country,\nnamely, Darfur. We call for greater mobilization on the\npart of the international community in support of the\nAfrican Union's efforts to bring an immediate end to\nthat political and humanitarian crisis.\nIn Cote d'Ivoire, because of the differences\nbetween the parties to the conflict and despite the\ntireless efforts on the part of the United Nations and\nthe African Union, the holding of elections, initially set\nfor October 2005, has now been brought into question.\nWe urge our Ivorian brothers to rise above their\ndifferences in the higher interest of their country and of\npeace and stability in the subregion.\nPeace and stability in the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo determine the stability and development of\nthe whole of Central Africa and the Great Lakes\nregion. We applaud the efforts by the international\ncommunity in support of the electoral process leading\nto a successful transition in the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo.\nOur subregion was very much involved in those\nefforts. As current chairman of the Economic\nCommunity of Central African States, the President of\nthe Republic of the Congo, Mr. Denis Sassou-Nguesso,\nwas assigned by his peers, following the twelfth\nConference of Heads of State and Government held in\nJune 2005 at Brazzaville, the task of promoting\nsuccessful transition. Pursuant to that mandate,\ntogether with my colleagues from Angola, Gabon and\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, we met with\nthe international partners of the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo, namely Belgium, the European Union\nand, of course, the United Nations.\nConcerning the Great Lakes region, the first\nsummit meeting of the International Conference on the\nGreat Lakes, which was held in November 2004 at\nDar es Salaam, aroused great hopes for a return to\npeace, stability and development in that subregion.\nIn a few months, the second summit meeting of\nthe International Conference will be held at Nairobi\nand will adopt a security, stability and development\npact, under which our countries intend to implement\naction programmes and protocols in order to make a\nreality of their desire for a shared future of peace,\nsecurity and development.\nThe International Conference on the Great Lakes\nRegion is a unique experience of regional\npeacebuilding. We very much hope that this subregion\nwill be the first to implement the reforms proposed by\nthe Secretary-General concerning peacebuilding.\nWe would like to take this opportunity to reiterate\nthe appeal made by the President of the Republic of the\nCongo to the international community in general and to\nthe development partners in particular to make the\nGreat Lakes region a special development area.\nNine of the eleven countries that make up our\nsubregion of Central Africa are now in a post-conflict\nsituation. This subject was discussed at length at the\ntwenty-third meeting of the United Nations Standing\nAdvisory Committee on Security Questions in Central\nAfrica, which was held at Brazzaville from 29 August\nto 2 September 2005.\nWe welcome the existence and work of that\ncommittee, of which my country is now chair, and at\nthe same time we ask the United Nations to act on the\noutcome of the committee\u00eds multidisciplinary mission\nto Central Africa in June 2003.\nIn the Middle East, notwithstanding the\npersistence of the Israel-Palestine conflict, we welcome\nand encourage the efforts made over the past several\nmonths by the Prime Minister of Israel, Mr. Ariel\nSharon, and the President of the Palestinian Authority,\nMr. Mahmoud Abbas, which reflect a common desire\nto bring about a fair and lasting solution.\nConsolidation of peace, restoration of\nmacroeconomic balances and combating pandemics\nsuch as HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, these\nare the top priorities of my Government.\nOur Government intends to expand its activities\nto deal with other scourges. We organized in\nBrazzaville in June 2005 a conference on\ntrypanosomiasis, during which a resolution declaring\ntrypanosomiasis the number-one priority for public\nhealth, like HIV/AIDS and malaria, was adopted. We\nrequest that special attention be given to this disease.\nConcerned about preserving the environment, the\nCongo and other countries of the subregion entered\n14\n\ninto a partnership agreement with the international\ncommunity in 2002 within the framework of the Congo\nRiver Basin Initiative.\nThe second summit meeting of heads of State and\nGovernment on conservation and sustainable\nmanagement of forest ecosystems in Central Africa\nwas held at Brazzaville in February 2005, and adopted\na long-term strategy for the preservation of the forest,\nfauna and biodiversity in the greater Congo basin.\nI wish to thank the European Union, the United\nStates of America, France and Germany for their\nsupport of this initiative.\nIn conclusion, I wish to thank the African Group\nfor having endorsed the candidacy of the Congo for a\nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council for 2006 to\n2007. I would like to reassure you that we are fully\ndetermined to work resolutely for peace, freedom and\njustice throughout the world."

        "file_text": "During the past year, we, the Member States, embarked\nupon a reform process without precedent in the history\nof our Organization. The international community\nbecame fully aware of the need to transform the United\nNations in order better to meet the threats and\nchallenges of our time. Although significant progress\nwas made, we have not yet achieved the expected\ngoals.\nThe political and intellectual contributions put\nforth by the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges\nand Change, the Secretary-General\u00eds Report \u00ecIn larger\nfreedom\u00ee (A/59/2005), the United Nations Millennium\nProject report and the input provided by the Group of\nFriends for the Reform of the United Nations are,\namong others, important efforts that have guided our\ndiscussions aimed at defining the future of our\nOrganization. Now, our task is to take stock of the\nlessons learned, of the good and the bad, in order to\nmake this sixtieth session the year of the United\nNations reform.\nThe outcome document adopted by heads of State\nand Government during this summit is a point of\ndeparture. It is not yet the final result. It should be seen\nas the architecture that will lead us in the building of\nthe new United Nations. It is crucial that we keep the\nreform momentum alive and implement as soon as\npossible the changes demanded by the international\ncommunity and our Governments.\nIn Mexico\u00eds opinion, there are three key aspects\namong the lessons learned that need to be taken into\nconsideration during the work of this sixtieth session of\nthe General Assembly.\nFirst, reform of the system must be\ncomprehensive. It will be very damaging, futile and\ninadequate if we decide to sacrifice a comprehensive\napproach by focusing our efforts on just one aspect of\nthe reform. A great deal of the frustration stemming\nfrom the summit\u00eds outcome occurred because of the\nextensive attention and time given to reform of the\nSecurity Council. We cannot deny the importance of\nthis issue, but we should not hold the whole reform\nprocess hostage to the exclusive discussion of one\nsingle item.\nThroughout the long days of discussion prior to\nthe summit, it became evident that the issues which\naroused interest and triggered concern were those such\nas human rights, development, the fight against\nterrorism, the environment, the social agenda and\nmanagement reform. It is much clearer today than it\nwas two weeks ago that the United Nations inevitably\nneeds to make simultaneous headway on those issues\nof priority for the international community.\nSecondly, the most effective means of advancing\nthe reform process lies in genuine negotiations open to\nall interested States, with agreed timelines for both\nadoption and implementation of the commitments\nreached. All delegations witnessed that, in the last\nthree weeks prior to the summit, we were able to make\nmore and faster progress than during the previous long\nmonths of consultations and speeches. The summit\nacted as a catalyst for serious and committed\nintergovernmental negotiations. Then we were finally\nable to perceive with the required precision each\nMember State's limits and margins of flexibility. In the\nlight of that experience, we must turn to negotiations as\nthe most productive working method.\nThirdly, in order to gain relevance and\neffectiveness, the United Nations institutional\nstructures should adapt to real global problems and not\nthe other way around. Otherwise, we could be in the\nabsurd situation of building institutions pleasing to\nhigh political and diplomatic circles but very\ndisappointing to the societies they are meant to serve.\nDiscussions on the new Human Rights Council\nillustrate that kind of failing. The number of members\nhas received far more attention than the mandates and\ntasks it should carry out in order to promote human\ndignity. It is urgent that this be reversed.\nMr. Eliasson, you will be presiding over a very\nunusual General Assembly session. Fruitless efforts\nhave been made for years to find the formulas to\nrevitalize the highest globally representative organ.\nToday, driven by the winds of reform and the need to\nease the Organization\u00eds sense of crisis, the General\n28\n\nAssembly has rare momentum to steer the future\ncourse of the United Nations. This is where major\nagreements could be reached and where States'\ncommitments will be recorded. Mexico is fully\nconfident that, during your presidency, the General\nAssembly will grow stronger as the main political\nforum for major global decision-making.\nAs stated by the President of Mexico at the recent\nsummit (see A/60/PV.4), we are at the starting point,\nnot at the finish line. Our task is incomplete, and it is\nurgent to establish a Peacebuilding Commission to put\ninto practice the concept of the \u00ecresponsibility to\nprotect\u00ee; to establish a Human Rights Council that\ncould make an immediate difference vis-a-vis the\nweaknesses and double standards that have tarnished\nthe reputation of the Commission on Human Rights; to\nbegin negotiations on reform of the Security Council,\nwith the common purpose of putting in place the best\npossible collective security system, one that can\neffectively face today's major threats.\nDevelopment continues to be a priority among\nthe aspirations and concerns on the global agenda.\nMexico has made particularly important efforts in this\nrealm. The International Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment, held in the Mexican city of Monterrey,\nbecame a watershed in our approach to that subject. A\npartnership between rich and developing countries was\nforged for the first time ever, with the purpose of\nfighting poverty head-on and defining financial targets\nand timetables in that fight. We therefore particularly\nappreciate the decision of those developed countries\nthat have announced precise timetables and levels of\ntheir gross national product to be allocated for official\ndevelopment assistance. We reiterate our call to the rest\nof the economic Powers to move in that direction, and\nwe urge the developing countries to present, as soon as\npossible, their own national strategies to ensure that\nthey can access those resources. It is crucial that all\nparties fully meet their commitments. We cannot allow\nourselves to go backwards in this connection.\nThe President of Mexico has asked me to put on\nrecord our disappointment at the fact that the summit's\noutcome document did not include a section on\ndisarmament and non-proliferation. My delegation will\njoin forces with other interested member States to\nrestore this sensitive issue to the United Nations\nagenda.\nFor Mexico, which last April had the honour of\nhosting the first Conference of States Parties and\nSignatories of Treaties That Establish Nuclear-\nWeapon-Free Zones, disarmament and non-\nproliferation issues are a top priority on our\ninternational agenda. Because of this, and because of\nthe hazardous international scenario we have\nexperienced in recent weeks, we consider it urgent to\nfind a way to end the paralysis faced by the multilateral\nforums dealing with this matter.\nLikewise, Mexico attaches great importance to\nthe agreement reached during the summit to finalize a\ncomprehensive convention on the rights of persons\nwith disabilities. We urge all Member States and\nObservers to continue their negotiations with a view to\nmaking sure that this instrument is adopted by the\nGeneral Assembly during its current session.\nFinally, I would like to comments on the section\nof the outcome document dealing with the rule of law.\nThe rule of law in international relations is a rational\npreventive tool for settling disputes. The United\nNations legal machinery constitutes an ally of the\nSecurity Council in the maintenance of international\npeace and security. Based on the comprehensive reform\npromoted by my country, we deem it necessary for\nStates to reinforce their commitment to strengthening\nthe International Court of Justice in a substantive way.\nMexico will remain a firm promoter of United\nNations reform and of seeking multilateral solutions to\naddress the world's major problems. Through the\nGroup of Friends for United Nations Reform, and\nduring this critical year in the life of our Organization,\nwe will go on putting forward proposals and\nmechanisms to implement decisions. In this regard, I\nwould like to echo President Fox's appreciation to his\ncounterparts from Algeria, Australia, Canada, Chile,\nColombia, Germany, Japan, Kenya, the Netherlands,\nNew Zealand, Pakistan, Singapore, Spain and Sweden\nfor their intelligent and constructive contribution to the\nreform process. The diversity of views within the\nGroup and the decision to focus on delivering concrete\nproposals to solve the problems of the United Nations,\nas well as those of the world, demonstrate that it is\nindeed feasible to reach agreements and translate them\ninto action. We are confident that this spirit will spread\nthroughout the membership of the United Nations, and\nthat the sixtieth session will truly mark the beginning\nof the second phase in the life of our Organization."

        "file_text": "We Austrians unfailingly\nkeep the United Nations in high esteem. Let me try to\nexplain why.\nAustria became a Member of the United Nations\nin December 1955. That was only half a year after our\nfull sovereignty had been restored through a treaty\nconcluded with the United States, the Soviet Union, the\nUnited Kingdom and France, called the Austrian State\nTreaty.\nFifty years ago, becoming part of the family of\nnations was a powerful motive for us. We could build\non your trust. We could rely on your help. We later\nsolved complex problems such as the question of\nS\u00fcdtirol with you, our partners in the United Nations.\nAnd we have since been eager to return to others in\nneed the help extended to us.\nMore than anything else, it is our own experience\nthat nurtures our confidence in the potential of the\nUnited Nations as a promoter of peace and a beacon of\nhope for so many who face the dire challenges and\nthreats to our societies \u2014 be they armed conflict or\nhunger, terrorism or environmental disaster. We need\nthe United Nations to be relevant, responsive and\nreliable \u2014 today and in the years to come.\nThe reform process initiated by Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan and reflected in the World Summit\nOutcome document will further enhance that potential.\nWe may not have achieved all we were striving for, but\nlet us not disregard the progress made, for it will \u2014 if\nacted upon \u2014 make a difference to people in need of\nour support, in need of our protection.\nPromoting peace is the United Nations very\nraison d\u2019\u00eatre. Since Austria joined the United Nations,\nsome 54,000 Austrian peacekeepers have participated\nin more than 50 missions all over the world. Currently,\n1,200 of them are deployed in missions from Kosovo\nto the Golan Heights and from Afghanistan to Aceh\nand the Sudan.\nIt is also in the light of their practical experience\nthat we welcome the new peacebuilding commission. It\nwill provide specific support to people having to cope\nwith the manifold challenges along the path from war\nto real peace. I wish to say one word on women in that\ncontext. Creating confidence in post-conflict societies\nrequires the active participation and deliberate\ninvolvement of women. They must become key\npartners in our peacekeeping and peacebuilding efforts.\n2\n\nThe European Union, as the major donor to post-conflict\nreconstruction and development, will substantially\ncontribute to the peacebuilding commission\u2019s work. It\nshould therefore have a place in the commission.\nFor us and many people all over the world, the\nmost serious failure of the present reform effort was\nthe lack of agreement on effective and verifiable\nmeasures against nuclear proliferation and for\ndisarmament. We must strengthen the multilateral\nverification mechanisms and enable the International\nAtomic Energy Agency to make best use of its\ncapacity. We must not abandon our efforts to find\ncommon ground on those most challenging tasks.\nIn this vulnerable world, we need to foster trust\nbetween communities and peoples and help to identify\nshared values. Austria thus strongly supports every\nform of dialogue among civilizations, religions and\ncultures. In particular, we need to reach out to the\nIslamic world, both internationally and inside our\nsocieties. As a concrete contribution, Austria will host\nan international conference in November on Islam in a\npluralistic world.\nAnywhere in the world, individuals will be able\nto live and unfold in larger freedom only when their\nfundamental needs of development, security and\nhuman rights are met. We need to address those\nrequirements in a comprehensive and integrated manner.\nWe are grateful to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who\nso remarkably raised awareness on that matter.\nThe Millennium Development Goals contain\nspecific promises of solidarity. Austria therefore\nwelcomes our continued common commitments, in\nparticular to poverty eradication and the global\npartnership for sustainable development. In\ncontributing to the funding effort, we will raise our\nofficial development assistance to 0.51 per cent of our\ngross national income by 2010.\nPromoting human security is an ever more\ndemanding task. Our decisions on the \u201cresponsibility to\nprotect\u201d are a courageous step forward in international\nrelations, but more importantly, they are an offer of\nhope to those most vulnerable to genocide, war crimes,\nethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. We must\nnot let them down. In the words of Simon Wiesenthal,\nwho sadly passed away last night in Vienna, what\nconnects 2,000 years of genocide is \u201ctoo much power\nin too few hands\u201d. Ten years ago, at this Assembly,\nSimon Wiesenthal proposed to organize a worldwide\nconference aimed at reducing hate. He said that\n\u201ctechnology without hatred can be so beneficial for\nmankind, but in conjunction with hatred it leads to\ndisaster\u201d (A/50/PV.66, p. 9). Reality has since\nillustrated the profound relevance of that proposal.\nIn our globalized world, the concept of\nneighbourhood has taken on a new meaning. In the eye\nof disaster, we are all neighbours, no matter how far or\nclose. As the tsunami and recent hurricanes have taught\nus, there is an emerging sense of shared destiny and\nresponsibility no longer limited to geographical\nvicinity. Let me on this occasion express our gratitude\nto all those private donors who set a mark of living\nsolidarity.\nAustria\u2019s clear commitment to effective\nmultilateralism is at the very heart of our work in the\nEuropean Union and the United Nations. It is in that\nspirit that we are a candidate for Security Council\nmembership in 2009-2010.\nPromoting the rule of law is the key to an\nenvironment of trust within our societies. It enables\nindividuals to enjoy a self-determined life. For many,\nthe rule of law is synonymous with normality and\npredictability in their private and professional lives.\nWe therefore welcome the proposed establishment of a\nrule of law assistance unit in the Secretariat to advise\nStates in their efforts towards the rule of law.\nOne of the main achievements of the summit was\nthe decision to establish a human rights council, even if\nthe concrete set-up remains to be defined. In our view,\nwe need a standing body with the ability to address\nurgent human rights issues swiftly and efficiently. That\nis no mere management question. What is at stake is\nthe new Council\u2019s capacity to make a difference for\nthose in need. It is now crucial that negotiations start\nwithout delay in order to seize the momentum of the\nreform.\nHuman rights are also a matter of education. In\nthe framework of the Human Security Network,\nAustria has therefore developed a human rights manual\nthat has been translated into all United Nations\nlanguages. It is used in training programmes in Austria\nand abroad and we encourage our partners to make use\nof that instrument.\nStrengthening human rights and the rule of law\nwill increase security. That is true for societies at large,\nbut it is also true for the smallest communities and\n3\n\nindividual households. Full respect for the rights of\nwomen and children is therefore indispensable in the\nworld of increased justice and equality we strive for.\nToo many women are victims of violence. We therefore\nwelcome the study currently being prepared by the\nSecretary-General on all forms of violence against\nwomen.\nMuch remains to be done. The Doha Development\nRound has to promote improved market access. In our\nefforts to protect the environment, we have to enhance\nthe use of renewable energy and reduce the emission of\ngreenhouse gases. We also need to finalize the\ncomprehensive anti-terrorism convention, as agreed at the\nworld summit, and adopt and implement the counter-\nterrorism strategy proposed by the Secretary-General.\nReal freedom is within reach if we, through the\nUnited Nations, join our forces to promote peace,\nsecurity and justice \u2014 not only freedom from want and\nfreedom from fear, but eventually freedom to live in\ndignity for both women and men across the globe."

        "file_text": "In no way can today\u2019s discussion be called\nroutine. We are faced with summing up the preliminary\nresults of the large-scale United Nations reforms that\nhave been launched and designating the main thrust for\nthe work of the entire system of United Nations\ninstitutions in implementing the outcome document of\nthe 2005 world summit. We propose to structure the\nwork of the sixtieth session of the General Assembly in\nsuch a manner as to facilitate the broadest possible\nagreement on a number of conceptual issues related to\nstrengthening the United Nations that will, to a large\ndegree, determine our ability to enhance the\nmanageability of international trends in an era of\nglobalization, and better respond to its new\naccompanying threats and challenges.\nAn analysis of the experience of the United\nNations over the sixty years of its existence, with all\nthe vagaries of the post-war, cold war and post-cold\nwar world order, gives us much food for thought and\nmany conclusions. I would like to share some of that\nwith you from the viewpoint of the Russian Federation.\nAs the most representative international\ninstitution with a universal mandate, the United\nNations has been and remains a major integration\nfactor in global politics. The success of the United\nNations is our success and its failures are our failures.\nBut ultimately the balance of its work is, we believe,\ndefinitely positive. It is primarily due to this\nOrganization that we have managed to avoid a new\nthreat of  world war and a nuclear disaster and have\nbeen able to prevent and settle dozens of military\nconflicts. At present, the United Nations mechanisms\ncontinue to be a means of constructive cooperation\ntouching upon all spheres of human activity.\nThe greater interdependence of the modern world\nhas not made it more secure. The standoff between\nEast and West has been replaced by numerous crises\nand conflicts that until recently had remained latent,\nleft on the periphery of the interests of the two super-\nPowers. Some of those conflicts are becoming real or\npotential sources of international terrorism, feeding\ntransborder crime and drug trafficking, which are\nclosely related to it. Humanity faces the threat of the\nuncontrolled spread of weapons of mass destruction\nand the possibility of their falling into the hands of\nterrorists. Again the world is witnessing genocide and\nhumanitarian disasters. All of this presents immediate\ndanger to each and every one of us.\n11\n\nIn that context, the enormous potential of the\nUnited Nations is in greater demand, primarily in\nensuring peace and security on a collective and, more\nimportantly, on a legitimate legal basis. The\nOrganization has at its disposal an entire arsenal of\nresources enabling it to coordinate the actions of the\ninternational community, to combine political efforts\nwith those in the social, economic and humanitarian\nareas, as well as in the field of protection of human\nrights and the environment and other spheres. We\nshould develop these assets through the concerted\nefforts of all States. Russia considers this task to be a\nstrategic core element of its foreign policy.\nThe events of the first years of the new\nmillennium reaffirm the validity of the conclusions\ndrawn by the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges\nand Change and the Secretary-General, that is, that a\nstronger United Nations and a better use of its\nmultilateral advantages are an essential instrument to\nbuild a balanced, safe international system, based on\nrespect for the unique features of every country, their\nsovereign equality and collective responsibility. There\nis no reasonable alternative to this.\nMultilateral mechanisms should also play a key\nrole in resolving the issues of disarmament and the\nnon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,\nbased on strict compliance with the relevant\ninternational agreements. United Nations achievements\ninclude Security Council resolution 1540 (2004),\ninitiated by Russia, and the International Convention\nfor the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism,\nwhich establishes the legal basis for preventing\nweapons of mass destruction from falling into the\nhands of terrorists.\nIt is now crucial to prevent an arms race in outer\nspace. I remind the Assembly that Russia has assumed\nthe obligation not to be the first to launch any type of\nnew weapon into space and has called upon other\ncountries possessing space capabilities to join in this\nmeasure to keep outer space peaceful. It is time to take\nsteps to enhance transparency and build confidence in\nthis area.\nThe legal basis for countering new threats,\nprimarily terrorism, is being reinforced. The adoption\nat the recent Security Council summit of resolution\n1624 (2005), initiated by the United Kingdom, is a\nnew, important step forward. It places outside the law\nnot only the terrorists, their accomplices and those who\nfinance them, but also the individuals inciting terrorist\nacts. This Security Council decision should put an end\nto attempts to engage the mass media to propagandize\nand justify terrorism.\nWe anticipate that the General Assembly will also\ncontribute to the fight against terrorism and will\npromote completion of the negotiations on a\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism\nas soon as possible. The fight against terrorism must be\ncontinued most decisively. Each of us should critically\nassess his or her efforts in this area.\nThe realities are that while the sanctions against\nthe Taliban, Al-Qaida and associated individuals and\nentities are still in force, the supplying of arms and\nmaterial and other kinds of assistance to the fighters\ncontinues. The geographical scope of their activities is\nexpanding. For many countries, including Russia, this\nis tangible on their own soil. Extremists who are not\ndirectly linked to Al-Qaida  are also stepping up their\nactivities in various parts of the world. This requires\nstrengthening of cooperation between States and the\n1267 sanctions Committee, the 1540 Committee and,\nof course, the Security Council\u2019s Counter-Terrorism\nCommittee. Furthermore, we believe that the\ncompilation of a consolidated list of all terrorists and\nterrorist organizations, whether they are associated in\nany way with Al-Qaida or not, cannot be postponed.\nThe development of criteria for the use of force\nin accordance with the United Nations Charter is\nanother pressing issue. Such criteria, when agreed\nupon, could be useful if they become a kind of\nbenchmark for consideration by the Security Council\nof various crisis situations. At the same time, it is clear\nthat these criteria cannot be applied automatically. The\nSecurity Council would authorize the use of force on a\ncase-by-case basis, as called for in the Charter.\nAnother equally important topic is that of States,\nin exercising their Charter right to individual and\ncollective self-defense, to include self-defense in case\nof an external terrorist attack or the imminent threat of\nsuch attack. Russia, like other States that have become\ntargets of terrorist attacks originating beyond their\nborders, has no right to err in the eyes of its citizens,\nwho have entrusted their security to us. We anticipate\nthat those critical issues will be given due attention at\nthis session of the General Assembly.\nAbove all, force should not be used to oppose\nlaw. It can be an effective tool to ensure the rule of law\n12\n\nin crisis situations. It is a tool to be used in\nextraordinary cases in which vital, legally protected\nvalues and interests of the entire international\ncommunity, or certain of its members, are in jeopardy.\nUnfortunately, in the preparations for the 2005\nworld summit, insufficient attention was given to\nseeking solutions to those and other important issues\nand to finding a way to common understanding. Thus,\nthat task must remain a top priority of our agenda.\nMuch remains to be done in terms of\ndevelopment and the eradication of poverty, epidemics,\nfamine and illiteracy. Such action would be the\nstrongest way to ensure global stability and eliminate\nthe breeding grounds of extremism of all kinds. Russia\nendorses all initiatives aimed at attaining the\nMillennium Goals and will enhance its contribution to\nresolving those urgent issues. The success of our\nconcerted efforts to support development greatly\ndepends on the efficacy of the Peacebuilding\nCommission to be established. The Commission will\nachieve the required results if it is more than just\nanother debating society and if it can be a mechanism\nfacilitating the greater coordination of the programmes\nand the projects of all the participants in development\nassistance, including the World Bank Group, the\nInternational Monetary Fund, regional development\nbanks, other multilateral and bilateral donors and, of\ncourse, recipient countries.\nThe dramatic events of the last six months have\nrevealed the sensitivity of the issue of Security Council\nreform for the majority of Member States. Guided\nabove all by its interest in ensuring the Security\nCouncil\u2019s effectiveness, Russia continues to support\npossible modifications of that key organ on the basis of\nwell-conceived and mutually acceptable decisions.\nUnited Nations Members have made the wise decision\nto continue negotiations, rather than pushing for a vote\nthat might split the Organization.\nI recall the striking words: the United Nations\nwas created not to make heaven on Earth but to save\nthe Earth from hell. Indeed, the United Nations is not\nan ideal body, but the best that humanity was able to\ncreate on the ashes of two world wars. With the help of\nthe United Nations, we are able to effectively counter\nthreats to peace and security in the context of evolving\ngeopolitical realities.\nToday, mankind is facing the challenges of\nglobalization. It is not a question of whether we should\naccept those challenges or not, but of how we should\nrespond to them, and on the basis of what principles.\nThe 2005 world summit decisions outline the general\ndirection for our efforts. As a permanent member of the\nSecurity Council and the next President of the Group\nof Eight, Russia, together with other States, will\ncontinue to strive to strengthen the collective\nunderpinnings of global politics and to enhance\nmechanisms for multilateral cooperation."

        "file_text": "We live in an age of\nunpredictable threats, against which there may be no\nairtight security measures. Tragedy could strike in the\nform of a deadly epidemic. It could be the handiwork\nof terrorists, like the attacks against New York City on\n11 September 2001 or the Bali bombings of 2002. It\ncould be a convulsion of nature, like the tsunami that\ndemolished the Indonesian province of Aceh and\nnearby Indian Ocean Rim areas, or the storm tide that\ndrowned New Orleans and much of Louisiana recently.\nOn the tragedy of New Orleans, we extend our\ndeepest condolences to the American people.\nWe Indonesians know too well the enormous\nsuffering that a natural catastrophe can bring. In Aceh\nalone, the tsunami of 26 December 2004 killed outright\nsome 130,000 individuals. It destroyed 220,000 homes\nand displaced 572,000 individuals. Some 100,000\npersons are still missing and presumed dead. The death\ntoll would have been higher were it not for the quick\nand vigorous response of the international community\nand the United Nations. For that, the Indonesian people\n29\n\nare deeply grateful. The outpouring of sympathy and\nsolidarity, as well as humanitarian assistance from all\nover the world, deeply touched us.\nEleven days after the tragedy, we hosted in\nJakarta a special summit of the Association of\nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on the aftermath of\nthe earthquake and tsunami. At that summit, world\nleaders and the United Nations Secretary-General, as\nwell as representatives of multilateral institutions,\nworked out a system of coordination and division of\nlabour in attending to the stricken countries. Pledges\nwere made of urgently needed assistance. A decision\nwas reached to develop a multi-nodal early warning\nsystem covering the Indian Ocean Rim countries.\nWithin ASEAN, an agreement to establish stand-by\narrangements to mitigate natural disasters was\nconcluded last July. Those efforts were reflected in\nGeneral Assembly resolution 59/233, initiated by\nASEAN and sponsored by more than 130 United\nNations Members.\nThe reconstruction and rehabilitation of Aceh got\noff to an early start as the emergency relief phase was\ncompleted ahead of schedule. A master plan for\nreconstruction and rehabilitation was then devised. An\nagency for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of\nAceh was established and given broad powers.\nThrough the World Bank\u2019s Multi-Donor Trust Fund\nand bilateral mechanisms with donors, we have\ninstituted a strict system that guarantees transparency\nand accountability in the disbursement of funds.\nRehabilitation and development, however, cannot\nrun smoothly without peace. And for many years there\nhas been no peace. Before the tsunami, Aceh saw three\ndecades of armed conflict caused by perceived\neconomic injustices. Many Acehnese felt that they\nwere not being given a fair deal by the central\nGovernment. As the conflict raged and took a heavy\ntoll on human life, a vicious cycle was at work:\nviolence impoverished the people, and in their poverty\nmany resorted to violence.\nIn the spirit of reform and in a democratic\nenvironment, efforts to address the problem of Aceh\nthrough dialogue and reconciliation were initiated in\n2000. Those efforts led to the signing of a final\nagreement in Helsinki last month. That was the silver\nlining in the cloud of 26 December; it opened the eyes\nof both sides to the hopelessness of the situation\nwithout peace.\nIt helps that there is international support for the\npeace process. At our invitation, the European Union\nand ASEAN contributing countries have provided\nmonitors for the implementation of the peace\nagreement. In a way, it has created a precedent for the\ncollaboration of two regional organizations in\npeacebuilding.\nThe decommissioning and destruction of rebel\nweapons are working according to the peace\nagreement. The former rebels are back in the fold of\nthe unitary Republic of Indonesia and are fighting on\nthe same side as the Government in the struggle against\npoverty.\nPeace and development in Aceh are the fruits of\nreform and democratization, which are pervading all of\nIndonesia. Starting this year, all local officials,\ngovernors, regents and mayors are directly elected by\nthe people. Whereas the former rebel leaders once\nsought power through the bullet, they can now seek\ntheir legitimate aspirations through the ballot.\nSince 1998, we have enhanced our political\ninstitutions through constitutional amendments. We\nhave overhauled our legal system, and we are adopting\nhigh standards of good governance in the corporate and\npublic sector. We have pursued vigorous campaigns\nagainst corruption.\nWe are now pursuing an economic strategy that is\npro-growth, pro-poor and pro-job. We are\nstrengthening the export sector, promoting investments\nto create jobs and speeding up rural economic\ndevelopment. In a few weeks, we will put in place a\nsocial safety net that will cushion the impact of high\noil prices on the poor. We are on target with our\nMillennium Development Goals on poverty reduction.\nWherever there is social unrest in Indonesia, we\nbring justice and foster dialogue and reconciliation, as\nwe did in Aceh.\nIn the same spirit of reconciliation, Indonesia and\nneighbouring Timor-Leste have reached out to each\nother so that both nations might together close a\npainful chapter in our shared history. Together, we\nhave established a commission of truth and friendship,\ntasked to bring about exposure of the truth and\nacknowledgement of responsibility for the human\nrights violations committed prior to and immediately\nafter the popular consultations held in Timor-Leste in\n1999. The commission started its work last August.\n30\n\nThe fledgling democracies of the two countries stand a\nbetter of chance of succeeding if they work together in\na spirit of reconciliation, friendship and cooperation,\ncomplementing the prosecutorial justice that has been\ncarried out in Indonesia and Timor-Leste.\nWith our other closest neighbours in South-East\nAsia, we are striving hard to become an ASEAN\ncommunity that is at peace with itself and all others \u2014\na prosperous ASEAN living in harmony within the\ncommunity of caring societies that we have long\nenvisioned. We hope to see ASEAN play a pivotal role\nin the evolution of a new equilibrium in the Asia-\nPacific region that will consolidate the peaceful\nengagement of regional Powers with one another.\nToday, ASEAN already serves as the driving force\ntowards the development of an East Asian economic\ncommunity.\nWe Indonesians love to build bridges. Last April,\nwe served as host to the representatives of 106 Asian\nand African countries, many of them heads of State or\nGovernment, for the Asian-African Summit of 2005.\nDuring that historic Summit, we put in place the\ncornerstone for a bridge of cooperation across the\nIndian Ocean \u2014 the New Asian-African Strategic\nPartnership \u2014 on behalf of the 4.6 billion people of the\ntwo continents. Through the Partnership, both\ncontinents will intensify their political solidarity,\neconomic cooperation and socio-cultural relations,\nincluding technical cooperation and human resources\ndevelopment.\nThe establishment of the Partnership was the\nmost meaningful way in which we could observe the\nGolden Jubilee of the 1955 Asian-African Conference\nheld in Bandung, which heralded the emergence of\nmany new sovereign nations from the shadow of\ncolonialism. In those formative years of ours, we\nsought to reform international relations through the\nUnited Nations.\nToday, we feel called upon to seek reform of the\nUnited Nations itself, for we are faced with the\nformidable challenges of development, security and\nhuman rights \u2014 three challenges that are interlinked\nand interdependent and that cannot be addressed\nseparately. We therefore need a United Nations that is\nmore effective and efficient and more democratic and\naccountable to its Members \u2014 an Organization with a\nbalanced focus on those three challenges.\nWe need a reformed Security Council that is more\ndemocratically representative. As the Asia-Pacific\nregion is home to more than half of the human race and\nis the cradle of ancient civilizations and religions, we\nin Indonesia feel that it should have more seats on the\nCouncil. Moreover, we must do away with the right of\nthe veto.\nWe cannot afford to exclude global disarmament\nand non-proliferation from our agenda. We are not rid\nof the danger of nuclear annihilation. At the same time,\ndeveloping countries must be allowed to engage in the\npeaceful use of nuclear energy to hasten their\ndevelopment.\nWe need a Peacebuilding Commission to help\ncountries in conflict make the transition from war to\ndurable peace. The Commission must work in\ncoordination with the Security Council and the\nEconomic and Social Council, under the mandate of\nthe General Assembly.\nWith regard to the fight against terrorism, we\nhope that a comprehensive convention can be\nconcluded soon. International cooperation to address\nthis problem should include efforts to deal with its root\ncauses. We also hold that no human right may be\nsacrificed and that no international law may be violated\nin the fight against terrorism.\nWe in Indonesia believe that interfaith dialogue\nand cooperation to empower moderate voices can\nsignificantly reduce violent radicalism. That is why we\nhave sponsored and hosted Asia-Pacific and Asian-\nEuropean dialogues on interfaith cooperation.\nWe urge that the Economic and Social Council be\nempowered to effectively review and coordinate\ninternational cooperation for development.\nThe envisaged Human Rights Council must\nuphold human rights as universal, indivisible and\ninterdependent. It should be free from politicization\nand double standards; instead, it should promote\ndialogue as well as concrete cooperation. It should be a\nsubsidiary body to the General Assembly.\nFinally, no effort aimed at United Nations reform\ncan be complete unless it affirms and makes a reality\nthe central role of the General Assembly as the main\ndeliberative body of the United Nations.\nIt may not be realistic to hope that these reforms\nwill be realized this week or in the months to come. We\n31\n\nthe Members of the United Nations are not sufficiently\nin concert to achieve an early breakthrough. But we\nwho desire reform must keep faith and persevere.\nFor three decades, armed conflict smouldered in\nAceh, until it became clear to both sides that the only\nway out of a tragic situation was the way of peace. For\nmore than three decades, Indonesian reformists\nstruggled against the crushing weight of an\nauthoritarian regime, until it became clear that our only\nway out of the Asian crisis was through democratic\nreform.\nWe do not know when the moment of truth will\ncome for the United Nations. We hope that it will\ncome, not in the wake of a crisis, but at the dawning of\na more enlightened time. Above all, we must never\nlose hope in the Organization\u2019s capacity for reform, its\nperfectibility. We must keep on working \u2014 even harder\nthan before. Then, when the moment of truth comes,\nwe will be ready to seize the opportunity."

        "file_text": "The Republic of Equatorial Guinea is\nparticipating in this debate with hope and optimism\nthat we will see the United Nations system\nstrengthened once again so that it can effectively carry\nout its mission as the centre of global equilibrium in\norder to attain the objectives established at its creation\nin 1945.\nIndeed, the United Nations was created to defend\nand promote the rights of persons and the dignity,\nfreedom and equality of human beings. The United\nNations was created to promote the equality of all\nnations, mutual respect, solidarity and the promotion of\ncooperation among States on an equal footing and for\nmutual benefit. Another of the objectives established\nwas to promote the global development of nations\nthrough a just and equitable economic system that\nwould protect the interests of all countries, rich or\npoor.\nThe United Nations must be given the\ninternational authority it needs to establish peace, order\nand stability in the world, serving as a centre of\nuniversal equilibrium with the capacity to resolve\nconflicts arising among States. Force must be used\nonly in conformity with the provisions of the Charter\nof the United Nations, with the prior consent of its\ncompetent bodies, because the undue use of force can\ndisrupt international peace and security in an\nunforeseeable manner.\nWe hope that the United Nations system will be\nthe inspiration for a democratic culture and for human\nrights, serving as a model and guide for the internal\norganization of its Members. We therefore support the\ncreation of a Human Rights Council that will be very\nclosely involved with human-rights-related issues in\neach country and that will have relevant competencies\nto support the affected countries with regard to the\ndecisions and recommendations of the Economic and\nSocial Council.\nThe democratization of societies and good\ngovernance are concepts universally accepted by\nStates. Therefore, there is no need to adopt coercive\nmechanisms against any State to ensure their\nimplementation. All that is needed is to assist and\nguide each State as to how it should assimilate\ndemocratic concepts in accordance with its economic,\nsocial and cultural realities.\nFor all those reasons, we believe that, 60 years\nafter the Organization\u00eds founding, the social and\npolitical circumstances that prevailed in 1945 have lost\ntheir validity because of the very dynamics of the\ndevelopment of modern societies. Today, we are in the\nbest possible position to rethink the responsibilities of\nthe United Nations and its Members in the light of the\naforementioned objectives, bearing in mind today\u00eds\ncircumstances and the experience accumulated in the\n60 years of its existence.\nWe recognize that the task is very difficult and\ncomplex, taking into account the various interests that\nconverge as we consider reforming the entire United\nNations system. That is why we congratulate you,\nMr. President, on the confidence that the international\ncommunity has placed in you and in your Government\nto moderate this important debate. We hope that your\nskill and professional experience will be put to good\nuse so that we can attain our objectives.\nWe believe that in this effort, we must give\npriority to the spirit of democracy and the interests of\nhumankind, because democracy, as the expression of\nthe popular will, and compliance with consensual\nnorms both involve respect for the collective will. We\nalso believe that the United Nations could not impose\norder and justice on a human community dominated by\nthe various cultural, economic and political interests of\nits Member States without recourse to the democratic\nprinciples to which all of us are bound. In that\nconnection, the Security Council, as the organ that\nmust demand universal compliance with its decisions,\nmust be the first to act under democratic criteria.\nFor my country, the needed reform of the\nSecurity Council does not involve an increase in its\nmembership or, even less, an expansion of the right of\n30\n\nthe veto. We must examine the reasons for the Security\nCouncil\u00eds failure since its creation in 1945. In fact, if\nthere is something that should be done to reform the\nSecurity Council, it is to simply revoke the right of the\nveto enjoyed by some of its members as a concept that\nwas created only because of the conflict between two\nopposing ideological systems within the United\nNations system. The veto has never allowed the\nconsensus or majority sovereign expression of the\nSecurity Council; it has served only as a way in which\nto block the popular will so as to protect the interests\nof the Power exercising the veto.\nIn the present circumstances of a unipolar world,\nwe do not see the need to exercise the veto in this\nUnited Nations body. Many just resolutions have been\nvetoed despite the fact that they have sought the\ncommon good, and we have seen the negative results.\nIf the veto must be maintained in the Security Council\nbecause of interests, we ask that Africa also have that\nright, because, like any other regional group, that\ncontinent has many interests to defend.\nWhen the Security Council is democratized we\nask that its decisions be binding and that those who do\nnot comply with them be properly sanctioned. This\nwould give teeth to its decisions. Non-compliance with\nthe principles and resolutions adopted by United\nNations bodies creates impunity unless disciplinary\nmeasures are taken against those who are in breach of\nthem.\nIn this regard, Equatorial Guinea strongly regrets\nthe failure to take measures against the terrorists who\ntried to overthrow the established constitutional\nGovernment on 6 March 2004 despite identification of\nnationalities of the terrorists and despite Equatorial\nGuinea\u00eds request to the Governments concerned.\nThe United Nations must clearly define the\nphenomenon of terrorism and in so doing avoid\nconfusion with what is interpreted as legitimate armed\nintervention. Humanitarian intervention cannot be\ncarried out on the basis of an individual interpretation,\nbut rather must be justified by the competent\ninstitutions of the United Nations system.\nQuestions related to organized transnational\ncrime, such as terrorism and mercenary activities, must\nbe the subject of a special session of the General\nAssembly to deal with criminal acts such as those of\n11 September in New York, 11 March in Madrid and\nevents in London, Russia, Morocco, Tanzania, Kenya\nand the mercenary attack in Equatorial Guinea and to\nadopt measures that can avert the loss of innocent life.\nIn Equatorial Guinea, the integration of women\ninto our development process is receiving the\nGovernment\u00eds utmost attention through the design of\nliteracy programmes for them and their gradual\nintegration in economic activities and political\ninstitutions with a specific percentage reserved for\nwomen.\nLastly, we want environmental problems, whose\neffects are of unforeseeable magnitude in each State, to\nbe addressed with due sensitivity, respect and\nsolidarity, in the same way as questions of world peace\nand security.\nWe reaffirm that the primary responsibility for\npromoting sustainable development in each country\nresides directly with the Government concerned.\nMultilateral and bilateral assistance only complement\nthe efforts of States themselves and provide guidance\nfor what must be accomplished internally by each\ncountry.\nAmong these efforts, Equatorial Guinea supports\nthe Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative\nproposed by the United Kingdom. Nonetheless, we\nbelieve that transparency must be required not only of\nGovernments but also of the economic players that\ncontrol these industries. It is, therefore, necessary that\nan international monitoring body be established to\nintervene in the activities of both Governments and\neconomic enterprises.\nWe welcome the report submitted for the\nAssembly\u00eds consideration as it contains important\nrecommendations, above all regarding the development\nprogramme.\nI wish to conclude by calling for greater\nsolidarity and a spirit of commitment from all the\nMembers of the United Nations so that we can make\nthis Organization an ideological model that serves the\naspirations of present and future generations."

        "file_text": "It is my pleasure to congratulate you, Sir, on\nyour election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its sixtieth session. Your renowned\nexperience in international affairs, especially in the\nUnited Nations system, will undoubtedly guarantee\nsuccess for our deliberations. I cannot fail to seize this\nopportunity to express to your predecessor, Mr. Jean\nPing, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Gabon, our thanks\nand appreciation for his efforts towards the successful\nconduct of the deliberations of the fifty-ninth session\nof the General Assembly. It also gives me pleasure to\nexpress to the Secretary-General of the United Nations,\nMr. Kofi Annan, our appreciation for his efforts to\nimplement the resolutions of the Organization and to\nfulfil the purposes of its Charter.\nDuring the 60 years of its existence, the United\nNations has witnessed heated debates and bitter\ndifferences. Yet this Organization remains a forum for\ndialogue among nations on the means of building a\nsecure world. While we agree with others on the need\nto reform the United Nations and take new\ninternational developments into account, we stress that\nsuch a process should be constructive and should apply\nlessons learned and the positive experiences that the\nUnited Nations has had. We also believe that such a\nprocess should unite and not divide us. It is through\nbroad agreement that we will be able to enhance the\nauthority and legitimacy of the United Nations, as well\nas its ability to effectively respond to the challenges of\nthe twenty-first century.\nWe must not forget that this Organization belongs\nto us all, and not merely to one particular party. We\nshould therefore find the wisdom to preserve it for\nfuture generations.\nFive years ago, we adopted a declaration in which\nwe set out the international community\u00eds vision for the\nnew millennium. Regrettably, both facts and figures\nshow that the results have not lived up to our\nexpectations. The objectives defined remain\nunfulfilled. Poverty, hunger and epidemics are\nprevalent throughout the world, while tension and\nforeign occupation continue to threaten international\npeace and security and hamper development for those\nliving under foreign occupation. Failure to eliminate\nweapons of mass destruction, foremost among which\nare nuclear weapons, haunts us and threatens peace. It\nis no longer feasible to delay the reform of the world\neconomic order. Moreover, reform should not be\nconfined to this international Organization. Rather, it\nmust encompass all international economic and\nfinancial institutions, particularly those that contribute\nto economic decision-making. The road ahead lies in\n20\n\nfairness, equality and democratic participation. The\nBretton Woods institutions, whose decisions bear\ndirectly on life in our countries, should be the prime\ncandidates for the overdue reform. We deem it fit to\nrecall the recommendation of several summit meetings,\nin both the North and the South, supporting the\ndeveloping countries\u00ed right to join the World Trade\nOrganization, with no hurdles and in a depoliticized\nway.\nSpeaking of development, we welcome the\nimportant outcomes of the three summits held during\nthe past five months on development, namely, the\nAsian-African Summit, the South American-Arab\nCountries Summit, and the second South-South\nSummit. Those meetings rejected the imposition of\nunilateral sanctions, considering such a policy to be in\nviolation of the principles of the Charter and\ninternational law and dangerous to development plans\nand reform processes in the targeted countries.\nThe main focus of discussions in the High-level\nPlenary Meeting was the reform of the United Nations.\nWe believe that the reform process will not be\ncomplete if it does not take into consideration the\ninability of the United Nations, for reasons known to\nall, to implement its resolutions pertaining to the Arab-\nIsraeli conflict. These reasons are primarily embodied\nin the generous support and unlimited protection\noffered by some to Israeli aggression against the Arab\nstates and to Israel\u00eds continuing occupation of the\nSyrian Golan, the Palestinian territories, and parts of\nsouthern Lebanon.\nSyria has declared that the withdrawal of settlers\nand Israeli forces from Gaza is undoubtedly a first step\nbut that this alone is not enough for peace. What is\nrequired is the implementation of all United Nations\nresolutions, the establishment of an independent\nPalestinian State, the return of the occupied Golan\nHeights and the return of refugees. There are relentless\nattempts by the Israeli side in particular and also by\nthose who support it to portray this withdrawal as a\ngreat accomplishment that is also painful. However,\nthey are neglecting the fact that the painful Israeli\noccupation of the Gaza Strip lasted for over 38 years,\nduring which our brothers in the Gaza Strip in\nparticular suffered from the horrors of occupation and\nits inhumane practices.\nMoreover, this abominable occupation persists in\nthe West Bank, including Jerusalem, as well as in the\noccupied Syrian territories in the Golan. As affirmed\nby many delegations in their statements this session,\nthe international community must be wary and must\ndemand that the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip be a\nfull withdrawal from land, sea, and air in order for it to\nbe considered a complete withdrawal. Moreover, this\nwithdrawal cannot be accepted as a cover for the\ncontinued Israeli occupation of the West Bank and East\nJerusalem, nor can it be a cover for the continued\nexistence of settlements and the separation wall in\nthese territories, especially since the General Assembly\nhas expressed its support for the legal opinion of the\nInternational Court of Justice on the illegitimate nature\nof the wall. Israel has rejected the opinion.\nIn 1981, the Security Council passed resolution\n497 (1981), deeming the Israeli decision to annex the\nGolan null and void. The General Assembly has passed\ndozens of resolutions condemning all the measures and\nactions taken by Israel \u00f3 the occupying Power \u00f3 to\nchange the nature of the occupied Syrian Golan and its\nlegal status and considering such measures null and\nvoid and a blatant violation of international law and the\nGeneva Conventions. In defiance of resolutions of\ninternational legitimacy, Israel has evicted almost half\na million Syrians from their land and continues to\ndetain dozens of Syrians, some of whom have been\nimprisoned for over 30 years. Israel still calls for the\nconstruction of more settlements in the occupied\nSyrian territories. The question is: If Israel claims that\nwithdrawing its settlers is painful and if it is genuine in\nits desire for peace in the region, then why does its\nGovernment continue to build settlements and bring\nsettlers in to the occupied Syrian and Palestinian Arab\nterritories?\nSyria has exerted every effort possible to achieve\na just and comprehensive peace in the region. It has\ncontinued to declare its readiness to resume the peace\nprocess unconditionally, keeping in mind that the\nimplementation of resolutions of international\nlegitimacy is not considered a precondition. However,\nall these efforts have gone to waste because of Israel\u00eds\ngreed and its defiance of international legitimacy.\nTherefore, we would like to affirm that peace in\nthe Middle East, to which the international community\naspires, cannot be achieved unless Israel abides by the\nresolutions of international legitimacy, particularly\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338\n(1973), the principle of land for peace and the Madrid\nPeace Conference terms of reference, and unless it\n21\n\naccepts the initiative that was put forth by the Arab\nStates at the 2002 Beirut summit and reaffirmed at the\nTunis and Algiers summits.\nThe international community is following the\ntragic events that have been unfolding in sisterly Iraq\nas a result of its occupation and the attempts to\nfragment the unity of its land and its people. We are\nnow facing a tragic situation that has led to the death of\nthousands of innocent Iraqis and to the destruction of\nthat sisterly country\u00eds infrastructure. Guided by our\ndesire to stem the bloodshed, we have taken many\nmeasures, which has put a burden on our resources.\nSyria has deployed thousands of its soldiers along\nthe Iraqi-Syrian border. We have also intercepted many\nof those attempting to infiltrate the border into Iraq. In\ncontrast, those who ceaselessly hurl accusations at\nSyria have failed to shoulder their responsibility to\nensure effective control of the border from the other\nside. The responsibility is shared between the two\nneighbouring countries. Although some had promised\nto assist us and provide technical equipment for border\ncontrol, they have failed to keep their promises.\nSyria condemns the acts of terrorism that\ncontinue to be perpetrated throughout Iraq, causing\nmany casualties among innocent civilians. We stress\nthat preserving the unity of Iraq\u00eds territory and people\nin these critical times requires a full commitment to\nnational unity on the part of all segments and groups of\nthe Iraqi population. Furthermore, Syria condemns all\nstatements aimed at creating discord and infighting\namong the Iraqi people. Such statements have been\ndisseminated by suspect groups that wish to spread\nchaos, extinguish hope and exacerbate suffering. Syria\nwill continue to support the political process in Iraq,\nuntil the country and its people overcome their plight\nand are able to exercise their right to self-\ndetermination in a unified, secure and prosperous Iraq.\nSyria welcomes the interest shown by the United\nNations and its Member States in combating and\neradicating terrorism. I find it necessary to affirm that\nSyria was one of the first countries to experience\nterrorism and that it has fought to eradicate it. From\nthis rostrum, Syria reaffirms that it will continue to\ncooperate with all States seeking to eradicate terrorism\nand implement all relevant Security Council\nresolutions.\nFurthermore, Syria has signed and ratified\ninternational conventions on terrorism, including, most\nrecently, the International Convention for the\nSuppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, which we\nsigned on the first day it was open for signature,\n14 September 2005. Syria emphasizes that it is\ncrucially important to avoid confusing terrorism \u00f3\nwhich we are combating and sincerely cooperating to\neradicate \u00f3 with the just struggle of peoples for\nliberation and independence, seeking to put an end to\nforeign occupation. That is a right guaranteed by the\nCharter of the United Nations, which most Member\nStates of the Organization hold dear. Syria was also\namong the first countries to initiate, in 1986, the\nproposal that an international conference be convened\nunder United Nations auspices to define terrorism and\nconsider its root causes.\nThe outcome of the Review Conference of the\nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) held several months ago\nrevealed the need to refocus international efforts on\nnuclear disarmament and to ensure the Treaty\u00eds\nuniversality. The facts clearly indicate the importance\nof returning to the principle of multilateralism and of\nmaking operational the various multilateral\ninternational conventions on disarmament issues.\nAt any rate, the Middle East region continues to\nexperience a unique situation that is both a source of\nconcern and a cause for censure. Israel alone runs a\ndangerous military nuclear programme outside any\ninternational framework and refuses to adhere to the\nNPT, while all the other States of the region are party\nto the Treaty and respect it in letter and spirit. Here, I\nmust recall once again Syria\u00eds initiative, proposed on\nbehalf of all the Arab States to the Security Council on\n29 December 2003, to eradicate all weapons of mass\ndestruction, including nuclear weapons, from the\nMiddle East region as a step towards declaring it a\nzone free of all weapons of mass destruction, including\nbanning nuclear weapons and preventing their\nproliferation.\nSyria is undergoing a serious process of\ncomprehensive economic and social reforms. The\nSyrian human development plan is modelled on the\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs); thus the\nplan's objectives serve as stepping stones towards the\nultimate achievement of the MDGs. The Syrian\nGovernment\u00eds strategy is based on the principles of\ncooperation for development, as reflected in the\nconcept of an effective development partnership among\nthe State, the private sector and civil society. Syria is\n22\n\nstriving to develop domestic investment, to encourage\nforeign investment and to improve the infrastructure\nand the performance of our institutions, while\neliminating waste and fighting corruption.\nImportant reports have recently been prepared in\ncoordination with the United Nations Development\nProgramme, including an analysis of the\nmacroeconomic situation; reports on poverty, national\ndevelopment and the Millennium Goals; and a Human\nDevelopment Report on education. Syria accords due\nimportance and attention to empowering women and\npromoting their rights so that they can fulfil their role.\nIn addition, Syria attaches great importance to\nchildren, to persons with special needs and the disabled\nwith a view to securing their future.\nSyria supports reform of the Security Council\naimed at improving its working methods, including\nincreasing its transparency. As I have previously\nstressed, we believe in the importance of just\nrepresentation of all regions in the Council through the\nexpansion of both the permanent and the non-\npermanent membership categories, and the need for\nrepresentation of the Arab States through a permanent\nseat in any Council expansion.\nAfrica remains at the centre of Syria's concerns.\nWithout stability in Africa, there will never be genuine\ndevelopment in the world. The Summit Outcome\ndocument (resolution 60/1) calls for sufficient efforts\nto satisfy the special needs of Africa. We believe that\nthat is necessary and correct. We do not believe that the\nSecurity Council can resolve Africa's problems by\nholding more meetings on the continent. It is more\nimportant to achieve concrete results by responding to\nAfrica's voice, respecting its viewpoints and taking its\nconcerns into account. In that regard, we should like to\npay tribute to the efforts of the African Union, as\nreflected in its mediation and good offices aimed at\ncrisis settlement in Africa.\nThe modern world and multilateral diplomacy,\nrepresented in the United Nations, stand at the\nthreshold of a new era. Let us all rise to the challenges\nconfronting us so that we may guarantee a future of\nsecurity, peace and stability for mankind."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I am pleased to greet and congratulate\nyou on your election, which will assure the success of\nthese debates. I am also pleased to greet Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan, whose efforts to preserve peace\nand promote solidarity among the world\u2019s peoples are\nrecognized and appreciated.\nMy country, Bolivia, located at the heart of South\nAmerica, has just overcome, with sacrifice and\ndeprivation, a profound political crisis. The maturity\nand the democratic spirit of my people led to a\ntransition period to ensure institutional continuity and\nto initiate a process to legitimize, through a universal\nvote, the election of the country\u2019s authorities.\nFurthermore, this process had as its goal to establish\ngovernability and to reaffirm faith in the citizens\u2019 right\nto elect their Government and the parliamentary\nrepresentatives of their choice.\nDuring the electoral process that Bolivia is\npresently undergoing, a new design for a pioneer\nnation in securing its liberty and independence will be\ndefined. The elections to take place at the end of this\nyear will bring about a new and unprecedented\npolitical scenario, a process to carry out a constituent\nassembly and the people\u2019s decision to put into practice\nregional autonomies that will lead to the establishment\nof a new social contract oriented towards the\nconstruction of a more organized country, forever\ndemocratic, without exclusion, as required by the\nMillennium Development Goals.\nA well-known Colombian citizen advised us that\nonly with a new look to the past may we create the\npossibility of another future; and only by looking\ncreatively at our world may we catch a glimpse of the\nnew type of order we ought to build. This vision is\n5\n\nshared by the peoples of Latin America and, of course,\nby Bolivians. For some time, we have been united in\nour effort to solve disputes by encouraging common\nactions so that disputing countries may look for and\nnegotiate peaceful solutions to their differences.\nIt is also true that in this America with profound\ndemocratic roots and ties of brotherhood and solidarity\namong the peoples, there are still unresolved situations,\nsuch as Bolivia\u2019s landlocked status. At the beginning of\nthe twenty-first century, the people of Bolivia and\nneighbouring countries should be capable of creating\nspaces in which open dialogue can take place, without\nprejudice, thereby allowing for solutions that look to\nthe future and are not based on positions anchored in\nthe past. We believe that it is essential to enter into\nnegotiations with a view to consulting, responding to\nand serving mutual interests and reaching a definitive\nsolution that restores Bolivia\u2019s sovereign access to the\nPacific coast. It is essential that we create an\nenvironment of trust for negotiation and agreement for\nthat purpose.\nLatin America is a region in which we dream\nabout freedom, hope for progress and the integration of\nour peoples, although this requires constant renewal\nand creativity on our part. I am convinced that we will\ncontinue with the necessary task of attaining the\nMillennium Development Goals set for 2015 and the\nsubsequent indicators for measuring social progress,\nalthough in the case of Bolivia we may face difficulties\nthat will require us to focus on inequality and\nexclusion, violent conflict, intolerance, unfair land\ndistribution, unemployment, extreme poverty and\nmalnutrition.\nThe Bolivian people fully agree that we need to\nlay a foundation for ensuring progress with equity.\nThus, a global effort is required if we are to eradicate\npoverty.\nAlthough significant progress has been made with\nregard to such indicators for sustainability, institutional\nimprovements and economic stability, the Government\nof Bolivia is concerned about the deadlines that have\nbeen set, and urges the international community to\nconsider putting in place better terms and conditions.\nHarmony among peoples cannot be achieved fully\nin a world in which security is put to the test every day\nby terrorist threats against innocent people and against\nthe systems chosen by peoples who cherish the\nconviction that the only way of safeguarding mutual\nrespect and harmony in society is through the exercise\nof democracy. Bolivia condemns terrorism and is\nactively combating that scourge afflicting humankind.\nOur Organization, which is committed to\npromoting the civilized coexistence of the peoples of\nthe world, is 60 years old. Founded by 45 States, it\nnow has 191 Members, which support and put into\npractice the guiding principles of our global\ncommunity. A world without the United Nations is\nunthinkable in either theory or practice, for it is\nguiding us towards a common destiny and away from\nsuch current tribulations as poverty, terrorism and\nviolence.\nBolivia recognizes that, throughout the 60 years\nof this Organization\u2019s life, it has benefited from\nvaluable cooperation efforts. Indeed, certain problems\nare shared by many countries. Thus international\ncooperation cannot be considered merely an act of\nsolidarity. Cooperation must be a pillar of peace, since\none of the threats that we are facing is increasing\ninequality leading to the marginalization of vast sectors\nof our societies. This brings dissatisfaction, which\nfrequently gives rise to dangerous social tensions.\nIt is not merely a question of achieving apparent\neconomic stability. Rather, we must significantly\nimprove quality of life indices, both out of basic\nrespect for human rights and because of the need for\nequity and justice.\nBolivia reaffirms its commitment to the principles\nof the United Nations, to peace and to democratic\ninstitutions. We believe that the United Nations is the\nhighest forum for universal interaction among\ncountries and individuals, and we also believe that its\ninstitutions and entities must be adapted and reformed\nif it is to achieve its objectives.\nThe interrelationship between development,\nsecurity and human rights within a framework of\ndemocratic values is an expression of today\u2019s\ninterdependent world, and of multilateralism, which\nreaffirms the leading role of the United Nations and\nour ongoing determination to promote social progress\nand to improve living standards within a broader\nconcept of freedom. In this context, Bolivia believes\nthat the recent commitment made at the world summit\nto adopt, in the near future, a United Nations\ndeclaration on the rights of indigenous peoples will\nencourage social integration and peaceful national\ncoexistence.\n6\n\nBolivia is sincere in its determination to achieve\npeace, solidarity and the well-being of all, to protect\nthe rule of law and to secure justice and liberty.\nUltimately, we are guided by democracy \u2014 a system\nthat can be improved upon, and a way of life."

        "file_text": "The conclusion of the\nsummit last week marks the beginning of another busy\nyear for the General Assembly and the Member States\nof the United Nations. The summit gave us an\nambitious new agenda and in the spirit of\nmultilateralism we must do our utmost to meet the\ngoals it set out. Denmark intends to pull up its sleeves\nand contribute to that undertaking and I encourage\nothers to do the same.\nIn his impressive report \u201cIn larger freedom\u201d\n(A/59/2005), issued in March, the Secretary-General\n11\n\ngave us the best possible basis for the necessary and\nprofound changes the Organization must undergo. The\nspirit of the new interrelated reform agenda is captured\nin the report\u2019s observation that \u201c\u2026 we will not enjoy\ndevelopment without security, we will not enjoy\nsecurity without development, and we will not enjoy\neither without respect for human rights\u201d (A/59/2005,\npara. 17). With those words the Secretary-General\nidentified the three pillars of the United Nations in the\ntwenty-first century: security, development and human\nrights.\nThe custodian of international peace and security\nis the Security Council. In October last year, members\nelected Denmark as a non-permanent member of the\nSecurity Council. We have \u2014 to the best of our\nabilities \u2014 sought to translate the trust bestowed upon\nus into action: Denmark holds the Chair of the Counter-\nTerrorism Committee; we work for improvements in\nUnited Nations peacekeeping by pursuing a holistic\napproach to the concept of peacebuilding; we advocate\nbetter protection for women and children; and we\nsupport a stronger emphasis on the rule of law and the\nneed to end impunity.\nThe Security Council must clearly demonstrate its\nwill to enforce the decisions taken by it. If not, the\nCouncil loses credibility, and the international\ncommunity loses its only forceful multilateral\ninstrument.\nTargeted sanctions are an important instrument\nfor achieving compliance with decisions of the\nSecurity Council and for compliance with international\nlaw in general. We must continue an intensive dialogue\non how best to implement sanctions and how to follow\nthem up to ensure the desired outcome. The approach\nmust always include both carrot and stick \u2014 incentive\nand punishment.\nThe United Nations plays a central role in efforts\nto fight terrorism and we support the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s outline for a comprehensive United Nations\ncounter-terrorism strategy that will engage the whole\nUnited Nations system in the fight against terrorism.\nWe will take an active part in its further development\nand implementation. We also welcome the new\nresolution on terrorism adopted by the Security\nCouncil (Security Council resolution 1624 (2005)).\nAs Chair of the Counter-Terrorism Committee,\nDenmark regards itself as having a special\nresponsibility in that field. We have given priority to\nenhanced cooperation between the relevant Security\nCouncil subsidiary organs dealing with terrorism, and\nwe will continue to do so. We have also engaged in\ndialogue with parts of the United Nations family not\npreviously involved in the fight against terrorism. The\naim of that dialogue is to identify their role in helping\nStates that would like to engage more actively in the\nfight against terrorism, but which lack the capacity to\ndo so. We will continue our efforts to strengthen the\nsynergies between relevant United Nations actors to\nfurther strengthen the counter-terrorism capability of\nthe United Nations.\nOur efforts to fight international terrorism must\nbe carried out with full respect for human rights and\nfundamental freedoms. It is imperative to strike the\nright balance between, on the one hand, preventive and\nswift action against terrorists and, on the other,\nadequate safeguards for the individual, and not least\nfor those who have been unjustly listed.\nThe summit has sent an important political\nmessage about the dedication of Member States to fight\nterrorism, even if it was not as strong as we had\nwished. We must now make every effort, at the present\nsession of the General Assembly, to reach agreement\non a comprehensive convention on international\nterrorism. Any further stalling on that important issue\nwill send the wrong message.\nThe single most frightening scenario today is that\nof weapons of mass destruction in the hands of non-\nState actors. Such possession constitutes a danger to\ncivilizations all over the world. Nobody can claim to\nbe safe today. Everybody must acknowledge the danger\nand refrain from activities that increase the threat. We\nneed a concerted effort in the field of non-proliferation\nand disarmament. The failure of the non-proliferation\ntreaty review conference, held this spring, to produce\nan agreement and the lack of new commitments at the\nsummit must not lead to resignation, but rather must\nspur us to redouble our efforts.\nAt the same, time concerted action is needed to\nend illicit traffic in small arms and light weapons,\nwhich kill 500,000 people every year. Arms transfers\nmust be transparent. Denmark strongly supports the\nadoption of an international arms trade treaty. Such a\ntreaty must be legally binding, include all weapons and\nbe United Nations-based.\nDenmark favours a holistic approach to\npeacebuilding. We believe the United Nations is well\n12\n\nplaced to coordinate international efforts to assist\ncountries emerging from conflict. Therefore, we have\nactively supported the establishment of the\nPeacebuilding Commission. This new body will add\nvalue to the work done by various actors including the\nfunds and programmes of the United Nations. I urge\nMember States to ensure that the Commission will be\noperational by the end of the year, as requested by the\nsummit.\nIt is a fact that conflicts in Africa continue to\nloom large on the Security Council\u2019s agenda. The\nslogan \u201cAfrican solutions to African problems\u201d must\nnot lead to indifference from donors. We must increase\nour assistance to regional capacity-building and, at the\nsame time, be prepared to provide the necessary human\nand financial resources for conflict prevention and\npeacebuilding efforts. To that end, Denmark is\nsponsoring a major capacity-building programme in\nAfrica in close cooperation with the African Union and\nthe Economic Community of West African States.\nThe summit confirmed our dedication to fulfil the\nMillennium Development Goals through considerable\ndonor commitments, as well as the need to pay\nparticular attention to countries in Africa that are\nlagging far behind. Denmark will remain well above\nthe 0.7 aid target and urges all donor countries to\nimplement the goals decided by the summit. The\nresponsibility, however, does not rest with donor\ncountries alone. In order to ensure sustainable\ndevelopment the world\u2019s poor countries must prioritize\nhuman development and respect for human rights,\ntackle national inequalities and curb corruption.\nIn a closely interrelated and interdependent\nworld, our collective security and prosperity depend\ncritically on the success of our fight against poverty.\nWe must continue to look for new ways to enforce\ninternational law and protect those in need. Promoting\nthe rule of law must be one of the main objectives\nwhen devising peacebuilding strategies in Africa and\nwhen addressing democratic deficits elsewhere.\nThe President returned to the Chair.\nIndeed, prosperity and security will occur only if\nand when we decide to respect and promote human\nrights. It is our obligation to address and to act on\nhuman rights violations wherever they occur, and we\nmust do so in a spirit of cooperation and\nunderstanding. It is our common duty to measure every\nMember State\u2019s actual performance against the\nuniversal standards of human rights, including when\nthat means naming and even shaming. Otherwise, we\nrisk undermining important norms of human decency\nand behaviour. All Governments must remember that\nthey are in office for the people and not for themselves.\nFor those reasons, Denmark strongly supports the\nestablishment of the Human Rights Council as a\npermanent, principal organ of the United Nations, as\nwell as the overall strengthening of the entire United\nNations human rights machinery, including the Office\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Human\nRights. Sixty years after the creation of this Organization,\nwe should give human rights the necessary attention and\npriority in order to meet the expectations of the people,\nwhom we are meant to serve.\nThe grave crimes against humanity committed in\nDarfur serve as a reminder to the international\ncommunity. Impunity is unacceptable. Some argue that\nwe face a dilemma every time a country emerges from\nconflict. They argue that the pursuit of justice clashes\nwith the pursuit of peace. However, peace and justice\nare not contradictory but, in fact, complementary. The\nprecedent created by the referral of the Darfur situation\nto the International Criminal Court is promising. It is a\nmajor step forward in the fight against impunity and\nbodes well for the pursuit of international justice.\nLastly, let me briefly address the call by the\nSecretary-General and Member States, including\nDenmark, for management reform. The Secretary-\nGeneral must be given the necessary discretionary\npowers, accompanied by accountability and\nindependent oversight. We need to modernize the way\nwe work so as to enable the Organization to meet its\nshare of the priorities set out at the summit.\nThe coming months will be crucial. The outcome\nof the summit must be implemented. We will be faced\nwith many difficult but important tasks. They will have\nto be solved in a true spirit of international\ncooperation. We must strengthen this great institution.\nIt has a vital role to play in the world of today.\nDenmark will spare no effort in doing its share."

        "file_text": "It is my honour to\ncongratulate you on your election to the presidency of\nthe sixtieth session of the General Assembly. I also\nwish to pay tribute to the tireless efforts of your\npredecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, for the manner in which he\nguided the work of the fifty-ninth session.\nI wish to extend the condolences of the Right\nHonourable Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of\nthe Bahamas, Perry Christie, and the Government and\npeople of the Bahamas to the Government and people\nof the United States in the aftermath of Hurricane\nKatrina last month. This is a scene with which the\npeople of the Bahamas are regrettably all too familiar,\nand we continue to offer our assistance and support in\nany way possible.\nThe High-level Plenary Meeting held last week,\nat which so many heads of State and Government were\nrepresented, served as a timely and much-needed\nreminder of the need for us all to recommit ourselves\nto the purposes and principles of this Organization. At\na time when some have begun to question the purpose\nof this Organization, the Bahamas reaffirms that the\nUnited Nations remains the best chance for all States,\nlarge and small, to achieve peace, security and\nsustainable development for our peoples.\nOne of the leaders who spoke last week was the\nMost Honourable P. J. Patterson, Prime Minister of\nJamaica. On April of 2006, Mr. Patterson demits office\nafter more than a decade in the service of his people\nand the Caribbean region as Prime Minister, and a\ngeneration as a parliamentarian and Government\nMinister. His statement last week was perhaps his final\nstatement to this Assembly as Prime Minister. The\nBahamas - and the region joins us, I am sure -\nsalutes Mr. Patterson as he retires from active public\nlife.\nMr. Patterson\u00eds example in Jamaica is one that we\nknow well enough in the Caribbean region. It is the\nexample of democratic governance and the traditions\nof regular elections and accountability to the publics\nwhom we serve. The history of democracy in our\nregion has also produced for the region an enviable\nstandard of living in many ways. This way of life has\nbeen described by the Prime Minister of Saint Vincent\nand the Grenadines, The Honourable Ralph Gonsalves,\nas the \\\"Caribbean civilization\\\" - one that did not\ndevelop without significant investment in our people\nand that cannot be sustained unless that investment\ncontinues.\nThe region is neither poor nor rich. It falls in\nbetween, having accomplished most if not all of the\nMillennium Development Goals. But as we watch the\ndevelopment of globalization, there is a tendency to\nforget that this region of relatively few people and\nsmall nations requires the continued support of the\ndeveloped world. Nowhere is this more evident than in\nthe decisions taken on sugar and bananas. There is a\nsymbiotic relationship between the region and the\ndeveloped world, with many of our people leaving the\nregion to help to sustain the way of life of the\ndeveloped world. There is a major transformation right\nnow in economies throughout the region.\nOur view is that greater attention from our\ndeveloped partners must therefore be paid to that\nregion in transition, looking towards investment,\nparticularly in education, support for the delivery of\nhealth care and continued support for democratic\ngovernance. It is not charity that is required, but a\nsound, sensible investment in our common future.\nHaiti is our poorest member in the region and is\nperhaps the example from which it is best to draw\nlessons. We want to thank Brazil and the many sister\ncountries of Latin America that have risen to the\nchallenge with men and materiel. But while much has\nbeen given, there are many pledges of donor aid that\nhave not materialized as they should. It is a complaint\nthroughout the developing world that donors make\npledges of financial and material support but do not\nfollow through on those pledges.\nHaiti today is paying the price in a real way for\nhaving charted the way towards freedom in this\nhemisphere when, in 1804, it struck a blow for the\nfreedom of Africans in the West. Today, we repeat\nwhat the American Christian Bishop, T. D. Jakes, said\n5\n\nin the National Cathedral in Washington last week\nwhen praying for the victims of Hurricane Katrina: it is\nwhat we do that counts, but what we say we will do.\nHaiti is of major interest to us in the Bahamas,\nbecause, given the circumstances of its economy and\nits national politics, the Bahamas and the region are\nfacing increased pressure from illegal migration from\nHaiti and the threat of instability. It is incumbent upon\nall of us in the United Nations to do all that we can to\nhelp resolve the issues in Haiti.\nIt is also important that we not overlook issues of\nglobal governance and institutional reform. It would be\nnearly impossible for small States, in particular, to\nsustain meaningful gains from the process of\nglobalization without a voice and without participation\nin international decision-making and norm-setting\nbodies. It is for that reason that the Bahamas is\nencouraged by the discussions that took place during\nthe high-level dialogue on financing for development,\nheld earlier this year, which confirmed that there is a\nplace for the United Nations in all aspects of global\nstandard-setting and assessment. The dialogue clearly\ndemonstrated that there is a need to address the\ndemocratic deficit in many of the international\neconomic, financial and trade institutions.\nFrom this rostrum last year, the Bahamas called\nfor the convening of a global forum to address the\nunfairness of unelected bodies imposing mandates that\nare unfunded upon developing economies like ours in\nthe region, without our countries having an opportunity\nto be heard and to influence the result. We call once\nagain for such a forum, and pledge that the Bahamas\nwill continue to work towards levelling the playing\nfield, particularly in the financial services sector.\nThe images of destruction in the aftermath of\nHurricane Katrina are all too familiar to many small\nisland developing States. The images have been\nsobering, as we realize that even the biggest and\nstrongest of us has to grapple with the difficulties\nassociated with the recovery from such a destructive\nforce of nature. Last year in this Hall, we said that the\nnative peoples of our region were so familiar with the\nviolent storms that plague the region in the summer\nmonths that they called them hurricanes. Today, we are\nseeing those storms hit with a savagery unknown in\nrecent times. It leads us to question whether we are\nnow being confronted by cyclical change or by climate\nchange. Either case places front and centre the need for\npublic policy on sustainable development and the\nimplementation of the Mauritius Strategy for small\nisland developing States.\nThe Bahamas, much of whose land is barely five\nfeet above mean sea level, wishes to highlight the need\nto undertake global action to address the problems of\nclimate change. With the warming of the Earth's\nsurfaces and oceans, we have seen an increase in the\nincidence of natural disasters, many of them causing\nuntold loss and damage. We have an opportunity,\nhowever, to address the adverse effects of climate\nchange. We have a chance to make a statement here\nduring this session that we will not neglect our\ncommon but differentiated responsibility to protect our\nenvironment and to send this message to Montreal,\nwhere, in November this year, the Kyoto Protocol can\nfinally begin to take on a more substantial form.\nFor countries such as the Bahamas, the threat of\ndevastation as a result of natural disasters is\nexacerbated by man-made hazards. We once again\nreiterate our grave concern about the serious threat\nposed to the security and economic development of\nCaribbean countries by the trans-shipment of nuclear\nwaste through the Caribbean Sea, and continue to call\non States involved in such trans-shipments to desist\nfrom that practice. In this context, I wish to highlight\nthe continuing efforts of the Caribbean region to\ndesignate the Caribbean Sea a special area in the\ncontext of sustainable development.\nThe achievement of sustainable development will\nrequire healthy, productive populations that are able\nboth to contribute to and benefit from social and\neconomic progress. The unrelenting spread of\nHIV/AIDS continues to threaten that progress in all\ncountries, but particularly in the hardest hit developing\ncountries. The Bahamas is a leader in the fight against\nHIV/AIDS in the Caribbean region, and has been\nrecognized at the international level for the progress\nmade in turning the tide against that disease in our\ncountry. We pay tribute to Dr. Perry Gomez, our lead\nphysician in the fight against HIV/AIDS and, indeed,\nto my predecessor at this rostrum, Mr. Denzil Douglas\nfrom Saint Kitts and Nevis, as well as to all the other\ncaregivers throughout the world. We welcome this\nbody's reaffirmation at the highest levels of the fight\nagainst that disease.\nIn this context, the Bahamas looks forward to the\nhigh-level five-year review of the progress made in\n6\n\nimplementation of the Declaration of Commitment on\nHIV/AIDS, scheduled to take place in June 2006. At\nthat time we must undertake an honest appraisal of\nwhat we have achieved and where we are failing short,\nand we must determine the way forward towards\nachieving the full implementation of the Declaration of\nCommitment.\nIn addition, the Bahamas has seen useful ideas\nadvanced by the United States of America, the World\nHealth Organization and the Pan American Health\nOrganization, to prevent a bird flu pandemic. We\nwould like to take this opportunity to alert the world\nthat we must fight to stop such an eventuality, and\npledge our support in doing so.\nBy virtue of its geographical location, the\nBahamas is an unwitting transit point for illegal drugs\nfrom producing countries south of our borders to\nconsumer countries to the north. We have consistently\npointed out that the Bahamas does not produce such\nsubstances and is not the ultimate destination for them.\nThat, however, does not stop the countries that\nconsume the drugs from blaming countries like ours for\nthe scourge. It is very unfair to do so. It is clear that\nconsuming nations must increase their efforts to reduce\ndemand within their borders. We continue to cooperate\nwith the United States and other countries in that\ninternational fight. Our successful efforts and those of\nthe broader region have been acknowledged by our\ninternational partners in the fight. I should like to\nmention in particular the admirable performance of the\nBahamas in its counter-narcotics effort and the superb\nrecord of our country's police in terms of dismantling\ndrug-trafficking organizations, as well as our hard\nwork to improve the country's ability to combat\nmoney-laundering. It is a fight that we pledge to\ncontinue.\nThe Bahamas, like other transit countries, is\nexperiencing the negative social impact of illegal\nactivities associated with that trade. The deadly nexus\nbetween illicit drugs and small arms and light weapons\nand other criminal activities is undermining the\neconomic and social fabric of our nation. We therefore\nwelcome the conclusion in June of the work of the\nOpen-ended Working Group on the marking and\ntracing of small arms and light weapons. The Bahamas,\nlike many other countries, would have strongly\npreferred to reach agreement on legally binding\ncommitments on the marking and tracing of such\nweapons. Nonetheless, we hope that this tool will\nprovide some of the necessary political will and\nmomentum to make real progress in halting the illicit\naccumulation and spread of small arms and light\nweapons. We also look forward to adopting concrete\ncommitments in the near future to regulate the\nactivities of brokers of small arms and light weapons.\nIn addition, the Bahamas continues to call on\ndeveloped countries to take the same extraordinary\nmeasures they use in seeking to stop the trafficking of\ndrugs into their countries to stop illegal arms from\nreaching our shores from their countries.\nThe Bahamas is pleased to note the adoption by\nthe General Assembly on 13 April 2005 of the\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of Acts\nof Nuclear Terrorism. We hope to be in a position to\nsign the Convention in the near future. We are resolute\nin the fight against the attacks on innocent people\ngoing about their daily lives by those pursuing dubious\nand nefarious political ends. The vicious attacks in\nLondon and Sharm el-Sheikh this year demonstrate\nclearly the urgency of our task.\nHowever, we must also remember that the fight\nagainst those who would attack our common\ncivilization can never be used as an excuse to curtail\nthe rights and freedoms of our citizens, and we must\nensure that all counter-measures must conform to both\nthe letter and the spirit of international human rights\nlaw. If we lose our common humanity in the process,\nthe other side will win. We must also ensure that a\nspirit of cooperation and assistance permeates our\ninternational cooperation efforts on this issue, as we\nunite to fight a common enemy.\nOver the past year, various issues related to the\nmanagement of United Nations programmes and funds\nhave been highlighted in the world media. Our\nOrganization has been plagued by allegations of\ncorruption and abuse. Therefore, during the months\nleading up to the present session, the Bahamas\nwelcomed the opportunity to engage constructively in\nconsultations to ensure a successful outcome on the\nquestion of management reform of the Organization.\nWe reaffirm our support for the Secretary-General with\nrespect to the bold measures that he promised in his\nreport entitled \\\"In larger freedom\\\" (A/59/2005), and\nwe believe that he should be given the necessary level\nof authority and flexibility to fulfil his function as our\nchief executive officer. However, that is not to say that\nwe support those proposals from other quarters that\nwould seek to transfer power from the General\n7\n\nAssembly to the Secretary-General in matters such as\nthe redeployment of resources. The General Assembly\nis and should remain the principal policy organ of the\nUnited Nations, with absolute powers in the area of\nsetting priorities. The Bahamas also looks forward to\ncontinuing discussions on the reform of the Security\nCouncil, particularly in relation to the Council\u00eds\nworking methods.\nLet me take this opportunity to thank Mr. Kofi\nAnnan for his fine work in leading the United Nations\nthrough treacherous seas over the past years. We will\nshortly celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the signing\nof the Charter of the United Nations. Looking back\nover the past 60 years, there is much of which we can\njustifiably be proud. There are some cases where we\nmust accept that the international community failed to\nlive up to its legal and moral obligation to act for the\nbenefit of people in need. There are some cases where\nour decisions were dominated by big-Power\npragmatism and doubtful legalisms, as opposed to\nmoral certainty and philosophical clarity.\nAs we move forward, let us be sure that we learn\nfrom our mistakes as well as our successes. We have\nengaged in a process of reflection, which at times has\nbeen painful. Let us emerge from this stronger, more\nunified and determined to act to achieve the goals\nadopted 60 years ago to promote social progress and\nbetter standards of life in larger freedom. The peoples\nof our nations demand and deserve nothing less. Now,\nmore than ever, we need the United Nations."

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset, on behalf of my delegation,\nwarmly to congratulate Mr. Eliasson on his outstanding\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at\nits sixtieth session. My country, Guinea, assures him of\nits full cooperation as he carries out his important\nmission.\nI also pay well-deserved tribute to his\npredecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, for the competence,\neffectiveness and devotion with which he led the work\nof the fifty-ninth session.\nI am also pleased to convey to Secretary-General\nKofi Annan the deep appreciation, encouragement and\nsupport of Mr. Lansana Cont\u00e9, President of the\nRepublic, for his tireless and praiseworthy work.\nThe summit meeting at this session of the General\nAssembly has substantially stiffened our common\nresolve to promote international peace and security, the\nrule of law and the right to development. The\n23\n\nassessment of the implementation of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals and the renewed commitment of\nStates Members to achieving them are cause for hope.\nThe Republic of Guinea nevertheless remains\nconvinced that if we are better to meet the threats and\nchallenges we face, we must resolutely pursue the\nreforms necessary to revitalize our Organization.\nIn the name of peace and security, the concerted\nand decisive action of the United Nations system and\nof regional and subregional organizations, the African\nUnion in particular, has made significant progress in\nrecent months.\nIn West Africa, and especially in the Mano River\nbasin, hopes for peace are gradually growing after\nyears of turbulence and tragedy.\nIn Liberia, the political and institutional rebirth\nunder way is encouraging, although many obstacles\nstill hinder national reconciliation and the country\u2019s\neconomic revival. It is essential that, in order to\npreserve their legitimacy and fairness, we do\neverything possible to prevent October\u2019s elections from\nbeing manipulated by the forces of destabilization. We\ntherefore call on the international community to give\nthat country the assistance necessary to seeing the\ntransition through and launching its own\nreconstruction.\nIn Sierra Leone, the process of national\nreconciliation is continuing, thereby promoting\npeacebuilding and development. My delegation\nbelieves that adequate financing for the Special Court\nfor Sierra Leone and the transfer of all persons\npresumed guilty of serious crimes under international\nlaw are prerequisites for putting an end to impunity and\nconsolidate subregional stability.\nAs concerns Guinea-Bissau, my country\nwelcomes the smooth holding of the presidential\nelections, which herald a positive new era that will be\nconducive to national reconciliation and a return to\nconstitutional order.\nIn C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, the signing of the Pretoria\nAgreement on 6 April 2005 has given rise to real hopes\nthat the crisis can be resolved. However, recent\ndevelopments are a source of concern to us. Our\nGovernment calls on all parties concerned to spare no\neffort to promote a political settlement of the conflict,\nsince peace and stability in the subregion hinge on this.\nIn Burundi, major progress has been made in the\npeace process, particularly through the holding of\nlegislative and presidential elections in free, fair and\npeaceful conditions. Guinea welcomes this and calls on\nour brothers in Burundi to continue on the path to\nnational reconciliation and reconstruction.\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where\nthe transitional period is at a decisive stage, problems\npersist in the eastern part of the country. My country\nencourages all parties to abide by the relevant\nprovisions of the comprehensive agreement.\nIn the Sudan, despite the sad death of Vice-\nPresident Garang, the establishment of a national unity\nGovernment and the political will shown by the various\nprotagonists will help to defuse tensions.\nGuinea urges all parties in Darfur to pursue the\nnegotiations that have begun under the auspices of the\nAfrican Union with a view to achieving a\ncomprehensive, consensus-based solution.\nIn the Horn of Africa, Somalia has reached a\ndecisive stage with the creation of a Transitional\nFederal Government. My delegation makes an urgent\nappeal to the various factions to engage in negotiations\nwith the Government in order to reach a\ncomprehensive peace agreement.\nRegarding the Ethiopia-Eritrea dispute, we call\non both parties fully to respect the Algiers Accord and\nto implement the Boundary Commission\u2019s decision.\nAs to the situation in the Western Sahara, Guinea\nsupports a negotiated and mutually acceptable solution.\nIt encourages the parties concerned to enhance their\ncooperation with the Special Representative of the\nSecretary-General.\nConcerning the Middle East, our Government\nwelcomes Israel\u2019s withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.\nHowever, we remain concerned by the occupation of\nthe West Bank, the continued illegal construction of the\nseparation wall and the continuing detention of\nPalestinian political prisoners.\nThat is why we appeal to the two parties to\nrespect the relevant resolutions of the General\nAssembly and of the Security Council, as well as the\nQuartet road map. This is the only way to bring about\nthe creation of two States \u2014 Palestine and Israel \u2014\nliving side by side in safety and security within secure\nand recognized boundaries.\n24\n\nIn Iraq, despite the holding of legislative\nelections that led to the establishment of a transitional\nGovernment, we cannot but deplore the current climate\nof daily violence. We agree that everything should be\ndone to help the country\u2019s leaders to consolidate the\npolitical transition, put an end to indiscriminate\nviolence and build a united, democratic and prosperous\nIraq.\nWith regard to Asia, our Government reaffirms its\nbelief in the principle of one China. We also attach\nimportance to the peaceful and independent\nreunification of the two Koreas as well as to ongoing\nefforts to maintain peace, security and stability on the\nKorean peninsula.\nMy delegation notes with profound concern the\nresurgence of terrorist activities throughout the world.\nWe strongly condemn terrorism in all its forms and in\nall its manifestations, for it constitutes one of the most\nserious threats to international peace and security. We\nexpress solidarity with all States that have fallen victim\nto it.\nTo eradicate that scourge, my delegation\nreaffirms the need to tackle with determination its root\ncauses, including injustice, exclusion, poverty and the\nintensification of social divisions.\nWe welcome the adoption by the Assembly on\n13 April 2005 of the resolution on the International\nConvention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear\nTerrorism, and we urge Member States to reach\nagreement on a comprehensive convention on\nterrorism.\nThe seventh Review Conference of the Parties to\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons and the Second Biennial Meeting of States to\nConsider the Implementation of the Programme of\nAction to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit\nTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its\nAspects, which were held, respectively, in May and\nJuly 2005, shows the concern of States parties to do\nmore to address disarmament-related problems.\nHowever, we note and deplore the fact that the\nStates parties to the Treaty have not yet succeeded in\nreaching consensus on questions of substance. Hence\nwe urge all States to continue negotiations in order to\nstrengthen the international non-proliferation regime.\nWith regard to combating the proliferation and\nillicit trade in small arms and light weapons, Guinea\nhas resolutely undertaken to eradicate that scourge and\nwelcomes the adoption of a draft instrument for the\ntracing of such weapons.\nWe invite the donor community to provide\nappropriate support for the implementation of the\nsubregional programme of the Economic Community\nof West African States (ECOWAS). The initiative to\ntransform the ECOWAS moratorium into a binding\nlegal instrument merits due consideration by Member\nStates.\nAware of the importance that peoples attach to\ndevelopment goals, of the latter\u2019s interdependence and\nof what is at stake, the Government of Guinea has\nadopted a national poverty-reduction strategy whose\nimplementation has, regrettably, been compromised by\nexternal factors linked to rebel attacks, a massive\ninflux of refugees and regional instability.\nMy delegation appeals urgently to all\ndevelopment partners to support Guinea in its efforts to\nimplement that strategy, which remains the most\ncertain way of achieving the Millennium Development\nGoals. In that connection, we welcome the recent\nprogress made in the framework of poverty reduction,\nparticularly the commitment of the G-8 to double\nofficial development assistance (ODA) over the next\nfew years and immediate debt cancellation for the 18\nmost indebted poor countries. We commend and\nendorse all other initiatives designed to increase funds\nfor ODA. We express the hope that the Gleneagles\ninitiative, which represents an important step forward\nin the right direction, will be translated into reality and\nwill be extended to all least developed countries.\nFurthermore, in the context of the current World\nTrade Organization trade negotiations, we urge\nMember States to show a spirit of compromise and\ndiligence in order to overcome their differences and\ncome to an understanding on a consensus programme\nfor the implementation of the Doha Development\nAgenda before the sixth Hong Kong Ministerial\nConference. What is at stake is the very future of the\nmultilateral trading system.\nOur work is taking place following the High-level\nPlenary Meeting, as a consequence of which our\nleaders have adopted an outcome document to guide\nour actions. The decisions and commitments taken at\nthe summit clearly indicate that a new era has begun.\nThe time for promises has passed, and we must now\ntranslate our commitments into concrete action in a\n25\n\nspirit of true solidarity between developed and\ndeveloping countries, on the basis of a far-reaching\nreform of our Organization.\nBy so doing, we will leave to future generations,\nto which we owe a debt, the right tools to lead\nhumankind towards a better future."

        "file_text": "I wish\nto congratulate you, Sir, on your election to preside\nover the General Assembly at its sixtieth session. I am\nconvinced that your talent will enable us to take useful\ndecisions. You can count on the full cooperation of my\ndelegation. I also thank the Secretary-General for his\nefforts to renew the Organization and his work on\nbehalf of the international community.\nThis general debate is being held after the summit\nto review the implementation of the Millennium Goals,\nin which many heads of State or Government\nparticipated, including the President of my country.\nThe work accomplished by the President at that\nMeeting will help to overcome the difficulties facing\nthe Organization.\nFor the Argentine Republic, respect for the rule\nof law is an essential premise. We believe that\ndemocracy is a universal value that is not the heritage\nof any country or region in particular. Day after day,\nwe strive to improve its quality and to ensure the rule\nof law and the impartiality and independence of our\njudiciary.\nMr. Singh (India), Vice-President took the Chair.\nRespect for human rights, whose protective\nnorms form part of our Constitution, is another of our\nconcerns. In my country, promoting and protecting\nhuman rights is a State policy that is part of our\ndemocratic identity as a nation and therefore is one of\nthe main underpinnings of our foreign policy.\nDefending the right to life and the right to dignity\nof men and women throughout the world does not\nallow half-hearted words or half-hearted solutions.\nThat is due to the importance that human rights have\nacquired in the international arena as a factor in the\npreservation of peace, development and democracy, as\nwell as in the cruel historic circumstances through\nwhich my country had to struggle.\nWe can never devote too much energy to\npromoting and protecting the human rights of all\npeoples of the world. Intolerance, censorship, torture\nand cruelty, even when they are presented as excesses\ncommitted in the name of beliefs, deny the validity of\nthe forum in which we are now speaking, and they will\ncontinue to do so as long as they exist.\nIn the context of its lasting commitment to\npolicies for social inclusion, my country, a few days\nago, adopted a national plan against discrimination. It\nunconditionally supports the progress of the\nnegotiations currently taking place in the Organization\nto achieve a comprehensive convention for people with\ndisabilities and hopes that work on that convention will\nbe completed in the course of the coming year.\nInternational solidarity can do a great deal for\nthose deprived of their fundamental rights and\nfreedoms, especially as nobody expects such torments\nto come upon them. That is why, from the start of the\ndiscussions on United Nations reform, we have taken a\nvery active stance to strengthen and perfect the\nuniversal system for the protection of human rights,\nmaking sure that those rights occupy the central\nposition that is their rightful place.\nThere are few things in which men have not\nbelieved \u2014 as few as those things they did not expect.\nFor that reason, in a country whose citizens were\nallowed to think that impunity is possible, those that\nsurvived must work to prevent history from being\nrepeated.\nWe therefore support the creation of a Human\nRights Council as an essential organ of the United\nNations and to give the issue of human rights the same\nimportance as that attached to development and\nsecurity. During the ongoing negotiations, Argentina\nwill work decisively to establish an organ that can\ncarry out vigorous and effective action to promote and\nprotect human rights in all the world.\nStrengthening global justice is necessary to put a\nstop to massive human rights violations, genocide and\ncrimes against humanity. Argentina is involved in the\n27\n\nfight against impunity for those crimes and\nunconditionally supports the International Criminal\nCourt.\nWe welcome the adoption of Security Council\nresolution 1593 (2005), which refers the situation of\nDarfur to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal\nCourt. That resolution represents a very important step\nin the strengthening of the institutions established\nunder the Rome Statute. It is a historical precedent\nlinked to the achievement of two main goals of the\nUnited Nations: peace and basic rights.\nArgentina, which in its past suffered systematic\nviolations of human rights characterized by torture,\nforced disappearances and summary executions of its\ncitizens, has taken decisive steps through its domestic\nlegislation to put an end to impunity. Our Supreme\nCourt recently ruled that the general amnesty laws\nentitled \u201cPunto Final\u201d and \u201cObediencia debida\u201d were\nunconstitutional and that they were an obstacle to\nattaining a postponed but necessary justice. Thus, we\njoin the efforts to ensure that those accountable for\ncrimes against humanity are tried and punished.\nAs the President of Argentina stated during the\nrecent summit, Argentina unequivocally condemns\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations, regardless\nof the causes it invokes. Nothing can justify\nindiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians and\nnon-combatants. We are strongly committed to fighting\nthat grave threat to international peace and security.\nOur response to terrorism must be ethical and\nmorally valid, and must therefore be carried out in full\nrespect of the United Nations Charter, the rule of law,\ninternational law, human rights, refugee law and\nhumanitarian law.\nGiven that we have to protect others from fear,\nwe must act in accordance with the principles of\nlegitimacy and proportionality and with the support of\ninternational public opinion.\nArgentina, the current Chair of the Security\nCouncil\u2019s 1267 (1999) Committee, responsible for\nmonitoring implementation of the sanctions against\nmembers of the terrorist group Al-Qaida and the\nTaliban, believes that the United Nations has a central\nrole to play in the coordinating the efforts and the\ndevelopment of international mechanisms. We must\nsupport those endeavours, particularly through the\nstrict and full implementation of Security Council\nresolutions.\nThis year, my country ratified the 1999\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\nFinancing of Terrorism. With that ratification, it\nbecame a State party to the 12 international\nconventions to combat terrorism. And we have just\nsigned the International Convention for the\nSuppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.\nIn spite of the efforts made, there has been an\nincrease in the number of attacks. That requires a\ncareful review and assessment of the objectives,\nmethods and approaches employed, as well as an\nimportant effort by the international community to\nbring conflicts to an end soon, eliminate aggressive\ninequalities and achieve a fairer, more rational world.\nThere has recently been some important\nconceptual progress towards the completion of an\ninternational convention on terrorism. We hope that\nthis instrument can soon be adopted.\nMy country \u2014 which suffered two very serious\nattacks, against the Israeli embassy in 1992 and against\nthe Argentine-Israeli Mutual Association (AMIA) in\nBuenos Aires in 1994 \u2014 is determined to shed light on\nthose heinous and unjustifiable criminal acts.\nIdentifying and punishing the culprits is our deeply felt\nduty to the innocent victims and their families. It is\nalso the desire of the Argentine people.\nThe United Nations is undergoing a reform\nprocess that must be transparent, thorough and\nadequate, and it must answer the urgent and undeniable\ndemands of our peoples. All main organs of the United\nNations should be thoroughly improved. The General\nAssembly, the principal deliberative and decision-\ntaking authority, must find a way to ensure that its\nvoice is heard throughout the world. The Economic and\nSocial Council also needs to be thoroughly rethought\nand restructured to make it more effective.\nA vast majority has called for enhancing the\ntransparency and the effectiveness of the Security\nCouncil. As part of the Uniting for Consensus\nmovement, Argentina will work for a Security Council\nthat includes new members only within the category of\nnon-permanent members, because we believe that we\nshould not create new privileges contrary to the\ndemocratic spirit that should reign in the United\nNations. Council members should be accountable for\n28\n\ntheir actions, and that can be achieved through periodic\nelections.\nFor its part, the Secretariat must continue its\nprocess of professionalization and universalization to\nbetter ensure its accountability and effectiveness.\nPeacekeeping operations are among the most\neffective tools of the United Nations to bring peace and\nsecurity to troubled peoples. Argentina is strongly\ncommitted to these operations, in which it has\nparticipated since 1958. Currently, we are contributing\nto eight of them.\nIn particular, I would highlight efforts being\nmade in Haiti in the search for a peaceful and lasting\nsolution to Haiti\u2019s serious challenges. We have long\nknown that the response to crisis does not end with the\nestablishment of a peacekeeping operation. Because of\nthis, we have established complex operations able to\npromote stable solutions in all fields: namely security;\nthe rule of law; justice; institution-building;\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration; social\nand economic development; human rights; and\ndemocracy.\nThat is why we stress the importance of\nestablishing a Peacebuilding Commission.\nArgentina supports the goals established at the\nMillennium Summit and at Johannesburg and\nMonterrey. Recent progress in development financing\nshows that while developing countries have made\nsignificant efforts to reform and streamline their\neconomies, these efforts have not been accompanied by\nmeasures on the part of developed countries to fulfil\nthe commitments adopted at those conferences.\nOnce again, we urge developed countries to allot\n0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product for\ndevelopment assistance, to open their markets and to\ndo away with subsidies. We support the Monterrey\nConsensus provisions on reform of the international\nfinancial system to adapt the system to the new\nchallenges posed by the fulfilment of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals.\nWe believe in the need to study and negotiate the\ncreation of new international financial instruments that\nwill prove more efficient in the ongoing fight against\nhunger and poverty.\nI turn now to two topics that are of utmost\nimportance to Argentina: first, the international trade\nsituation. As the summit outcome document that we\nhave adopted (resolution 60/1) states, international\ntrade is a fundamental tool for economic and social\ndevelopment. It is, therefore, imperative that we\nestablish fair, equitable and rule-based international\ntrade that is inclusive and gives priority to\ndevelopment. The ongoing World Trade Organization\n(WTO) negotiations in the context of the Doha\ndevelopment round are of key importance. It is\nessential for the WTO to promote a fair international\ntrade system. Developed countries must eliminate\nprotectionist measures in the form of subsidies,\nnon-tariff barriers and arbitrary standards, which\ndistort and limit commercial exchanges, especially in\nthe agricultural sector.\nThe sixth WTO Ministerial Conference, to be\nheld in Hong Kong, is drawing near, and there is still a\ngreat deal to be done. We hope that it will enable us to\nincrease the indirect benefits to be gained through\ngrowing participation by developing countries in\ninternational trade.\nSecondly, we must also deal with the question of\nexternal debt. International bodies must adopt\neffective, broad, equitable and lasting solutions to the\nproblem of the debt of developing countries. The\nconcept of sustainability of external debt must be\nredefined, bearing in mind the primary responsibility\nof the State to maintain and stimulate development in\nsectors such as health, education and promotion of\nemployment. It is illogical to transform developing\ncountries into relatively less-developed countries so\nthat when the desperate moment arrives, the debt\ncancellation process can begin.\nIn conclusion, I also wish to refer here to the\nquestion of the Malvinas Islands. Recovery of the full\nexercise of sovereignty over the Malvinas, South\nGeorgia and South Sandwich Islands and the\nsurrounding maritime areas is among the national\ninterests that are an essential component of Argentina\u2019s\nidentity as a democratic nation. All Argentines are\nstrongly committed to the peaceful settlement of this\ndispute; this commitment is a priority of my country\u2019s\nforeign policy and is enshrined in our Constitution.\nArgentina has repeatedly stated its willingness to\nresume negotiations on sovereignty, as took place\nbetween 1966 and 1982.\nI wish to conclude by reiterating that we have an\nopportunity to renew this Organization so that it is\n29\n\nbetter equipped to meet the numerous demands of\nhumanity. Everything we can achieve today will result\nin benefits for future generations. We shall cooperate\nwith other United Nations Members to that end with\ndue modesty, as any party expecting the same level of\ncommitment from others would cooperate."

        "file_text": "Your election, Sir, as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixtieth\nsession comes at a significant moment in the history of\nthe United Nations. The outcome document adopted by\nour heads of State or Government shortly after the\nbeginning of the session represents the culmination of\na long process. It started with the report of the High-\nlevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change. It\ncontinued with the Secretary-General\u2019s \u201cIn larger\nfreedom\u201d report, and the efforts of your distinguished\npredecessor to synthesize those ideas for the\nconsideration of Member States. We thank all of those\ninvolved for their dedicated efforts.\nWe are united in our commitment to\nmultilateralism; that is a good foundation for our\nfurther efforts. All countries, especially those from the\ndeveloping world, played a significant role in the\nnegotiations on the outcome document. Much was\nachieved; much has been left out. There are\nfoundations on which we have to build, but there are\nalso shortcomings which we need to correct in the\nprocess of implementation. A notable omission is the\ntheme of disarmament. Our struggle for multilaterally\nnegotiated, universal and verifiable nuclear\ndisarmament, in a time-bound manner, must continue\nwith vigour. The outcome document must serve as a\nroad map, with its main elements acting as signposts in\nour discussions over the coming months under your\nstewardship, Mr. President.\n26\n\nYou, Sir, have suggested a very appropriate theme\nfor the general debate: \u201cFor a stronger and more\neffective United Nations: follow-up to and\nimplementation of the High-Level Meeting in\nSeptember 2005\u201d. We believe that that captures the\nspirit and essence of all that we, co-partners in the\nUnited Nations, wish to achieve.\nIndia is the world\u2019s largest democracy. There is\nno historical precedent for a democracy of over 1\nbillion people. It is a tremendous undertaking. It is also\nan exciting and inspiring one. We are breaking new\nground. The fact that Indian democracy works is a\npolitical miracle. The credit goes to the Indian voters.\nThey ensure that India remains secular, democratic and\npluralistic.\nWe also believe that we need to do much more to\ninculcate respect for and acceptance of pluralism. I am\nreminded of what Mahatma Gandhi, the father of our\nnation, said:\n\u201cI do not want my house to be walled in on all\nsides and my windows to be stuffed. I want the\ncultures of all the lands to be blown about my\nhouse as freely as possible. But I refuse to be\nblown off my feet by any.\u201d\nHumankind is now learning, to some extent, to\ncope with the menace of terrorism. We all know that\nthat evil is increasingly directed at innocent civilians.\nIt invites the strongest condemnation. We all agree that\nthere can be no justification for terrorism in any form.\nWhether we are considering terrorism or non-\nproliferation, unless there is a non-selective, uniform\nand sustained approach, the objectives of the\ninternational community cannot be achieved. The\noutcome document reflects the joint resolve of the\ninternational community to fight terrorism. In our\njudgement, there is no institutional setting that is more\ncapable than the United Nations of providing cohesion\nand vigour to those efforts.\nAs a victim of terrorism over the past two\ndecades, India understands, and is fully supportive of,\nthe need for United Nations action on counter-\nterrorism. A key aspect of the implementation of the\noutcome document will be the development and\nadoption by the General Assembly of a strong counter-\nterrorism agenda to supplement the existing General\nAssembly and Security Council resolutions on that\nissue. As an initiator of the draft comprehensive\nconvention on international terrorism, India welcomes,\nand is fully committed to, the decision taken by heads\nof State or Government to conclude negotiations on the\nconvention during this session of the General\nAssembly.\nThe main purpose of the summit last week was to\nreview the implementation of the Millennium\nDeclaration. Unfortunately, most developing countries\nwill not be able to achieve the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals, given current growth rates and\nlevels of international support. We must strengthen\nefforts at both the national and the international levels\nto take us closer to the development targets set out in\nthe Millennium document.\nThe Millennium Development Goals embody a\nquantifiable vision of human dignity and solidarity, as\nwell as of important economic and social rights. Yet,\nimportant objectives, such as employment, critical for\ndeveloping countries, are excluded. India\u2019s use of\ninnovative financial instruments for rural\ninfrastructural investment, as well as our Rural\nEmployment Guarantee Bill \u2014 recently passed in\nParliament \u2014 I believe may be of interest to other\ndeveloping countries.\nMost of us had much higher expectations of the\nsummit in the area of development, particularly in\nagreeing on a definite timetable for the achievement of\nthe 0.7 per cent target for official development\nassistance. Unfortunately, that has not been achieved,\nand we have gone down to 0.5 per cent. That is equally\ntrue of innovative sources of financing because\ndeveloping countries cannot break out of the cycle of\npoverty without enhanced resource flows and the\napplication of science and technology to meet their\ndevelopmental challenges.\nAs India\u2019s own economy develops \u2014 at about 8\nper cent per year \u2014 and its technological advancement\ncomes of age, we are expanding our economic and\ntechnical cooperation with the developing countries,\nreinforcing our political solidarity. We have extensive\nprogrammes in Africa and elsewhere in the developing\nworld. We are also happy to have contributed to the\nSouth Fund for Development and Humanitarian\nAssistance. The India-Brazil-South Africa Facility for\nAlleviation of Poverty and Hunger is a good example\nof South-South cooperation.\nIndia has written off the debts of all the highly\nindebted poor countries. Given India\u2019s long-term\nassociation with and commitment to Africa, we\n27\n\nwelcome the recognition given by the High-level\nPlenary Meeting to the need to urgently address the\nspecial needs of our African brothers and sisters. On its\npart, India has undertaken several initiatives in\npartnership with Africa. The Techno-Economic\nApproach for Africa-India Movement initiative is\ndesigned to promote technology transfer to West\nAfrica. The pivotal role of scientific knowledge and\ntechnology for economic development cannot be\noverstated. India stands ready to share its experience\nwith the developing countries of Africa and elsewhere.\nTo bridge the digital divide within a country\nitself, which sometimes becomes as problematic as it is\nat the international level, wireless local loop\ntechnology developed in India, which eliminates\nexpensive equipment and copper lines, has already\nbeen used in several countries in Africa. India has put\ntogether a connectivity mission in Africa, using fiber\noptics and dedicated satellite. It will support tele-\neducation, telemedicine, e-commerce and e-\ngovernance, infotainment, resource mapping and\nmeteorological services. India is also earmarking $1.5\nbillion for lines of credit to assist developing countries,\nin particular those in Africa, in fighting HIV/AIDS and\nother pandemics.\nThe international community needs to address\nintellectual property regimes that seek to deny\ntechnologies rather than facilitating their transfer to the\ndeveloping countries, including in the areas of\nenvironment and public health.\nAlthough both the Millennium Declaration and\nthe outcome document have spoken of exploiting the\nbeneficial aspects of globalization, we are yet to agree\non and implement the modalities for such a process.\nMaking the process of globalization fairer and more\nequitable remains one of the main challenges of our\ntime. At present, the accumulation of wealth is\naccompanied by the accumulation of poverty. Ruskin,\nthe nineteenth century British author, in his book Unto\nthis Last \u2014 a favourite of Mahatma Gandhi \u2014\ndescribed such wealth as \u201cthe gilded index of a far-\nreaching ruin, a wrecker\u2019s pile of coin gleaned from a\nbeach to which he has beguiled an argosy.\u201d Poverty is\nsometimes attributed to lack of entrepreneurship. The\npoor of the world prove their entrepreneurship every\nday by ensuring their families\u2019 physical survival.\nRegrettably, the summit has not given a clear and\ncomprehensive direction to the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO) Doha Round of trade\nnegotiations. Formulas are not an end in themselves;\nthe end has to be a decrease in poverty and an increase\nin employment. Therefore, equal treatment cannot be\nforced on unequal partners. Special and differential\ntreatment remains an integral component of all trade\nnegotiations, including agriculture and non-agricultural\nmarket access. India, as a member of the G-20, will\ncontinue to promote in the WTO and elsewhere the\ninterests of all developing countries, including the\nsmall island developing States, the least developed, the\nlandlocked and the highly indebted poor countries.\nAn achievement of the developing countries in\nthe Group of 77 is their hard-fought and reasonably\nsuccessful struggle for progress on systemic issues\ncritical to good international economic governance. We\nhave to build on that to ensure the reform of Bretton\nWoods institutions and the restoration of the central\nrole of the United Nations in setting the international\neconomic agenda.\nA change in the composition of the Security\nCouncil is an imperative. The G-4 framework\nresolution has made United Nations reform a central\nissue that can no longer be ignored or disregarded.\nThere is a democracy deficit, as the Secretary-General\nalso said in July, in the governance of the United\nNations. There is not much point in speaking of\ninclusiveness, transparency and democracy and leaving\nthe Security Council as a glaring exception to those\nprinciples. Measures taken so far to revitalize the\nGeneral Assembly are simply not enough. Only by\nelecting permanent members committed to rendering\nunto the General Assembly what is the General\nAssembly\u2019s can that be done. That is essential for a\nworld order in which decisions are optimal and\ntherefore acceptable, and the use of force minimal.\nJawaharlal Nehru, India\u2019s first Prime Minister,\naptly stated: \u201cAbove all, we have to participate in the\ngrowing structure of a world order. We cannot rely on\nothers to do it on our behalf.\u201d One cannot argue in\nfavour of democracy in the rest of the world and leave\nthe Security Council undemocratic. Effectiveness is a\nfunction of right decisions with broad support.\nNegotiations on the outcome document and many\nsubsequent statements have demonstrated that, if more\ncould not be achieved on the development aspects of\ntrade in the document, it is because the Security\nCouncil has not been made representative. If\ninstitutional reform has been faltering and many are\n28\n\ndoubtful of securing a just solution, it is because the\nSecurity Council does not reflect the world of today. It\nreflects the world of 1945.\nThe unsatisfactory progress on other issues shows\nthat critics of Security Council expansion in both the\ncategories were profoundly mistaken. Security Council\nreform, far from hindering progress, was actually\nhelping it. In its absence, fears of intervention have\nprevented agreement on a human rights council and\nother issues. Therefore, Security Council reform\nremains more necessary than ever and should\npreferably, as the Secretary-General has said, be\ncompleted by the end of the year. That should be our\nmain priority; I doubt if it is. Security Council reform\nis not about any country\u2019s prestige or power, but about\ntransforming the balance of power in the world. Our\nexperience in India from the freedom movement to\npresent times shows that diversity is a source of\nstrength and effectiveness. The same would be true of a\nreformed Security Council. We would continue also to\nengage actively in the strengthening of the Economic\nand Social Council, the restructuring of the Secretariat\nand the setting-up of peacebuilding commission.\nAs we observe the sixtieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations, I am reminded once again of the words\nof India\u2019s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, who\nsaid at this very forum 45 years ago:\n\u201cDuring these past fifteen years the United\nNations has often been criticized for its structure\nand for some of its activities. These criticisms\nhave had some justification behind them, but\nlooking at the broad picture I think that we can\ndefinitely say that the United Nations has amply\njustified its existence and repeatedly prevented\nour recurrent crises from developing into war. It\nhas played a great role, and it is a little difficult\nnow to think of this troubled world without the\nUnited Nations.\u201d (A/PV.882, para. 110)\nIn the life of individuals as well as of institutions,\nthe completion of 60 years is a significant moment for\nstocktaking \u2014 certainly in my part of the world. Even\nas we reflect upon the functioning of this institution\nsince its inception in 1945, all of us gathered here look\nforward to the realization of new hopes, aspirations\nand, indeed, to a rejuvenated United Nations which is\nfully geared to meet the myriad challenges of our times\nand effectively contribute to the well-being and\ndevelopment of humanity at large and to manage\nchange.\nThe vision which we have for a better world is\nbest described in the words of a great son of India, the\ngreat poet Rabindranath Tagore, who was the first\nAsian to be awarded the Nobel Prize in literature. I\nshall end my statement by quoting a very famous text\nof his:\n\u201cWhere the mind is without fear and the head is\nheld high\nWhere knowledge is free\nWhere the world has not been broken up into\nfragments by narrow domestic walls\nWhere words come out from the depth of truth\nWhere tireless striving stretches its arms towards\nperfection\nWhere the clear stream of reason has not lost its\nway\nInto the dreary desert sand of dead habit\nWhere the mind is led forward by thee\nInto ever-widening thought and action\nInto that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my\ncountry awake.\u201d"

        "file_text": "A small boy on the run\nremains vividly in my mind today, a boy with eyes that\nhave seen more horror than most of us in this Hall have\never seen, a boy whom all of us have failed.\nThere are thousands of children like him in\nDarfur. I met him when I visited areas of fear,\nsuffering, hunger and senseless violence. We owe that\nboy in Darfur more: better performance; a stronger\nconnection between our declarations and our actions.\nWe have tools to prevent armed conflicts. We\nhave made many commitments to end oppression,\nradically reduce poverty and protect our environment.\nWe have cures for many of the diseases that continue to\nkill. The challenge before us is to use instruments for\npeace, development and human rights, and to transform\nour commitments into real action.\nCooperation across borders is not just a good\nidea - it is a must. And for the truly global\nchallenges, the United Nations is indispensable. Our\njoint commitment to the Charter of the United Nations\nis an excellent starting point But as new threats emerge\nand the world evolves, the United Nations must also\nadapt.\nWe need a multilateralism that is effective, with\ninstitutions that have teeth and a strong political will to\nmake them work. We need a multilateralism that is\nbased on common principles, not on the lowest\ncommon denominator of the day. We need a rule-based\ninternational order, applicable to all.\nThis is a crucial year for the United Nations. The\nSecretary-General has, with great courage and vision,\nled the way. The outcome of the summit sets the\ndirection. This session of the General Assembly has\nbeen given the responsibility of following up on\nimportant decisions. We must together achieve real\nresults in a number of areas. Let me highlight some of\nthe main challenges.\nThe first challenge is to make progress on the\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). Millions of\npeople still suffer from extreme poverty. Important\nprogress has been made towards the goal of eradicating\npoverty, but we need to do better. All developed\ncountries should make timetables for reaching the\ntarget of 0.7 per cent of gross national income for\ninternational development assistance by the year 2015.\nSweden will reach its one per cent target next year.\nEqually important is that all countries live up to the\ncommitments on aid effectiveness, to our agreements\nfrom Monterrey and to our promises to find new ways\nof financing development.\nBetter progress in preventing maternal and child\nmortality is vital for reaching many of the MDGs. We\nmust renew our commitment of universal access to\nreproductive health care by 2015 and give more focus\nto sexual and reproductive health care and rights.\nMarket access for goods and services must be\nsubstantially improved for poor countries. Trade-\ndistorting subsidies need to be phased out. Sweden will\ncontinue to work for reduced agricultural subsidies and\nto press for speedy implementation of the development\ndimension of the Doha work programme.\nWhile the developed world can and should play a\nbigger part in order to reach the MDGs, the developing\ncountries bear the critical responsibility for their own\ndevelopment. The importance for the sustainability of\ndevelopment efforts of good governance, well-\n39\n\nfunctioning democratic institutions and full respect for\nhuman rights and the rule of law cannot be\nunderestimated.\nThe second challenge is to halt climate change.\nAwareness of the connection between the way we live\nour lives, particularly in the industrialized world, and\nits effects on the long-term survival of our planet is\ntoday greater than ever. But action is still much too\nlimited. It is deeply regrettable that no firm agreement\non the way forward was reached at the summit. All\nparties to the Kyoto Protocol and to the United Nations\nClimate Change Convention must continue to\nimplement their commitments. There is also a need to\nurgently initiate a process aimed at controlling climate\nchange beyond the year 2012.\nThe third challenge is to combat terrorism\ntogether. Terrorism has taken the lives of thousands of\ninnocent people. One of our most urgent priorities must\nbe to stop and prevent terrorism. It remains a threat to\nall of us. We need to address these threats together,\nwith a broad strategy, and with respect for human\nrights. The outcome of the summit has given us a\nplatform to build on. The United Nations should now\ntake the lead in developing a comprehensive counter-\nterrorism strategy based on the Secretary-General\u00eds\nexcellent work. We must also conclude a\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism,\nincluding a legal definition, during the sixtieth session\nof the General Assembly.\nThe fourth challenge is to better promote human\nrights. Human rights are violated throughout the world,\ncreating enormous suffering and affecting both security\nand development. Human rights must be mainstreamed\nin all United Nations work as a core task of the\nOrganization. Sweden welcomes the decision to create\na Human Rights Council. That Council will need a\nstrong mandate to address any human rights situation,\nrespond to urgent human rights violations and monitor\ncompliance by all States with their human rights\nobligations. We must all join in efforts to establish an\neffective and legitimate Human Rights Council during\nthe sixtieth session.\nThe summit made a strong commitment to our\ncommon responsibility to protect. We must now act\naccordingly. The world has a responsibility to react in\norder to prevent genocide, ethnic cleansing and crimes\nagainst humanity. The Security Council must be ready\nto take responsibility if and when a State cannot give\nits citizens the necessary protection. However, it is not\njust a question of acknowledging the obligation to act;\nit is also a question of being prepared to actually do so.\nThe fifth challenge is to implement commitments\non disarmament and non-proliferation. Weapons of\nmass destruction could kill all of us here, all at once.\nThey could wipe out villages, cities and entire\npopulations in seconds. Yet we still do not take the\nthreat seriously enough. It should have been made clear\nat the summit that disarmament commitments are to be\nimplemented and that non-proliferation undertakings\nare to be complied with. The countries in possession of\nnuclear weapons have a special responsibility to\ndisarm. At the summit, decisions should have been\ntaken to strengthen verification. There should have\nbeen commitments to make the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and other\narms conventions universal. Negotiation processes\nshould have been given a boost by the summit. None of\nthat actually happened.\nSweden looks forward to the recommendations of\nthe Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission, chaired\nby Mr. Hans Blix. The failure to address the threat\nposed by weapons of mass destruction leaves us with\nan immensely important task ahead.\nThe sixth challenge is to put the Peacebuilding\nCommission in place promptly. Far too many people in\nwar-torn countries have seen a fragile peace relapse\ninto new conflict. With the establishment of the\nPeacebuilding Commission, the United Nations is\nbetter equipped to build peace in war-torn societies and\nto prevent countries from relapsing into war. In order\nto be successful, the Commission needs to draw on\nlessons from international peace efforts. Regional\norganizations will have important contributions to\nmake. The Peacebuilding Commission needs a well-\nbalanced composition, including major donor\ncountries. Let us establish this Commission before the\nend of the year. Sweden is ready to do its part,\nincluding through the swift provision of financial\ncontributions.\nThe seventh challenge is to reform the Security\nCouncil and the Secretariat. United Nations reform will\nnot be complete without Security Council reform. If\nthe decisions of the Council are to be accepted as\nlegitimate and effectively implemented, the Council\nneeds to better represent the world of today. In\naddition, the Council\u00eds effectiveness must be\n40\n\nsafeguarded. There should be no extension of the right\nof veto, and the use of the veto should be limited. The\nreform of the United Nations also requires the reform\nof the Secretariat. The summit took several important\ndecisions on management reform. Those include a\nreview of internal rules, regulations and mandates and\nthe strengthening of the oversight system. But greater\nflexibility must be given to the Secretary-General in\nmanaging staff and resources. That would not only\nmake the Secretariat more efficient, but it would also\nenable Member States to focus more on strategic issues\nand make the Organization more dynamic.\nThe summit has provided essential momentum for\nmore effective multilateralism. The legacy of our\nefforts will continue to be determined during the\nsixtieth session of the General Assembly. During the\nmonths ahead the task can be completed - the task to\ncreate a United Nations capable of facing the\nchallenges of our time.\nIn conclusion, let me return to the subject with\nwhich I began: Darfur. The United Nations must, above\nall, serve the interests of the boy that I met there and of\nall the other children, as well as the husbands, the\nwives, the grandparents - men and women of this\nworld who lack security, hope and human dignity. That\nis our mission."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, allow me at the outset to congratulate\nyou warmly on your election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its sixtieth session. I would also\nlike to express my confidence that your well-known\nwisdom and competence will contribute to enriching\nand focusing the deliberations of this Assembly.\nMoreover, I would like to express my gratitude to your\npredecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, for the strenuous efforts he\nexerted during the past session. I would especially like\nto convey my appreciation to Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan for his notable efforts in advancing the reform\nprocess in the United Nations.\nFrom this rostrum, allow me to convey my\ncountry's solidarity with the people and Government of\nthe United States of America for the tragedy that was\ninflicted on certain regions and cities by Hurricane\nKatrina. I would like to extend our sincere condolences\nto the families of the victims and our sympathy for the\ndestruction caused by the hurricane.\nTackling the reform of the United Nations\nrequires the objective recognition that the\nOrganization, since its establishment in 1945, has\nachieved a large measure of success in the realization\nof the purposes and principles of its Charter.\nObjectivity further requires the admission that\nsubstantive and concrete changes have affected the\ncore of the international order and the network of\ninternational relations; this has made it imperative to\nreview the role of the United Nations as a matter of a\nreal and urgent international necessity. Such a review\nshould focus on a comprehensive revitalization of this\nrole in order to enable the Organization to respond to\nsuch challenges and changes affecting the international\nsystem.\nThe United Nations Charter is a document that is\ncapable of coping with international developments,\nprovided that Member States have the political will to\nintroduce the necessary reforms into the work of the\nmain organs of the Organization. The reforms should\nensure that these bodies are able to fulfil the ambitions\nof member States and, at the same time, provide the\nenvironment and mechanism necessary to guarantee the\nfaithful application of the Charter's provisions and the\nimplementation of resolutions adopted, particularly\nSecurity Council resolutions, without discrimination.\nIn this context, we would like to welcome the\nresults of this year's world summit and the adoption of\nthe outcome document, even though more could have\nbeen achieved in the document, particularly in relation\nto the renewal of the international community's\ncommitment to the Millennium Development Goals\n(MDGs). Nevertheless, we hope that the document will\nbe a starting point to development and reform, which\nwe all hope to achieve, so that the United Nations\nremains the cornerstone of the system of international\nrelations.\nWhile emphasizing the principles of the non-use\nof force in international relations and non-interference\nin the internal affairs of States, we believe that the\nCharter's provisions, if applied, would respond to the\nnew and unconventional challenges that constitute a\npossible threat to international peace and security. The\nSecurity Council can deal with such challenges\nappropriately and in a timely manner, if the will exists\nto do so, without exceeding its powers. This requires\nthat serious consideration be given to revitalizing the\nCouncil's mechanisms in order to make them more\ndemocratic, transparent and representative. That, in\nturn, requires an expansion of both permanent and\nnon-permanent membership of the Council in a way\nthat reflects the current international situation and the\nsignificant increase in United Nations membership.\nIn the context of reform, it is imperative to\nstrengthen the General Assembly and enhance its role,\nwhich complements that of the Security Council in the\nmaintenance of international peace and security. The\nrole of the General Assembly is central, since it is the\norgan in which all United Nations Member States are\nrepresented. It is, therefore, capable of dealing\neffectively with the requirements of enhanced\nmultilateral international cooperation and the\ndevelopment of the policies necessary for such\ncooperation.\n18\n\nWe support the development of the work of the\nEconomic and Social Council in order to resolve\nemerging economic, social and development challenges\nand problems. We would like to emphasize the\nCouncil's leading role in coordinating and guiding the\ninternational development process and promoting the\nachievement of the MDGs, which Member States\npledged to implement and fulfil by the year 2015.\nIt is important to consider seriously the current\ncoordination mechanisms with other international\norganizations involved in development and the\nliberalization of world economy and trade. It is also\nimperative to consider the reduction of the debt of\ndeveloping countries, in accordance with a\nmethodology that helps to achieve sustainable\ndevelopment and bridge the widening gap between\ndeveloped and developing countries.\nMoreover, this development methodology ought\nto parallel commitments by States towards certain key\nissues, such as the promotion of good governance,\nrespect for human rights and basic freedoms and the\ncombating of corruption. This is done through a reform\nprocess that should take into consideration the\nparticular cultural specificities of each State.\nConfronting the existing challenges and settling\nconflicts requires us to emphasize the necessity to\nrespect the rule of law and human rights.\nCombating international terrorism is a priority\nthat requires the close cooperation of all on the basis of\nthe principles mentioned earlier. The same can be said\nof responses to acts of aggression against others, which\nshould accord with existing commitments under the\nCharter, international law and Security Council\nresolutions. To safeguard human rights, it is crucial to\nrevitalize human rights mechanisms, promote their\nwork and establish new machinery, including a Human\nRights Council. In the same context, respect for the\nrule of law requires that we address more serious\ncrimes against the international community \u00f3 hence\nthe pivotal role of the International Criminal Court in\ncombating war crimes, genocide and crimes against\nhumanity. Moreover, the promotion of the rule of law\nmakes it imperative to resort to the International Court\nof Justice to settle disputes between States and to\nrespect its decisions and advisory opinions.\nMy country is committed to reform and\ndevelopment. We believe that the ideal paradigm for\nreform is one that comes from within and aims to\nenhance the protection of human rights and basic\nfreedoms, as well as expanding grass-roots\nparticipation in national decision-making. Jordan is in\nthe process of launching a national agenda aimed at\nformulating a comprehensive reform methodology in\nthe political, economic and social areas over the next\n10 years. The agenda also aims to promote grass-roots\nparticipation in political decision-making on the basis\nof a solid democratic choice.\nAny real reform and development in a State is\naffected, positively or negatively, by the political and\ngeographical realities of the region. The pattern of\nreform in Jordan and the Middle East will be more\nsustainable and progressive if the political settlement\nbased on the international terms of reference of the\npeace process, the road map and the Arab peace\ninitiative attains its goal of achieving a just, lasting and\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East.\nJordan welcomes the Israeli withdrawal from the\nGaza Strip and certain settlements in the northern West\nBank. We stress that this withdrawal is not an\nalternative to the road map but must be part of it, and\nthat both the Israeli and Palestinian sides must carry\nout their respective obligations under the road map as\nwell as the recent Sharm el-Sheikh Understandings. In\nthat regard, we call upon Israel to withdraw its military\nforces from the Palestinian towns reoccupied in\nSeptember 2000 and to cease all forms of settlement\nactivity in the occupied West Bank, including East\nJerusalem.\nWe also call upon Israel to cease the construction\nof the separation wall in the occupied Palestinian\nterritories and to demolish the segments that have\nalready been built in those territories. We call on it to\nreturn the property that was seized and to pay\ncompensation for the damage incurred. The\nconstruction of the wall along its current route\nconstitutes a clear and continuous violation of the\nestablished norms of international law, including the\nright to self-determination, human rights principles and\nthe rules of international humanitarian law. That fact\nwas emphasized by the International Court of Justice in\nits landmark advisory opinion on the subject.\nWe also urge support for the Palestinian National\nAuthority in its genuine efforts to preserve the truce\nand to deal firmly with any violations of it or the\nceasefire. We call upon the international community\nand the Quartet in particular to provide all possible\n19\n\nassistance to the Authority. We emphasize here that the\nmost important outcome of the road map is the\nestablishment of an independent, viable Palestinian\nState that is geographically contiguous, with East\nJerusalem as its capital, whose borders are based on\nthose existing before 5 June 1967.\nMoreover, we must create conditions conducive\nto completing the peace process in order to achieve a\njust and comprehensive peace in the Middle East, on\nthe basis of full Israeli withdrawal from all the\noccupied Arab territories, including the Syrian Golan\nHeights, and to reach an agreed solution on the issue of\nthe Palestinian refugees, based on General Assembly\nresolution 194 (III). That should lead to the\nestablishment of normal relations between the Arab\nStates and Israel, in accordance with the Arab peace\ninitiative and the international terms of reference of the\npeace process.\nThe Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan rejects all\nforms and manifestations of terrorism, regardless of\njustifications. We stand together on the front lines, in\nword and deed, to eradicate that scourge, which has\nafflicted the entire international community and left no\none unscathed. My country also rejects all unjust and\nsuspicious attempts to tie that criminal phenomenon to\na specific religion, culture or geographical region, and\nwe stand firm against any such attempt to tie it to the\nIslamic religion. Islam, in substance and practice, is\nbased on moderation and facilitation. It was a pioneer\nin promoting the protection of human rights and\nsafeguarding the life, dignity and property of persons.\nIt rejects any infringement on these concepts, even in\ntime of war. In that context, the Amman message\nwould emphasize that this divine religion is beyond\nany suspicion linking its teachings to incitement to\nharm innocent human beings.\nJordan welcomes the adoption of the Convention\non the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism and\nsupports the efforts under way to ensure the adoption\nof the comprehensive convention to combat terrorism.\nWe further endorse the proposal made by the Kingdom\nof Saudi Arabia to establish an international centre to\ncombat terrorism, which was adopted by the Counter-\nterrorism International Conference, held in Saudi\nArabia early this year.\nJordan will continue to assist Iraq in overcoming\nits current crisis and in consolidating its safety and\nsecurity. We condemn all aspects and practices of\nterrorism and extremism in the country, which daily\nkills scores of innocent people. My country calls on all\ngroups and sectors of the Iraqi population to reach\nconsensus on the basic principles and elements\nnecessary to preserve the unity of Iraq and the\ninviolability of its territory and to ensure that it\ncontinues to belong to the Arab world. We also call for\nthe respect of religious, ethnic and sectarian diversity\nin the framework of free democratic choice, without\nprejudice to the rights of its minorities. We reiterate\nour support for the political process in Iraq and call on\nthe international community to lend its support to\ncreate the appropriate conditions for its success. We\ncall also on the United Nations to continue playing its\nimportant role.\nLet me now turn to an issue that is important to\nJordan: the drying out of the Dead Sea, and how to\npre-empt an ensuing environmental crisis through the\nimplementation of the Red Sea-Dead Sea Canal\nProject. An agreement was reached recently by the\nrelevant parties and beneficiaries of the project, namely\nJordan, Israel and the Palestinian National Authority,\non a feasibility study for the construction of the canal.\nWe look forward to continued international support for\nthis project and the implementation of all its phases, in\naccordance with the agreement mentioned earlier.\nThe future of the Middle East requires the\ncreation of strong civil societies enjoying decent lives\nand deriving their guidance from their strong belief in\ntheir heritage. We are endeavouring to achieve this\ngoal at the national level through effective reform\nprojects, whose benefits are beginning to be evident in\nJordan.\nBut stability, security and peace are essential to\ncreating a suitable environment for such societies.\nPutting an end to the Israeli occupation of Arab\nterritories and reaching a just and comprehensive\nsolution will contribute to bringing about a bright\nfuture."

        "file_text": "I join with other\ndelegations in congratulating you, Mr. President, on\nyour election to preside over the sixtieth session of the\nUnited Nations General Assembly. The Barbados\ndelegation\u2019s appreciation is also extended to the\noutgoing President, His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping,\nForeign Minister of Gabon, for the outstanding work\nhe has done in guiding the Assembly during the\nprevious session and particularly in the preparations\nfor the High-level Plenary Meeting.\nLast week, heads of State and Government, in an\nattempt to define and articulate a global consensus,\nadopted an outcome document representing the\ndetermination of the vast majority to make progress\ntowards full achievement of the goals and targets\ninspired by the Millennium Declaration, as well as a\nnumber of decisions on United Nations reform.\nBarbados, as part of the tremendous efforts made by\nmany, had hoped for bolder and more ambitious\ncommitments, particularly regarding development.\nIn all of the circumstances, we accept that the\noutcome of the High-level Plenary Meeting provides\nthe platform for coordinated international action in\nresponse to the complex and interconnected global\nchallenges confronting this and future generations.\nThe Millennium Development Goals are now\nrecognized as the world\u2019s time-bound, quantifiable\ntargets for addressing poverty in its many dimensions\nof hunger, disease, lack of access to health care and\neducation, gender inequality and environmental\ndegradation. Progress on their achievement has been\nfar from uniform across the world, or for that matter\nacross the Goals. Unless action is taken on a much\nbroader front and a much faster pace, the eminently\nlaudable words of the Declaration will serve only as\ngrim reminders of human needs neglected and of\nnumerous promises unfulfilled.\nThe Secretary-General has stated that our\ngeneration, with the combination of resources and\ntechnology at its disposal, must be the first to make the\nright of development a reality for everyone and to free\nthe entire human race from war.\nProgress towards the achievement of the\nMillennium Development Goals in Barbados is\nencouraging. Although the regional report of the\nUnited Nations Development Programme presents an\noptimistic outlook for most Caribbean countries in\nrespect of the first five Goals, the region faces severe\nchallenges and constraints to their achievement.\nForemost among them, and beyond our control, is our\nvulnerability to economic shocks and to every natural\ndisaster known to mankind \u2014 be it hurricane, volcanic\neruption, mudslide, earthquake or flood.\nEqually challenging is the fuller and more\neffective integration of Barbados in the globalized\neconomy, for which a successful outcome of the next\nDoha development round of talks on trade\nliberalization is crucial.\nPermit me to refer to an outstanding omission\nfrom the Millennium Development Goals, that of\nsexual and reproductive health and rights. Indeed, the\nexclusion was so stark that the Secretary-General\nhimself stated:\n\u201cThe Millennium Development Goals,\nparticularly the eradication of extreme poverty\n8\n\nand hunger, cannot be achieved if questions of\npopulation and reproductive health are not\nsquarely addressed. And that means stronger\nefforts to promote women\u2019s rights and greater\ninvestment in education and health, including\nreproductive health and family planning.\u201d\nWe must seize the opportunity presented by this\ncurrent review of the implementation of the\nMillennium Development Goals to mainstream sexual\nand reproductive health and rights by adopting a\nuniversal access target or indicator that can be used to\nfacilitate the monitoring of progress in this area and to\nhold Governments accountable.\nBarbados takes the position that women are\ncentral to the successful implementation of the\nMillennium Development Goals. After all, women of\nchildbearing age constitute one billion of the world\u2019s\npoorest people, and for this group sexual and\nreproductive health issues are at the fore of problems\nof ill health and loss of productivity. Women living in\npoverty are not usually aware of their sexual and\nreproductive rights and are often ignorant about the\nservices to which they have a right of access. Similarly,\npoor women, and in particular poor young women, are\nhighly susceptible to contracting HIV/AIDS despite the\nprevalence of preventive measures.\nI feel compelled to support the call for mobilizing\nnew resources for improved sexual and reproductive\nhealth services for women and for men worldwide.\nIndividuals, non-governmental organizations and\nGovernments in developing countries are already\ncontributing more than 75 per cent to current\nexpenditures in this field. It is certainly time for\ndeveloped countries to live up to the pledges they made\nat the 1994 International Conference on Population and\nDevelopment.\nCentral to the global partnership for development,\nwhich is embodied in the eighth Millennium\nDevelopment Goal, are the commitments by\ndeveloping countries to pursue sound macroeconomic\npolicies, to make the most creative use of our limited\nendowments, to respect human rights and to ensure that\nour material development takes place within the\ncontext of social justice, commitments that Barbados\nhas proudly upheld since becoming independent in\n1966.\nBy the same token, developed countries must\nfulfil their obligations made at numerous United\nNations summits and conferences on trade, debt and\nfinance, and in particular their pledge to honour the\noutstanding target of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic\nproduct for official development assistance (ODA).\nIncreases in ODA will not be sufficient to achieve the\nsustained economic growth and development that we\nall seek. It will also be necessary for the international\ncommunity to address the indebtedness of poor and\nmiddle-income developing countries; promote foreign\ndirect investment flows to a broader range of\ndeveloping countries; confront serious global\nenvironmental problems such as climate change;\ncombat HIV/AIDS; and reform multilateral trading\narrangements as well as systemic deficiencies in the\nglobal economic and financial system. These are the\nreal threats to our human security as we see it in the\nCaribbean.\nThe Doha development round, launched by the\nWorld Trade Organization in 2001, is so called\nprecisely because trade ministers deliberately sought to\nplace development at the centre of multilateral trade\nnegotiations. This decision inspired new hope in\ndeveloping countries that we would be afforded the\nopportunity to participate more effectively and\nbeneficially in the new global economic system.\nRegrettably, some of our developed country\ncounterparts seem to have reneged on their\ncommitment. We are still locked in a fierce struggle at\nthe World Trade Organization to persuade these\ncountries to rise above their narrow self-interests and\nembrace positions that would allow for the creation of\na more just global economic order.\nBarbados fears that we could squander yet\nanother opportunity genuinely to involve developing\ncountries in the multilateral trading system. We do not\nbelieve that the international community can continue\nto ignore this fact. Furthermore, we are far from\nconvinced that the High-level Plenary Meeting of last\nweek fully refocused global attention on matters of\ndevelopment and rescued from obscurity the global\ndevelopment agenda, which has unfortunately been\novertaken by a narrowly defined anti-terrorism agenda.\n\u201cIt is time to put the global development agenda,\nincluding that for the world\u2019s smallest and most\nvulnerable countries and societies, back on track\u201d.\nThose are the words of the Prime Minister of Barbados,\nThe Right Honourable Owen Arthur.\n9\n\nBarbados considers that peace and collective\nsecurity, human rights and the rule of law represent, in\naddition to development, a strong foundation on which\nthe United Nations can assist the international\ncommunity in building a stronger world. Issues of\nterrorism, responsibility to protect, disarmament and\nnon-proliferation need also to be addressed.\nTerrorism affects all countries, both large and\nsmall, and all countries have an obligation to the\ninternational community to ensure that the perpetrators\nof acts of terrorism do not find safe haven and succour\nwithin their borders. While we believe that the United\nNations should strongly and unequivocally issue a\ncondemnation of terrorism in all of its forms, care must\nbe taken to formulate an unambiguous definition that\nwould provide a basis for a comprehensive convention.\nThis would rightly place the United Nations at the very\nheart of the fight against terrorism, signalling a\nmultilateral approach to this scourge.\nClosely linked to the issue of terrorism is that of\ndisarmament and non-proliferation. Action taken by\nthe United Nations must be clear and firm, and efforts\nmust be redoubled to find compromises that would\nfacilitate progress. The Caribbean remains a major\nroute for international narco-traffickers and suffers\nfrom the destabilizing effects of the parallel illegal\ntrade in small arms, promoted by the same\ntransnational criminal elements. The absence of\nconcerted international action against small arms\ntrafficking places the peace-loving societies of the\nsmall Caribbean States at great risk. Small arms\nproliferation and the violence that accompanies it\nimpact negatively on our development, our security\nand human rights, and pose a severe threat to the\npeaceful, stable and sustainable development of\nCaribbean democracies.\nBarbados supports the call for the negotiation of a\nnew international instrument on the marking and\ntracing of weapons. This is an urgent priority which\nwill provide the international community with an\neffective means of monitoring the movement and\nproliferation of small arms and taking comprehensive\ninterdiction and enforcement action against illegal\ntraders.\nBarbados remains resolute in its rejection of the\ncontinued use of the Caribbean Sea for the trans-\nshipment of nuclear and radioactive waste. This high-\nrisk practice poses grave danger to our region in the\nevent that there is an accident, a natural disaster or a\nterrorist attack.\nThe Secretary-General has emphasized that if the\nUnited Nations is to be a useful instrument for its\nmembers and is to successfully address the challenges\nfacing humanity, then it must be fully adapted to the\nneeds and circumstances not only of today, but\ntomorrow as well. Barbados shares this view. Reform\nshould not be seen as an end in and of itself, but as a\nmeans towards achieving the goals we have set\nourselves in 2000 in the Millennium Declaration, to\nmake the United Nations a more effective instrument\nfor pursuing the priorities of the world\u2019s peoples.\nReform should also seek to enhance the role of the\nUnited Nations in global affairs to create the conditions\nfor more democratic and transparent decision-making\nand to provide a forum for the full and equal\nparticipation of small States.\nBarbados believes that the main organs of the\nUnited Nations should be strengthened. This will\nrequire the revitalization of the General Assembly to\nmake it the chief deliberative and policy-making body\nof the Organization, as envisaged by the United\nNations Charter. It will further require the reform of\nthe Security Council to make it more representative of\ncurrent global geopolitical realities. Small States\nshould be represented continuously in the membership\nof the Council, and any arrangements for the selection\nof the non-permanent members of a reformed Council\nshould be so formulated.\nWe are convinced that the Economic and Social\nCouncil should play a larger role in policy-making on\ninternational economic and social matters and the\npromotion of improved global economic governance. A\nrestructured Economic and Social Council should find\nits voice again as a vibrant forum for economic policy\ndialogue, for promoting increased guidance and\ncoordination to the United Nations funds, programmes\nand agencies and for monitoring the implementation\nand follow-up of the Millennium Development Goals\nand other major elements of the global development\norder.\nIf the United Nations is to undertake fully and\neffectively the demanding responsibilities with which\nit has been charged, then it must be provided with the\nrequired level of resources, and the Secretary-General\nmust be given appropriate managerial authority. The\nBarbados delegation intends to participate actively in\n10\n\nthe delineation of these issues during this sixtieth\nsession.\nAs a small State, Barbados believes that a strong\nmultilateral system, with the United Nations at its core,\nis our greatest protection from the unilateral pursuits of\nthe powerful. We are unwavering in our commitment to\nthe precepts of multilateralism and to the belief that no\nother international institution is better suited or\nequipped to meet the diverse demands for global peace,\nsecurity and development than this Organization. As a\nmember of the United Nations, Barbados must be\nassured that its voice will continue to be heard\nregardless of size or economic power. This is a struggle\nfrom which we are not at liberty to abstain."

        "file_text": "I, too, congratulate you,\nSir, on your election as President of the General\nAssembly at its sixtieth session.\nSixty years ago, the United Nations rose out of\nthe ashes of the Second World War. The creation of our\nOrganization was the fulfilment of people's hopes for a\nbetter and safer future. Norway was honoured to\nprovide the United Nations with its first Secretary-\nGeneral, Trygve Lie.\nLast week, we saw agreement on a summit\noutcome document (resolution 60/1). The document\nfalls short of our expectations. Still, it provides\nimportant direction on how to improve and strengthen\nthe role of the United Nations in building peace and\nsecurity and promoting human rights and development.\nIn some areas, Member States made considerable\nprogress; in others, better results should have been\nachieved. In particular, I had hoped for \u00f3 and worked\nfor \u00f3 a substantial text on nuclear disarmament and\nnon-proliferation. The proliferation of weapons of\nmass destruction represents a fundamental threat.\nThere is a growing risk of proliferation and of\ncatastrophic terrorism. At the same time, we see a\nreluctance on the part of some to accept that all States\nmust advance disarmament and non-proliferation.\nDuring the past week, I have repeatedly heard in\nthe General Assembly that we are willing to solve\ncommon problems. Yet it has not been possible to\nreach any consensus on how to address these truly\nglobal threats. I can assure members that Norway will\ntake up the challenge set out by the Secretary-General\nand will continue to seek consensus and concrete\nresults. We will do that together with Australia, Chile,\nIndonesia, Romania, South Africa and the United\nKingdom and with all those countries that supported\nour efforts.\nFurther progress is also urgently needed to\nprevent the proliferation of small arms and light\nweapons. Norway welcomes the outcome document's\ncall for implementation of the United Nations\nProgramme of Action on Small Arms and Light\nWeapons. We would have liked, however, to see a\nstronger commitment to controlling international\ntransfers of such weapons through legally binding\nagreements.\nThe international community needs to cooperate\nin order to meet global challenges. We are faced with\nan array of new threats and challenges: I just spoke of\nthe risk of proliferation; terrorism is another. The\nspread of new and infectious diseases is also a\nfrightening prospect. Multilateralism is the answer. We\nmust face all these threats together and reach\nagreement on how to meet them. The global arena must\nbe continually reformed and adapted to make sure that\nwe have a United Nations that is in the best possible\nshape. We cannot blame others if it does not function.\nAs the Secretary-General said in his statement to the\n11\n\nsummit, \\\"Whatever our differences, in our\ninterdependent world, we stand or fall together\\\"\n(A/60/PV.2, p. 5).\nOur greatest responsibility is to ensure that the\nstrong protect the weak. Our greatest failure is when\nwe, the Members of the United Nations, are unable to\nprevent atrocities against innocent civilians. For the\nfirst time, Member States have endorsed the principle\nof the \u00ecresponsibility to protect\u00ee. That creates an\nimportant new basis for collective action in cases of\ngenocide, crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing\nand war crimes. We now have the tools to prevent\nanother Srebrenica or another Rwanda.\nA greater consensus on collective action and early\ndiplomatic response are needed to prevent violent\nconflicts. Addressing the needs of countries under\nstress is a demanding challenge for the United Nations;\nso is assisting countries suffering from conflict and in\ntransition from war to peace. The peace process that\nNorway is facilitating between the Government of Sri\nLanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam has\nbenefited from United Nations support. The\nOrganization's role in providing humanitarian and\ndevelopment assistance to all areas of Sri Lanka has\nbeen indispensable.\nI therefore welcome the initiative to establish a\nPeacebuilding Commission to marshal resources, give\nadvice and propose comprehensive strategies for\npeacebuilding and post-conflict recovery. The situation\nin the Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nand other conflict-afflicted areas clearly demonstrates\nthe need for a Peacebuilding Commission. As long as\nthe Security Council remains actively seized of a\nmatter, the Peacebuilding Commission should provide\nadvice to the Council. Norway will contribute $15\nmillion to the Peacebuilding Fund. The role and the\nneeds of women should be duly reflected in the\nestablishment of a Peacebuilding Commission. The\nCommission should contribute to the follow-up of the\nbinding commitments set out in Security Council\nresolution 1325 (2000) on women and peace and\nsecurity.\nWhile supporting the establishment of the\nPeacebuilding Commission, Norway places great\nemphasis on the need to maintain and strengthen the\nactivity of the Secretary-General to take initiatives\nthrough his good offices.\nAs we convene here in New York, an estimated\n10 million people are facing severe food shortages in\nSouthern Africa. According to the Secretary-General,\nthe chronic state of emergency in the region is caused\nby a combination of HIV/AIDS, food insecurity and a\nweakened capacity for governance. During recent\nmonths, there has also been a severe drought in Niger\nand in parts of the Sahel region.\nThe response capacity of the United Nations is in\nneed of reform. That means improving the speed,\nequity and predictability of humanitarian response. An\nupgraded and expanded Central Emergency Response\nFund is an important step in the right direction; so is\nimproved coordination at the field level, including the\nHumanitarian Coordinator system. The General\nAssembly must now take the decisions necessary for\nthe new Fund to become operational as early as\npossible. Norway has pledged $15 million to the Fund,\nand we stand ready to assist in putting in place the\nnecessary organizational framework.\nThe United Nations is making a significant\ncontribution to development. The universal\nendorsement of the Millennium Development Goals\nand the renewed commitment to achieving them by\n2015 are key results of the summit; so are the\nstrengthened commitments concerning increased\nofficial development assistance (ODA) and debt relief\nmade during the preparations leading up to the summit,\nparticularly by the European Union and the Group of\nEight. The world community must now make sure that\npromises are followed by payments and that the focus\non Africa remains strong. Norway will do its part by\nincreasing its ODA contributions to Africa for 2006 by\n$150 million.\nInternational trade is a prerequisite for economic\ngrowth and development. Norway is committed to the\nfurther development of a rule-based and fair\nmultilateral trading system. The ongoing World Trade\nOrganization negotiations are approaching a crucial\ncrossroads in Hong Kong in December. We must\nredouble our efforts to achieve the fullest possible\nrealization of the Doha work programme in order to\nsuccessfully complete the Doha development round in\n2006. Particular attention must be paid to the needs and\ninterests of developing countries.\nNo cause can justify acts of terror. The United\nNations should have a central role in leading and\ncoordinating the international fight against terrorism. A\n12\n\nbroad-based strategy is necessary to counter this threat,\nas recommended by the Secretary-General. The fight\nagainst terrorism must be based on the rule of law. The\nrole of the United Nations is essential, because it can\nprovide the legal instruments and frameworks we need.\nI encourage all States to sign, ratify and implement the\n13 United Nations conventions related to terrorism.\nNorway strongly supports the efforts to conclude a\ncomprehensive United Nations convention on\ninternational terrorism.\nTerrorism must be fought by a broad range of\nmeans, including military and legal means. Other\nthreats to peace and stability must also be addressed,\nsuch as poverty and unemployment, lack of social and\npolitical rights, absence of the rule of law and lack of\naccess to education. The United Nations has a vital role\nto play in all those areas. It has more experience on\nthose issues than any other organization and possesses\nthe most suitable tools to address them.\nDefending human rights is a principal universal\nobjective. When human rights defenders are silenced,\nviolations of human rights go unnoticed, unexposed\nand unopposed. The issue of individuals and groups\nsubject to human rights violations should be put firmly\non the agenda of all countries. I call for members'\ncontinued support for a draft resolution to that end.\nIt is vital that we assign human rights their\nrightful place as a fundamental pillar of the United\nNations. Our goal in the coming months must be to\nbridge the gap between expectations for credible\nUnited Nations action in the field of human rights and\nthe capacities of the Organization. We must take the\nfollowing steps.\nWe must create a new standing human rights\nbody as soon as possible, preferably as a principal\norgan of the United Nations. It must focus on both\nimplementation and capacity-building. It must also be\nable to deal swiftly with human rights violations\nworldwide in a credible and effective manner. The\nstrengths and best practices of the Commission on\nHuman Rights must be retained and its weaknesses left\nbehind.\nAnd we must strengthen the Office of the United\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights by\nrespecting, in the Fifth Committee, the decision of the\nsummit to double the regular budget resources of the\nOffice.\nThere is a need for stronger executive leadership\nand thorough administrative reform of the\nOrganization. Corruption, mismanagement and sexual\nexploitation and abuse are examples of conduct that\ncannot be tolerated.\nWe have decided to make the Office of Internal\nOversight Services more independent. The Office's\ncapacity to carry out audits and investigations will be\nsignificantly strengthened. It is necessary to further\nstrengthen the accountability of the Secretariat and\nimprove management performance, as well as reinforce\nethical conduct. Responsibility for many of the\nweaknesses in the United Nations system, however,\nlies with the Member States themselves.\nWe need a more relevant General Assembly as\nthe chief policymaking body of the Organization. That\nwill require strategic leadership on the part of Member\nStates. The Secretary-General, as the chief\nadministrative officer, must be granted sufficient\nauthority and flexibility to carry out his duties. In order\nto strengthen the Organization's capacity to ensure that\nmandates are fulfilled, we need to provide the\nnecessary resources. In order to maintain an efficient\norganization, we need to review existing mandates and\nrevoke those that are no longer relevant.\nThe management reform process provides a\ngolden opportunity to increase the recruitment of\nwomen at all levels of the United Nations. Good\ngovernance in a modern organization requires\ncontributions from women on an equal footing with\nmen.\nSome have called the results of the summit just\nanother step along the way. In my view, many\nimportant steps were taken. Now it is up to the General\nAssembly to follow up. I promise that Norway will do\nits part. We will continue to work for reforms. The\nUnited Nations system must become more effective in\nsecuring global peace and security, combating poverty\nand promoting human rights. In the end, it is we, the\nMember States, who are responsible for making that a\nreality."

        "file_text": "The outcome document \nadopted at the High-level Plenary Meeting (resolution \n60/1) serves as a map by which we navigate in seeking \nto improve the lives of the many peoples of the world; \nit may be imperfect, but it is our task as leaders to \nprovide a vision of a better world and to lead our \npeoples towards the achievement of that vision. The \noutcome document spells out this vision, and we \nshould use it much as one uses a map when navigating \nthe destiny of our respective nations.  \n In this respect, Nauru looks to the United Nations \nas the global leader in reaching this vision of a better \nworld: a world in which human rights are collectively \nrecognized and defended, terrorism in any form is \neliminated, peace and security is promoted and \nmaintained, and poverty is eradicated. We therefore \napplaud the effort to strengthen the work of the United \nNations through management reform. This should \nimprove the delivery of the global services that this \nOrganization is expected to provide. \n Equally important is the need to reform the \nSecurity Council, to recognize that international \ndevelopments since the establishment of that body \nmany decades ago now demand a more democratic \nrepresentation of the global family in an expanded \nSecurity Council. The earlier these reforms are \nimplemented, the earlier the work of the United \n  \n \n4 05-51226 \n \nNations can be further improved, with commensurate \nbenefit to the people whose interests we all serve. \n Nauru is in the unenviable position of having lost \nits earlier status as a donor country, with much of its \nwealth lost through mismanagement and, in particular, \ncorrupt leadership. We therefore speak with some \nexperience when we note with encouragement the \ndecision by the United Nations to implement \nmanagement and structural reforms to improve, \namongst other things, transparency and accountability \nfor the greater good of Member countries and the \npeoples we represent.  \n Nauru itself is undertaking significant economic \nand political reforms as it recommences the nation-\nbuilding process. These include the design of a national \ndevelopment strategy, the public consultative phase of \nwhich has just been concluded; it will be presented to \nthe donor community in November this year. We hope \nthat the international community can participate, not by \ndriving the development agenda for the people of \nNauru, but by accepting the vision of our people as that \nto be implemented by Nauru with the support of its \ndevelopment partners. The development agenda for \ndeveloping countries, particularly those with fragile \nand vulnerable economies, must be designed by those \non whose lives that agenda will have an impact and not \nby external parties that have a different agenda. \n We believe that the thorough consultative process \nwithin which the national development strategy is \nbeing designed is in itself an exercise in democracy. \nThe views expressed by government and non-\ngovernment agencies and by community, faith and \nother leaders, is testament to the strength of democracy \nin Nauru. To turn a blind eye to this process by driving \na development agenda not envisioned by the people is \nnot only dangerous to the development needs of the \npeople it should serve, but a threat to democracy itself. \nWe hope that the United Nations itself will have a \nleading role in assisting the rebuilding of Nauru and in \nachieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. \nWe reiterate our call for a United Nations presence in \nNauru for this purpose. \n Nauru also calls upon the developed world to \nmatch its rhetoric with action when it comes to meeting \nthe development needs of the developing world, \nthrough development financing and/or debt relief. It is \nsimply not good enough to be targeting the \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals by \n2015 without making available the resources to fund \nthat effort. The developed world has an obligation to \nshare its resources with the developing world by \nensuring it meets its own target of official development \nassistance expenditure of 0.7 per cent of gross \ndomestic product, and to achieve it promptly, if the \ndeveloping world is to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals within 10 years. \n The decision not to consider the question of the \npeople of Taiwan is a gross dereliction of duty by this \nAssembly. There are 23 million people on Taiwan who \nare being denied the right to be recognized and \nprotected by this Organization. The United Nations has \na role in assisting and facilitating constructive dialogue \nto ensure a future of peace for the people of Taiwan \nand the rest of that region. Peace and security in the \nTaiwan Strait is peace and security in the Asia-Pacific \nregion. I am very hopeful that Member States will \nrecognize and accept the appeal by the good people of \nTaiwan at the sixtieth session of the General Assembly.  \n God bless the Republic of Nauru and God bless \nthe United Nations and the peoples of the world. We \nshall proceed with God\u2019s will first. "

This requires that we\nintensify our consultations and coordination on the\nquestion of reforming the United Nations and\ndeveloping its institutions, in accordance with a\ncomprehensive vision based on enhancing solidarity,\nmutual assistance and partnership among peoples so\nthat our Organization will be able to deal with current\ninternational issues efficiently.\nMany of those issues still constitute a source of\nconcern for the international community, because of\ntheir impact on security and stability, and foremost\namong them is the Middle East problem.\nIn keeping with its commitment, and that of its\nPresident, His Excellency President Zine El Abidine\nBen Ali, to peace as a strategic choice, Tunisia has\ncontributed to all efforts and initiatives aimed at\nreaching a just, comprehensive and durable settlement\nto the Palestinian question. We reiterate our call to all\nparties, more particularly to the Quartet, to take\nadvantage of recent positive developments in the\nregion in order to resume peace negotiations, thus\nallowing the Palestinian people to recover their\nlegitimate national rights and establish their own\n20\n\nindependent State on their land as well as bringing\nsecurity, stability and prosperity to all peoples of the\nregion.\nWe feel that achieving just, comprehensive and\ndurable peace in the Middle East requires the recovery\nby sisterly Syria and Lebanon of all their occupied\nterritories.\nWe also express the hope that sisterly Iraq will\ncomplete its political process and strengthen its\nconstitutional institutions in accordance with the\naspirations of the Iraqi people, within a context of\nsecurity, stability and national unity.\nTunisia welcomes the important steps taken by the\nSudanese Government towards national reconciliation,\nin keeping with the aspirations of the Sudanese people\nto the consolidation of security and stability in that\ncountry.\nTunisia is sparing no effort, along with the other\nsisterly Arab countries, in laying the foundations for a\nnew phase of joint Arab action, promoting cooperation\nin all the political, economic and cultural fields, and\nreinforcing the process of development and\nmodernization, in line with the proposals made and\ndecisions taken by the Arab Summit in May 2004,\nwhich Tunisia had the honour to host.\nWe are also keen on consolidating the bonds of\nfraternity and cooperation with all fellow Arab\nMaghreb countries and completing the process of\nbuilding the Arab Maghreb Union, thus meeting the\naspirations of the peoples of the Maghreb to\ndevelopment and complementarity.\nAlthough it has witnessed a number of positive\ndevelopments, the African continent continues to suffer\nfrom the persistence of tensions and conflicts in many\nof its regions. Additional efforts are required in order\nto take further steps towards their settlement. Bringing\nto completion the establishment of the basic structures\nof the African Union would enable African countries to\nmove ahead in promoting cooperation and reinforcing\nthe foundations of security and stability in the\ncontinent. This, in turn, will encourage development in\nAfrican countries and facilitate their integration into\nthe world economy.\nAt the Euro-Mediterranean level, Tunisia is\nentering a new phase in its relations with the European\nUnion, a phase marked by a determination to further\npromote, develop and enlarge the scope of partnership\nwith that Union on the basis of cooperation, solidarity,\ncomplementarity and mutual respect, in line with the\npurposes and principles adopted at the Barcelona\nConference as we prepare to celebrate the tenth\nanniversary of its Declaration.\nTunisia is also endeavouring to strengthen ties of\nfriendship and enlarge the scope of cooperation with\nthe countries of the American and Asian continents in\norder to establish a solidarity-based partnership that\nwill lay the foundations for a new stage in these\nrelations. That would serve the interests of all parties,\nbring their peoples closer to one another and contribute\nto consolidating the foundations of stability, peace and\nprosperity in the world.\nThe intensification of violence and terrorism,\ndespite the joint efforts undertaken for many years to\nconfront that grave scourge, deepens our conviction\nthat the most effective way to deal with terrorism is by\nunifying our methods for tackling it, thereby\nstrengthening the capacity of the international\ncommunity to confront terrorism and eradicate its root\ncauses.\nIn that regard, His Excellency President Zine El\nAbidine Ben Ali proposed the convening of an\ninternational conference under United Nations auspices\naimed at establishing a binding international code of\nconduct on combating terrorism.\nProceeding from its steadfast adherence to the\nprinciples of solidarity and dialogue among peoples\nand its continuing endeavours to strengthen stability\nand development in the world, Tunisia will take an\nactive role in achieving the objectives spelled out in\nthe Millennium Declaration and in finding appropriate\nsolutions to the international issues we face today.\nIn that regard, we would mention the General\nAssembly\u2019s adoption of the Tunisian proposal for the\nestablishment of a World Solidarity Fund. The\ninternational community must now provide the\nnecessary financial resources so that the Fund can\nlaunch its activities and achieve its noble objectives of\nreducing poverty and famine, particularly in some\nregions of Africa.\nTunisia calls for the strengthening of world\nsolidarity, the benefits of which were most recently\nmanifested in the international efforts to alleviate the\nenormous damage caused by both the tsunami disaster\nand hurricane Katrina.\n21\n\nAs we prepare to host the second phase of the\nWorld Summit on the Information Society \u2014 held in\nresponse to a Tunisian proposal dating back to 1998 \u2014\nTunisia is looking forward to the high-level\ninternational participation of Governments, the private\nsector and civil society in that important global event\nin order to give it the best possible chance of success.\nA successful outcome will help to establish a\nsolidarity-based digital culture that allows developing\ncountries to benefit from the vast prospects offered by\ninformation and communication technologies and to\nmake the best use of them in their development plans.\nFurthermore, Tunisia wishes to express its thanks\nand appreciation to all Member States and to the\ninternational and regional organizations that have\ncontributed to the success of its international initiative\nto proclaim 2005 the International Year of Sport and\nPhysical Education in the service of peace, security and\ndevelopment in the world.\nTunisia will continue to make an effective\ncontribution to strengthening the culture of dialogue\nand the values of tolerance and cultural communication\namong civilizations and among all the world\u2019s\ncountries and peoples, and to work against fanaticism\nand isolationism. We once again underline the\nimportance of those values in spreading security, peace\nand stability throughout the world, thus freeing\nhumanity to direct its efforts towards comprehensive\nand sustainable development in a spirit of optimism\nand confidence in a better future."

        "file_text": "Allow me to begin by\nextending my delegation\u2019s warmest congratulations to\nthe President upon his assumption of the office of the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixtieth\nsession. We have full confidence in his ability to guide\nour deliberations to a successful conclusion. I also pay\ntribute to his predecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, for skilfully\nconducting the work of the fifty-ninth session of the\nGeneral Assembly and for his efforts in preparing the\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting, held from 14 to\n16 September 2005.\nIt is appropriate that the theme for the sixtieth\nsession of the General Assembly is \u201cFor a stronger and\nmore effective United Nations: the follow-up and\nimplementation of the High-level Plenary Meeting in\nSeptember 2005\u201d.\nIndeed, this session has the responsibility to\nimplement the decisions of the High-level Plenary\nMeeting. Our leaders have clearly pronounced that the\ngoals and objectives of the Millennium Summit and\nother United Nations conferences and summits\nrepresent the minimum required to deal with the issues\nand challenges of our time. Their message is that 2005\nshould be a year for concrete action to deliver on those\ngoals and objectives. We must, therefore, summon\npolitical will and assume moral responsibility to work\ntruly for the benefit of our peoples on whose behalf we\ngather at the United Nations year after year.\nIn the report \u201cIn larger freedom: towards\ndevelopment, security and human rights for all\u201d\n(A/59/2005), the Secretary-General argues that the\nprinciples and purposes of the United Nations\ncontained in the Charter remain as valid and relevant\ntoday as they were in 1945 and that what is now\nrequired is for practice and organization to move with\nthe times. My delegation fully agrees with that view.\nOur work must always be guided by the Charter, but\nour approach must adapt to changing circumstances\nand challenges. In doing so, we must move beyond\nnarrow national perspectives and interests and treat all\nissues in a balanced and holistic manner.\nAs I stated at the High-level Plenary Meeting last\nweek, my delegation supports all initiatives to\nstrengthen the United Nations and its institutions. Of\n17\n\nsignificant interest to my delegation is the\nstrengthening of this Assembly, which is the only\nuniversal body in the United Nations. There is a clear\nconsensus within the membership on the need for\nurgent and wide-ranging reform of the United Nations,\nalthough differences remain on the nature and extent of\nreform. The 2005 World Summit Outcome has\nentrusted the sixtieth session with implementation of\ncertain reform decisions and at the same time with\ncarrying out further discussions and negotiations in\nareas where consensus has not been reached. We must\ncontinue with our efforts to find consensus in those\nareas.\nAmong the issues that are unresolved is the\nreform of the Security Council. We have debated this\nissue for well over a decade, but have not yet reached a\ndecision. My country continues to call for early action\nto enlarge the permanent and non-permanent\nmembership of the Security Council and to improve its\nworking methods. In this context, we reiterate our\nsupport to include Brazil, Germany, India and Japan as\npermanent members. Those countries have\ndemonstrated their capacity and will to contribute to\nworld peace and security. We also believe that Africa\nshould be adequately represented by permanent\nmembership on the Council.\nDevelopment is the most immediate and pressing\nissue for the vast majority of Member States. No other\nissue can be as central as development when millions\nlive in deprivation and despair; and global peace and\nsecurity cannot be truly achieved without advancing\ndevelopment. In fact, partnership in other areas cannot\nbe sustained without genuine international cooperation\nin development.\nThe shortfalls in our commitments to the\nMillennium Summit and other major United Nations\nconferences and summits are all too clear. More needs\nto be done urgently to address the hurdles of\ndevelopment, which range from finance to debt, trade,\nglobal governance and systemic issues, the\nenvironment and science and technology.\nAdequate and predictable sources of financing are\ncrucial for the success of development efforts. We\ntherefore welcome ideas for innovative sources of\nfunding and calls for increased official development\nassistance (ODA). In this regard, my delegation would\nlike to commend those countries that have achieved or\nexceeded the ODA target of 0.7 per cent of gross\nnational product (GNP). We welcome the timetable\nestablished by some countries to achieve the ODA\ntarget by 2015 and urge others to do so expeditiously.\nWe also urge that 0.2 per cent of GNP be allocated to\nleast developed countries to enable them to achieve the\ngoals and objectives of the Brussels Programme of\nAction and the Millennium Development Goals\n(MDGs). The recent decision of the Group of 8 (G-8)\nto cancel the external debt of 18 highly indebted poor\ncountries, including 13 least developed countries, is a\nwelcome move. My delegation is hopeful that the same\nconsideration will be given to all least developed\ncountries.\nAs a small, least developed and landlocked\ncountry, Bhutan sees official development assistance as\nits primary source of financing for development. In this\nregard, my delegation would like to place on record its\ndeep appreciation of the bilateral and multilateral\npartners that are actively supporting our development\nefforts. Despite a significant increase in its own\nresources, my country will have to rely on ODA for\nsome time in its efforts to realize the MDGs as well as\nfor overall development.\nThe continued support of the international\ncommunity for our development efforts is crucial at the\npresent juncture. Decades of gradual but deliberate\nchange in the system of governance of the country,\nspearheaded by His Majesty King Jigme Singye\nWangchuck, are entering a critical phase. A draft\nconstitution for the country is currently under\ndiscussion. Its adoption in the near future will\ntransform the country into a parliamentary democracy.\nFor this system of governance to succeed, it is\nimperative that the country be able to maintain the\ncurrent level of progress in the social, economic and\nother fields.\nMy country attaches great importance to the\nconservation and protection of the environment, as\nhuman life is fundamentally dependent on natural\nsystems and resources. There cannot be sustainable\ndevelopment without environmental sustainability. We\nmust commit ourselves to meeting the goals of, inter\nalia, the World Summit on Sustainable Development,\nAgenda 21 and the Kyoto Protocol. In Bhutan, we have\nmade serious efforts to integrate the principles and\npractices of environmental sustainability into our\ndevelopment policies and programmes. As a result of\nour conservation efforts, Bhutan has successfully\nmaintained 72.5 per cent of its land area under forest\n18\n\ncover. Our modest achievement in this area was duly\nrecognized by the United Nations Environment\nProgramme (UNEP) in April 2005 when it awarded to\nHis Majesty the King and the people of Bhutan a\nUNEP Champions of the Earth 2005 award.\nMy country fully supports the establishment of a\nworldwide early warning system for all natural\nhazards. Situated in a very fragile mountain ecosystem,\nBhutan is prone to glacial floods and other natural\ndisasters, including earthquakes. The solidarity that the\ninternational community demonstrated last year when\nmany countries in the Indian Ocean rim were\ndevastated by the tsunami was exemplary and is worth\nreplicating in other areas.\nTerrorism is a pernicious threat to peace and\nsecurity. It cannot be justified under any\ncircumstances. It is imperative for the international\ncommunity to act resolutely to root out this menace.\nWe condemn terrorism in all its forms and\nmanifestations. Bhutan supports all efforts to conclude\na comprehensive convention on international terrorism\nand other initiatives. Small and poor developing\ncountries are particularly vulnerable and are in need of\ninternational support to fight terrorism. They are also\nvulnerable to transnational crime and need assistance\nto deal with it.\nInternational migration is on the increase today.\nMigration offers opportunities and at the same time\npresents serious challenges to both source and recipient\ncountries. Associated with it is the problem of illegal\nimmigration, which presents serious challenges,\nparticularly to small countries such as my own. It is\ntherefore important for a high-level dialogue on\ninternational migration and development to be held by\nthe General Assembly in 2006 to address all issues\nassociated with migration.\nMy delegation supports the Secretary-General\u2019s\ncontinuing efforts to organize annual multilateral treaty\nevents in conjunction with General Assembly sessions.\nIn this context, we are pleased to report to the\nAssembly that Bhutan acceded to the following treaties\nlast week: the United Nations Convention against\nCorruption; the Optional Protocol to the Convention on\nthe Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children\nin Armed Conflict; and the Optional Protocol to the\nConvention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of\nChildren, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography.\nBhutan, as a responsible Member State, fully\nupholds all relevant international treaties and\nconventions. However, our desire to accede to them is\nconsistently constrained by lack of capacity to deal\nwith the range of issues they contain and by the\ndifficulties of meeting reporting and other obligations.\nThis is a serious hurdle faced by many small countries,\nespecially least developed countries. There is a genuine\nneed to look at ways to simplify reporting and other\nobligations and to provide technical and financial\nassistance to countries in need.\nWe must heed the call of the Secretary-General\nwho has said,\n\u201cOur action must be as urgent as the need,\nand on the same scale. ... Only by acting\ndecisively now can we both confront the pressing\nsecurity challenges and win a decisive victory in\nthe global battle against poverty by 2015\u201d.\n(A/59/2005, para. 23)\nWe believe that the time to act is now. We must not let\nthe opportunity slip. I wish the General Assembly\ncontinued success at this session."

        "file_text": "Let\nme first convey, on behalf of the people and the\nGovernment of Albania, the most profound sentiments\nof sympathy, friendship and solidarity to the people of\nthe United States and to President Bush with respect to\nthe human suffering and the material damage caused by\nHurricane Katrina.\nI would like to wish Mr. Jan Eliasson every\nsuccess in carrying out his important mission. I take\nthis opportunity to assure him of the full cooperation of\nmy country in accomplishing the undertakings ahead of\nus. Let me also join others in thanking Mr. Jean Ping\nfor the dedication he demonstrated as president of the\nGeneral Assembly at its previous session and for the\nefforts he invested in the revitalization of our\nOrganization.\nAlbania aligns itself fully with the statement\nmade at the 9th plenary meeting by Mr. Jack Straw,\nForeign Secretary of the United Kingdom, on behalf of\nthe European Union.\nI am privileged to address the Assembly on\nbehalf of the new Albanian Government, which took\noffice following recent parliamentary elections. I will\nset out some of my country\u2019s positions on issues of\nconcern to us all and outline my Government\u2019s\nstrategic priorities in the field of foreign policy.\nThe fact that, just a few days ago, a large number\nof heads of State and Government gathered at the\nUnited Nations to assess the progress made in the\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals\nand to debate the reform of the Organization should be\ntaken as a reaffirmation that multilateralism is a\ndriving force in global policy. That also serves once\nagain to confirm that we are living in a very complex\nand multidimensional environment that clearly requires\ncomprehensive, global and coherent reactions.\nThe need for enhanced regional and global\ncooperation has never been more pronounced. Albania\ntherefore supports the outcome of the High-level\nPlenary Meeting, which reaffirms our faith in the\nOrganization, the importance of the core values and\nprinciples of international cooperation, the global\npartnership for development, concerted actions to\nstrengthen collective security and peace, the fight\nagainst terrorism, promoting human rights and the rule\nof law and the strengthening of the United Nations, in\nparticular its comprehensive reform. Albania believes\nthat, through concrete and speedy action, the sixtieth\nsession of the General Assembly will constitute an\nimportant and meaningful step towards the\nimplementation of all the commitments to which I have\nreferred.\nAlbania believes that the United Nations should\nbe further strengthened in order to continue to play a\ndecisive role in the efforts of the international\ncommunity to create a safer, more stable and\nprosperous world. We would like to reiterate our\nappreciation for the efforts of the Secretary-General\nwith regard to reforming the United Nations. Albania\nshares his view that the United Nations needs to have\nthe legitimacy and flexibility to adapt itself to the\ncircumstances of a changing world. The Security\nCouncil clearly has enormous responsibility in that\nregard. My country fully supports the reform of the\nSecurity Council. It should be noted, however, that we\nview Council reform from the standpoint of improving\nits working methods and transparency and of adjusting\nand improving the decision-making system. We firmly\nbelieve that Members acting together have the\nnecessary power and capacity to achieve very broad\nconsensus on Council reform.\n34\n\nThe roles of the General Assembly, the Economic\nand Social Council and the Secretary-General must not\nbe underestimated. Their potential has not yet been\nfully explored. The success of the reform effort can be\nassured if it is coherent and aimed at the Organization\nas a whole. Albania is encouraged by the outcome\ndocument of the High-level Plenary Meeting with\nregard to the strengthening of the United Nations. We\nreaffirm our willingness to work with all delegations to\nachieve the broadest consensus possible on the most\nimportant reform issues.\nAlbania believes that the Peacebuilding\nCommission will be an essential and efficient tool for\ndeveloping more coherent, relevant and better funded\nstrategies and for giving timely political attention to a\ncountry making the transition from conflict to\nsustainable development. In that connection, the\nreform of the United Nations will better enable the\nOrganization to improve the work of the international\ncommunity and assist countries in the post-conflict\nphase.\nWe believe that the exchange of views on the\nestablishment of the Human Rights Council will be\ncompleted soon. An action-oriented Council with a\ncredible membership will improve the quality of\nUnited Nations efforts in the area of human rights.\nMoreover, we fully support the strengthening of the\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights,\nincluding increasing its budget.\nAlbania believes that the initiative to establish a\nDemocracy Fund is an essential component of reform.\nMy country will make every effort to support the Fund.\nLike other friendly countries, we consider it an\neffective mechanism to support new democracies,\nstrengthen civil society and establish institutions\nsupporting the rule of law.\nThe numerous tragic events of recent years have\nconfirmed that terrorism, which has taken thousands of\ninnocent lives, is the most urgent threat facing the\nworld today. My country will remain committed to\nfighting this evil. We support Security Council\nresolution 1624 (2005), which was adopted during the\nhigh-level summit. We also join the solemn appeal to\nfinalize the comprehensive convention against\nterrorism during the course of this session of the\nGeneral Assembly. We believe that acts of terrorism\ncarried out with weapons of mass destruction can have\nunprecedented consequences for humankind.\nArms control is a key element of my country\u2019s\nsecurity policy. In that regard, I should like to point out\nour ongoing support for the further strengthening of\ncrucial international disarmament and non-proliferation\ninstruments. Albania is therefore fully committed to\ncooperate on disarmament and non-proliferation issues\nboth in its own region and beyond. To that end, we\nhave put in place robust measures at the national level\nto prevent the illicit trafficking in arms on our territory.\nIn addition, with regard to implementing commitments\non the control of small arms and light weapons, we\nhave amended our national legislation in order to bring\nit closer to that of the European Union in areas such as\nlicensing, strengthening import and export regimes and\nenforcement. Part of the Government\u2019s programme in\nthis area has included the destruction of some 200,000\nsmall arms and light weapons that had been in the\nhands of civilians. Moreover, in cooperation with\nforeign donors, the Government has drafted a\nprogramme to destroy all chemical weapons materials\non our territory, thereby contributing to the\nstrengthening of security in the region and beyond.\nAlbania is continuing to demonstrate the growing\nmaturity of its democracy. The year 2005 is an election\nyear in Albania. Last July\u2019s parliamentary elections\nand orderly transfer of power were tangible\ndevelopments that had a positive impact on the\ncountry\u2019s future political, economic and social\ndevelopment.\nAlbania believes that good governance is a key\nelement in improving the lives of all its citizens. Good\ngovernance is also an essential precondition to\nguaranteeing sustainable economic growth and\neradicating poverty. In that regard, we will work\ntirelessly to strengthen the rule of law, promote\ntransparency in the decision-making process and\nincrease the Government\u2019s sense of responsibility to\nserve all citizens.\nWith regard to the economy, the new Albanian\nGovernment\u2019s priorities in the coming years will be to\nfight corruption and the factors that encourage it,\npromote free competition and relentlessly combat\nmonopolies.\nA set of measures is being contemplated to\nimprove the national education system. Among those\nmeasures is the opening of universities to all who want\nto pursue higher education.\n35\n\nIn addition, for the first time in its history, a\nwoman heads Albania\u2019s National Assembly. This is a\nstrong indication of Albania\u2019s serious commitment to\ngender equality.\nThe new Government is committed to improving\nthe country\u2019s macroeconomic indicators. We are\ndetermined to develop social policies that guarantee\ngradual improvements in people\u2019s living standards,\nparticularly for the most vulnerable. In order to achieve\nits programme\u2019s goals, the Government will support\nthe expansion and modernization of the financial\nsystem, while keeping inflation under control, in an\neffort to improve the legal framework necessary for\neconomic development.\nWith regard to our close cooperation with the\nWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund, we\nare determined to promote sound macroeconomic and\ninvestment policies that will guide the country towards\nsustainable development, encourage the private sector\nand promote employment.\nI would also like to assure the Assembly that our\nGovernment is fully committed to implementing the\nMillennium Development Goals. We share the belief\nthat coordinating and harmonizing national and local\ndevelopment strategies, with wide-scale civil society\nparticipation, private sector initiative, heightened\npublic awareness and the holding of public debates to\nidentify the most effective ways and means to achieve\nthe Millennium Development Goals will lead to the\ndesired results, including in Albania.\nThe Albanian Government is resolved to combat\norganized crime, transnational crime, illegal trafficking\nand terrorism relentlessly by strengthening national\nlegislation and law enforcement structures and by\nestablishing relevant implementation mechanisms and\nfully committing itself to regional cooperation on a\nwider scale. That effort will serve to bring us closer to\nour friendly neighbours as well as to all European\ncountries. This is a common struggle.\nIt should be recalled that my country has had\nexcellent experience in coexistence among different\nreligious communities. We are convinced that\nstrengthening dialogue among cultures, civilizations\nand religions is an important element in strengthening\npeaceful coexistence and good-neighbourly relations. It\nalso holds great potential for strengthening cooperation\namong countries. In that connection, an international\nforum was held in Tirana in December 2004 under the\nauspices of the President of Albania and the Director-\nGeneral of UNESCO. In addition to discussing\nimportant issues related to such a dialogue, the\ngathering also paved the way for further cooperation in\nthat regard.\nMy country has decisively committed itself to the\npath to Euro-Atlantic integration, with the clear\npurpose of joining the European Union and NATO. We\nview Euro-Atlantic integration as our country\u2019s entry\ninto the zone of peace, stability and prosperity\nestablished in Western Europe over the course of many\nyears. Joining that family will signal our society\u2019s\nembrace of such values as economic and political\nfreedom, fundamental human rights and freedoms, the\nprimacy of law, social prosperity and solidarity. It will\nalso reflect that fact that we are making our\ncontribution to that set of values.\nAlbania is preparing for the closure of\nnegotiations of the Stabilization and Association\nAgreement with the European Union that will lead to\nits signature. We are convinced that our country has the\nability to meet all the requirements of this very\nrigorous process. Albanian society is firmly committed\nto carry out reform, which will contribute to our\nintegration into the European Union. We believe that\nthe reform process is, first and foremost, in the interest\nof the country and of strengthening the economy and\nimproving Albania\u2019s image in the world.\nWe view NATO as a guarantor of security in our\nregion. By increasing cooperation with NATO we are\naiming at membership soon. Albania\u2019s participation in\nNATO peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina and Afghanistan constitutes a real\ncontribution to both regional and international peace\nand security.\nGood-neighbourly relations and cooperation with\nthe countries of our region continue to be top priorities\nof our foreign policy. Our vision for a region of\nstability and security, through fruitful bilateral and\nmultilateral cooperation, is sincere and is already quite\nclear. Our philosophy regarding the development of\nsuch relations is based on three basic principles:\ntransparency, tolerance and dialogue. In that context,\nwe have intensified high-level political dialogue with\nall the countries of the region. We have expanded the\nframework for legal and institutional cooperation at the\nbilateral and multilateral levels in many areas of\ncommon interest. That dialogue is becoming more\n36\n\nconstant and sensible due to a spirit of mutual\nunderstanding and confidence.\nThrough their growing participation in\npeacekeeping missions in areas of conflict throughout\nthe world, several countries of the region have been\ntransformed from consumers to worthy contributors to\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\nWith regard to positive developments and\nprogress in the region, Albania has consistently played\na positive, moderating and constructive role vis-\u00e0-vis\nAlbania\u2019s neighbouring countries by promoting multi-\nethnic coexistence in an atmosphere of harmony and\nlasting peace. Albanian foreign policy holds that\ndetermining the status of Kosovo is an important issue.\nThere is no more time to lose. The status quo will not\nguarantee lasting peace in the region. We believe that\nthe answer to Kosovo\u2019s status should take into account\nthe will of its people as democratically expressed and\nnot disregard the rights of minorities. In that regard,\nconditional independence could allow the international\ncommunity to monitor the development of Kosovo\u2019s\ninstitutions and society for a given period and, above\nall, would provide a guarantee for Serbs and other\nminorities to live in their own homes in that country.\nWe all believe that Kosovo\u2019s future, as for all the\ncountries in the region, lies in European and Euro-\nAtlantic integration.\nWe Albanians are confident that, in his\nforthcoming report, Mr. Kai Aide, Special Envoy of the\nSecretary-General for Kosovo, will provide an\nobjective assessment of the standards achieved thus far\nin Kosovo in connection with the establishment of the\ninstitutions for the rule of law and a democratic\nenvironment that will open the way for negotiations on\nKosovo\u2019s final status. The Contact Group on Kosovo\nhas an important role to play in that process.\nIn short, there have been some preliminary\npositive results. But there is much work to be done by\nus all to encourage and sustain the dialogue between\nPristina and Belgrade. There are many issues to\ndiscuss. With good will and the determination to\nachieve peace, we have much cause to optimistic."

        "file_text": "It is an honour and\nprivilege for me to present my country\u2019s statement, as\ncommanded by His Majesty King Mswati III.\nI am happy to convey the greetings and best\nwishes of His Majesty King Mswati III, Her Majesty\nthe Queen Mother, and the entire Swazi nation.\nOn behalf of my delegation, I wish to\ncongratulate Mr. Eliasson on his election as President\nof the General Assembly at its sixtieth session. The\nKingdom of Swaziland is confident that his diplomatic\nskills and vast experience in international affairs will\nguide the work of the General Assembly to a\nsuccessful conclusion as it faces the daunting task of\nreform and change.\nWe wish also to recognize the work done by his\npredecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, Minister of Foreign Affairs\n23\n\nof Gabon, who ably steered the last session so as to set\nthe stage for change in the year 2005. He hands over\nthe leadership of this body at a crucial time \u2014 a time\nwhen we have to take concrete and firm action to effect\nsuch change. We wish him well and every success in\nhis future endeavours.\nThis is a momentous occasion, as we are\ncelebrating the sixtieth anniversary of the United\nNations at a time when we are charting a course and\nadopting clear guidelines for adapting the Organization\nto the effective role it must play in the new century. We\nhave also taken on the responsibility and challenge of\nensuring that the United Nations of the twenty-first\ncentury can make real improvements in the lives of the\npeoples of the world.\nGiven the contributions of the United Nations to\nworld peace, economic and social development and the\nobservance of human rights, we are reaffirming our\nfaith in the Organization, and we will continue to work\nto achieve the objectives of the Charter through the\nstrengthening and revitalization of the United Nations\nsystem.\nIn the last five years, the international community\nhas witnessed a mixed bag of successes, trials and\ntribulations whose consequences have been felt across\nthe globe. The scale of some of these man-made\nproblems and natural disasters \u2014 such as terrorism,\nwar, the tsunami and Hurricane Katrina \u2014 was\nunprecedented.\nIt is because of some of these incidents that, for\nthe first time in its existence, the United Nations has\nbeen challenged in its pivotal role of maintaining\nglobal peace, security and safety. Fortunately, the\nUnited Nations has remained undeterred, and that is\ndue in particular to the astute leadership of our\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, whose diplomatic\nskills and efforts to unite \u2014 tested as they have\nbeen \u2014 have managed to keep the Organization\nfocused as it deals with the critical issues confronting\nthe international community today.\nFor those reasons, the Kingdom of Swaziland\nbelieves that this session presents an opportunity for us\nto advance further the reform process in order not only\nto make the Organization efficient and effective, but\nalso to ensure that the programmes of action adopted at\npast global conferences are fully implemented.\nWe therefore welcome the decisions taken at the\nrecently concluded Millennium Development Goals\n(MDGs) review summit. These will indeed set us on\ncourse to have a significant impact on each and every\ncountry\u2019s socio-political and economic development.\nOur quest for a safer and secure world continues\nto be challenged. The recent spate of terrorist\nbombings in various parts of the world is a clear\nindication that we have to fight that growing scourge\nwith urgency. The adoption of the 13 conventions\ncovering different aspects of terrorism demonstrates\nour unwavering commitment to this course.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland supports the\nSecretary-General\u2019s call for the drafting of a\ncomprehensive instrument that will enable us to\ncollectively and effectively fight terrorism.\nTensions and conflicts within and among States,\nwhich are detrimental to development and productivity,\ncontinue to affect many parts of the world. Such\nconflicts are fuelled by the ever-growing illicit trade in\nsmall arms and light weapons, which cause the death\nand displacement of thousands of innocent people\nevery year.\nIn that regard, the Kingdom of Swaziland\nsupports United Nations efforts to enhance\ninternational cooperation to prevent, combat and\neradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light\nweapons. We further call for stern action to be taken\nagainst the mass production of such arms and weapons,\nin the same manner as we would deal with drug\nproducers.\nIn this age of globalization, collective action will\nbe necessary given that no single nation can find its\nown solutions to the challenges that we face. In that\ncontext, we welcome the various initiatives currently\nunder way that are aimed at engaging regional\norganizations to do their part in responding to\nchallenges within their regions.\nThese partnerships have been taking shape, and it\nis now up to us to give them substance by establishing\nappropriate frameworks, harmonizing methods and\npooling capacities and resources for our work.\nWe in Africa consider cooperation between the\nAfrican Union and the United Nations as being of great\nvalue. For example, peacekeeping and peacebuilding\nmissions continue to enhance peace initiatives in our\nregion. However, I would like to stress here that\n24\n\npeacekeeping operations must go hand in hand with\nhumanitarian efforts, with all of the urgency such\nsituations require.\nAfrican leaders have demonstrated their political\nwill, but they lack the resources to resolve crises in\nAfrica. It is for that reason that we appeal to the\ninternational community to increase its support for the\nAfrican Union, so as to enhance its capacity and\nresponse mechanism.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland supports the call for\nan integrated approach to conflict resolution on our\ncontinent, and we also support the idea that the African\nUnion is the organ best suited to mobilizing the efforts\nof its members, and, most important of all, to\nundertaking preventive action before a situation\ndeteriorates.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland remains concerned,\nhowever, by the conflict in the Middle East, which\ncontinues to threaten international peace and security.\nWe believe that the road map holds the key to a\npositive outcome on the matter and urge the Quartet to\ncontinue its efforts to bridge the differences between\nthe parties.\nWhile welcoming the positive efforts by the\nGovernment of Israel to withdraw from some parts of\nthe occupied territories, we would urge both parties to\nmake a commitment to a comprehensive cessation of\nall violence, particularly that aimed at civilians, or else\nreal progress will remain elusive. We remain hopeful\nthat a solution to the conflict is imminent and continue\nto urge both parties to remain pragmatic and\nconstructive in their quest for a solution.\nThe recent MDG follow-up summit succeeded in\nhighlighting the plight of Africa with unprecedented\nclarity. The paradox of Africa is the extreme and\nincreasing poverty of its people, who face many\nproblems, including ill health, in a land so richly\nendowed with natural resources. This has become\nincreasingly visible over the past decade, while we\nhave seen evidence of a decline in poverty in other\nparts of the world.\nIn much of Africa, one of the major causes and\nconsequences of poverty is disease, mainly malaria and\nHIV/AIDS. These diseases continue to compromise the\nhealth situation in African countries, halting and even\nreversing health gains achieved in earlier years. The\npoor are caught in a complex poverty trap in which low\nincome leads to low consumption, which in turn results\nin low capacity and low productivity.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland believes that there\nare relatively affordable technologies in our modern\nworld that can mitigate the effect of disease on the\npoor. Experience has shown that proven strategies and\nhealth interventions can effectively and dramatically\nreduce the toll of these killer diseases. Fortunately, the\nMDGs point the way forward.\nWe believe that the creation of a world solidarity\nfund to eradicate extreme poverty and an accord within\nthe framework of the World Trade Organization on\npatents are imperative and would be steps in the right\ndirection, so that our countries can provide medicines\nto all.\nHealth is a strong entry point for poverty\nreduction, and alleviating the disease burden on the\npoor will contribute to the improvement of their social\nstatus.\nThis year also marks another milestone in the\ncalendar of the movement for gender equality and the\nadvancement of women: the 10-year review of the\nBeijing Declaration and Platform for Action. In 1995\nwomen gathered in Beijing and took a giant step\nforward. At that point, gender equality came to be\nrecognized as a critical element of development and\npeace for each and every country. Some progress has\nbeen made. For example, many more girls are now\nenrolled in primary education. Investing in women is\nparamount for ensuring sustainable development.\nDuring this session, we must strive to meet the\nchallenge that the Charter, established 60 years ago,\narticulated: the equal rights of men and women.\nAs we note this progress, we acknowledge the\nnewer challenges that have emerged, such as the effects\nof the HIV/AIDS pandemic on both women and girls.\nThe HIV/AIDS scourge continues to plague our\ncommunities in Africa. The pandemic is as much a\nmedical crisis as it is an economic, social and political\ncrisis. With no cure insight, it will continue to deplete\nthe essential financial and human resources so critical\nfor development. For its part, my Government has been\ncollaborating with local communities to find home-\ngrown solutions to this problem. We continue to be\ngrateful to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,\nTuberculosis and Malaria and other international\nagencies for the assistance and support they continue to\nprovide us in our fight against this killer disease.\n25\n\nThere is no doubt that developing countries are\ndetermined to fight poverty by creating jobs for our\npeople. As we play our part in the mobilization of\ndomestic resources, I would like to appeal to the\ndeveloped world to meet its commitments by\nsupporting us. Effective assistance by the international\ncommunity to enhance the quality of economic choices\nis necessary, as is firm commitment without\nconditionalities.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland believes that the\nDoha Development Agenda needs to be seriously\nadvanced, with industrialized countries addressing the\nneeds of developing countries. We call for better access\nto markets, in particular preferential markets with\nlowered tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade with\nindustrialized countries.\nOn the question of reform of the United Nations,\nthe Kingdom of Swaziland supports the wide range of\nproposals put forward to revitalize our Organization in\nits management of our affairs. We are of the view that\nthe role of the General Assembly must be significantly\nstrengthened to enable it to fulfil the tasks originally\nassigned to it by the Charter. The General Assembly, as\nthe most democratic and representative body of the\nUnited Nations, should seize this opportunity to take\nthe lead and thus demonstrate that it can express the\npolitical will of the people of the world.\nIn this regard, the Economic and Social Council\ntoo should be strengthened and given decision-making\npowers to implement the United Nations development\nagenda. We also believe that the Council should\ncontinue to be the overall coordinator of all\ndevelopment activities, including the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals.\nAs we discuss greater representation and wider\nparticipation in the United Nations system, and as we\ncelebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the Organization,\nallow me to remind all of us gathered here that the\nmore than 23 million people of the Republic of China\nremain hopeful that their voice in quest of participation\nin the very important United Nations system will soon\nbe heard and positively responded to, so that they too\ncan make their valuable contributions to the\nmanagement and prosperity of world affairs. In the\nmeantime, it is our continued hope that the existing\nissues between the parties will be resolved peacefully."

We support the early\nestablishment of a human rights council so as to\npromote democracy.\nHowever, the results of the summit meeting do\nnot fully correspond with Africa\u2019s aspirations. What is\nlacking is that long-hoped-for impetus that would\nenable every Member State to express its views, give\nhope to our peoples, preserve the balance of nature and\nenable us to ensure the futures of all the world\u2019s\nchildren. We need to further strengthen our efforts by\ntrying fresh approaches.\nFirst of all, it is high time to strengthen the role\nof the General Assembly. It is also time for Africa to\nbe better represented within United Nations bodies,\nand in particular on the Security Council. That is a\nmatter of justice, but it is also a necessity for the\ndevelopment of our continent. Having Africa\u2019s voice\nheard on the international level and allowing it to share\nin responsibilities on a global level are marks of\nconcern and respect for our States and our peoples. Let\nus put an end to the exclusion of the African continent.\nWe want to make our full and complete contribution to\ndebates and decision-making on issues that concern\nhow our world works.\nThe discussions in recent months have focused on\ninstitutional reform at the United Nations. That is a\nvery important question. It is also important for Africa.\nBut we would ask you to expand the discussion so as to\nproperly define the role that the Organization should\nplay in world development. The United Nations should\nbe more than just a crisis management body \u2014 a body\nthat addresses poverty, disasters and emergencies. Let\nus convert it into a body that inspires us with hope. Let\nus work together for development, justice and equity.\nThe sixtieth anniversary of the United Nations\nshould mark the beginning of a new era in which we\nwill have the opportunity to build a more prosperous,\nmore just, more democratic and more environmentally\naware world \u2014 a world that is sounder, healthier, more\nresponsible and more united.\nWe need to work out strategies and plans that\narouse enthusiasm among nations and attract the\nfervent hopes of our peoples. We will only change the\nworld if we can secure the support of our populations.\nThe United Nations must devise and adopt the\nnecessary measures to establish a more balanced world.\nAll the crises, the wars, the questions of security and\nterrorism, the world\u2019s epidemics \u2014 all of those have\nconcrete causes.\nThe Secretary-General rightly quoted one of the\nUnited Nations purposes from the preamble to the\nCharter: \u201cto promote social progress and better\nstandards of life in larger freedom\u201d. Our peoples want\nto have real opportunities. Quite rightly, they call for\nthe favourable conditions that will allow them to take\nadvantage of those opportunities.\nOur Organization is 60 years old. Much has been\nachieved in decolonization and peacekeeping, for\ninstance. Five years ago we defined the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals. Now we must go still further. Let\nus devise a genuine global strategy for development, a\nstrategic partnership with a clear-cut vision and more\nambitious goals.\nAs regards Africa, what is lacking is a clear\nvision of its future. It can be seen that Africa is still a\npoor continent. Nonetheless, Africa has the potential to\nbe rich. The previous General Assembly provided me\nwith an opportunity to propose a \u201cMarshall Plan for\nAfrica\u201d. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\nmade the same proposal and the President of the World\nBank, Mr. Paul Wolfowitz, has also spoken of a plan of\naction for Africa. Let us ask other donors to join in this\ninitiative.\nThe Marshall Plan for Africa should cover much\nmore than a call to cancel debt and increase financial\nsupport. It should take into account Africa\u2019s potential\nand the right steps that are needed to realize it. It\nshould build a positive image of our continent and\ndetermine the role that it could play in economic,\npolitical, social and cultural spheres.\nGlobalization highlights the economic dimension\nof international relations. However, we need to invest\nmore in the social dimension of development by\nenhancing the role of the Economic and Social Council\nso as to meet the legitimate aspirations of our peoples.\nThe future of Africa lies, of course, with its\nchildren. The plan for Africa should describe how we\ncan approve the transfer of knowledge and how we can\nensure access for young Africans to the world\u2019s\nknowledge and expertise, so that the intellectual\npotential of millions of people will not be wasted.\nWe need to increase literacy levels. We also need\nan educational system that meets international\n5\n\nstandards of quality and effectiveness \u2014 a system that\nwill foster creativity and help our peoples to realize\ntheir dreams; a system that will optimize our countries\u2019\nhuman resources so as to enable us to play an\nimportant role in the world economy; a system which\nwill help to close the digital divide among nations.\nSaving African children also means feeding them.\nIn that respect, overcoming hunger in Africa is an\nurgent challenge, as millions of people will be affected\nby this crisis.\nMadagascar, as a new member of the Southern\nAfrican Development Community, urges the General\nAssembly to make that crisis its highest priority. We\nmust act rapidly and with resolve.\nLet us also improve the situation of women. They\ndeserve to play a more significant role in civil society\nand in the economic and political arena.\nI have personally been asked by the Water,\nSanitation and Hygiene (WASH) project to share their\nconcerns with you. Indeed, one of the most\nburdensome daily chores of African women is\nproviding a family with water. Access to drinking\nwater for all frees women from servitude and thus\npreserves their dignity. Moreover, the issue of water\nmanagement is inseparable from those of sanitation\nand hygiene. Water is a source of life and a great\neconomic asset. The development of hydroelectric\nenergy is one solution to Africa\u2019s energy deficit. Let us\nnot forget that rational water management will enable\nus to achieve food self-sufficiency.\nSuch a Marshall Plan should include the\nprotection and development of natural resources, which\nare crucial to our continent. To that end, we have a\nvision, which we call \u201cMadagascar, naturally\u201d.\nTwo years ago in Durban, I announced our\ndecision to triple the extent of protected areas in the\ncountry so as to ensure the preservation of our rich and\nunique biodiversity. We took the decision to earmark 8\nper cent of funds stemming from the cancellation of\nexternal debt for the funding of our protected-area\nsystem.\nThe African continent already is involved in the\npreservation of natural resources for the world and will\nincrease its efforts in that area.\nLet us focus on agribusiness by creating more\nopportunities for processing our natural products and\nthus enhancing the value-added that they bring to our\ncountries. This is the approach that Madagascar is\ntaking now, with the support of donors. Let us foster\ninitiatives to establish a fair and equitable trading\nregime among nations, such as the reduction of trade\nbarriers.\nIn short, such a Marshall Plan should make it\nclear that the African continent can prosper by\nshouldering its responsibilities. We need to speak more\nof our assets than of our weaknesses. We need to speak\nof our potential rather than our lack of resources. The\nworld wants to invest in our potential. Let us find a\nfresh approach. Let us create a new image, a new, clear\nvision for Africa. It is only through such a vision,\nalong with a genuine global strategy for development,\nthat the Millennium Development Goals can be\nachieved.\nSuch an approach must incorporate the various\ninternational and bilateral programmes and projects\nwhose differing structures, objectives and content\nmake them complicated to manage and hinder the\nidentification of possible synergies. But it is incumbent\non us to ensure the effective coordination of\ndevelopment and thus adopt the concept of country\nownership. We in Madagascar have taken the initiative\nof setting up national programmes in which all donors\u2019\nprojects are incorporated.\nThe world must heed the needs of Africa, but\nAfrica must also face up to its responsibilities by\nstrengthening democracy, good governance and the\nrule of law.\nThe discussions on the role and the structure of\nthe United Nations which have taken place in the\ncontext of the sixtieth anniversary offer us an\nexceptional opportunity. Let us create more equitable\nstructures that are better suited to today\u2019s needs and\nrealities. Let us draw inspiration from the spirit of the\nfounding fathers of our Organization.\nLet us be nations united in spirit, with a global\nvision and strategy of development for a world that is\nnot only more dynamic but also more balanced, more\nequitable and more responsible. Let us work towards\nthat end."

        "file_text": "Allow me to begin by\ncongratulating Mr. Jan Eliasson, upon his election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixtieth\nsession. We have full confidence in him and in his\nteam. I would also like to commend Mr. Jean Ping for\nthe pivotal role that he played during the fifty-ninth\nsession.\nThe leaders of the world gathered in this very\nHall last week at the largest summit meeting in history.\nThe outcome document adopted by the heads of State\nor Government has given us very concrete tasks for the\nfuture. The reform continues; we will have to maintain\nfocus and take important decisions during the sixtieth\nsession.\nMy remarks today will be confined to a few main\ntopics, with a specific emphasis on Estonia\u2019s\ncontribution to our common goals.\nDevelopment, security and human rights are\ninterconnected issues. It is inconceivable that global\nprogress in those areas can be made without an\neffective multilateral system, fully in line with the\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter. As we\npointed out a week ago in the outcome document, no\ncountry can tackle today\u2019s intricate challenges alone.\nEstonia is fully committed to strengthening the United\nNations.\nWe live in a global and interdependent world and\nwe thus need to combine our efforts. There has to be\ncooperation among different organizations that have\nthe capacity for conflict prevention and peacekeeping\noperations, as well as for providing for such\nrequirements as logistical support and training.\nThe United Nations cannot hope to find a United\nNations solution for all problems. Estonia is pleased to\nsee that the United Nations is actively forging a deeper\npartnership with various organizations. Estonia is\nactively participating in the common efforts of both the\nEuropean Union and NATO. We feel that the United\nNations, the European Union and NATO should all\ncontinue working towards mutually fruitful\ncooperation and towards greater predictability in terms\nof the allocation of resources. The more we coordinate\nour activities, the better will be the results we can\nachieve in dealing with conflict, poverty and human\nsuffering. The European Union has made great\nheadway in developing battle groups, thus increasing\nour ability to react swiftly in crisis situations.\nEstonia will continue to contribute through\nvarious organizations to the stability of Afghanistan,\nIraq, Sudan, Kosovo and the Middle East. Our long-\nterm contribution to United Nations monitoring on the\nIsraeli-Lebanese border, our explosives-detecting\nteams in Afghanistan, our substantive presence \u2014\nconsidering the size of Estonia \u2014 in Kosovo, our\nassistance in training the new Iraqi police force and our\nparticipation in stabilizing Iraq are just a few examples\nof my country\u2019s contribution to common efforts.\nEstonia also acknowledges the need to develop\nAfrican peacekeeping and to provide better training for\nUnited Nations peacekeepers. We hosted a United\nNations peacekeeping \u201ctrain the trainers\u201d course in\nEstonia just a few months ago, attended by\npeacekeepers from some 30 countries.\nOver the years, we have shown our continued\ncommitment to United Nations activities, including\npeacekeeping, in a very simple and unequivocal\nway \u2014 by paying regularly and on time the full\namount of our assessed contributions.\nThe role of the international community does not\nend at the point where we manage to stop an ongoing\nconflict. As we all know, without adequate State\nstructures, a country faces the risk of relapsing into\nconflict. Therefore, Estonia welcomes the\nestablishment of the Peacebuilding Commission, and\nwe hope to see the first results of its work fairly soon.\nThe next issue I would like to address is\nterrorism. Here, our position is unequivocal: terrorism\nis unacceptable in all circumstances, and we should be\nunited against it. We regret that the summit document\n37\n\ndoes not condemn the deliberate killing of civilians and\nnon-combatants.\nEstonia believes that the anti-terrorism strategy\nput forward by Secretary-General Kofi Annan should\nbe adopted and implemented. We consider the\nconclusion of the comprehensive convention against\ninternational terrorism an utmost priority during the\ncurrent session of the General Assembly. Estonia fully\nimplements all relevant United Nations Security\nCouncil resolutions and supports the initiatives of the\nUnited Nations and other international organizations in\npreventing and combating terrorism. A few days ago,\nEstonia signed the International Convention for the\nSuppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\nis another pressing security concern. We regret that no\nagreement was reached on non-proliferation and\ndisarmament during the summit.\nThere is a serious concern over slow progress in\nthe sphere of poverty eradication and the realization of\nother Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).\nEstonia, together with other European Union member\nStates, is increasing resources devoted to development\ncooperation. Despite our status as a new donor,\nEstonia\u2019s official development assistance in 2004 was\nalready 0.08 per cent of gross national income. We are\nsteadily increasing our input, and this will also raise\nour voluntary contribution to United Nations\ndevelopment-related activities.\nNo State will be able to achieve the MDGs as\nlong as it does not respect fundamental human rights.\nThe second International Decade of the World\u2019s\nIndigenous People coincides with the targeted time\nframe for the accomplishment of the MDGs \u2014 2015. If\nwe truly want to achieve the MDGs, we must focus on\nthe issues that matter most to people, including\nindigenous peoples. The implementation of the MDGs\nin connection with the indigenous peoples has to be\nviewed within the broader context of the Millennium\nDeclaration, which brings together the three basic aims\nof the United Nations Charter \u2014 peace and security,\neconomic and social development, and human rights.\nOne cannot, of course, fail to mention the matter\nof climate change, the relevance of which has become\nespecially clear after recent natural disasters. Indeed,\nwe have to step up global long-term cooperation so that\nwe can produce real change.\nI would like to stress the significance of the\nHuman Rights Council. We see the Council as a\nstanding Charter body, well-connected with other\nUnited Nations structures, including the Security\nCouncil. Human rights violators should not have a seat\nat the Council.\nEstonia is committed to promoting human rights\nas universal values that should be guaranteed for all.\nWe are pleased that the summit agreed to double the\nregular budget for the Office of the United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights within the next\nfive years.\nI would like to stress Estonia\u2019s firm belief in the\nextraordinary importance of democracy, good\ngovernance and the rule of law. Estonia supports the\ncreation of the Democracy Fund, to which we will\nmake a financial contribution.\nEstonia applauds the agreement that we reached\non the responsibility to protect. We should all fulfil\ncommitments nationally, but we should also be\nprepared to deal with cases of genocide, war crimes,\nethnic cleansing and all other crimes against humanity\nurgently requiring outside intervention, even if it has\nnot been requested. In such cases, the international\ncommunity has to take action.\nAs a founding member of the International\nCriminal Court, we are disappointed not to see any\nreference to this Court in the outcome document. We\ndeem the Court, as well as other instruments of\ninternational justice, vital to counter impunity for\ninternational crimes.\nSixty years ago, world leaders made a promise to\nprevent war, to defend human rights and to help the\npeoples of the world to achieve safety, prosperity and\nfreedom. Let us be bold and try harder than ever to\nachieve these goals."

        "file_text": "It is a\ndistinct honour to address this Assembly on the\noccasion of the sixtieth regular session of the General\nAssembly of the United Nations, an important\nmilestone in the life of our Organization. We would\nlike to take this opportunity to express our warm\ncongratulations to His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan,\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, for the skill\nand dynamism he has displayed in leading our\nOrganization. We would also like to pay tribute to his\ndedication to the cause of peace and to the interest he\nhas always paid to the people of Burundi during their\ndifficult times. Allow us also at this memorable time to\nexpress our profound gratitude to the Security Council\nof the United Nations for the resolute will it has\ndisplayed in accompanying the people of Burundi step\nby step in their search for peace.\nOur country has just entered an essential phase in\nits history. In political terms, after more than ten years\nof war and a lengthy period of transition, the main\nprotagonists in the conflict have agreed to bury the\nhatchet. Free, pluralist, fair and transparent elections\nwere the culmination of this long process. Indeed, it\nwas at the end of a genuine electoral marathon,\ninvolving local, legislative, senatorial and presidential\nelections, that the people of Burundi overwhelmingly\nchose the programme and candidates of my party, the\nCNDD-FDD (Conseil National pour la D\u00e9fense de la\nD\u00e9mocratie, Forces pour la D\u00e9fense de la D\u00e9mocratie),\nin calm and in dignity. This was an indisputable and\nundisputed victory recognized and acknowledged by\nall of the many foreign observers. The political parties\nhave also accepted the verdict of the ballot boxes.\nIn order to enable every opportunity for national\nharmony and establish democracy once again, we have\njust set up a Government of broad national union\nconsisting of all the elements of the Burundi people,\nwith its political, social, ethnic and regional diversity, a\nGovernment where women hold the significant\nposition they deserve.\nWe are especially pleased to note the genuine\nsocial and mental change represented by the entry of\nBurundian women into the political sphere. Today,\nwomen hold 35 per cent of posts in the executive\nbranch. Their presence is notable in all State\ninstitutions. For the first time in my country\u2019s history,\n2\n\nthe National Assembly is presided over by a woman\nand two women are vice-presidents of the Senate. At\nthe Government level, one of the two vice-presidencies\nof the Republic is held by a woman. Women head\nseven of the 20 ministries, including in such important\nposts as justice, foreign relations and planning. Lastly,\nmany women are working in provincial and communal\nadministrations.\nOur Government cherishes the hope that this\ncontribution of women\u2019s talents to managing the affairs\nof State will help to strengthen democracy by giving it\na warmer, more thoughtful and peaceful image.\nWe are also pleased that the democratic spirit of\ncohesion and unity in diversity which has breathed new\nlife into the political scene is also being felt in the\ninstitutions of defence and security. Indeed, yesterday\u2019s\nantagonists \u2014 the former Burundian armed forces and\nthe armed groups arrayed against them \u2014 have been\nmerged into new forces, known as the National\nDefence Force and the National Police of Burundi, in\nwhich all the country\u2019s players are represented. That\nfact is rare enough to warrant highlighting.\nAll of those profound changes have been made\npossible by the synergy between the concern of the\ninternational community, the courage and maturity of\nthe Burundian people, and the willingness to\ncompromise of the political class. We express our\nwarmest thanks to all the international partners that\naccompanied us on our long road to peace. In\nparticular, we would single out the regional initiative,\nthe United Nations Operation in Burundi, mediators\nMwalimu Julius Nyerere and President Mandela,\nfacilitator Jacob Zuma, the European Union, the United\nStates of America, the African Union and many\nfriendly countries, especially those that contributed\ntroops to the peacekeeping force as well as financial\nlogistic means.\nPeace in our country, like the lasting success of\nour democratic experience, is closely linked to the\nstability of the regional environment. We therefore\nwelcome the efforts to restore peace, stability and\nsustainable development in the Great Lakes region. We\nare closely following and actively participating in the\npreparations for the International Conference on the\nGreat Lakes Region, now being organized under\nUnited Nations and African Union auspices, with the\nsupport of the region\u2019s Group of Friends.\nWe are one with our world village. Nothing that\noccurs there does not touch us. Threats to peace and\nsecurity sneer at borders. We call today for an urgent\npartnership to combat terrorism. In that context, the\ngeneral convention on international terrorism, once\nconcluded, will be an innovative legal instrument in\naddressing issues that have yet to be regulated.\nWe also need to stem the phenomenon of drug\ntrafficking, which \u2014 with its many corollaries,\nincluding child labour, the sex industry and illegal\nmigration \u2014 is transforming human beings into\ntwenty-first century commodities.\nCombating terrorism must include promoting a\nculture of peace. It would thus be useful to use the\nInternational Decade for the Culture of Peace to build\nthe defences of peace in the minds of men and women,\nparticularly through education, the media, faith-based\norganizations and cultural programmes aimed at\nchildren.\nTerrorism is also a denial of human rights. We\ntherefore welcome the decision to create the human\nrights council to promote respect for those rights. The\ncouncil will allow us to end the partisan bickering\nprevalent in the Commission on Human Rights.\nAs to the reform of the Security Council and\nother United Nations organs, our Government supports\nthe position of the African Union.\nWith respect to good governance, our\nGovernment is committed to taking appropriate\nmeasures to establish good governance in all its\naspects. We refer in particular to capacity-building, the\nmobilization of domestic resources and the\nimplementation of strategies to combat corruption,\nfraud and embezzlement. We will soon be unveiling a\nnew law and anti-corruption squad.\nWe are committed to fighting impunity, for we\nwant to strive for impartial justice, not only by\nbuilding our capacities in that sphere, but also by\nreforming the sectors involved in that issue. In that\ncontext, we request in particular the international\ncommunity\u2019s assistance in the urgent establishment of\na truth and reconciliation commission.\nIn the socio-economic field, we hope that the\nestablishment of new elected, democratic institutions\nwill lay the groundwork for robust legitimacy and\neffectiveness in our reconstruction and socio-economic\ndevelopment strategies. We wish to prioritize the\n3\n\nrehabilitation of social and economic infrastructure\ndestroyed during the war and the reintegration of\nexpatriates, internally displaced persons, demobilized\nsoldiers and war victims.\nWe also intend to attach high priority to\neducation. Thus, when we came to power, we decided\nto provide free primary schooling to all children by the\nbeginning of the 2005-2006 school year. That priority\ngoal for education requires the development and\nimplementation of ambitious and urgent programmes to\ntrain qualified teachers, rebuild schools and obtain new\neducational materials.\nFor the period 2006-2008, we are planning for the\nconstruction of at least one primary school for each\ncensus area, totalling some 350 primary schools. That\nwill involve the construction of 800 classrooms in\n2006, the recruitment of 2,000 new teachers and the\nacquisition of teaching materials at an estimated cost of\n$15 million. In that same context, we will prioritize\nprofessional training, particularly in the agricultural,\nparamedical, technical and trade fields, in order to\nhasten the country\u2019s reconstruction. By 2008, we\nexpect to build in each province a technical secondary\nschool with several departments and a capacity of at\nleast 1,000 pupils.\nIncreased financial resources will be necessary\nand we know that we can count on the assistance of the\ninternational community. In that regard, we support the\ninnovative proposal of the French Government to find\nnew sources of development financing by imposing a\nlevy on air tickets.\nMuch remains to be done in the area of health.\nOur Government has undertaken to develop a policy to\nmake significant improvements in universal access to\nhealth care, and to implement the national strategic\nplan to combat HIV/AIDS, an essential component of\nwhich is capacity-building in HIV/AIDS prevention\nand treatment.\nThe achievements of my country, particularly in\nthe political and security fields, are important steps in\nthe right direction. Nevertheless, they are only the start\nof a process that must be consolidated.\nIn particular, we will have to resume activities to\ncombat poverty and re-establish economic growth, two\nessential measures that will allow our people to reap\nthe dividends of peace.\nThe support of the entire population for the peace\nprocess and the programme for economic growth is\nessential. But how can the people feel that the new\npolicy includes them if their living conditions are not\nrapidly improved? That is why the support of the\ninternational community in this difficult period is of\nsupreme importance. We make an urgent appeal to the\ninternational community to ensure that the level and\nquality of their commitments will respond to the\ninsistent expectations of our population and to the new\ndemocratic changes."

        "file_text": "At the outset, I\nwould like, on behalf of the Vietnamese delegation,\nsincerely to congratulate Mr. Jan Eliasson on his\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its\nsixtieth session. I am convinced that under his able\nstewardship this session will be crowned with success.\nLet me express our deep appreciation for the\ncontributions made by his predecessor, Mr. Jean Ping,\nto the work of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth\nsession. I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his great\nefforts over the past year to reform and strengthen our\nOrganization.\nTaking place in the context of the many activities\ncommemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the United\nNations \u2014 especially the High-level Plenary Meeting\nof the General Assembly that just concluded \u2014 the\npresent session constitutes an event of crucial\nsignificance that offers us a great deal of hope and\nconfidence. We believe that Member States will be able\nto work out effective ways in which to implement the\ncommitments contained in the outcome document\n(resolution 60/1) just adopted by our leaders, especially\nthose concerning the implementation of the\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). We are\nconfident that, amid both challenges and opportunities\nand with the necessary wisdom and determination, we\nwill find the right path towards a brighter future for\nhumanity in the twenty-first century.\nIn today\u2019s celebratory atmosphere, we cannot and\nshould not forget stark realities as we continue to see\nthe spread of war and conflict, the resurgence of\nterrorism, natural disasters, poverty, the outbreak of\nepidemics and transnational crime, which are\nthreatening the peace, security, independence and\nprosperity of nations. The people of the world were\nshocked by the recent terrorist attacks in London, in\nSharm el-Sheikh and elsewhere. Viet Nam therefore\njoins with others in the fight against terrorism of all\n21\n\nkinds. It is our view that, in order to root out terrorism,\nthe international community must seriously and\nadequately address the phenomena of poverty, injustice\nand inequality.\nViet Nam welcomes the recent positive\ndevelopments in the Middle East peace process. It is\nour consistent policy to support the just cause of the\nPalestinian people in their struggle for their inalienable\nrights. In that connection, we welcome Israel\u2019s\nwithdrawal from resettlement areas in the Gaza Strip.\nProceeding from its principled position that\ninternational disputes should be settled by peaceful\nmeans, Viet Nam supports peaceful solutions to the\nnuclear issue in Iran and on the Korean peninsula.\nConsidering embargoes and blockades to be\nunacceptable in the modern world, we call for the early\nlifting of the unilateral embargo against Cuba. It is Viet\nNam\u2019s view that the United Nations should be more\nactive in that connection.\nThe tsunami that affected Asian countries last\nyear and Hurricane Katrina, which hit coastal cities of\nthe United States, both resulting in the loss of a great\nnumber of lives and damage worth hundreds of billions\nof dollars, are reminders of the need for effective early\nwarning systems, preparedness and international\nsolidarity in confronting the forces of nature.\nAs we are preparing to translate the commitments\ncontained in the outcome document into action to\nreform the United Nations, I would like to associate\nmyself with the views expressed by the Secretary-\nGeneral in his report \u201cIn larger freedom\u201d (A/59/2005)\nand reaffirmed in the outcome document concerning\nthe interactive links among peace, security,\ndevelopment and human rights. Viet Nam\u2019s experience\nshows that an environment of peace and political and\nsocial stability is indispensable for development and\nthat economic growth, the improvement of people\u2019s\nlives, will help to strengthen peace and stability. In that\nregard, we believe the United Nations should play a\ngreater role in making those links more interactive.\nViet Nam shares the common view that reform of\nthe United Nations should aim, first and foremost, at\nenhancing the Organization\u2019s efficiency and democracy\non the basis of strengthening the fundamental\nprinciples enshrined in the United Nations Charter. It is\nessential to reinforce the central role and power of the\nGeneral Assembly, a body that stipulates the equal\nparticipation of all United Nations Members. Reform\nof the Security Council should be accorded adequate\nattention, so that the Council can be turned into a body\nthat is able to perform its functions in maintaining\ninternational peace and security effectively. The\nCouncil\u2019s working methods should be improved to\nensure democracy and transparency. The Council needs\nto be enlarged in both categories of its membership in\norder to ensure that it truly represents all United\nNations Members, as stipulated in the Charter. We\nbelieve that developing States should be more\nadequately represented in that important organ. We\nwould like to reiterate the support we have expressed\nsince 1999 for India, Japan and Germany as permanent\nmembers of an expanded Council.\nFurthermore, Viet Nam believes that reform of\nthe United Nations must be carried out\ncomprehensively and in a way that ensures a balance\nbetween the two equally important and mutually\ncomplementary goals of maintaining peace and\nsecurity and promoting development. An enabling\nenvironment for development must be built on the\nbasis of equitable international economic relations,\nmutual benefit, shared responsibility and the fulfilment\nof agreed commitments.\nIn that spirit, Viet Nam supports the proposals on\ndevelopment set out in the report of the Secretary-\nGeneral and the commitments contained in the\noutcome document, especially the recommitment of the\ninternational community to achieving the MDGs on\nschedule. Viet Nam welcomes the commitment on the\npart of some developed countries to allocate 0.7 per\ncent of their gross national income to official\ndevelopment assistance without any conditions. If\ndeveloping nations are to achieve the MDGs, it is\nessential that they be enabled to participate more\nactively in the global economy. Viet Nam therefore\ncalls on the United Nations to adopt and implement\nmeasures to facilitate the entry of developing countries\ninto the World Trade Organization. Moreover, non-\ntariff and other protective measures aimed at blocking\nexports from developing countries, under such pretexts\nas sanitary and phytosanitary standards, should be\ndismantled.\nGuaranteeing and promoting human rights always\nremain high priorities in the work of the United\nNations. Viet Nam supports a greater role for the\nOrganization in that regard. We will continue to spare\nno effort in contributing to the common cause of\n22\n\nhuman rights protection. Mindful of the need to reform\nthe United Nations machinery for protecting human\nrights, we believe that reform must be conducted in a\nmanner that is free from acts of politicization. More\nin-depth discussions are needed with regard to the\nissue of establishing a Human Rights Council and the\nconcept of the responsibility to protect, so as to ensure\nbroad support for the measures to be implemented.\nThe Vietnamese people have just celebrated the\nsixtieth anniversary of the founding of their democratic\nState. Having gone through a process of comprehensive\nrenewal, Viet Nam today is a country with high and\nsustained economic growth and social equity, and we\nhave made significant progress in implementing the\nMDGs. Today, Viet Nam is a safe and stable country\nthat has further integrated into the global economy and\nhas pursued a foreign policy of independence,\nsovereignty and diversification, strengthening\nmultilateral ties in its external relations. It is a country\nthat is willing to be a friend and a reliable partner of all\ncountries of the world community.\nWe have actively participated in various regional,\ninterregional and global cooperation arrangements.\nViet Nam has been making great efforts to conclude\nnegotiations for its early accession to the World Trade\nOrganization. I would like to take this opportunity to\nextend our thanks to those countries that have\nsupported Viet Nam in that connection. We are actively\nengaged in the cooperation activities of the Association\nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Asia-Pacific\nEconomic Cooperation (APEC), as well as with\nASEAN cooperation with East Asia. To make a greater\ncontribution to the work of the United Nations, Viet\nNam has decided to present its candidacy for a\nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council for the\n2008-2009 term. We are now actively preparing to\nparticipate in United Nations peacekeeping operations\nwhen conditions are ripe.\nTo conclude, let me assure the Assembly that Viet\nNam will continue to work closely with other countries\nin the international community to strive for our\ncommon goals, among them a stronger United Nations."

        "file_text": "Let me congratulate the\nPresident of the current session and former President\nJean Ping for the success of the historic sixtieth\nanniversary summit. We admire the dedication and\nskill with which President Ping conducted the\npreparations for the summit. We thank the Secretary-\nGeneral for his initiative to convene the summit and his\nnumerous constructive ideas to advance development\nand United Nations reform.\nPakistan supported adoption of the outcome\ndocument. It reflects the existing consensus on a range\nof issues. However, like many others, we are\ndisappointed with the results. We could have achieved\nmore, perhaps, if the agenda were not so extensive, if\nSecurity Council reform had not sapped energy from\nthe preparatory process, and if the negotiations on the\ndocument had been commenced earlier.\nDevelopment was, and remains, of the highest\npriority for the vast majority of Member States. The\nsummit was to focus on fulfilment of the\n26\n\ninternationally agreed development goals. There are\nwelcome recommendations on official development\nassistance (ODA) targets, debt relief, enhancing and\nimproving aid and addressing the special needs of\nAfrica; but we did not advance very much on trade,\ninvestment flows and global governance.\nHowever, we can recover lost ground and lost\ntime on development through a focused and more\ndetermined implementation process. The objective\nmust be accorded first priority. Fortunately, agreement\nexists already on development goals, including the\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). The\ndeveloping countries are adopting national strategies to\nachieve those goals. Development partners must now\ndemonstrate the political will to fully support the\nnational strategies and to accept greater equity in the\ninternational trade and financial systems.\nWe must quickly put in place an effective\nmechanism to promote and monitor the implementation\nof the goals and agreements on development. Adequate\nresources must be provided for the purpose.\nThe summit emphasized the role of the Economic\nand Social Council in promoting policy dialogue,\ndevelopment cooperation, post-conflict development\nand coordination within the United Nations system.\nPakistan believes that the Economic and Social\nCouncil should now serve as the central forum for\nfollow-up and implementation of the development\ncommitments made at the summit. In this regard, we\nwould propose that the model developed for tracking\ntsunami aid \u2014 the so-called DAD (Development\nAssistance Database) system \u2014 be replicated to assess\nthe status of implementation of the agreed development\ngoals. Pakistan has also offered to convene a high-level\ninformal meeting of members of the Economic and\nSocial Council and other stakeholders towards the end\nof this year to review the steps taken to advance the\nimplementation of the development goals and decide\non further measures.\nThe widely recognized interlinkage between\npeace and development has now been institutionalized\nwith the decision to establish the Peacebuilding\nCommission. Pakistan is proud that the Peacebuilding\nCommission evolved from the concept of ad hoc\ncomposite committees that we introduced in 2003. As a\nmajor troop contributor to United Nations\npeacekeeping operations and, in particular, through our\nengagement in complex missions, such as in Sierra\nLeone, Liberia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nand Burundi, Pakistan has a wealth of experience and\nexpertise to contribute to the work of the Peacebuilding\nCommission. We shall take part actively in the\ndiscussions to be held in the General Assembly to\nfinalize the details and modalities for the\ncommencement of the Commission\u2019s work.\nTerrorism is a global menace and requires a\ncollective response. Pakistan has been a major target of\nterrorism. We are at the forefront of the international\nwar against terrorism. At home, the Pakistan\nGovernment has instituted a number of short- and long-\nterm measures to eliminate terrorism and extremism.\nThese include banning extremist organizations and\ndetention of extremists, crackdowns against hate\nmaterial, halting the misuse of religious institutions,\nregistration and reform of the madrassas and fighting\nilliteracy and poverty.\nThe summit has endorsed the elaboration of a\ncomprehensive strategy against terrorism. We should\nset up an ad hoc working group to elaborate this\nstrategy. A comprehensive strategy should oppose\nterrorism, wherever and by whomever \u2014 individuals,\ngroups or States. No strategy can be comprehensive if\nit does not address the factors that contribute to\nextremism, including poverty, political and economic\ninjustice, foreign occupation and denial of the right to\nself-determination.\nDialogue and understanding between civilizations\nand religions should also be an essential component of\na comprehensive strategy on terrorism. There are\nseveral noteworthy and mutually reinforcing initiatives\nthat can be coalesced to generate international and\nnational action. These include President Musharraf\u2019s\nstrategy of \u201cenlightened moderation\u201d, which seeks to\nsimultaneously promote internal reform in the Islamic\nworld and the active support of the international\ncommunity to help resolve political disputes and\naddress the socio-economic and development\nchallenges of the Islamic world.\nThe failure to achieve agreement on disarmament\nand non-proliferation in the outcome document reflects\nthe deep differences that exist among Member States.\nThis is dangerous for peace and stability, especially in\nregions of tension. It is time for the international\ncommunity, for the entire United Nations membership,\nnot just some self-selected States, to promote a new\nconsensus on disarmament and non-proliferation\n27\n\nthrough the Conference on Disarmament or a special\nsession of the Disarmament Commission.\nThe summit also could not achieve full consensus\non how to ensure the effective promotion of human\nrights that, along with \u201cpeace and development\u201d, is the\nthird pillar of United Nations reform. We should build\non the agreement reached to evolve a full consensus.\nPakistan will join in creating a new and representative\nHuman Rights Council as a subsidiary body of the\nGeneral Assembly. Its mandate and methods must\npromote cooperation rather than confrontation. We\nmust also improve and rationalize the Sub-Commission\non the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, the\nhost of special mechanisms that exist on the subject\nand the participation of civil society in the work of the\nUnited Nations on human rights. We feel that this\nexercise of reform should be entrusted to a working\ngroup in Geneva.\nWe have committed ourselves to strengthening\nthe United Nations and making it more effective,\nefficient, democratic and accountable. Our pledge to\nreaffirm the central position of the General Assembly\nshould be given real meaning. The Assembly\u2019s role and\nmandate should be preserved from encroachment,\nespecially by the Security Council. It is the General\nAssembly that should ensure the follow-up of the\nsummit\u2019s decisions.\nIn its capacity as President of the Economic and\nSocial Council, Pakistan will work closely with\nmember States to implement the proposed enhanced\nrole of the Council with adjustments to the Council\u2019s\norganization, agenda and working methods.\nThe Security Council has the primary\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international\npeace and security, but it lacks transparency and\ndemocracy. It is neither fully representative nor\naccountable to the general membership. The rationale\nfor its reform is, therefore, clear. The Council should\nbe enlarged by adding 10 additional non-permanent\nmembers to reflect the entire spectrum of the United\nNations membership. It could allow immediate\nre-election to enable major countries to seek more\nfrequent membership of the Council, but it should not\nadd to inequality by inducting new permanent\nmembers. That would alienate many important\ncountries, divide and weaken the United Nations and\nfurther reduce the Council\u2019s credibility and legitimacy.\nThe proposal of Uniting for Consensus is\nequitable, fair and democratic. It has the flexibility to\naccommodate the positions and aspirations of all\ncountries and regional and political groupings,\nincluding those of Africa. It will increase the\nrepresentation of the general membership in the\nSecurity Council. It will enhance the stature of the\nGeneral Assembly by making the Council more\naccountable to the general membership. We are ready\nto continue efforts \u2014 in any open and transparent\nformat, including that of the General Assembly\u2019s\nOpen-ended Working Group \u2014 to reach consensus on\nSecurity Council reform.\nPakistan is gratified that the summit reaffirmed\nthe central values and principles of the United Nations\nand acknowledged that the range of threats we face\nrequires our urgent, collective and more determined\nresponse. It also acknowledged that many threats are\ninterdependent. We welcome the renewed emphasis on\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes and on the Charter\u2019s\nstrict constraints on the use of force. It is befitting that\nwe are observing the International Day of Peace today.\nPakistan believes that while dealing with new\nthreats, such as terrorism and weapons of mass\ndestruction, the United Nations must continue to\naccord priority to addressing and resolving the\nnumerous disputes and conflicts that afflict so many\nregions of our world.\nIn Africa, there is a new dynamic of regional\nownership and international engagement and\npartnership in addressing conflicts and complex crises.\nProgress is, however, mixed. Relative improvements in\nSierra Leone and Liberia are in contrast with numerous\nchallenges in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo and Burundi. We are heartened by the\nprospects of peace in the Sudan. Somalia, on the other\nhand, still awaits the international attention and\nsupport needed to restore security and consolidate the\npainful gains in the peace process. Pakistan will\ncontinue to contribute to United Nations and\ninternational efforts for the restoration of peace and\nstability in Africa.\nThe early resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian\nissue in accordance with the relevant United Nations\nresolutions and a two-State solution would usher in an\nera of peace and stability in the Middle East. We have\nwelcomed Israel\u2019s withdrawal from the Gaza, and we\ntrust that it will be followed by withdrawal from the\n28\n\nWest Bank, leading to the creation of an independent\nand viable Palestinian State. Pakistan will do whatever\nit can to promote durable peace in the Middle East.\nThat would help considerably to eliminate the\nconditions that encourage extremism and terrorism.\nPakistan also hopes for the early restoration of\npeace and security in Iraq. We should encourage a\ndemocratic consensus among its peoples and regions\nthat preserves Iraq\u2019s unity and territorial integrity, as\nwell as the strengthening of its national capability to\npreserve security by combating violence and terrorism.\nAfghanistan has completed another milestone\nwith the successful holding of parliamentary elections.\nThe international community must remain fully\nengaged to help Afghanistan overcome the remaining\nchallenges. Pakistan is committed, bilaterally and\nmultilaterally, to support efforts for peace, security,\ndevelopment and reconstruction in Afghanistan. We\nwish to see the 3 million Afghan refugees whom we\nstill host return to their homes in safety and honour.\nThere should be no self-serving questions or\nquibbling about Pakistan\u2019s commitment and\ncontribution to peace and security in Afghanistan,\nwhich are in Pakistan\u2019s own best interest. Pakistan is\nactively engaged in halting illegal cross-border\nmovement and containing the threat posed by the\nTaliban and Al-Qaida, including through the Pakistan-\nAfghanistan-United States Tripartite Commission.\nPakistan\u2019s military presence along the border far\nexceeds the combined strength of the national and\ninternational military presence in Afghanistan. We\nrecently proposed partial fencing of the border in\nlimited areas to minimize the chances for illegal\nmovements. We hope that that will be accepted and\nimplemented in the spirit in which it was offered.\nRelations between India and Pakistan are\nimproving. There is new hope for peace and\ncooperation in South Asia. We must also give that hope\nto the people of Jammu and Kashmir in their legitimate\nquest for self-determination. In his address to the\nsummit on 14 September, President Musharraf said that\nPakistan and India must not remain trapped by hate and\nhistory in a cycle of confrontation and conflict. To\nprevent that from happening, it is essential to find a\njust solution to the dispute over Jammu and Kashmir,\nacceptable to Pakistan, India and, above all, the people\nof Kashmir. On the same day, the President met with\nthe Indian Prime Minister, Mr. Manmohan Singh, in\nNew York to further advance the ongoing composite\ndialogue between our two countries.\nPeace in our neighbourhood will also provide a\nfillip to the efforts being undertaken by Pakistan for\nrapid and equitable socio-economic development. We\nshare the emphasis placed by the summit on the role of\nnational policies and development strategies in the\nachievement of sustainable development. The\nGovernment has taken a series of actions to transform\nPakistan into a modern, dynamic, progressive and\ndemocratic Islamic State. Our policies have produced\nvisible results: macroeconomic stability, 8.4 per cent\ngrowth in gross domestic product last year, a reduced\nfiscal deficit and growing export earnings, external\nremittances and investment. The major focus of our\nGovernment now is to accelerate the transfer of\neconomic benefits to the people of Pakistan. We are\nconfident that we will achieve all the targets of the\nMillennium Development Goals.\nPakistan is also succeeding against terrorism and\nextremism. It is on the path to sustainable democracy.\nOur people have been empowered from the grass-roots\nlevel up. That includes guaranteed 30 per cent\nrepresentation of women at all levels. Minorities have\nbeen brought into the mainstream. We are determined\nto sustain those positive trends in our national\ndevelopment. At the same time, we are working to\nforge close economic partnerships in the region and\nbeyond.\nIt is in the same spirit of constructive engagement\nthat Pakistan wishes to pursue cooperative\nmultilateralism and to strengthen the United Nations \u2014\nthis unique forum that is indispensable, in our\ninterdependent world, for all States, large or small,\npowerful or weak.\nPakistan participated actively in, and contributed\nconstructively to, the preparation of the summit and its\noutcome. We are committed to furthering the reform\nprocess in the follow-up to the summit\u2019s decisions. We\nlook forward to working closely with all other Member\nStates and would like to assure the Assembly of our\nfull cooperation in this historic endeavour."

        "file_text": "Speaking for the first time from this rostrum, I wish to\nreaffirm here the importance France attaches to the\nmultilateral system. Our common future cannot be\nenvisaged without strengthening it.\nThe declaration adopted the day before yesterday\nis a milestone in that direction, even if it does not meet\nall our expectations. Indeed, the text makes some\nsignificant advances. I am thinking in particular of\ninnovative financing for development. I am also\nthinking of the decision to establish a peacebuilding\ncommission within the Security Council. Finally, I am\nthinking of the establishment of a Human Rights\nCouncil and the endorsement of the principle of the\nresponsibility to protect. Now it is up to us to put those\nnew concepts into practice.\nIn that connection, I wish to pay tribute here to\nthe remarkable work that has been done under the\nstewardship of Mr. Jean Ping.\nBut let us not underestimate the extent of the task\nthat still remains to be accomplished, be it in the areas\nof counter-terrorism, non-proliferation, Security\nCouncil reform or development assistance.\nThe United Nations is founded on the rule of law\nand the promotion of universal standards. Those reflect\nour common values and our conviction that there can\nbe no security and development without scrupulous\nrespect for human rights. This is not a moral question\nbut one of respect for the identity of every individual.\nIt is not a matter of passing judgement but of enabling\nall people to live in greater freedom and in dignity.\nLet us reject the impressment of children in\narmed conflicts, the systematic use of sexual violence\nagainst women and girls as a weapon of war, the\nrecourse to threats, arbitrary detention and torture of\nopponents, journalists, labour leaders and defenders of\nhuman rights. And, let us conclude the negotiations on\na convention against forced disappearances. To that\nend, let us strengthen the Office of the United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights and promptly\nestablish the Human Rights Council.\nFrance particularly welcomes the fact that the\ninternational community now has the necessary\nlegitimacy to exercise effectively its responsibility to\nprotect populations threatened by ethnic cleansing,\ncrimes against humanity and genocide. France also\nwelcomes the progress of the international criminal\njustice system, in particular through the action of the\nSecurity Council. Those who believe they can count on\nthe international community not to act when they\ncommit their crimes should make no mistake: they will\nbe held accountable.\nSixty years after the founding of the United\nNations, terrorism is now at the top of the list of human\nrights violations. Nothing \u2014 no cause, religion or\nmoral order \u2014 can justify attacks on the lives of\ninnocents, the lives of civilians. We must define acts of\nterrorism once and for all so that we can better combat\nthat barbaric practice which sets humankind back.\n17\n\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\nconstitutes another major threat for the planet, against\nwhich we must remain united and determined.\nFrance, together with its British and German\npartners, has proposed to Iran a constructive approach\npaving the way for a new relationship between that\ngreat country and the international community. That\nrelationship is currently compromised by concerns over\nIran\u2019s nuclear programme. We ask Iran to build trust by\nproviding objective guarantees on the exclusively\npeaceful nature of its programme. Iran\u2019s statements\nfrom this rostrum compel the international community\nto meet its responsibilities, as referral of the matter to\nthe Security Council is on the agenda in order to\nstrengthen the authority of the International Atomic\nEnergy Agency. The very integrity of the non-\nproliferation regime is at stake.\nBut let us also work to reduce the proliferation of\nsmall arms and light weapons, which fuel so many very\ndeadly conflicts.\nTo better serve peace and ensure the security of\npopulations, the Security Council has expanded its\nfield of action to the trafficking that finances conflicts\nand the impunity that protects traffickers, using, in\nparticular, sanctions and embargoes. The United\nNations is resolutely engaged on the ground, at the\nvery heart of conflicts. More than 70,000 blue\nhelmeted soldiers and police officers are now serving\nin 18 peacekeeping operations, and thousands of others\nare operating under Security Council mandates.\nThe results can be seen, for example, in Timor-\nLeste, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi,\nLiberia and Sierra Leone. But as countries emerge from\ncrisis, it is essential that they continue to benefit from\nour full attention and support. The United Nations has\nthe duty to take a central role in the transition phase\nthrough the Peacebuilding Commission.\nOther situations demand great vigilance and a\nhigh level of mobilization. Thus, in Haiti, the presence\nof strong contingents of United Nations soldiers and\npolice must lead to the strengthening of the political\nprocess by involving all peaceful forces without\nexception. Preparations for elections must be\naccelerated. Like all peoples, the Haitian people, who\nhave suffered for too long, are entitled to respect and\nfreedom.\nIn C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, the presence of the United\nNations Operation in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and the\nappointment of a High Representative of the Secretary-\nGeneral for the elections should also help strengthen\nimplementation of the process set out at Marcoussis\nand Pretoria.\nBut in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, as in Haiti, the determined\naction of the united international community will not\nproduce results unless all parties cooperate in good\nfaith and demonstrate their sense of responsibility. In\nAbidjan as in Bouak\u00e9, all must respect their pledged\ncommitments so that free and transparent elections can\nbe held throughout the country. No other solution is\npossible. That is why it is essential to resolutely\nsupport the electoral process that has begun, as well as\nthe demobilization, disarmament and reintegration\nprogrammes. All Ivorian parties must understand that\nthey will not block the peace efforts with impunity if\nthey take an obstructive stance, make hate speeches or\nchallenge democratic rules. The Security Council will\nmeet its responsibilities.\nThe situation in Lebanon demonstrates what can\nbe accomplished by a determined international\nmobilization, supported by the courageous will of the\npeople. Most Syrian forces have now left Lebanon.\nElections have been held. A representative Government\nhas been formed. Our Organization must continue to\nsupport the Lebanese Government\u2019s efforts to recover\nfull sovereignty and exercise its authority over the\nwhole of its territory. At the same time, we must\ncontinue to support the work of the commission of\ninquiry into the assassination of Rafik Hariri. We are\ndetermined to see justice done.\nAlso with respect to the Middle East, a dynamic\nof hope, which could touch all States of the region, is\nemerging following Israel\u2019s withdrawal from Gaza.\nFrance, together with its European partners, stands\nwith the Palestinians to rebuild and develop that\nterritory so that its inhabitants can move around freely\nand have access to jobs and, quite simply, to decent\nliving conditions.\nBut we must not stop there. It is important to\nrestore political prospects for relaunching\nimplementation of the road map by, on the one hand,\nencouraging the Palestinians to redouble their efforts\non security and, on the other, encouraging the Israelis\nto take the measures necessary to stop settlement\nactivity and to comply with international law in their\n18\n\nstruggle for security. Peace can come only with the\nexistence of two peaceful and democratic States living\nside by side in peace and security.\nFinally, with respect to Iraq, France remains\nengaged so that, with the assistance of the United\nNations in particular, the Iraqi people can acquire\ndemocratic institutions with which all Iraqis can feel\nidentified. It is clear that a policy focused exclusively\non security leads to the retrenchment of a community,\nthus jeopardizing the cohesion of Iraqi society and the\ncountry\u2019s unity. In Iraq, too, the political process must\nnot exclude any representative, peaceful force, and the\npolitical process must offer Iraq the prospect of the\nrestoration of its complete sovereignty.\nIn all those crises, the Security Council has\ngradually imposed the authority of the United Nations\nin the service of international peace and security. Its\naction is legitimate, and its authority will be further\nstrengthened when we reach agreement on an\nenlargement of the Council that reflects the emergence\nof new Powers and which gives an equitable place to\nall continents.\nAt the same time, it is important to carry out the\nthorough management reforms that our Organization\nrequires. In his report entitled \u201cIn larger freedom\u201d\n(A/59/2005), the Secretary-General proposed elements\nof an action plan and initiated the first reforms. I pay\ntribute to his resoluteness and reaffirm France\u2019s\ndetermination to support him in his approach.\nWe all know that security and development\ncannot be separated. Five years after the Millennium\nSummit, heads of State or Government have just issued\na troubling assessment of the implementation of the\nMillennium Development Goals.\nThe outcome document they adopted (resolution\n60/1) clearly sets out the priorities on which we must\ntake action. The first of those sadly remains food\nsecurity, because, as underlined by the Declaration on\nAction Against Hunger and Poverty, adopted in 2004\non the initiative of President Lula and President\nChirac, hunger remains the worst weapon of mass\ndestruction. It continues to kill several hundred million\nmen, women and children around the planet. We can\nsee it happening right now in the Sahel and southern\nAfrica. That scourge belonging to another age can and\nmust be fought.\nOf course, emergency humanitarian aid must be\nprovided to people in distress. That implies\nstrengthening the coordination of United Nations\ninterventions and, in particular, the establishment of an\ninternational humanitarian force, as proposed on\nseveral occasions by France.\nBut beyond that, it is important to provide all\nareas at risk with the technical resources for prevention\nand early warning. Above all, it is essential to create\nthe conditions for sustainable development to the\nbenefit of all. That is the aim of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals, whose attainment requires\nsubstantial long-term financing. Official development\nassistance will continue to be primary for much time to\ncome. The summit\u2019s outcome document recalls the\ninternational commitments made in that regard, which\nFrance and the European Union will respect. It is\nurgent that the other developed countries make the\nsame commitments. But we know well that this will\nnot be sufficient. Additional long-term resources have\nto be found through innovative financing mechanisms.\nFrance endorses the establishment of\ninternational solidarity contributions. Over 66\ncountries have given their support to the pilot project\nto levy a tax on airline tickets, and we welcome this. In\nFebruary, France will host a ministerial conference on\nthis initiative so that it can be implemented specifically\nand promptly.\nBy devoting three of the eight Goals to health, the\nMillennium Declaration has put public health back at\nthe centre of sustainable development. In terms of its\nscope and socio-economic impact, the HIV/AIDS\npandemic is of concern to us all. Only by working\ntogether will we be able to deal with it, through an\napproach that integrates prevention, treatment, care and\nthe medical and social vulnerability of infected\npersons. France wants to carry out this integrated\napproach with its European partners and with the\nWorld Health Organization, the Joint United Nations\nProgram on HIV/AIDS and the Global Fund to Fight\nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. We must do\neverything possible to achieve universal access to\ntreatment by 2010, if need be promoting greater\nflexibility of intellectual property rights as provided for\nin the Doha international trade agreements.\nThe fight against AIDS requires us all to mobilize\nour efforts. For its part, France has pledged to double\nits contribution to the Global Fund, increasing the\n19\n\namount to 300 million euros by 2007. At the same\ntime, international cooperation must take into account\nthe particular challenges faced by certain categories of\nindividuals: victims of abject poverty who are\nexcluded, young women denied the right to sexual and\nreproductive health, those with disabilities\nmarginalized by society.\nFrom the Indian Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico,\nfrom Japan to Antarctica, man is confronted today with\nan unprecedented rise in environmental threats that he\nhimself has caused. Scientific proof of the reality of\nclimate change and its human origins are irrefutable.\nAll initiatives must be compatible with the Kyoto\nProtocol; prospects must be charted for the future of\nthe multilateral climate regime after 2012. France\nwould hope to see more robust commitments,\nespecially regarding the transfer of technologies to\nemerging countries. To respond to the threat and more\neffectively mobilize energies and resources, France and\nEurope have proposed the establishment of a\nspecialized agency, based on the United Nations\nEnvironment Programme, for the purpose of\ncoordinating international action. This idea is\nmentioned in the summit\u2019s outcome document; it must\nnow be translated into reality.\nThe United Nations is commemorating its sixtieth\nanniversary this year. The world has changed\nprofoundly since 1945. Millions of men and women\nhave gained freedom and have emerged from\nunderdevelopment. Technological progress has been\nstaggering and has radically changed the life of society\nand relations among States. Challenges and threats\nhave changed; they are now worldwide and jeopardize\nhumanity itself.\nYet, we must remain optimistic. It is not too late,\ngiven that we understand what is at stake and that we\nmobilize collectively. The United Nations is\nrediscovering the way charted for it by the founding\nfathers: helping in the peaceful settlement of disputes,\nbuilding international cooperation for development and\npromoting human rights.\nWe need the United Nations more than ever; it is\nthe sole framework for universal comprehensive action\nwhich is legitimate and recognized as such by all\nStates. Let us give it our full support. France for its\npart makes this commitment."

        "file_text": "Sixty years ago, our\npredecessors, having adopted the United Nations\nCharter, made sure that the United Nations\nimmediately got down to work. We need to act now\nwith the same urgency.\nIn the face of the profound challenges that\nconfront the world \u2014 some of long standing, some\nnew \u2014 our heads of State and Government last week\nagreed on a far-reaching agenda for change. Although\nthe summit did not achieve all that we had hoped for, it\nis still a major step forward.\nIt is now time for follow-up. On Saturday the\nSecretary-General proposed an accountability pact. He\nundertook to deliver on his obligations but said that\nwe, the Member States, must deliver on ours. That\nrequires real political leadership all round. I here\ncommit Ireland to playing its part.\nThe United Nations has no Member more loyal\nthan Ireland. But we realize that the United Nations\nneeds to change, just as the world around it has\nchanged. This has to be our focus over the next year.\nAnd what we do affects not just us here in this Hall,\nbut billions of our fellow human beings.\nFor the first time in its history, the human race\nhas the capacity to end extreme poverty. The summit\nhas endorsed the Millennium Development Goals\n(MDGs) as the benchmark of progress towards that\nobjective. Ireland will play its full part. Last week, my\nPrime Minister committed Ireland to reaching the 0.7\ntarget by 2012. By that year we will be spending up to\n1.5 billion euros annually. Moreover, our aid will\nremain completely untied and directed towards the\nvery poorest. Africa is, and will continue to be, the\nprimary focus of Ireland\u2019s aid programme.\nOver the past year, we have been tragically\nreminded of human vulnerability in the face of natural\ndisasters. Their causes may be beyond our control, but\nhow we react is in our own hands. Ireland will place an\neven stronger emphasis on emergency and\nhumanitarian relief. In particular, we are urgently\nexamining how we ourselves can improve our own\ncapacity to deliver effective civilian protection in such\ncases.\nConflict resolution is a vital part of the United Nations\nmission. It is not enough to end war. We must win the\npeace. Without coherent peacebuilding strategies,\nvulnerable countries may not escape the cycle of\n17\n\nviolence. From the start, my country has been a leading\nproponent of the Peacebuilding Commission. Now that\nit has been agreed, let us work hard to get it up and\nrunning by the beginning of 2006.\nAt the summit, there was agreement on the vital\nprinciple that the international community should take\naction to prevent genocide, war crimes, ethnic\ncleansing and crimes against humanity when the\nresponsible Governments fail to do so. I hope and pray\nthat such eventualities will never again come to pass.\nBut if they do, we must act in a way which honours\nthat solemn commitment. We have failed grievously in\nthe past and must never do so again.\nThe summit has committed us to strengthening\nthe United Nations human rights machinery. I strongly\nwelcome the decision to double the budget of the\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.\nAnd the decision to establish a Human Rights Council\nwas very positive. Now the General Assembly must\nmove swiftly to flesh out the modalities and the\nstructure. It must be composed and operate in a way\nwhich avoids the failings of the past. But the best\nfeatures of the Commission on Human Rights, such as\nits engagement with civil society, must be retained.\nIreland particularly values the work of human rights\ndefenders in calling Governments to account, and that\nmust continue.\nOnce more, we meet in the shadow of terrorism.\nSo many recent and terrible acts remind us that no\ncountry is immune, as Ireland knows from its own long\nand bitter experiences. We should agree on the\ncomprehensive convention on combating terrorism\nwithout delay during this session of the General\nAssembly. And all existing specific conventions must\nbe fully implemented, and practical cooperation made\nmore effective.\nThe threat of terrorism requires a robust security\nresponse. But that response must be intelligent,\ncalibrated and proportionate. It must respect human\nrights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law. And\nalthough no cause can ever justify terrorism, the\npolitical and social conditions within which it breeds\nmust also be addressed.\nWe cannot ignore the threat posed to our security\nby weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear\nweapons. Ireland was deeply disappointed at the failure\nof the recent Review Conference of the Parties to the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n(NPT). We were equally disappointed at the inability of\nthe summit to make any progress on that absolutely\nvital issue. But we cannot afford to give up hope. The\nlogic in favour of the twin and mutually reinforcing\ngoals of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation\nremains compelling.\nI welcome what appear to be positive\ndevelopments with regard to the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea and salute the leadership of its\nneighbours and the United States in the negotiating\nprocess.\nUnder the NPT, countries have every right to\nchoose the option of civilian nuclear power. But it is\nessential that they do so in full accordance with the\nNPT and under the supervision of the International\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA). International\nconfidence in their exclusively peaceful intent is also\nvital and, where damaged, must be rebuilt in a clear\nand fully verifiable way. With our other European\nUnion partners, Ireland fully supports the efforts of the\nEuropean Union three to achieve that outcome with\nregard to Iran.\nWe must continue to reform the structures of the\nUnited Nations. The need to align the Security Council\nwith today\u2019s realities is widely acknowledged. This\nremains an important piece of unfinished business. We\nmust fulfil our commitment to revitalize the Assembly.\nAnd we need to take a serious look at how the\nEconomic and Social Council can better fulfil its role.\nThe Secretary-General has made clear his\ncommitment to delivering on management reform\nwithin the Organization, as was requested by the\nsummit. Very substantial progress on this question\nmust be made during the present session.\nI would now like to touch on a number of issues\nof specific concern to Ireland.\nIn relation to the Middle East and Iraq, the\nachievement of a lasting peace in the Middle East is of\ngreat importance to the entire world. Here, too,\npolitical will is the crucial ingredient. The initial\ndifficult phase of Israel\u2019s disengagement from\nsettlements in Gaza has taken place peacefully. The\ncourage and the commitment of Prime Minister Sharon\nand his Government have been commendable. Much,\nhowever, remains to be done.\nI welcome the determination of President Abbas\nand his colleagues to take full advantage of the\n18\n\nopportunity presented by the withdrawal. They must,\nwith our help, maintain their efforts to ensure peace,\nsecurity and the rule of law. And disengagement will\ntruly be a success only if Gaza becomes economically\nviable, with free trade and free movement. This is\nclearly in Israel\u2019s interests, as well as in those of the\nPalestinians.\nDisengagement is an important advance. It cannot\nbe the end, but rather a step towards the full\nimplementation of the Quartet\u2019s road map. With the\nsupport and the assistance of the international\ncommunity, both sides must press forward and renew\nmomentum towards a permanent peace. It is also vital\nthat, in particular in relation to the West Bank \u2014 as my\ndelegation has spelled out in detail on many\noccasions \u2014 Israel desist completely from further steps\nwhich could jeopardize the viability of a two-State\nsolution.\nWith respect to Iraq, the people of Iraq face\nappalling challenges from terrorism. Despite that, they\nhave courageously taken steps towards the restoration\nof full democracy and the control of their own destiny.\nThe final decision on the adoption of the draft\nconstitution now rests with the people themselves in\nnext month\u2019s referendum. The international community\nmust do whatever it can to ensure that the vote takes\nplace in a democratic and peaceful way. We have seen\nelsewhere that, no matter how difficult and imperfect\nprogress may be, with political will and the support of\nthe international community, it is possible to move\nforward, away from conflict.\nThe elections yesterday in Afghanistan are a\nfurther welcome milestone in its transition.\nI also commend the excellent progress made in\nAceh. I am proud that Irish soldiers are among those\ntaking part in the monitoring mission run by the\nEuropean Union and the Association of Southeast\nAsian Nations (ASEAN).\nSadly, in Burma-Myanmar, human rights and\ndemocracy continue to be denied. That is most acutely\nsymbolized by the continued detention of the heroic\nAung San Suu Kyi. The cumulative length of her\ndetention now approaches ten years. Her ordeal is not\nforgotten by the people of Ireland. I urge ASEAN, in\nparticular, to demonstrate effective regional leadership\nand to heighten pressure on the regime to release her\nand move along the path of reform.\nAs I said earlier, Ireland is particularly committed\nto Africa. We contribute substantially to development\nand conflict resolution, and we will continue to\nincrease that contribution. But external help can do\nonly so much. In the resolution of various political\ncrises affecting the continent, the key requirement is,\nagain, political leadership and vision.\nWe welcome the recent signing of the\nComprehensive Peace Agreement in the Sudan, which\nmust now be fully implemented. I am encouraged that,\ndespite the tragic and untimely death of Vice-President\nGarang, both sides have reaffirmed their commitment\nto the Agreement.\nHowever, the situation in Darfur continues to be\ndeeply worrying. My Government fully supports the\nAfrican Union\u2019s mission to improve security there. We\nlook forward to early progress in the International\nCriminal Court investigation into human rights\nviolations. The Government of the Sudan and the\nparties in Darfur must renew their efforts to conclude a\ncomprehensive peace agreement by December, and the\ninternational community must continue to support\nefforts led by the United Nations to provide\nhumanitarian assistance.\nI welcome recent progress in the Great Lakes\nregion, in particular in Burundi, where the elected\nrepresentatives have shown generosity of spirit and\ncourage. I look forward to parallel progress in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. Ireland will\ncontribute to support for the electoral process there.\nBut I am seriously concerned at the situation in\nZimbabwe. The downward spiral, which, above all,\nhurts the ordinary people of that nation, must be\nreversed. The Zimbabwean Government should start by\naccepting the recommendations of the Secretary\nGeneral\u2019s Special Envoy.\nTurning to a topic closer to home, in the Northern\nIreland peace process it is also time for renewed\nleadership. There is a real prospect of the full\nimplementation of the Good Friday Agreement \u2014\nwhich was put together in 1998 and voted by the\npeople of Ireland \u2014 and the sustained operation of its\ninstitutions. The British and Irish Governments are\npartners in that endeavour, and we look for others to\njoin us in delivering their promises.\nThe Irish Republican Army took a major and\ncourageous step forward in July. We now expect early\n19\n\nmovement to deliver fully, in a verified and convincing\nway, on its commitment to decommissioning. There is\nno room for fudge and, equally, no room for any\ncontinuation of paramilitarism or criminality. Sinn Fein\nshould also show leadership in moving to support the\nPolice Service of Northern Ireland and to take their\nplace in the governance of policing. The Police Service\nis showing professionalism, courage and even-\nhandedness. The completion of the policing project\nwould represent a profound move towards peace and\npolitical stability, and I call upon Sinn Fein, in\nparticular, to take the hard decisions needed.\nEqually, leadership is needed from within the\nUnionist community. When the IRA\u2019s commitments are\nfully delivered and verified, then the way will be clear\nfor renewed political discussions by all parties on the\nreactivation of the Northern Ireland institutions. The\nUnionist parties say they are prepared to share power,\nwhen it is clear that the threat of violence has been\nremoved once and for all. It should soon be time for\nthem to demonstrate that good faith.\nI also look to the Unionist community to show\ndetermination in condemning and doing all it can to\ndiscourage the continuation of the appalling\nlawlessness, which has in recent times so badly\naffected both loyalist communities and their vulnerable\nnationalist neighbours. The need for political\nleadership is so urgent precisely because the prospect\nof decisive progress is so real and so alluring.\nFollowing the summit, we have a collective\nresponsibility to grasp the opportunity to reinvigorate\nthe United Nations. If we fail, our peoples today and in\nthe future will not judge us kindly.\nIreland gives its full backing to the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s proposals for change. I personally was\nhonoured to act as one of his envoys, because, like\nhim, we recognized that the United Nations was at a\nfork in the road. At the summit, we chose to start down\nthe right track, but there is a long way to travel. I\npledge again that over the year ahead Ireland will\nremain at the forefront of the drive for reform and\nrenewal."

        "file_text": "I\nam very pleased, Mr. President, on behalf of the\ndelegation of the Niger, to express our warmest\ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of\nthe sixtieth session of the General Assembly. In\nelecting you, we recognize your outstanding qualities\nas a diplomat and as an active player on the ground -\nqualities that augur well for the success of the present\nsession. Rest assured, Sir, that you will have the full\nsupport of my delegation. We wish you every success\nin accomplishing your task.\nTo your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Jean\nPing, I wish to express our appreciation and our\ngratitude for the wisdom, skill and insight with which\nhe guided the work of our previous session and\nprepared for the High-level Plenary Meeting.\nTo Secretary-General Kofi Annan, I wish to pay a\nwell-deserved tribute for the decisive role he has\nplayed at the head of our Organization. We pledge our\nunswerving support for his efforts to reform the United\nNations system and adapt it to the concerns of today.\nNeed we recall the historic nature of our session?\nIt is taking place exactly 10 years after the Declaration\nand Platform for Action were adopted by the Fourth\nWorld Conference on Women in Beijing and the\nProgramme of Action was adopted by the World\nSummit for Social Development in Copenhagen. The\nSecretary-General, in his important report entitled \\\"In\nlarger freedom: towards development, security and human\nrights for all\\\"\u009d (A/59/2005), made a comprehensive\ndiagnosis of the multiform and interdependent threats\nand challenges facing the world and, at the same time,\nmade interesting recommendations to deal with them.\nEqually historic is the outcome document (resolution\n60/1) of the High-level Plenary Meeting, which we just\nadopted. It is a source of great hope in our arduous\nefforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.\nAmong those threats and challenges, to which I shall\nrefer again presently, are terrorism, the inequalities of\nthe international economic and trade system, and\nviolations of human rights.\nTerrorism continues to rage throughout the world,\nseriously threatening international peace and security.\nThe recent attacks in London and Sharm el-Sheikh\nattest eloquently to that fact. The fight against this\nscourge must therefore be strengthened and carried out\nover the long term, but within the framework of\ninternational law. In that regard, we believe it is crucial\nto accelerate the process of elaborating an international\nconvention to fight terrorism. Such a convention\nshould define the concept clearly to avoid ambiguity.\nMoreover, the fight against terrorism cannot be\neffective and fruitful without appropriate international\ncooperation. It is because of such cooperation - which\nhas enabled us to strengthen the capacities of our defence\nand security forces - that my country has recently had\nconsiderable success in combating this phenomenon.\nPeace and security also require the adoption of\neffective measures against the proliferation of weapons\nin general. Here, I welcome the initiative of the\nEconomic Community of West African States - which\nthe Niger currently chairs - aimed at establishing a\nlegally binding instrument: its moratorium on the\nmanufacture, import and export of weapons. That\napproach has led us to regret the failure at the most\nrecent review conference of the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\nToday, international peace and security are being\nsorely tested by a steadily rising number of conflicts,\nsome of which seem to be endless quagmires because\nof their persistence and recurrence. In West Africa,\nalthough some hotbeds of tension are in the process of\nbeing defused - such as in Sierra Leone, Liberia and\nGuinea-Bissau - the subregion is still not completely\n20\n\nfree of insecurity and instability. We hope for positive\ndevelopments in Cote d'Ivoire that will permit a swift\nreturn to normalcy in that country, formerly a harbour\nof peace and prosperity.\nIn Western Sahara, the Niger reaffirms its support\nfor the Secretary-General's efforts to bring about a just\nand lasting settlement of the conflict in accordance\nwith the relevant United Nations resolutions.\nIn Burundi, we welcome the positive outcome of\nthe peace process culminating in the legislative and\npresidential elections.\nPeace must not only be re-established and\nmaintained; it must also be consolidated. In that regard,\nthe Secretary-General's proposal concerning the\ncreation of a Peacebuilding Commission is of capital\nimportance, in that it will enable many countries\nemerging from conflict to break the vicious circle of\nviolence and devastation.\nConcerning the Middle East, my country wishes\nto reaffirm once again that settlement of the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict necessarily depends upon the\nrealization of the rights of the Palestinian people,\nincluding the creation of an independent, sovereign and\nviable State. In that regard, Israel's withdrawal from\nthe Gaza Strip is a positive step that, we hope, will\npermit the resumption of negotiations within the\nframework of the road map.\nWith regard to Jammu and Kashmir, we remain\nconvinced that the relevant United Nations resolutions\nmust be implemented to enable the Kashmiri people to\nexercise their right to self-determination. That should\nfurther reduce the tensions between India and Pakistan.\nThe Niger, a member of the contact group of the\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference on that issue,\nencourages the two parties to move forward in their\ntalks aimed at a definitive settlement of this problem.\nThis year, as we assess the progress made in\nhonouring the commitments made at the Millennium\nSummit, the outcome document of the High-level\nPlenary Meeting, which we just adopted, once again\nemphasizes the interdependence of States and\nhighlights the need for increased solidarity. To that\nend, solidarity and international cooperation must,\nmore than ever before, go beyond professions of faith\nif they are to be more effective. In any event, solidarity\nmust no longer be infinitely variable, as is\nunfortunately the case today.\nThe Niger, recently the victim of an acute food\ncrisis, would like international solidarity to be\nrethought so that we can invest in the future by\nimplementing lasting solutions that will ensure\npermanent food security for our people. Without a\nrethought solidarity, many African countries, including\nmine, may unfortunately never be able to achieve the\nMillennium Development Goals by 2015. That would\nrequire an increase in official development assistance,\nfrom both a qualitative and a quantitative perspective.\nIn that regard, we welcome the decision of those\ndeveloped countries that have elaborated a timetable\nenabling them to achieve the set objective of 0.7 per\ncent of their gross domestic product by 2015. A\nrethought solidarity would also require the\nestablishment of innovative financing sources that\nwould not place an excessive burden on developing\ncountries.\nWe welcome the recent decisions taken by\npartners, particularly the Group of Eight and the\nEuropean Union. We urge the international community\nand the United Nations to further strengthen their\ncooperation with the New Partnership for Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\nDevelopment and with new initiatives for Africa,\nincluding the Blair Commission's International\nFinance, Facility, President Bush's Millennium\nChallenge Account and the Chirac-Lula initiative.\nWith regard to international trade, we hope that\nthe multilateral negotiations under way will lead to\nmutually advantageous results by 2006, as planned.\nHowever, in the interest of mutual and shared\ndevelopment, there must be an end to all agricultural\nsubsidies on exports. In that regard, the Hong Kong\nMinisterial Conference planned for December is a\ncrucial event for us that, once again, should be\nattended with this rethought solidarity in mind,\nparticularly with regard to the poorest countries.\nConcerning institutional reform of the United\nNations, my country wishes to pay tribute to the far-\nsightedness of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\nin identifying the stakes of such reform and in making\nhis interesting and important recommendations.\nThe Niger is fully committed to the role played\nby Africa in the international arena. That collective\ncommitment has led us to forge a common position on\nUnited Nations reform, which my country\nwholeheartedly supports. In fact, our continent, whose\nimportance is more apparent every day, must pursue\n21\n\nwith determination and in unity its fight for the\ndemocratization of international relations.\nThe United Nations is the only world body with\nthe mandate of addressing issues of security,\ndevelopment and human rights. To be equal to that\nimmense and delicate mission, it must be fair,\nrepresentative and democratic. It must also base its\nactions on multilateralism and consultation,\nparticularly within the General Assembly.\nThe long-awaited reform of the Security Council\nmust be pursued in transparency so that a renewed\nUnited Nations can be more democratic and more\nrepresentative of today's world.\nThe Economic and Social Council, for its part,\nmust be the forum for coordinating and drafting\nstrategies so that the excellent opportunities created in\nthis increasingly globalized world will also be\naccessible to the poorest countries.\nThe establishment of a Peacebuilding\nCommission has filled a significant void, because it\nconstitutes a formerly non-existent link between\nsecurity and development.\nWe welcome the creation of the Human Rights\nCouncil, based on the principles of universality and\nnon-exclusion. These are the prerequisites for\nstrengthening and improving our shared House."

        "file_text": "I should like, on\nbehalf of my delegation and of the Government and the\npeople of the Republic of Mauritius, to congratulate\nyou, Sir, on your election as President of the General\nAssembly at its sixtieth session. We are confident that\nyou will be able to discharge the responsibilities\nentrusted to you. I want to assure you, as I did during\nour meeting this morning, of my delegation\u2019s fullest\ncooperation during your tenure of office.\nI would also like to convey my delegation\u2019s\ngratitude and appreciation to Mr. Jean Ping of Gabon\nfor the outstanding manner in which he conducted the\naffairs of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth\nsession. As Africans, we are proud of his exemplary\nstewardship.\nMy delegation also wishes to express its\nappreciation for the tireless and dedicated efforts of the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, in leading the\nOrganization in these challenging times.\nThe very first words of the United Nations\nCharter \u2014 \u201cWe the peoples of the United Nations\u201d \u2014\nare of overwhelming significance. They imply that\npeople should be the primary beneficiaries of every\nresolution that we adopt and every programme that we\nlaunch. As we engage in this debate, we should ask\nourselves whether we have, indeed, put the peoples at\nthe centre of all of our deliberations and activities.\nHave we done enough to ensure that ordinary people,\nmen and women, young and old, benefit from all our\ninitiatives and actions, collective as well as individual?\nLast Friday, by adopting the outcome document,\nleaders of the world renewed their pledge to save\nhumanity from the scourge of war, fear, disease, famine\nand poverty. The citizens of the world were witness to\nthe sober promises we made in it. They now wait, in\nearnest, to see concrete results. We are therefore\nrequired to muster the collective political will to\nmobilize the necessary resources to fulfil those\npledges.\nThe wealthy and powerful North should assist the\nless fortunate countries, which require assistance to\nhelp propel them into the orbit of irreversible\nsustainable social and economic growth. For its part,\nthe South must devote energy and show creativity as it\nengages in a common effort to attain social\ndevelopment and human security.\nThe spirit of teamwork and partnership which\nresulted in the successful outcome of the United\nNations world summit should allow us to adopt a fresh\nmindset that places the interests, security and welfare\nof our peoples at the centre of our socio-economic\npolicies. That cannot be done without promoting\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms.\nIn our efforts to pursue people-centred\ndevelopment, we must put a premium on tackling those\nnational and transnational issues that have a direct\nimpact on people\u2019s welfare. Lifting peoples out of\nabject poverty and endowing them with appropriate\nmeans to lead productive lives is the best guarantee for\nlong-term sustained social stability, which, in turn, will\nensure prosperity and international peace. Poverty\nreduction and eradication must therefore remain at the\ncore of all development efforts towards a just and\nequitable order.\nIn keeping with our democratic tradition, just\nthree months ago, the people of my country voted,\noverwhelmingly, for a change of Government.\nImmediately upon assuming office, my Government\nhas formulated development strategies based on the\npremise that economic and social policies must\nsubserve the primacy of the people, in particular the\npoor. In fact, the fundamental principle of my\nGovernment\u2019s policy is putting the people first. My\nGovernment believes that the fullest possible\nparticipation of the people in the development process\nis the best guarantee for the success of any growth\nstrategy.\nThe first set of social decisions taken by my\nGovernment, with that in mind, has been to expand the\nwelfare State to cover free transportation for students\nand the elderly as well as to restore old-age pensions\nfor all citizens. My Government's overriding objective\nis ultimately to make the economy work for the people,\nnot to make the people work for the economy.\nMy delegation believes that assisting developing\ncountries through increased official development\nassistance (ODA) is crucial; but it is only a palliative,\nnot a remedy. Aid without trade would be not only\nunsustainable but, indeed, self-defeating. Trade is, and\nwill always remain, the recognized engine of economic\ngrowth and development. Developing countries\ncontinue to face impediments in their efforts to attain\nsustained economic growth. Tariff and non-tariff\nbarriers in developed countries, combined with the\n10\n\nnon-implementation of commitments undertaken with\nrespect to development financing and debt alleviation\nfor developing countries, further aggravate the\nsituation. We call on the international community to\ndemonstrate the political will necessary to ensure that\nthe Doha development round truly takes into account\nthose concerns so as to achieve a fair and equitable\nglobal trading system for the benefits of our people.\nMy delegation welcomes the particular attention\ngiven by the world summit to the special needs of\nAfrica. While many countries throughout the world\nhave made significant progress in lifting their people\nout of poverty, for many others \u2014 mainly in\nsub-Saharan Africa \u2014 poverty, hunger, illiteracy,\ninfectious diseases and the incidence of HIV/AIDS,\nunemployment and environmental degradation\ncontinue to take a heavy toll. My delegation therefore\nappreciates the resolve of the international community\nto address those issues and emphasizes the need for\ntimely implementation of the relevant measures.\nDespite significant efforts that have resulted in\npeace in several parts of Africa, the continent\ncontinues to suffer from violent conflicts and\nhumanitarian crises. The plight of displaced people \u2014\nespecially women and children \u2014 in those conflict\nsituations and in refugee camps needs to be urgently\naddressed. My delegation wishes to underscore the\nimportance of enhanced measures to protect vulnerable\ngroups, especially women and children, during and\nafter armed conflicts.\nIn our own region, Mauritius continues to remain\nactively engaged in the reconciliation process in the\nComoros. We are presently coordinating the\npreparations to host a donor round table for the\nComoros later this year. The importance of the meeting\ncannot be overstated. We urge the donor community to\ncontribute to this process for the benefit of the people\nof the Comoros.\nThe situation in the Middle East is seeing some\ntangible progress. We welcome the process of Israeli\ndisengagement from Gaza and the northern West Bank,\nand we commend the efforts of the President of the\nPalestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, to find a\npeaceful and lasting solution to the conflict. We urge\nboth the Israeli and the Palestinian peoples to continue\nthe much-needed confidence-building measures so as\nto achieve a just and lasting peace.\nWith regard to Iraq, where innocent civilians are\nfalling victim to violence on a daily basis, it is\nimperative that necessary support be provided to\nensure the creation of an environment in which the\nIraqi people can live in peace and security.\nI spoke extensively on terrorism in the statement\nI made on 15 September 2005 during the High-level\nPlenary Meeting. I wish to reaffirm my country's\ncommitment to fully cooperate with the international\ncommunity to fight the scourge of terrorism, which has\na direct and indirect effect on the lives of ordinary and\ninnocent people.\nAt a time when there is a global consensus\nregarding the need to build a more secure world, it is a\nmatter of the greatest regret that the 2005 Review\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons failed to\nachieve a conclusive outcome. The proliferation of\nnuclear weapons poses a grave risk of fissile material\nfalling into the wrong hands. That eventuality is too\nhorrendous to contemplate. The devastation that could\nbe caused by so-called low-yield nuclear weapons is\nunimaginable.\nMauritius advocates the eventual complete\nelimination of all nuclear weapons on the basis of a\ncomprehensive and non-discriminatory disarmament\nregime. To demonstrate once again its full commitment\nto non-proliferation and to international peace and\nsecurity, Mauritius recently signed the Additional\nProtocol of the International Atomic Energy Agency.\nMauritius welcomes the agreement reached in\nJune 2005 in New York on a politically binding\ninternational instrument on the tracing of small arms\nand light weapons, which will no doubt assist in\ncombating the illicit trade in such weapons. That\nrepresents a significant step in ensuring that our\npeoples live in a safer world.\nAs regards reform of the Security Council, I wish\nto refer to my statement on 15 September 2005\noutlining the position of Mauritius on that issue. We\nhave a unique opportunity for substantial reform; it\nmust not be squandered. It is imperative that Africa\nand India, the world's largest democracies, should find\ntheir rightful place in such reform. A reformed Security\nCouncil should reflect the present geopolitical realities\nto meet the aspirations of all our peoples.\n11\n\nThe United Nations is a vital forum in which\nStates, large and small, wealthy and less fortunate, can\nhave their voices heard. It also provides a framework\nfor collective action on the basis of consensus\npartnership and mutual understanding. I wish to\nreiterate the appeal I made, as Chair of the Alliance of\nSmall Island States, to our friends and partners at the\nspecial session on financing for development to\ncontinue to assist the small island developing States in\ntheir sustainable development efforts through the\nproper and effective implementation of the Mauritius\nStrategy.\nRegional cooperation is an important means for\ndeveloping and strengthening the economies of\ndeveloping countries. To that end, we have made\nmodest but encouraging progress with respect to\nregional integration. Mauritius pursues an active policy\nof integration through subregional organizations such\nas the Southern African Development Community, the\nCommon Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, the\nIndian Ocean Commission and the Indian Ocean Rim-\nAssociation for Regional Cooperation. While relations\nwith our traditional development and trade partners\ncontinue to feature prominently in the foreign policy of\nMauritius, we intend to take vigorous steps towards the\ndevelopment of strategic partnerships with member\nStates of the South Asian Association for Regional\nCooperation and of the Association of Southeast Asian\nNations, as well as with Latin American countries.\nAllow me to reiterate before the Assembly our\nlegitimate sovereignty claim over the Chagos\nArchipelago, including the island of Diego Garcia,\nwhich was detached by the United Kingdom from the\nterritory of Mauritius prior to our independence, in\nviolation of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of\n1960 and resolution 2066 (XX)  of 1965. The people of\nthe Chagos Archipelago, who were evicted from the\nislands, are still struggling for their right to return to\ntheir birthplace. We reiterate our call to the United\nKingdom to pursue discussions with us for an early\nsettlement of this issue. Likewise, we  appeal to the\nFrench Government to expedite the process of\nresolving the issue of the sovereignty of Tromelin\nthrough dialogue in the spirit of friendship and trust\nthat has always characterized our relationship.\n(spoke in French)\nHere, I should like to say a few words in French\nto show my country\u2019s attachment to and respect for\ncultures and languages in all their diversity. Some of\nthose languages, including French, have been\nbequeathed to us by history.\nPeople have struggled throughout history to live\nbetter, but humankind continues to suffer. That remains\ntrue, unfortunately, for the developing countries, and\nthose of the African continent in particular. The dawn\nof the third millennium has seen the expansion of\nassistance projects, including the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals, to improve the fate of the weak\nand impoverished. We are committed to reducing\nextreme poverty and hunger by 2015.\nThe International Organization of la\nFrancophonie, as announced in November 2004 at its\ntenth summit in Ouagadougou, is involved in that\nglobal struggle. We need to reinvent ourselves, get off\nthe beaten track, and find new ways to attain our\nobjectives as soon as possible. In that respect, we\nwelcome the contribution of the French-speaking\nfamily in that joint action.\n(spoke in English)\nFrom this very rostrum 37 years ago, when\nMauritius acceded to United Nations membership in\n1968, Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, then Prime\nMinister and father of the Mauritian nation, firmly\nadvocated a secure, stable and just world:\n\u201c[M]en of goodwill are constantly trying to find a\nformula by which the underprivileged can banish\ninequality and fear and aspire to a place in the\nsun.\u201d (A/PV.1643, para. 100)\nToday, those aspirations are more valid than ever\nas the comity of nations engages in the quest for\nfreedom from want, freedom from fear and the freedom\nto live in dignity. Providing mankind with those\nfreedoms remains the primary goal of the United\nNations.\nIn that spirit, I wish to announce that my\nGovernment has made a commitment in the Clinton\nGlobal Initiative to organizing an international\nconference on poverty and development, which will be\nresults-oriented.\nToday, as we celebrate the sixtieth year of its\nexistence, let us strive to become what we were always\nmeant to be \u2014 a truly representative body of \u201cWe the\npeoples of the United Nations\u201d, acting in defence of\ntheir welfare and the advancement of their interests\n12\n\nabove all else. That must remain our unflinching\nobjective, and Mauritius pledges to fully play its part\nin that noble endeavour."

        "file_text": "Let me begin by\ncongratulating the President of the fifty-ninth session\nof the General Assembly, His Excellency Mr. Jean\nPing, for his tireless efforts in the lead-up to the\nsummit meeting and for his contribution to the\nelaboration and adoption of the outcome document\n(resolution 60/1). Mongolia considers the outcome\ndocument, with all its omissions, to be another\nimportant milestone in forging global consensus on\ndevelopment, and pledges to contribute its modest\nshare to the successful implementation of the\ncommitments contained therein. In this connection, I\nwould also like to commend our Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his leadership and vision and to\nwish him well in his bold reform activities. I also\nwarmly congratulate Mr. Jan Eliasson on his well-\ndeserved election to the presidency and express our\nconfidence that his skill, experience and intimate\nknowledge of the matters at hand will enable us to\nsuccessfully follow through on the commitments made\nby our leaders last week in this Assembly.\nMongolia is poised to achieve most of its\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) on education,\ngender, child and maternal health and combating\nvarious diseases by 2015. Capitalizing on its 1990s\nsystem of public health and education and a traditional\nculture of gender equality, Mongolia is well on track to\nachieve, by 2015, universal primary education and\nliteracy, eliminate gender disparity at all levels of\neducation, and reduce its child mortality rate by two\nthirds and maternal mortality rate by three fourths.\nHowever, the most important goal of halving poverty\nby 2015 looks highly elusive, if not unachievable, at\nthe moment. Aware of its responsibility for its own\ndevelopment, Mongolia has, by and large, managed its\npublic finances responsibly and maintained\nmacroeconomic stability. It has done its utmost to\nadopt and implement sound national policies and\ndevelopment strategies and to introduce good\ngovernance and the rule of law.\nYet, like many other small, vulnerable and\ncommodity-dependent economies, Mongolia\u2019s\ndevelopment is severely handicapped by many factors\nwell beyond its control. Skyrocketing oil prices, for\ninstance, are taking a serious toll on economic growth,\nengulfing whatever gains we made earlier on, and are\nexposing already vulnerable societies to increased\nhardship and uncertainty. Many frustrated oil-\nimporting developing countries have articulated a\nnumber of interesting ideas during this general debate,\nand we urge the international financial institutions and\nthe oil producers to heed our collective appeal.\nLast week world leaders once again reaffirmed\ntheir commitment to address the special needs of the\nlandlocked countries and their special difficulties in\nintegrating into multilateral trading systems. Full,\ntimely and effective implementation of the Almaty\nProgramme of Action and the Sao Paulo Consensus\nadopted at the eleventh session of the United Nations\nConference on Trade and Development will provide a\nsignificant boost to the development and poverty\n19\n\nreduction efforts of the landlocked countries, including\nMongolia. Mongolia spends a significant portion of its\ngross domestic product (GDP) on transit transportation\nand insurance costs through its two neighbours, Russia\nand China, roughly double the transportation costs of\nother developing countries. Since 1998, Mongolia has\nbeen negotiating with these two neighbours on a\nframework agreement on transit transport to reduce\ntransit transportation costs and related cumbersome\nprocedures, both in crossing the land border and in\ntrans-shipment at ports. Six rounds of talks ended for\nthe most part inconclusively, but we hope that with the\nrenewed commitment of our leaders to the Almaty\nDeclaration, agreement will be within our collective\nreach.\nMongolia is a small economy, highly vulnerable\nto commodity market fluctuations and weather and\nclimatic conditions. The call made in the Summit\nOutcome document (resolution 60/1) on the need to\nsupport the efforts of commodity-dependent countries\nto restructure, diversify and strengthen the\ncompetitiveness of their commodity sectors merits a\nswift response from the international community. In\nthis regard, I wish to draw the attention of this\nAssembly to the important recommendations derived\nfrom the Multi-Stakeholder Consultations organized by\nthe New Rules for the Global Finance Coalition in\npreparation for the summit. Recommendations include\ncommodity price arrangements and stabilization tools\nand the establishment of a rapid-responding,\noverarching, grant-financed shocks facility for low-\nincome commodity-dependent countries. Immediate\nestablishment of such a facility would make a tangible\ncontribution to our efforts to reduce poverty.\nMongolia is highly susceptible to natural\ndisasters, which cause loss of life and extensive\ndamage to its economy. In addition, desertification,\ndeforestation and soil erosion hamper our development\nefforts. We urge the international community to\nredouble its efforts to address these trans-boundary\nthreats collectively. For our part, we will continue to\ntake specific measures in combating desertification, in\nusing land resources properly and in protecting forests\nby introducing and implementing special protective\nstrategies.\nDespite an encouraging increase in official\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) in recent years, after a\ndecade of steady decline, the world is still well short of\nachieving the long-standing target of 0.7 per cent of\nGDP. We are encouraged that the war against poverty\nwill now be waged more aggressively with the\ncommitment of the world leaders to increase ODA to\ndeveloping countries by $50 billion a year by the year\n2010. However, it is imperative to increase the aid\nquantity to a sufficient level to make multiple\ninvestments in the health, education and economic\ninfrastructure needed to break cycles of deprivation\nand ensure sustained growth. Furthermore, the quality\nof aid has to be improved, as per the principles of the\nParis Declaration on Aid Effectiveness of March 2005,\nwith a particular emphasis on providing stable and\npredictable multi-year financing, and with a focus on\ndevelopment goals, mutual accountability, building\ninstitutional capacity, untying aid, reducing transaction\ncosts and bureaucratic procedures and increasing the\nrecipient\u2019s ownership of aid.\nMongolia fully endorses the recommendation of\nthe Secretary-General that, starting in 2005, developing\ncountries with sound, transparent and accountable\nnational strategies should receive a sufficient increase\nin aid, of sufficient quality and timeliness to enable\nthem to achieve their Millennium Development Goals.\nIn addition, new and innovative sources of financing,\nincluding an International Finance Facility, quick-\nimpact initiatives and debt-conversion for MDG\nimplementation projects should urgently be put in\nplace.\nMongolia, for one, resolves to introduce free\nschool lunches, starting with those for primary\nschoolchildren, as a quick-impact initiative.\nDespite the importance of aid for developing\ncountries, trade and investment play a pivotal role in\nensuring sustainable development. According to the\n2005 Human Development Report, trade barriers faced\nby developing countries exporting to developed\ncountries are three to four times higher than those\nfaced by developed countries when they trade with\neach other. The current multilateral trade negotiations\nhave not produced a tangible outcome that would meet\nour expectations from the Doha development agenda.\nThe Doha Round, to be successful, should result in\nestablishing fairer and more favourable terms of trade\nfor developing countries, especially those with special\nneeds, in the form of enhanced and predictable market\naccess and assistance in building productive and trade\ncapacities. Mongolia appreciates the decision of the\nEuropean Union to provide duty-free access to over\n7,200 goods from small and vulnerable economies,\n20\n\nincluding Mongolia, under the special Generalized\nSystem of Preferences Plus scheme. Increased and\nbetter access means that more families will be able to\nleave destitution and poverty behind.\nThe Summit Outcome emphasized once again the\nimportance of a timely, effective, comprehensive and\ndurable solution to the debt problems of developing\ncountries. In assessing the eligibility of countries for\ndebt relief, we urge the donor community not to limit\nitself to mere statistics or rigid categorizations such as\n\u201cleast developed countries\u201d. Debt relief should be\nconsidered comprehensively, taking into account the\nhistory and impact of the debt on the development of\nthe recipient country and its actual capacity to repay.\nMany of these factors were taken into account when\nMongolia negotiated its debt repayment with Russia. I\nwould like to take this opportunity to express from this\npodium the gratitude of my Government to the\nGovernment of the Russian Federation for its display\nof solidarity and political and economic pragmatism in\nresolving this issue, so important for us.\nWe believe that education is an engine for\ndevelopment, a guarantee of the respect for human\nrights and a pillar of democracy. Mongolia has made\nsubstantial efforts in the second half of the last century\nto develop its education system. As a result, the adult\nliteracy rate has reached 97.8 per cent. Nonetheless,\ntaking stock of our recent past, we have drawn lessons\nso as to further improve the deliverables of the\neducation system. Stronger emphasis is now placed on\nvocational and technical training, the quality of\neducation, addressing functional illiteracy against the\nbackdrop of the rapid advance of information and\ncommunications technology and the universal usage of\nEnglish. These policy measures are taken in\naccordance with the Dakar Framework for Action and\nthe United Nations Literacy Decade.\nMongolia welcomes the strong focus on human\nrights, rule of law and democracy in the Summit\nOutcome. Democracy and rule of law are not part of a\nstate of affairs that can be arranged or introduced\novernight. We believe that fostering democracy and\nrule of law is a continuous process, and we hope that\nthis long-term, sustained approach will prevail in the\nactivities of United Nations institutions. We support\nthe efforts of the United Nations to make democracy a\nuniversal environment for global governance. We\nbelieve that the United Nations Democracy Fund is an\nimportant product in the overall reform process, as it\nhighlights the importance of democracy and the role of\nthe Organization. Mongolia believes that the Fund\nshould serve as a vital instrument to assist Member\nStates in the consolidation of democracy and\nimplementation of their commitments, including the\nUlaanbaatar Declaration and Plan of Action adopted at\nthe fifth International Conference of New or Restored\nDemocracies in 2003 and approved by the General\nAssembly in its resolution 58/13.\nWe all agree that the United Nations must be\nstrengthened to meet the challenges of the new\nmillennium. This will be an all-encompassing task that\nwould involve system-wide reform of the Organization\nto bring it in line with the realities of our era,\nincluding, where necessary, changes in composition,\nmandates, procedures and working methods of the\nprincipal and subsidiary organs, the various\nprogrammes and funds, as well as the establishment of\nnew or reinvigoration of existing bodies. Overall,\nUnited Nations assistance needs to be focused, results-\noriented and tailored to the priority development needs\nof the countries concerned. It has to be designed to\nbring a tangible and speedy impact on the lives of\nordinary people and to help them escape the trap of\npoverty and live in dignity, free from want.\nAccountability, oversight, management performance\nand transparency of the Secretariat must be brought to\na new level of efficiency, professionalism and ethical\nconduct on a par with the best corporate governance\npractices.\nMongolia supports the idea of empowering the\nSecretary-General, the chief administrative officer of\nthe United Nations, with greater authority and\nflexibility in administering the work of the\nOrganization in line with the Charter\u2019s provisions. All\ntoo often, sound management reforms proposed by the\nSecretary-General have been stalled by us, the Member\nStates.\nIn conclusion, Mr. President, let me voice\nMongolia's confidence that we collectively will\nsucceed in reforming our world Organization, and the\nrenewed and reinvigorated United Nations will be\nbetter equipped to address effectively the manifold\nchallenges that lie ahead."

        "file_text": "I should like\nto extend my warmest congratulations to you, Sir,\nAmbassador Jan Eliasson of Sweden, on your\nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly\nat its sixtieth session. I should also like to express\nfraternal greetings to Secretary-General Kofi Annan,\nwhose wisdom and commitment to multilateralism\nhave made an immense contribution to progress here at\nthe United Nations. Minister Jean Ping of Gabon\ndeserves special recognition for the competent and\ndedicated manner in which he presided over the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session.\nThis is a rare and historic opportunity to promote\nchange; let us not waste it. Peace, development,\ndemocracy and respect for human rights are objectives\nthat unite us. Reform must be our motto.\nThe final document adopted yesterday at the\nsummit (resolution 60/1) has unquestionably fallen\nshort of our expectations. However, it provides us with\nguidelines that will enable us to carry out our work.\nThe General Assembly must be strengthened.\nMore than ever, we need a forum with universal\nrepresentation, in which the crucial issues of today\u2019s\nworld can be democratically debated. The General\nAssembly must provide leadership and political\nguidance to the Organization as a whole. In supporting\nthe authority of the General Assembly by enabling it to\nact more speedily and be more productive, we are\nsupporting the very essence of the United Nations.\nThe Economic and Social Council must again\nbecome a dynamic and influential organ. It must help\nus to come together on issues related to trade, finance\nand development in an environment free from\nprejudice and dogma. The Economic and Social\nCouncil should be a privileged, deliberative forum in\nour quest for reconciliation between the objectives of\nsustainable economic growth and the reduction of the\ninequalities caused by asymmetric globalization.\nPresident Lula suggested this year, at the summit of the\nGroup of Eight (G-8) at Gleneagles, that we could start\nraising the profile of the Economic and Social Council\nby organizing a high-level segment, with the\nparticipation of the Finance Minister of the country\nholding the G-8 presidency. The Economic and Social\nCouncil must also help to promote peace and stability\nin partnership with the Security Council, as provided\nfor in Article 65 of the Charter.\nThe establishment of a Peacebuilding\nCommission will bridge an important institutional gap.\nIt will be a link between security and development.\nCurrently, there is no such link.\nThe structures and mechanisms of the\nOrganization in the human rights field must be\nimproved and reinforced. We support the creation of a\nHuman Rights Council, based on the principles of\nuniversality, dialogue and non-selectivity. The\nelaboration of an annual global report on human rights\nby the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights, covering all\ncountries and situations, will help to increase the\ncredibility of the United Nations human rights system.\nThe Secretary-General has called for better\ncoordination in our work to protect victims of grave\nand systematic violations of human rights.\nInternational cooperation in the field of human rights\nand humanitarian assistance must be guided by the\nprinciple of collective responsibility. We have\nmaintained on several occasions \u2014 in our region and\nelsewhere \u2014 that the principle of non-intervention in\nthe domestic affairs of States must be associated with\nthe idea of \u201cnon-indifference\u201d.\nWe have been called upon to deal with new\nconcepts, such as human security and the responsibility\nto protect. We agree that they merit a proper place in\nour system. But it is an illusion to believe that we can\ncombat the dysfunctional politics at the root of grave\nhuman rights violations by military means alone, or\neven by economic sanctions, without fully utilizing\ndiplomacy and persuasion.\nHuman security is mainly the result of just and\nequitable societies that promote and protect human\nrights, strengthen democracy and respect the rule of\nlaw, while creating opportunities for economic\ndevelopment and social justice. The United Nations\n6\n\nwas not created to disseminate the notion that order\nshould be imposed by force. That extreme expedient\ncan be considered only when all other efforts have\nbeen exhausted and peaceful solutions have proved not\nto be viable. A judgement as to the existence of such\nexceptional circumstances must always be a\nmultilateral one.\nThe Charter foresees two situations in which the\nuse of force is permissible: to restore or maintain\ninternational peace and security, and in the case of the\nright to self-defence. Mixing those two concepts would\nblur the meaning of the very tenets of this\nOrganization.\nSecurity Council reform is the centrepiece of the\nreform process in which we are engaged. The vast\nmajority of Member States recognize the need to make\nthe Security Council more representative and\ndemocratic.\nAt this historic juncture, no Security Council\nreform effort will be meaningful unless it contemplates\nan increase in the number of permanent and non-\npermanent seats, with developing countries from\nAfrica, Latin America and Asia included in both\ncategories. We cannot accept the perpetuation of\nimbalances that run contrary to the very spirit of\nmultilateralism.\nAbove all, a more efficient Council must be\ncapable of ensuring that its decisions are implemented.\nIt is not reasonable to expect the Council to continue to\nexpand its agenda and responsibilities without\naddressing its democracy deficit.\nTwo years ago, President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da\nSilva declared before the Assembly that every nation\nthat is committed to democracy at the domestic level\nmust strive for more transparent, legitimate and\nrepresentative decision-making processes in its\nexternal relations. In the same spirit, Secretary-General\nKofi Annan pointed out the contradictions to be\novercome, stating:\n\u201cWe are the ones who go around the world\nlecturing everybody about democracy. I think it is\nabout time we apply it to ourselves, and then\nshow that there is effective representation\u201d.\nWe are still far from accomplishing the goals of\nthe Millennium Declaration. This week\u2019s summit has\nstressed the importance of a renewed commitment to\ndevelopment assistance and contributed to promoting\nuniversal acceptance of the target of 0.7 per cent of\ngross national product devoted to official development\nassistance. At the same time, we must continue to work\non innovative and additional sources of financing. I\nnote with satisfaction that since the Summit of World\nLeaders for Action against Hunger and Poverty,\nconvened last year by President Lula, we have\nachieved significant progress. A growing number of\nGovernments and non-governmental organizations\nhave joined in the effort to eradicate hunger and\npoverty. This is the only war in which we are engaged.\nThis is the only war we can all win.\nThis year we witnessed yet again brutal acts of\nterrorism. Innocent civilians, women and children are\ntoday victims of groups who stand as adversaries to the\nvalues we share. As a country whose identity cannot be\ndissociated from the notions of tolerance and diversity,\nBrazil rejects in the strongest terms those abhorrent\nacts, which go against the very notion of humanity. We\nwill continue to lend our support to increased\ninternational cooperation in the fight against terrorism\nand in the struggle to eliminate its deep-rooted causes.\nSuch efforts must be undertaken with due respect\nfor international law and human rights. The fight\nagainst terrorism cannot be viewed in terms of police\nrepression alone. Nor can such repression result in\nabsurd and indiscriminate killing like terrorism itself.\nDespite the fact that there is no automatic linkage\nbetween poverty and terrorism, communities can be\nexposed to extreme attitudes by fanatical groups as a\nresult of grave social and economic problems,\nespecially when associated with the absence of civil\nand political liberties. I wish to express Brazil\u2019s\nreadiness to work intensively with a view to the prompt\nconclusion of a comprehensive convention against\nterrorism.\nWe recognize the risks of the proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction. At the same time, we\ncannot disregard the importance of reducing and\ndismantling existing arsenals of all such weapons. We\nregret that the seventh Review Conference of the\nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons did not produce tangible results.\nTogether with non-proliferation efforts, we must\ncontinue to work tirelessly towards nuclear\ndisarmament.\nIn addition to the challenges I have just referred\nto, we are faced with two crises of global scope: the\n7\n\npandemic explosion of HIV/AIDS and the serious\nthreats posed by climate change. Brazil will continue to\npromote the implementation of existing multilateral\ninstruments to fight those scourges.\nBrazil is committed to reinforcing the strategic\nalliance with its main partner in our region \u2014\nArgentina \u2014 and to the promotion of a prosperous,\nintegrated and politically stable South America,\nbuilding upon our experience in the Southern Cone\nCommon Market (MERCOSUR). We will tirelessly\nstrive for MERCOSUR\u2019s advancement in the economic\nand political fields. The South American Community\nof Nations, which was founded last year in Cuzco,\nPeru, can be seen as a driving force for integration in\nLatin America and the Caribbean as a whole.\nOur efforts in establishing partnerships with other\ndeveloping countries go beyond our immediate region.\nThe India-Brazil-South Africa Dialogue Forum (IBSA)\nhas brought together three large democracies from\nAfrica, Asia and Latin America that are keen on\ndeepening the economic, political and cultural ties\nbetween them and between their regions. Together with\nother partners, we have joined in setting up the Group\nof Twenty (G-20), which places developing countries\nat the centre of agricultural trade negotiations of the\nWorld Trade Organization\u2019s Doha round. Thanks to the\nrole played by the G-20, it has been possible to\ncombine trade liberalization with social justice in the\ncontext of the multilateral trading system.\nStrengthening our ties with Africa has been a\nlong-standing aspiration of Brazil\u2019s. No previous\nGovernment has pursued that objective with the\nresolve demonstrated by President Lula. Trade and\ncooperation between Brazil and Africa have grown\nsignificantly. Political dialogue has intensified. We\nhave been contributing to the consolidation of peace\nand democracy in countries such as Guinea-Bissau and\nSao Tome and Principe. We have helped to fight\nhunger, develop agriculture and combat the scourge of\nHIV/AIDS in various brother countries of Africa.\nThe same sense of solidarity inspires us to\nparticipate in United Nations peace efforts in Haiti.\nThe Brazilian and Latin American presence in Haiti is\nunprecedented, in terms of both troops and political\ncommitment. We are motivated by three main\nobjectives: establishing a safe environment, promoting\ndialogue among the various political actors with a view\nto a genuine democratic transition and securing\neffective international support for institutional, social\nand economic reconstruction. Haiti is likely to be the\nfirst test case for the Peacebuilding Commission.\nBrazil and the Arab world are renewing their ties\nof friendship, inspired by strong historical and cultural\naffinities. Apart from bilateral initiatives, Brazil has\nbeen strengthening its relations with regional\ngroupings such as the Gulf Cooperation Council and\nthe Arab League. In May 2005, an unprecedented\nsummit of South American and Arab States took place\nin Brasilia. That pioneering initiative brought together\ntwo regions of the developing world in a concrete\ndemonstration of harmony of civilizations.\nOn several trips to the Middle East, I had the\nopportunity to talk to variety of people, including\nleaders from Israel and Palestine. They are aware of\nBrazil\u2019s willingness to support the work of the Quartet\nas a partner for peace. The practice of tolerance and\nrespect for others, as well as the harmonious co-\nexistence of different communities in our country,\nconstitute our comparative advantage. I believe that\nconviction is shared by eminent persons and political\nleaders from both Israel and Palestine.\nAt the beginning of this new chapter in the life of\nthe United Nations, Brazil remains committed to the\nideals that led to the creation of the only Organization\nof universal scope, the only body that can guarantee a\nfuture of peace and prosperity \u2014 not for the few, but\nfor all."

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure at the outset to\naffirm my delegation\u2019s confidence that the Swedish\nleadership of the work of the current General Assembly\nsession will help us achieve the best results. I also\nseize this opportunity to commend the efforts made by\nGabon, represented by its Foreign Minister, during its\nleadership of the previous session. I would also like to\nreiterate our gratitude for the efforts made by\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan to advance the march of\nUnited Nations reform and achieve the goals enshrined\nin its Charter.\nSince the 1970s, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has\nbeen fully aware of the need to reform the United\nNations and was the first State to put forward official\nproposals to the General Assembly in that regard,\npresenting draft resolutions from the thirty-fourth to\nthe fortieth sessions aimed at reforming the Security\nCouncil and abolishing the veto privilege. Though the\nLibyan proposals were not successful because of the\nobjection of the super-Powers, they did, however,\ncreate a wide understanding of that issue within the\nGeneral Assembly, resulting in the adoption of a\nresolution at its forty-seventh session establishing an\nopen-ended group to review the issue of fair\nrepresentation in the Security Council and expanding\nits membership. We participated actively in the group\u2019s\nwork, but its activities reached an impasse.\nWe felt hopeful over the last few years while we\nwere conducting consultations at all levels in order to\nrealize a radical reform for the United Nations system,\nin the service of international peace and security.\nHowever, as the date of our summit-level meeting this\nyear approached, it became evident that the reform we\nsought remained elusive. This is because some of the\nprivileged Powers of the Security Council do not wish\nto give up their privileges \u2014 in fact not even to share\nthese privileges with others.\nThe victorious countries in the Second World War\narrogated rights and privileges for themselves at the\ntime the Charter was drawn up. This led to the\nmarginalization of the General Assembly and rendered\nthe Security Council a domineering body \u2014\ninequitable, unbalanced and undemocratic, with the\nveto privilege greatly abused. The United Nations,\ntherefore, has been unable to administer justice among\nnations; in fact, some of its decisions have inflicted\nharm on many peoples.\nAs we discuss United Nations reform, we should\ntake into consideration that its membership has now\nreached 191 States. New global problems have\nemerged, in addition to the old ones. Thus, it is\n2\n\nnecessary to place the power of decision-making in the\nhands of all Members of the United Nations, that is, in\nthe hands of the General Assembly, in which all States\nhave equal votes. However, if such an agreement is not\npossible, we should seek a new formula for permanent\nmembership in the Security Council.\nIn this respect, we propose that permanent\nmembership be accorded to geographical groups, not to\nspecific States. We also propose that the African Union\nbe granted permanent membership even before the\ncomprehensive reform has been decided, given the fact\nthat Africa is the only continent without a country\nholding permanent membership in the Security\nCouncil.\nAs a member of the African Union, we affirm our\nadherence to the common African position, adopted by\nthe Fifth African Union Summit, held in Sirte, Libya,\non 4 and 5 July 2005. This position was confirmed in\nthe African Union\u2019s Extraordinary Summit on United\nNations Reform held in Addis Ababa on 4 August\n2005.\nLibya believes that the elimination of weapons of\nmass destruction is a fundamental factor in confidence-\nbuilding and the consolidation of international peace\nand security. Hence, Libya declared on l9 December\n2003 its voluntary renunciation of the programmes and\nmaterials that could lead to the production of\ninternationally prohibited weapons and their means of\ndelivery. Since that date, it has been cooperating in a\ntransparent manner with the International Atomic\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) and the Organization for the\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). All\nrelevant materials and equipment have been disposed\nof with the knowledge of experts from the IAEA and\nthe OPCW.\nLibya is now party to all international\nconventions on weapons of mass destruction, as well as\nthe code of ethics concerning ballistic missiles. We\nhope that members of the international community will\ncooperate in a more appropriate manner to eliminate\nweapons of mass destruction, acquired by all States,\nwithout discrimination, in order to create a world in\nwhich peace and security prevail.\nThe Libyan declaration was a culmination of\nprevious Libyan efforts undertaken in this field,\nstarting with effective participation in the\nestablishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in\nAfrica \u2014 through its accession to the Pelindaba\nTreaty \u2014 and the call to make the Middle East a zone\nfree of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass\ndestruction.\nWe confirm our readiness to continue our full\ncooperation with all international organizations in this\nfield and emphasize Libya\u2019s right to expand its\nprogramme of peaceful uses of nuclear energy for\ndevelopment, particularly in the fields of medicine,\nagriculture, desalination, mining and oil exploration.\nWe hope that all countries in the region would place all\ntheir nuclear facilities under the IAEA inspection\nregime.\nOur country is concerned with human rights\nissues at the international and national levels. We deal\nwith all organizations working in the field of human\nrights in a transparent manner. We have donated 2\nmillion dinars to support the activities of the Office of\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Human\nRights, and we are now reviewing some of our national\nlegislation that is not in conformity with international\ninstruments in the field of human rights. We also have\neliminated the People\u2019s Court, established in the early\nyears of the revolution, and its jurisdiction has been\nassigned to regular courts.\nLibya was among the first States that called for\nthe coordination of international efforts to combat\ninternational terrorism and that proposed an\nextraordinary session of the General Assembly to study\nthat phenomenon and to develop measures to combat it\nand eradicate its causes.\nLibya has condemned terrorism in all its forms,\nincluding State terrorism, ratified all international and\nregional conventions concerning terrorism and is\ncooperating actively with the committee established by\nthe Security Council on that subject. We believe that\nthe eradication of terrorism requires practical measures\nto eliminate its causes. Among such actions, we should\nactively strengthen human rights protections for all\npeople, confront all acts of aggression and occupation\nof the lands of others, fight poverty and encourage\ndemocracy.\nTerrorism cannot be uprooted unilaterally through\nactions taken by one State or group of States. The\nsolution for such a problem cannot be achieved by\nlinking it to a certain religion or nationality. It is not\nfair that the legitimate struggle of peoples to achieve\nself-determination and independence should be\nclassified as terrorism. We should all exert and\n3\n\ncoordinate all our possible efforts under the umbrella\nof the United Nations to combat terrorism and\ncomplete, as early as possible, a comprehensive\ncounter-terrorism treaty.\nMy country was subjected to unjust sanctions that\ncaused great material losses totalling about $40 billion.\nNow, while this matter has ended and the reason\nbehind the sanctions settled, I extend my gratitude to\nall the friendly and sisterly countries that stood by our\nside and supported our position in tackling that\nsituation.\nCompetent Libyan authorities are now drawing\nup plans for restructuring the Libyan economy and are\nreviewing the public sector, encouraging the private\nsector and providing opportunity for all to engage in\neconomic activities. New economic policies were\nadopted in order to advance the national economy,\neliminate deficiencies and improve performance.\nCertain measures have been taken in the monetary\nfield, including the adoption of a single exchange rate\nfor the Libyan dinar against foreign currencies, the\nabolition of monetary control and a reduction of\nincome taxes. Import and export licences as well as\ncustoms guarantees on exports have been abolished as\nhave customs fees on approximately 3,500 imported\nitems.\nImportant steps have been taken for the\nprivatization of many public sector companies. Libya\nhas opened its doors to investors and a law for the\nencouragement of foreign investment has been\npromulgated. This law gives foreign investors many\nprivileges and exemptions and allows them 100 per\ncent ownership of their enterprises or partnership with\ndomestic investors. Our application to join the World\nTrade Organization was approved unanimously by the\norganization on 27 July 2004. We seek further\ncooperation from all countries in that respect.\nThe consolidation and realization of peace and\nsecurity for all is a fundamental goal of the United\nNations. It is an objective that could not be realized by\nthe Organization without the assistance and\ncooperation of all Member States, which could be\neffective tools to solve the most difficult problems and\nconflicts among countries, particularly in Africa. In\nthis respect, we wish to express our satisfaction with\nthe stabilization of the situation in Sierra Leone and\nAngola and the improvement of the situation in\nSomalia, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo, as well as the signing of the peace agreement in\nSudan.\nWe call on all Member States to assist the African\nUnion in its endeavours to face its various challenges\nand create a unified African continent capable of\nachieving progress and participating effectively in the\nmarch towards progress, upholding freedom and\nhuman rights and eradicating wars, poverty and disease\nwhile removing the remnants of colonialism. We hope\nthat support will be extended to the African Union\u2019s\nplans to achieve prosperity for all African people by\nproviding assistance to the New Partnership for\nAfrica\u2019s Development.\nThe international community so far has failed to\nsolve the Palestinian problem, although it is as old as\nthe United Nations itself. In fact, the problem is getting\nworse. The Palestinian people have lived for over half\na century either as refugees all over the world or\nsubjected to an occupying Power, which has usurped\nits land and practiced against them the most horrible\ncrimes, including the killing of children, women and\nthe elderly. Their lands have been confiscated, their\nfarms burned, their trees uprooted, their houses\ndestroyed over their occupants, while houses are built\nfor settlers coming from all over the world. Even\nthough highly sophisticated weapons are being used\nagainst civilians, the Security Council stands unable to\ntake concrete steps to stop such practices. This has\nencouraged the occupying Power to continue its\naggression and crimes, heedless of the decisions of the\ninternational community.\nThe suffering of the Palestinian people requires\nthat urgent and firm action be taken by the\ninternational community to put an end to the Israeli\naggression and provide a radical solution for the\nPalestinian question.\nWe believe that the solution cannot be achieved\nby accepting a de facto situation or by merely adopting\nresolutions or unrealizable plans. It will happen\nthrough a radical solution that allows and guarantees\nthe return of all Palestinian refugees to their lands and\nthe establishment of a democratic State on the land of\nhistorical Palestine in which Jews and Arabs live side\nby side, enjoying full equality, similar to the South\nAfrican model, where blacks and whites reconciled\nafter decades of conflict and bloodshed. If such a\nsolution is not realized, with the support of the\ninternational community, the suffering of the\n4\n\nPalestinian people will continue, and the region will\ncontinue to witness tension and conflict without peace\nand security.\nThe Israeli occupation forces must withdraw from\nall occupied Arab territories; the Golan Heights must\nbe returned to Syrian sovereignty and the Shabaa farms\nto Lebanon.\nIn Iraq, where international law has been violated\nand the country subjected to occupation on unfounded\nbases and flimsy pretexts, the tragedy is escalating\ndaily, getting more and more difficult to solve. The\nIraqi people are paying a high price with the lives of\ntheir sons and daughters as a result of the occupation.\nWe have to exert every possible effort to guarantee a\nspeedy end to the occupation in order to enable Iraq to\nregain its independence and sovereignty and preserve\nits territorial integrity and Arab identity. The Iraqis\nmust be allowed to determine their own affairs, future\nand manage their resources, and to achieve self-\ndetermination with freedom involving all citizens\nwithout the marginalization of any group so that peace,\nprosperity and security can prevail all over Iraq."

        "file_text": "Permit me to join others in\nexpressing, on behalf of our President, Mr. Leonel\nFern\u00e1ndez Reyna, our heartfelt congratulations to\nAmbassador Jan Eliasson of Sweden on his election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at this historic\nsixtieth session. The Dominican Republic is confident\nthat he will lead it in an effective and fruitful manner. I\nalso express my gratitude to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his most valuable contributions to\nthe strengthening of the United Nations as an\ninstitution. In addition, I wish to congratulate His\nExcellency Mr. Jean Ping of Gabon and to\nacknowledge his notable work in leading the most\nrecent session.\nThis sixtieth session of the General Assembly\nshould go down in history as one of the most\nmomentous United Nations sessions. Proof of that lies\nin two areas of major significance on its agenda: first,\naccountability with regard to the degree of\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals\nand renewal of the commitments made to achieve\nthem; and secondly, setting out the course for reform of\nthe Organization to adapt it so that it can address\ncurrent challenging problems and guarantee the\neffectiveness of its actions in order to ensure the\ndevelopment, freedom and peace of all the world\u2019s\npeoples.\nFor nations such as the one I represent, the\nambitious agenda aimed at achieving the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by 2015 has become the\nkey governmental programme.\nWhat could be more important to small\nunderdeveloped nations with scarce natural resources\nthan leading their people out of the socio-economic\nabyss caused by poverty, poor health and the lack of\neducation and productive employment? No political\naction is more urgent \u2014 at least not in the Dominican\nRepublic. Eliminating poverty in the world is a\nmonumental task requiring unstinting political\ncommitment and the collective participation of all\nsocieties, as well as unlimited economic support from\nthe developed nations.\nThe heartbreaking realities of the present are\nmorally unacceptable in a world with humankind at its\ncentre; they underline the flawed nature of the zero-\nsum policies practised in the past, when the great\nPowers dedicated themselves to amassing wealth by\nexploiting the riches of poorer, weaker nations.\nWidespread poverty is not good for poor nations,\nand even less so for rich nations. As all know, poverty\nleads to despair, violence and chaos. That, in turn,\nproduces unbearable social and political tensions and\nthe outbreak of conflicts, leading to failed States.\nWhen a State fails, the conflict raging within spills\nover into regional conflicts or prompts endless,\nunstoppable waves of migrants. In today\u2019s world, a\nfailed State eventually becomes an issue before the\nUnited Nations, requiring attention and solutions.\n5\n\nWhen one has examined how that chain of events\nworks, it becomes clear that achieving the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals is crucial.\nAllow me to underline the following. It is\nalarming that in 2015, the year in which the\nMillennium Development Goals are to be achieved, the\nproduction of oil \u2014 the fuel that enabled the world to\nachieve spectacular growth over the past 100 years \u2014\nis projected to begin to decline dangerously. To foresee\nthe future, one has only to take a good look at the\npresent. All the world\u2019s Governments face difficulties\ncaused by high oil prices, and we are all aware that this\ntime, unlike the oil shock of the 1970s, the present\nreduction in the flow of oil could become permanent. I\nemphasize this because, owing to that situation, our\nnations risk facing endless difficulties on all fronts.\nIt is disturbing that this should happen precisely\nwhen we are making enormous efforts to overcome the\nobstacles preventing us from creating a dignified, free\nand safe society for our peoples. The predicted global\ncrisis could bring an ongoing reduction in oil\nproduction, immediately causing higher oil prices. The\ncatastrophic effects that would produce cannot be\nignored today. We have known for a long time that oil\nwould not last forever. Now is the time for the United\nNations to launch an initiative, much broader in scope\nthan the Millennium Development Goals, to chart a\ncourse guiding Member States to a civilization not\ndependent on oil.\nMy country, the Dominican Republic, shares the\nsmall Caribbean island of Hispaniola with Haiti. It has\nto be said that, historically, the problems on one side of\nthe border have tended to become problems for the\nother side. Haiti, a country with a 200-year history of\nindependence, is a fractured nation today. Amid\ninsurmountable economic difficulties and all types of\nsocial shortfalls, its political conflicts weakened its\ninstitutions, and the State collapsed.\nToday\u2019s transitional regime, without enough\nresources to function properly, is, with the support of\nthe United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti,\nstriving greatly to rebuild what was destroyed, and the\ninternational community has put great hope in restoring\nlegitimate political authority through the holding of\nelections.\nIn the General Assembly and elsewhere, many\nhave said that they believe that the electoral process in\nHaiti should not have been given top priority; rather,\ntop priority should have gone to humanitarian\nassistance and job creation by means of a massive\nprogramme for building infrastructure such as roads,\nwater supply systems, schools, hospitals and electric\ngenerators. However, past experience in the process of\nrebuilding failed States points to the priority need to\nlegitimize new political leadership through elections,\neven though we know that in such cases, the ideal\nframework for holding elections cannot be achieved.\nThat is why, on behalf of my country\u2019s President,\nMr. Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez Reyna, I propose that the United\nNations Stabilization Mission in Haiti, with the support\nof the Transitional Government of Haiti and the\ninternational community, should carry out \u2014 as they\nhave been doing \u2014 a broad national dialogue to reach\ngeneral agreement between the political forces and the\norganized sectors of Haitian civil society.\nSuch an agreement would ensure national\nreconciliation and prepare the way for a national\nreconstruction plan that has the support of all Haitian\nleadership. All Haitian civil society and political\nleadership have important roles to play in their\ncountry\u2019s institutional reconstruction, and all must\nfulfil those responsibilities. We cannot ignore the fact\nthat in recent years, the Haitian people have been\nliving in fear, insecurity, poverty and despair. For\nrecovery to take place, the people need to have\nconfidence in the process of peace, reconciliation and\nthe rebuilding of State institutions.\nIn addition, President Fernandez proposes that the\nUnited Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti\n(MINUSTAH) invite distinguished world leaders to be\npresent during the elections in Haiti, in order to give\nmore credibility to the electoral process.\nAmong these statesmen, the Dominican Republic\ntakes the liberty of suggesting Presidents Fox of\nMexico and Lula da Silva of Brazil, the former\nPresidents of the United States of America, Mr. Carter\nand Mr. Clinton, and the legendary former President of\nSouth Africa, Nelson Mandela.\nElections are the first important political step to\nhelp Haiti back on its feet. We are not under the\nillusion that elections alone will guarantee security,\nensure the reign of democracy in the immediate future\nor produce an overnight improvement in the living\nconditions of Haitians.\n6\n\nOur own experience has taught us that the road to\ndemocracy will be a long one, as it has been for the\nnations that today function within the framework of\ndemocratic institutions. And the road towards\ndevelopment will be even longer but more secure, if\ntensions are reduced, a climate of cooperation is\nfostered and if donor nations and institutions faithfully\nfulfil their generous promises of financial support for\nHaiti in a timely manner.\nOn the subject of peace, security and dialogue,\nwe want to comment on two items that are very high on\nthe international political agenda. First, the progress\nmade in the peace process between Israel and the\nPalestinian National Authority.\nSecondly, the recent natural disasters in Asia and\nnow in the United States of America are forcing us to\nthink about the vulnerability of nations to the\npotentially dangerous, manmade changes in the balance\nof nature when faced with these types of events. We\nsincerely regret the loss of life due to Hurricane\nKatrina.\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that we must\nnot lose time. Let us act today, as if this were our last\nopportunity to reach a consensus and formulate action\nto turn sustainable development into a collective\nachievement in order to ensure world security and\nprogress together on the road to peace."

        "file_text": "Allow me to extend to\nyou, Sir, our warm congratulations on your election to\npreside over the historic sixtieth session of the General\n13\n\nAssembly. You can rest assured of the fullest\ncooperation of my delegation. We want to express our\nappreciation to the President of the fifty-ninth session\nof the General Assembly, our brother, Mr. Jean Ping,\nwhose tenure as President of the Assembly coincided\nwith momentous events at the United Nations that\nrequired both wisdom and a great deal of competence\non the part of the President. Mr. Jean Ping showed he\nhad both, and he has made us all proud.\nWe are, as usual, grateful to our Secretary-\nGeneral, Kofi Annan, whose tenure of office will\nalways be remembered as a period of enormous\ndedication to the reform of the United Nations and of a\nnoble effort to mobilize international support to combat\nextreme poverty.\nThe outcome document which our heads of State\nor Government endorsed (resolution 60/1) reflects the\nglobal consensus on the fact that the reform of the\nUnited Nations is essential and timely. My delegation\nwelcomes the document, which outlines a far-reaching\nagenda for change.\nThe achievement of the Millennium Development\nGoals (MDGs) by those vulnerable to being thrown off\ntrack is critical to all, not just to those directly affected.\nIt would be regrettable if targets that have so much\nsignificance for the well-being of all were missed in\nthe course of the next 10 years due to failure on the\npart of those directly affected or a lack of solidarity at\nthe international level. We strongly believe that the\ntargets are neither unrealistic nor unduly ambitious.\nIt cannot be emphasized enough that, at the end\nof the day, those that have primary responsibility for\nprevailing over extreme poverty are those that are\ndirectly affected. But those that suffer from extreme\npoverty require the support of the international\ncommunity to stay on track to achieve the MDGs.\nIn concrete terms, that means that official\ndevelopment assistance and measures on debt relief\nand trade need to be aligned with the realization of the\nMillennium Development Goals. In that regard, we are\nencouraged by the progress made at the Group of Eight\nGleneagles summit. We were also encouraged by the\ncommitment of leaders at the High-level Plenary\nMeeting to address the current distortions in\ninternational trade, including through the elimination\nof agricultural subsidies. There is nothing more\nimportant for low-income countries than a partnership\nthat is predictable, consistent and based on previously\ndefined mutual obligations.\nNo amount of international cooperation will be\nenough to achieve the Millennium Development Goals\nunless domestic conditions are met in all relevant\nareas. We in Ethiopia have been doing our level best in\nthat regard. We have spared no effort to change the\neconomic situation in our country for the better, our\nprimary focus being the rural sector. Ethiopia has made\na tireless effort to implement the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals.\nDespite all the complications and the absence of a\ntradition of loyal opposition, the recent elections in\nEthiopia have demonstrated the depth of commitment\nwe have to transform the tradition of governance in\nEthiopia \u00f3 a tradition that has been as remote from\ndemocracy as it is possible to be. Those elections stand\nout as a milestone in the process of democratization of\nthe State and of society at large. Ethiopia has entered\ninto a new era of a vibrant multiparty political system.\nIn the area of peace - and particularly with\nrespect to peace in our subregion - we, along with\nlike-minded partners, will continue to be pillars for\npeace and stability.\nOn the fight against terrorism, Ethiopia will\ncontinue to discharge its responsibility in cooperation\nwith other peace-loving countries. Ethiopia rejects\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We in\nEthiopia are determined to work with the international\ncommunity to implement the counter-terrorism\nstrategy.\nIn connection with our deep aspiration for peace,\nour only source of disappointment is the lingering\ndispute we have with Eritrea. Ethiopia has been\ncontributing more than its share to resolve that\noutstanding problem. In his statement on Wednesday,\n21 September (see ), the Eritrean\nrepresentative officially threatened to use force against\nEthiopia on the basis of the unfounded allegation that\npart of Eritrean territory is under Ethiopian occupation.\nI find it incumbent upon me to set the record straight.\nThis is a problem that grew out of an act of\naggression committed by Eritrea against Ethiopia. It is\nno secret how Ethiopia managed to reverse the Eritrean\naggression and how it created the conditions for a\npeaceful resolution of the crisis between the two\ncountries, based on legality, to which Ethiopia has been\n14\n\nand remains committed. Any suggestion, such as the\none made by the Eritrean representative on Wednesday,\nthat Eritrean territory is occupied is a mockery of the\ntruth and an insult to the intelligence of the\ninternational community.\nThe threat or use of force should have no place as\na means of resolving disputes between States. That is a\nprinciple to which Ethiopia has adhered: before the\nEritrean act of aggression, after the aggression was\nreversed and since. Regrettably, Eritrea's attitude is\ndifferent, as has been repeatedly evidenced on the\nground in our region and in statements made by\nEritrean officials in different forums, including the\nGeneral Assembly. The Eritrean Government needs to\nbe reminded that it should make no mistake: it will be\nheld accountable for its actions.\nEthiopia has always been committed to the rule of\nlaw and to the maintenance of peace and stability. Our\nfive-point peace plan of 25 November 2004 for moving\nforward towards peace with Eritrea, which was\nwelcomed by the international community,\ndemonstrates Ethiopia's seriousness in that regard.\nEritrea knows that Ethiopia has been ready for\ndialogue, both to ensure the demarcation of the\nboundary on the basis of the decision of the Boundary\nCommission and to normalize relations between the\ntwo countries.\nEritrea abhors dialogue, perhaps because it\nsuspects that dialogue would eventually lead to peace.\nIt is not clear whether the Government of Eritrea\nbelieves that peace serves its interests. Perhaps the\npeople of Eritrea need to be kept on their toes, with\ntheir gaze focused on artificial external adversity. In\nany event, Eritrea has no reason to be angry at Ethiopia\nor at the world. Eritrea dragged Ethiopia into war in\n1998 and now continues to be an obstacle to the\nnormalization of relations between the two countries\nand peoples.\nThe problem between Ethiopia and Eritrea has\nnever been, and is not, a legal one; rather, it is political\nin nature, and Ethiopia has the political will to move\nforward. We invite Eritrea to join us in that effort.\nEthiopia does not believe at all in sabre-rattling, least\nof all between countries that should have little time to\nspare from fighting extreme poverty.\nOn the continental level, we are encouraged by\nthe dynamism that the new African Union has injected\ninto the joint African effort for peace and stability.\nThere is no doubt that reform of the United Nations\ncould create even greater possibilities for Africa to\nplay its proper role, not only within Africa but also\noutside the continent.\nEthiopia continues to attach great importance to\nthe reform of the United Nations. We believe that,\nalthough all our expectations have not been met, the\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting provided great impetus for\nmaking progress, in terms of both achieving the\nMillennium Development Goals and advancing the\nreform of the United Nations. It is our hope that it will\nbe possible to make progress in the course of this\nsession.\nI would like to conclude by reiterating Ethiopia's\ncommitment to the United Nations, and its\npreparedness to do whatever is necessary to contribute\nto efforts designed to make the Organization more\neffective and more representative."

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like to\nconvey the condolences of my people to the friendly\npeople of the United States on the tragic loss of life\nand large-scale destruction caused by Hurricane\nKatrina. This is also a stark reminder of the many other\nnatural and man-made disasters, such as famine in\nAfrica, tsunamis, earthquakes, ecological catastrophes\nand wide-scale violence and terrorism. They all require\nsustained international attention and cooperation.\nHaving suffered from similar disasters, Turkey deeply\nfeels for others and stands in solidarity with them.\nUpholding the principles of justice, dignity,\nequality and social progress for the men and women of\nour world should be the basis of the international order.\nWe must spread justice together with freedom. We\ncannot rest until we provide prosperity and dignity for\nevery human being. Those principles should guide us\nin our future efforts.\nWe have left a very busy period behind,\nculminating with an important summit. The Summit\nOutcome document (resolution 60/1) has encouraged\nus all to focus on the global problems we face and on\nthe way to achieve positive change. Now is the time to\nact. We must start implementing what we have agreed\nupon on issues ranging from peacebuilding to human\nrights. While doing this, we must not lose sight of our\nmain target: we must reach the internationally agreed\ndevelopment goals, including the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals, by the year 2015.\nWith these things in mind, we welcome the\nSecretary-General\u2019s proposal to start with an\naccountability pact (see ). We also welcome\nyour idea, Mr. President, to submit an outline of work\nfor the year ahead related to follow-up of the summit.\nA large number of international problems that are\nhigh on the United Nations agenda are occurring in our\npart of the world. These are real issues that closely\naffect the daily lives of our people. As a country with a\n2\n\nrich heritage and great international experience, we are\nworking to build a culture of compromise and\nreconciliation.\nOur historical and cultural links to nations in\nneighbouring regions from Eurasia to the Islamic world\nand our role as a member of European, trans-Atlantic\nand Mediterranean institutions will have a positive\neffect on Turkey\u2019s contribution to international\nrelations in the twenty-first century.\nIt is against that background, and with a sense of\nconfidence, that I take the opportunity to submit to the\nAssembly\u2019s attention Turkey\u2019s candidacy for a\nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council for the\nterm 2009-2010.\nOngoing reform efforts hold great promise for the\nimprovement of the political, social and economic\nstandards of the Middle East region. We will continue\nto encourage and assist those local efforts.\nConcerning the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Israeli\nwithdrawal from the Gaza Strip is an encouraging\ndevelopment. We would like to witness the same\npositive trend in the West Bank. Israeli settlement\nactivities in occupied territories must come to an end.\nThe sanctity of the holy sites in Jerusalem must be\nrespected. The road map should be revived and fully\nimplemented.\nFurthermore, we must not let terror and violence\nderail the process this time. The reform of the\nPalestinian National Authority must move forward,\nparticularly in the security domain. Efforts to improve\nthe living conditions of the Palestinians have to be\nintensified. We support the work of Mr. James\nWolfensohn, Quartet Special Envoy for\nDisengagement, and are cooperating with him. We\nbelieve these efforts will help restore a sense of hope\namong the Palestinians and ensure security for the\nIsraelis.\nIn order to integrate the Palestinians with the\nworld, seaports and airports must be built and\nactivated. Border crossings and trade corridors must\nfunction smoothly. Freedom of movement must be\nachieved. Such measures will go a long way towards\nrevitalizing the Palestinian economy. That will\nencourage the Palestinians to become real partners in\npeace with the Israelis. Turkey is already actively\nworking with the parties for the realization of this\nvision. We are determined to continue to contribute in\nany way we can.\nIraq\u2019s destiny and the way the events are\nunfolding in that country are of crucial importance for\npeace and stability in the Middle East and beyond.\nBuilding a democratic and prosperous Iraq at peace\nwith itself and its neighbours will be possible only if\nthe Iraqi people act as one, in full solidarity and with a\nclear vision. Ethnic and religious differences in Iraq\nshould not be divisive. Rather they should be a source\nof cultural plurality. Otherwise, the new Iraq will be a\nsource of instability and conflict, instead of hope and\ninspiration for the entire region.\nTurkey, in cooperation with the United Nations,\nhas been in the forefront of efforts for political and\neconomic rehabilitation in Iraq. The Neighbours of\nIraq forum, again pioneered by Turkey, has been an\nefficient platform to support the unity and territorial\nintegrity of Iraq.\nThe security situation is a source of concern for\nall. Iraq has, unfortunately, become a training ground\nfor terrorists. As a neighbouring country, Turkey\nsuffers as a result of this. We are concerned that\nterrorism emanating from Iraq might have a ripple\neffect on other countries, including Turkey. It is our\njoint duty to prevent such an outcome.\nThe problems of Nagorny Karabakh, Abkhazia\nand South Ossetia continue to impede peace and\ncooperation in the South Caucusus. These problems\ndefy all United Nations principles. They demand our\nurgent attention. In particular, a peaceful settlement\nmust be found to the Nagorny Karabakh issue\nconsistent with the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan.\nSteps towards ending the occupation of Azeri territory\nwill create a better climate in the region, including in\nTurkish-Armenian relations. We are giving full support\nto the efforts of the Minsk Group. We are closely\nfollowing the high-level contacts between Turkey\u2019s\ntwo neighbours and are encouraging the parties to\nmake progress.\nIn Afghanistan, many challenges still lie ahead.\nThe continued support of the international community\nis still needed. Among other matters, education, health,\ngender equality and economic development need\nincreased attention. Alternative crops must be\nencouraged in order to replace widespread poppy\ncultivation. As a country that has twice led the\nInternational Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan,\n3\n\nfor a total of 14 months during the past three years,\nTurkey wishes to reiterate its continued commitment.\nWe welcome the holding of elections as an encouraging\ndevelopment for democracy in Afghanistan.\nWe are determined to continue our support for the\nstrengthening of peace, stability and prosperity in\nSouth-East Europe. The Balkan region has made\nconsiderable progress towards the establishment of a\npeaceful environment leading to economic\ndevelopment. The political and economic consolidation\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina and final-status talks in\nKosovo need to be monitored carefully. Turkey will\ncontinue to be a reliable partner in this process.\nRegarding the Eastern Mediterranean, our vision\nis to create a basin of cooperation, stability and\nprosperity among Turkey, Greece and the two peoples\nof Cyprus. However, it is regrettable that, at a time\nwhen we are debating the best way to reform the\nUnited Nations and enhance its role, we are at the same\ntime witnessing an attempt to move the Cyprus\nproblem away from this Organization. We regard these\nefforts to undermine the role of the United Nations as a\nmost disturbing paradox. The Annan plan represented a\nunique basis for the solution of this problem. Although\nit did not fully meet their expectations, for the sake of\ncompromise the Turkish Cypriots approved the plan by\nan overwhelming majority.\nOn the other hand, under the effective guidance\nof the Greek Cypriot leadership, the rejection of the\nAnnan plan in a referendum held last year was a blow\nto the international community. Thus, a chance to put\nan end to the division of the island once and for all was\nmissed.\nThe report of the Secretary-General (S/2004/437)\nissued after the referendum gave an overview of the\nlong negotiating process and recommended the lifting\nof all restrictions upon the Turkish Cypriots.\nUnfortunately, against established practice, the\ncomprehensive report of the Secretary-General on\nCyprus is being disregarded. As a result, the unfair\nrestrictions imposed upon the Turkish Cypriots could\nnot be lifted. One might find it difficult to believe that\nthe Turkish Cypriots still continue to live under\nrestrictions, cut off from the outside world.\nDuring the ensuing period, the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s soundings and his efforts to reactivate the\ntalks based on his plan have yielded no tangible results\nbecause of the continued intransigence of the Greek\nCypriot administration. As if that were not enough, the\nGreek Cypriot administration is now trying to sideline\nthe United Nations and carry this issue to other forums.\nI urge all international actors to discourage these\nmisguided efforts. Turkey continues to be ready to\ncontribute to United Nations endeavours to find a just,\nequitable and lasting solution to the Cyprus problem on\nthe basis of the Annan plan.\nOn this occasion, I would like to reiterate the\nproposal that I made on 30 May 2005 for the lifting of\nall restrictions related to the island (see A/59/820). In\nthat proposal, I basically suggested that it was\nnecessary to enable the free movement of people,\ngoods and services and to lift all restrictions applied to\nseaports and airports between the two sides in Cyprus\nas well as to Turkey and Greece. It is evident that this\nproposal conforms to the legitimate expectations of the\ninternational community.\nWe attach great importance to furthering our\nrelations and cooperation with the African continent.\nAccording to an action plan, Turkey is vigorously\ndeveloping its relations with Africa as a whole. We\nrecently opened an office in Addis Ababa to serve as a\ncoordination centre for Turkish humanitarian and\ndevelopmental assistance to the continent. The Turkish\nGovernment has also declared 2005 as the Year of\nAfrica in Turkey. We will continue our contributions to\ninternational institutions, working to alleviate the\nsuffering and eliminate disease and hunger in Africa.\nThe chain of attacks in various parts of the world\nproves that no country is immune to terrorism. We\ncondemn these atrocities in the strongest terms. No\ndistinction should be made among terrorist\norganizations. There is no room for double standards in\nthis fight. We must reject terrorism as a method,\nregardless of where, why and how it is employed.\nCombating terrorism should be a global and collective\neffort, and the United Nations should continue to play\na prominent role. We welcome Security Council\nresolutions that call for strengthened measures against\nincitement of terrorist acts and in favour of the\nprevention of armed conflict, particularly in Africa. We\nmust also resist any temptation to associate any\nspecific culture, religion or faith with terrorism.\nWe should keep in mind that the right to the\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy requires full and\ntransparent cooperation with the International Atomic\nEnergy Agency. The establishment of zones free of\n4\n\nweapons of mass destruction, particularly in the\nMiddle East, will be an important contribution to\ninternational peace and security.\nStrengthening multilateralism and the central role\nof the United Nations in the international system is a\nfundamental aspect of our foreign policy. It is the\nstrongest hope and guarantee for a safer and better\nworld."

        "file_text": "I\ntake this opportunity to congratulate President Eliasson\non his election to lead our deliberations during this\nvery important session of the General Assembly. I\nwould also like to pay tribute to our outgoing President\nof the fifty-ninth session, His Excellency Mr. Jean\n21\n\nPing, and our Secretary-General for their tireless\nefforts and very considerable contributions to the\nsuccessful outcome of the High-level Plenary Meeting\nthat concluded just a week ago.\nThis year, at this historic session, we\ncommemorate a milestone in the rich history of the\nOrganization as we celebrate its sixtieth anniversary.\nFor us in Micronesia, the occasion also marks the\nfifteenth anniversary of our joining the United Nations.\nWe are proud and motivated to be part of this great\nOrganization.\nOur celebrations, however, should have a noble\npurpose beyond honouring the past and the present.\nThis occasion should give focus to the long road ahead\nof us. Inspired by the accomplishments of the past 60\nyears, we must forge ahead with strong determination,\nconfidence and vigour to meet the challenges that the\nfuture holds for the Organization.\nThe Federated States of Micronesia does not\npretend to believe that the problems that we are called\nupon to tackle are easy; they are not. But while we\nhave differences of opinion as to how they may be\neffectively addressed, my delegation is encouraged by\nthe broad consensus that was reached during the high-\nlevel panel meetings last week that the reform of the\nUnited Nations and the attainment of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) must be addressed one\nway or another and sooner rather than later. No doubt\nthe consensus was forged in the conviction that the\nUnited Nations, with all its shortcomings, still\nrepresents the best hope for humankind to solve its\nproblems at the multilateral level. If that is the case, as\nmy country firmly believes it is, the Organization must\nbe reformed to reflect present day realities and to\neffectively and efficiently achieve its enduring\nobjectives as enshrined in the Charter. For the sake of\nour Organization\u2019s credibility, for its long-term\nsustainability, and for the millions of people around the\nglobe that pin their hopes on the United Nations, the\nOrganization must be reformed. My delegation fully\nsupports the call that has been made within the General\nAssembly Hall for its comprehensive reform.\nConsequently, let us give full consideration to the\nreform of the Security Council. The challenges of the\ntwenty-first century demand that we should do so. With\nthe indulgence of members, I do not wish to go into\ndetails here, as the position of my Government on the\nissue has already been made known on several\noccasions. I would only reiterate our call for the\ninclusion of Japan and Germany, among the developed\ncountries, as permanent members of the Council,\nbecause we believe they will contribute greatly to the\nmaintenance of peace and security. For those\naforementioned reasons, we also support the inclusion\nof India, a developing country, as a permanent member\nof the Security Council. Moreover, we will support the\ninclusion of other developing countries from other\nregions, if that reflects the choice of those regions. We\nurge Member States to take bold and decisive action on\nthis issue.\nThe time has come for the \u201cenemy State\u201d clauses\nin the United Nations Charter to be removed. They\nhave long become obsolete. The outcome document\nrightfully reflects that fact.\nThe sixtieth General Assembly could not have\nbeen more timely. It can take up the noble but\nincomplete task of reinforcing and facilitating the full\nimplementation of the outcome of last week\u2019s summit.\nWe have little choice but to complete that which was\nleft unfinished.\nConsistent with the broader agenda of the\ndebates, we wish to reiterate the great importance that\nwe attach to the second phase of the World Summit on\nthe Information Society (WSIS) to be held in Tunisia in\nNovember. For my country, whose population is\ndispersed on many islands scattered over a vast area of\nthe Pacific, access to affordable and reliable\ninformation and communication technologies (ICTs) is\ncritical to the socio-economic advancement of its\npeople. But harnessing the power of ICTs does not\nbenefit only a few. In the end, it is a win-win\nproposition for us all \u2014 for developing and developed\ncountries alike. The responsible use and effective\ndissemination of meaningful information is the key to\nemancipation from human ignorance and is therefore\nessential to socio-economic progress. It follows that\nthe means of collecting, evaluating, and transmitting\ninformation must be shared and placed at the service of\nhumankind. It is for that reason that my country\ncontinues to add its voice to those of other countries in\nurging universal cooperation in the WSIS process. It is\na step forward along the road to achieving the MDGs.\nWithout it, the MDGs will mean little.\nIt is for the same reason that my Government\nsupports the Community of Democracies and\nparticipates in its activities. In our view,\n22\n\ndemocratization of the institutions of governance and\ntransparency in public policymaking \u2014 with due\nregard to local conditions \u2014 are inseparable from\neconomic progress and collective security. After all,\nthe work of the Community does not contradict but\nfurther reinforces the MDGs and, in a larger sense, the\ntime-honoured objectives incorporated in the Charter\nof the United Nations.\nIt does not take a great deal of wisdom to realize\nthat, as a small island developing State, my country is\nvulnerable to the extremely adverse impact of global\nclimate change. For the 15 years we have been a\nMember of the United Nations, we have been vocal\nhere and elsewhere on the issue of climate change and\nits adverse impact on small island developing States.\nFor us, it is an issue of security and survival. I reiterate\nour appeal to those countries that have not yet ratified\nthe Kyoto Protocol to do so immediately and without\nfurther delay.\nA week ago during the High-level Plenary\nMeeting, President Joseph Urusemal, like other\nMicronesian Presidents before him, called attention to\nthe daunting challenges facing our country and other\nsmall island developing States in pursuing sustainable\ndevelopment and achieving the MDGs. I reaffirm their\ncalls here once again, and stress the urgent need for the\ninternational community to fully and effectively\nimplement the Mauritius Strategy for the further\nImplementation of the Programme of Action for the\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates. The Strategy provides a way forward for these\ncountries and plays a crucial role in our ability to\nachieve sustainable development and meet the MDGs.\nAs if the plethora of challenges I have spoken of\nare not daunting enough for my country, the escalating\ncost of fuel and its negative impact on our efforts to\nmeet development goals and pursue sustainable\ndevelopment is a major cause of concern. That crisis\nbrings to the fore the need identified by small island\ndeveloping States for accelerated research and\ndevelopment and a sharing of technologies in the areas\nof renewable and alternative sources of energy. We\nappeal to the international community to assist us in\nthose areas.\nI take this opportunity today to reiterate the call\nmade by my President during the High-level Plenary\nMeeting to further strengthen cooperation and linkages\nbetween the United Nations and countries of the\nPacific, like mine. The need for the physical presence\nof the United Nations system and its sustained\nengagement in our development process is now more\ncompelling than ever. We cannot accept the notion that\nour country is undeserving of the substantive presence\nof the United Nations.\nOver the past few months we have seen\nencouraging signs in the Middle East. The historic\ndisengagement of Israel from the Gaza Strip and parts\nof the West Bank is a step in the right direction and\nshould be commended. My Government appreciates the\npolitical obstacles faced by the two parties and\nencourages them to stay the course towards a peaceful\nsettlement of what has been a long, complex and\nunpleasant experience. We call upon both parties to\nspare no effort to actively pursue peaceful negotiations.\nThey should not be satisfied until the day comes when\nIsraeli and Palestinian children can play side by side\nand live in peace, without fear.\nAs a young country that graduated from the\ntrusteeship regime of this Organization, my country\nplaces high hopes in the United Nations. At 60, the\nUnited Nations should not to be contemplating\nretirement. Instead, the time has come for this great\nOrganization to strengthen and rededicate itself in\norder to effectively and efficiently meet the challenges\nof the new millennium."

        "file_text": "Palau warmly congratulates\nthe President on his election to the presidency of the\nAssembly and assures him of Palau\u2019s full support and\ncooperation. We pay tribute to his predecessor, Jean\nPing of the Gabonese Republic, for his effective\nleadership.\nAt last week\u2019s historic summit, our leaders\ncreated an agenda for the world. It is our task to\nundertake concrete measures to advance that agenda.\nWhile the outcome document may not have addressed\nevery issue of importance in a manner that is\nsatisfactory to all, it is inarguably an excellent starting\npoint for the hard work that now lies before us. We\nmust think of it as a floor, rather than a ceiling, for our\nefforts.\nPalau has much to offer and much to gain from a\nstronger United Nations. We are a new country, this\nyear celebrating our eleventh anniversary as an\nindependent nation and as a Member of the United\nNations. As Palau takes its place among the community\nof nations, a major concern is the development that\nwill enable us to stand on our own. In particular, Palau\nregards the capacity-building expertise of the United\nNations and its agencies as central to these efforts.\nAs the Secretary-General stated earlier this year\nin his report \u201cIn larger freedom\u201d, \u201cone of the great\nchallenges of the new millennium is to insure that all\nStates are strong enough to meet the many challenges\nthey face\u201d (A/59/2005, para. 19). He went on to say,\n\u201cno country, weak or strong, can realize prosperity in a\nvacuum\u201d (ibid., para. 24).\nI fear that just such a vacuum exists in many\nsmall island developing States and that Palau is one of\nthem. Not a single United Nations representative can\nbe found in Palau to assist the country in moving\nforward. The United Nations flag does not fly there. So\nwhen a youngster wants to know whether a capacity-\nbuilding internship or scholarship might be available,\nthere is no one to ask. And when a local\nenvironmentalist wants to know whether a Global\nEnvironmental Facility Small Grant might be available\nto assist in the preservation of an endangered species\n26\n\nthat is important to the whole world, there is no one to\nhelp in submitting an application. In like manner, when\nPalau does its part in ratifying an international\nagreement, thus accepting the obligation to render\ncomplex reports to an international agency, there is no\none to help.\nThe United Nations has attempted to fill this\nvacuum through the creation of regional and\nsubregional centres, which are quite distant from\nPalau\u2019s shores. While arguably well intentioned, this\ntactic has failed to provide Palau with the capacity-\nbuilding required and has, similarly, prevented the\nworld from truly understanding Palau\u2019s needs and\naspirations. In this sense, these regional and\nsubregional centres merely replicate the colonial\nregimes, which the Pacific islands have thrown off \u2014\ndistant capitals making decisions about far-flung\nprovinces. To Palau, strengthening the United Nations\nmeans strengthening its marginalized Members.\nPalau has willingly taken its place as a\nresponsible member of the international community.\nHeeding the Secretary-General\u2019s call to action, Palau\nthis year proudly deployed a contingent of police\npeacekeepers, who now serve in East Timor. And in\nresponse to the Secretary-General\u2019s stated desire to\ndevelop better gender balance in these missions,\nPalau\u2019s contingent is entirely female.\nWhen the world develops important conventions,\noften with burdensome reporting requirements, Palau\nsteps up and signs them, as was the case last week\nwhen Palau\u2019s President Remengesau signed the\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of Acts\nof Nuclear Terrorism. And when natural disasters\nstrike, Palau responds willingly, making significant\nfinancial contributions to remit suffering caused by the\ntsunami and by Hurricane Katrina. I submit that in both\nof these cases, Palau\u2019s contributions were, on a per\ncapita basis, among the highest in the world.\nPalau asks for very little. But now it asks for\nhelp, and that help should be forthcoming. As our\nPresident Remengesau stated in the Assembly\u2019s 4th\nmeeting, last week, in his address to the world summit:\n\u201cIt is therefore time for the international\ncommunity, and the United Nations as its\nrepresentative, to begin to move beyond studies\nthat recognize past failures to achieve sustainable\ndevelopment in our island nations, and to move\naggressively forward and to establish a specific\nprogramme agenda that recognizes our unique\nsmallness, that appreciates our distinctive\ndiversity, and that respects our island cultures as\nequal to those in other nations of this world.\u201d\nPalau\u2019s development challenges are different\nfrom those of many of our friends around the world\nwho have taken this podium. Hunger is not an issue at\npresent in paradise. But the challenges that confront\nthe small island nations of the Pacific may ultimately\nbe every bit as devastating as famine.\nClimate change and sea-level rise threaten to\nobliterate our islands. The very poignant and moving\nstatement of His Excellency Anote Tong, Beretitenti of\nthe Republic of Kiribati at the 15th meeting last week\ncontained a chilling preview of what the unchecked\nscourge of carbon emissions could mean to all of the\ncountries in the Pacific, and of course to many other\noceans of the world. The President acknowledged that\nthe Government of Kiribati needed now \u201cto seriously\nconsider the option of having to relocate our peoples\nwhen necessary\u201d. In this understated Pacific way, the\nPresident forces us all to confront a world where whole\ncountries simply disappear from the globe. Is there a\nmore compelling call to action than that?\nThe period leading up to such a catastrophe is\nupon us. Palau must rely on the maintenance of its\nextraordinary reefs and waters and its unparalleled\nbiodiversity to attract tourists. Without these assets, it\nwill be unable to develop a sustainable economy and to\ncreate jobs, which will allow its children to live and\nwork in their homeland.\nThe other pillar of Palau\u2019s development is its\nfisheries. For countless generations, our people have\nrelied on their waters for their sustenance. Now,\nforeign fishing fleets, which have denuded the waters\nproximate to their own harbours, have come to the\nPacific and threaten to do the same. The very food\nchain is threatened by new fishing practices that,\nthough in their infancy, have begun to damage Pacific\nseamounts in ways that the scientific community deems\nalarming. It is for this reason that Palau has called for a\nmoratorium on deep sea bottom trawling until the\nscientific community can gauge the long-term impact\nof that practice. We renew that call today and applaud\nCosta Rica for its leadership on this important issue.\nWe take this opportunity and we are grateful for\nthis opportunity to commend Palau\u2019s bilateral partners\nand friends who have overcome our new nation\u2019s\n27\n\nremoteness to become involved and knowledgeable\nabout our needs and aspirations. The United States has\nprovided in-country diplomatic representation and\nyears of support for our vital democracy.\nJapan has also provided in-country diplomatic\nrepresentation and invaluable assistance. Like the\nUnited States, Japan has been steadily involved in\nPalau\u2019s development, and I would submit that this\nspecial familiarity with Palau\u2019s people has enhanced\nJapan and the United States every bit as much as it has\naided Palau.\nPalau has been disappointed by the failure of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session to\naccomplish Security Council reform, particularly\nbecause Japan\u2019s deep knowledge of our region would\ninform Council members who have less familiarity\nwith the situation of the Pacific islands. We supported\nand continue to support therefore the Group of Four\nresolution and hope that the sixtieth General Assembly\nwill finish this critical work that was begun last year.\nA third steady supporter of Palau\u2019s development\nhas been the Republic of China on Taiwan. We\ncontinue to assert that the world would be benefited by\nTaiwan\u2019s membership in this august body. This year\nPalau was a sponsor of a resolution calling for a\nproactive role for the United Nations in addressing the\nrising tensions in the Taiwan Strait. We regret that the\ndebate on that important resolution was foreshortened\nin the General Committee and that we were prevented\nfrom expressing our views on this topic; however we\nare glad that we have an opportunity to do that now.\nThe people of the Pacific, and the Pacific island\nnations themselves, are under-represented in the\nSecretariat and in the governing bodies, commissions\nand tribunals of the world. Our cohesive and effective\nregional group, the Pacific Islands Forum, is most\nfortunate in having Australia and New Zealand among\nus. But it is time, we submit, for the new island nations\nto take a more active role and to share their unique and\ngraceful Pacific way with the rest of the world. It is\nquite possible, I submit, that the islands are\nmarginalized in part by the irrational composition of\nthe regional groups. Strengthening the United Nations\nshould include a realignment of the groups to better\nreflect the proliferation of Pacific countries, which has\noccurred in the last 20 years, and the actual geography\nof the world. This would allow the island nations to\ncompete more effectively for seats on major bodies.\nFor this reason, Palau suggests the reform of the\nsystem and the creation of an East Asia and Pacific\nGroup and that this group include, of course with their\nconsent, our friends in Australia and New Zealand."

        "file_text": "Allow me to begin by\ncongratulating the President of the General Assembly\nat its fifty-ninth session, Mr. Jean Ping of Gabon, and\nall Member States on the successful adoption of the\n2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1). The\nsummit outcome document was the product of months\nof consultations and negotiations. We wish to we pay\ntribute to Mr. Ping for skilfully guiding the process to\nits conclusion. We also wish to congratulate Mr. Jan\n33\n\nEliasson on his election as President of the General\nAssembly at its sixtieth session. Let me assure him of\nmy delegation\u2019s full support and cooperation in the\ntasks that lie ahead in this session.\nBy adopting the summit outcome document, we\nreaffirmed our belief in the purposes and principles of\nthe United Nations and agreed to take appropriate and\nurgent steps to achieve the Millennium Development\nGoals (MDGs). We also committed ourselves to\nrenewing the Organization to make it more efficient,\neffective and transparent so that it can be more\nresponsive to the numerous and varied challenges and\nexpectations of our times and, indeed, can save\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war,\nmaintain international peace and security, develop\nfriendly relations among nations and, most important,\npromote social progress and better standards of life in\nlarger freedom.\nWe must work together in a serious and concerted\nmanner to achieve the MDGs and other goals outlined\nin the summit outcome document. We must create a\nworld that is free from hunger, poverty and\ndeprivation. We must create a world of greater\neconomic opportunity for developing countries. We\nmust create a world in which people are free to live in\ndignity, a world that does not tolerate \u2014 or fail to\nrespond by protecting populations under threat of \u2014\ngenocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing or crimes\nagainst humanity. This is no time for business as usual.\nWe must be urgent and focused in our action.\nIt is a matter of great concern to us all that if\ncurrent trends persist, many African countries will not\nachieve most of the MDGs by 2015. Some African\ncountries have actually regressed since 2000 in their\nefforts to achieve MDG targets. Poverty, hunger and\ninfectious diseases lay waste entire communities and\nnations, often exacerbate the effects of war and\nconflict, and make the prospects for recovery infinitely\nmore problematic. Urgent action needs to be taken to\nreverse those trends.\nWe need greater commitment from developed\ncountries, particularly with respect to increasing\nofficial development assistance to at least 0.7 per cent\nof gross national income, freer and fairer trade and\ndebt cancellation. Let me remind the Assembly that the\ntarget of 0.7 per cent of the gross national income for\nofficial development assistance was set by our\nAssembly more than 40 years ago and that, as we\nspeak, only five countries have reached it. The time for\nspeeches and debate is over. We must have action on\nthose issues.\nMost of us have now come to understand the\ninterconnectedness and interdependence of all nations\naround the world and the nexus between security and\ndevelopment. Poverty, hunger and deprivation in\nsub-Saharan Africa are bad for peace and security in all\n191 nations represented here today. By recognizing that\ninterdependence, we accept that there are collective\nresponsibilities and obligations, as well as collective\nbenefits and opportunities. The responsibilities include,\nin the words of the Charter, to \u201cpromote social progress\nand better standards of life in larger freedom\u201d. We can\nhave neither security without development nor\ndevelopment without security at the national, regional\nand international levels. It is both unacceptable and\nunsustainable for one half of the world to live amid\nwealth and plenty while the other half dies from\ndisease and hunger.\nOur Governments are judged according to their\nactions, not according to ideals or principles. Similarly,\nthe United Nations should be judged according to its\nactions, not according to the values and principles laid\nout in the Charter. It is our experience that, while the\nUnited Nations is immaculate in its values and\nprinciples, it has all too often been found wanting in its\nactions. If there is any advice we can offer to the\nUnited Nations on its sixtieth birthday, the advice\nwould be that it must learn from its mistakes and be\nmore effective in implementation.\nThere are probably no States members of this\nAssembly apart from Rwanda where the United\nNations has consistently neglected to learn from its\nmistakes, resulting in massive loss of life and untold\nmisery. Allow me to explain. It was in 1959, while\nRwanda was still under United Nations trusteeship,\nthat the first acts of genocide against Tutsis took place\nthere, leading to the first mass refugee problem on the\nAfrican continent. The United Nations watched\nunmoved and no action was ever taken. In the years\nfollowing 1959, the United Nations stood by in silence\nand inaction as pogroms took place throughout the\ncountry, resulting in massive loss of life and\ncompounding the refugee crisis.\nMore recently, in 1994, while the United Nations\nhad a huge political and military presence in Rwanda,\nit watched without taking action the planning and\n34\n\nimplementation of genocide. We all recall the shocking\ndecision of the Security Council to withdraw\npeacekeepers at a time when hundreds of thousands of\ndefenceless people needed them most.\nWhen the genocide was totally consummated, the\nSecurity Council mandated one of its members to send\ntroops to the country, which only succeeded in\nallowing the perpetrators of the genocide safe passage\nout of Rwanda and into the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo, from where they have been a major source of\ninsecurity and instability for the entire subregion. Over\nthe last 11 years, our repeated appeals to disarm and\ndemobilize those genocidal forces have, if not fallen of\ndeaf ears, yielded no results.\nI raise those examples to highlight the fact that\nRwanda is probably the country most interested in\nUnited Nations reform. We wish to take back home\nfrom this meeting a message of hope and a promise to\nour people that we have reinvented a United Nations\nthat will never betray them again.\nMy Government welcomes the endorsement of\nthe \u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d in the summit outcome\ndocument. The responsibility to protect includes a\nresponsibility to prevent genocide, crimes against\nhumanity and ethnic cleansing, as well as a\nresponsibility to prevent incitement to commit those\ncrimes.\nBut here again, action, not words, will be the\nmeasure of our success or failure. How will the United\nNations respond the next time action to protect\npopulations is required? Will there be lengthy\nacademic and legal debates on what constitutes\ngenocide or crimes against humanity, while people die?\nWhat is clear to us is that no nation or people\nshould have to face the horrors that we faced 11 years\nago. Where a State is unable or unwilling to protect its\npeople, as was the case in Rwanda in 1994, then the\nresponsibility to provide such protection should \u2014 and\nindeed must \u2014 shift immediately to the international\ncommunity. Such action should be taken by the\nSecurity Council in a timely and decisive manner in\norder to save the lives of populations under threat. Our\npledge of \u201cnever again\u201d to genocide should not ring\nhollow the next time we are confronted with such\ncrimes.\nA collective international response to genocide\nincludes a responsibility for all States to combat\nimpunity and bring to justice any persons accused of\nhaving committed such crimes. We find it inexplicable\nthat, while some States profess commitment to the\nCharter, human rights and international law, they allow\nknown suspects of the Rwanda genocide to live in their\ncountries and take no action to apprehend them and\ntransfer them to the International Criminal Tribunal for\nRwanda or to Rwanda for prosecution. Those States\nmust be challenged, if necessary by the Security\nCouncil, to fulfil their international obligations to\napprehend and transfer those fugitives for prosecution.\nRwanda, as a country emerging from conflict,\nunderstands better the usefulness of and strongly\nsupports the plans to establish a peacebuilding\ncommission. We have indeed seen the United Nations\nspend hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions,\non peacekeeping missions that leave behind no\nrepaired road or bridge, no rehabilitated school or\nhealth centre in the countries where they have been\ndeployed. Instead, they leave behind children who will\nnever know their fathers and are most vulnerable to\npoverty. Those resources could be better spent to create\nlasting peace and stability.\nWe must, however, ensure that the commission\ndoes not become another bureaucracy that is difficult\nto access and out of touch with the realities in\ncountries emerging from conflict. It should take a long-\nterm approach to post-conflict recovery and change the\ncurrent practice whereby short-term approaches to\nlong-standing conflicts mean that we apply mere\n\u201cband-aid\u201d solutions to highly complex situations.\nThe Commission should consult actively and\nwidely with the countries affected and those countries\nthat have successfully emerged from conflict in the\nrecent past. It must also ensure local ownership of\nsolutions and outcomes so that its work can be\nsustainable.\nWe believe that the Security Council should be\nreformed to improve its transparency and\naccountability. The reform process should enable\nStates that are not members of the Council to\nparticipate more actively in its deliberative processes,\nespecially on issues that affect them. A reformed\nCouncil should be seen by all States to be more\naccessible, transparent and credible.\nTerrorism continues to brutally kill innocent\ncivilians. We must all join hands to fight that evil of\nour times. My country will continue to lend its support\n35\n\nto international efforts to combat terrorism. We\nwelcome the decision to negotiate and conclude a\ncomprehensive convention against terrorism and my\ncountry stands ready to partake in that effort. We\nbelieve, however, that what is lacking is not a\nconvention but a universally shared commitment to\nfight the evil. After all, in 1994, we had a Convention\nagainst genocide that was 46 years old, and yet\ngenocide occurred in my country.\nTurning to issues closer to home, we welcome the\nprogress made in the peace process in Burundi. We\ncongratulate the newly elected Government and stand\nready to work closely with the Government and people\nof Burundi and the international community to\nconsolidate that commendable progress.\nWe also welcome the progress being made in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, where the\nTransitional Government has prepared a draft\nconstitution and has begun the process of registering\nvoters for elections. Progress is also being made with\nrespect to the integration of the armed forces. We\nwelcome all those developments, recognizing that they\ncontribute to sustainable peace and stability in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and in the wider\nregion. We also stand ready to continue to support the\ntransition process in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo.\nWe would also like to take this opportunity to\nrenew our commitment and support for the\nInternational Conference on the Great Lakes Region.\nMy Government looks forward to the forthcoming\nsecond summit, to be held in Nairobi in December. The\nsummit must come up with concrete measures to deal\ndecisively with the menace of the genocidal militias\nthat continue to roam freely in the region and frustrate\nour collective peace efforts.\nMy Government\u2019s commitment to peace and\nsecurity in the region is demonstrated through our\nparticipation in the peacekeeping Mission in the Sudan,\nwhere Rwanda is the biggest troop contributor.\nThe role of the international community is\ncritical. In that connection, we would like to pay\nspecial tribute to the United States Government for its\nassistance and support, which have led to the\nestablishment of a tripartite mechanism comprising the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and\nUganda to examine and resolve issues that could result\nin tensions between the three countries.\nWe also welcome the role of the African Union\nand the United Nations in advancing the prospects for\nsustainable peace and security in the region.\nFinally, let us this time build a United Nations\nthat, in addition to having good words to say about life,\nis one which nourishes and protects life all over the\nworld."

I would also like to pay high tribute\nto Mr. Jean Ping, your predecessor, for his\ndistinguished leadership.\nThe 60-year history of the United Nations has\nbeen a pathway towards a peaceful, prosperous and just\nworld.

Japan will spare no\neffort in that endeavour.\nThe new United Nations must be equipped with a\nbetter peacebuilding capacity. We expect the proposed\nPeacebuilding Commission to help to achieve that\nobjective. To that end, Japan will continue to play a\nconstructive role, making full use of its experience and\nresources.\nIn the Gaza Strip, the reconstruction effort after\nthe Israeli withdrawal has been crucial. Japan has\nimplemented more than $110 million worth of\nassistance since the beginning of this year, in the\nfervent hope that we will now see the resumption of\nthe road map.\nAs the largest donor to the Trust Fund for Iraqi\nreconstruction, Japan has devoted its energies to\nbringing together the international community in the\nreconstruction effort. Humanitarian and reconstruction\nassistance by Japan's Self-Defence Forces and official\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) are contributing in\ntandem to progress towards a peaceful and prosperous\nIraq. Japan has pledged ODA amounting to $5 billion,\nof which $1.5 billion in grant assistance has already\nbeen implemented.\nJapan has taken the lead in assisting the Afghan\nefforts for disarmament, demobilization and\nreintegration (DDR), in conjunction with the United\nNations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA).\nAs a result, about 63,000 ex-combatants are to\ncomplete the reintegration programme by the end of\nnext June. Japanese Self-Defence Forces vessels are\nengaged in activities in the Indian Ocean in support of\nthe countries fighting against terrorism. Japan has\nannounced that its contribution will total $1 billion by\nthe end of March 2006, including assistance in the field\nof security.\nIt is essential to ensure a sense of justice in a\nsociety struggling to recover from its suffering in the\naftermath of conflict. In the area of establishing the\nrule of law, Japan, in cooperation with the Government\nof Cambodia, has taken the lead in setting up a tribunal\nto try members of the Khmer Rouge, with a\ncontribution of over $20 million.\n41\n\nSixty summers have passed since Hiroshima and\nNagasaki suffered the indescribable horrors of nuclear\ndevastation. Japan again calls upon all Member States\nto renew their determination to bring about a peaceful\nworld free of nuclear weapons.\nTo that end, Japan will submit a draft resolution\nto the General Assembly presenting a concrete agenda\nto strengthen the disarmament and non-proliferation\nregime, including a call for the early entry into force of\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).\nIn that regard, it is extremely regrettable that the 2005\nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)\nconcluded without adopting a consensus document on\nsubstantive issues, and that the outcome document\nfound no consensus on disarmament and non-\nproliferation.\nThe Democratic People's Republic of Korea\u00eds\nnuclear programmes pose a serious challenge to the\ninternational non-proliferation regime, centring on the\nNPT, and constitute a direct threat to peace and\nstability in North-East Asia. Japan is committed to a\npeaceful resolution of the nuclear issue through the six-\nparty talks and strongly hopes that the Democratic\nPeople\u00eds Republic of Korea will accept the prompt and\nverifiable dismantlement of all its nuclear weapons and\nnuclear programmes at the current round of talks in\nBeijing. Japan will continue to make every effort to\nensure that the nuclear issue, along with the missile\nand abduction issues, is comprehensively resolved in\naccordance with the Pyongyang Declaration.\nJapan believes that the Iranian nuclear issue\nshould be resolved through negotiations by diplomatic\nmeans. To that end, Japan strongly urges Iran to\nimplement, in a spirit of sincerity, all the requirements\nset out in the relevant resolutions of the International\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors,\nincluding the full suspension of uranium conversion\nactivities, and to return to the negotiating table with the\nthree European Union States.\nIn recent years, we have witnessed countless\ntragedies caused by terrorist acts. Japan, for its part,\nhas continued to provide assistance to countries in need\nof capacity-building in the area of counter-terrorism.\nTo consolidate the international legal framework, Japan\ncalls on Member States to join international counter-\nterrorism conventions and protocols, including the\nnewly adopted International Convention for the\nSuppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.\nDevelopment provides a foundation for peace and\nstability. The new United Nations must serve as an\neffective Organization for the promotion of\ndevelopment. Having recovered from the devastation\nof the Second World War with global assistance, Japan\nis in a better position than any other country to\ndemonstrate the significance of ownership and\npartnership, poverty reduction through economic\ngrowth, and human security in promoting development.\nThe concept of human security \u00f3 focusing on the\nprotection and empowerment of individuals \u00f3 offers a\nmeaningful approach in a world striving for freedom\nand dignity. The concept also provides an important\nviewpoint with respect to the protection of human\nrights. I look forward to forthcoming discussions on\nthis concept in the General Assembly, to which leaders\ncommitted themselves in the outcome document.\nBased on its experiences as a recipient, and also a\ndonor for more than a half century, Japan has been\nkeen to make an impact on world development and\nthus has contributed one-fifth of world ODA over the\npast 10 years. Japan is resolved to continue its support\nfor achieving the Millennium Development Goals\n(MDGs). To that end, Japan intends to increase its\nODA volume by $10 billion over the next five years.\nFor the achievement of the MDGs, addressing the\nissues facing Africa is critically important. As Prime\nMinister Koizumi announced during the Asia-Africa\nsummit, Japan will double its ODA to Africa in the\nnext three years and host the fourth Tokyo\nInternational Conference on African Development\n(TICAD) meeting in 2008. In an effort to support\nAfricans\u00ed own efforts to bring about peace and\nstability, Japan has devoted its energies to the\nconsolidation of peace in such countries as the Sudan,\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone,\nBurundi and Liberia.\nWith respect to the Sudan, Japan has decided to\ndisburse more than half of its pledged assistance of\n$100 million, with a contribution of personnel through\nthe United Nations Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS).\nFurthermore, to address the humanitarian crisis in\nAfrica and in other regions caused by infectious\ndiseases, Japan has announced $500 million in\nfinancial assistance in the coming years for the Global\nFund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Japan\n42\n\nwill contribute $5 billion over the next five years to the\n\u00ecHealth and Development\u00ee Initiative. Japan has also\ntaken steps to address the \u00ecforgotten crises\u00ee in Africa\nand will continue to focus on those issues.\nAt no other time in its history has an effective,\nefficient and credible United Nations been more\nneeded than today. The credibility of the United\nNations is at stake. The basic structure of the Security\nCouncil continues to reflect the world of 1945. Reform\nof the Security Council therefore remains key to\nachieving the overall renewal of the United Nations.\nThe fact that an overwhelming majority of Member\nStates - 166 countries in all - called for Security\nCouncil reform during the previous session of the\nGeneral Assembly is a testament to the urgent need for\nreform.\nFor the first time in the 60-year history of the\nUnited Nations, during the last General Assembly\nsession we witnessed the submission of draft\nresolutions calling for fundamental change in the\ncomposition of the Security Council. Japan is proud to\nhave taken the lead in promoting Security Council\nreform. It is encouraging, as well, that a large number\nof leaders at the recent summit expressed their support\nfor reform.\nI believe that Japan's path of striving for\ninternational peace speaks for itself, and should serve\nas the basis for a larger role for Japan as a permanent\nmember of a reformed Security Council. I can assure\nyou, Mr. President, that Japan will continue to make its\nutmost effort to realize the reform under your\nleadership. And I call on Member States to reach an\nearly decision at this session of the General Assembly.\nThe new United Nations requires an efficient and\neffective Secretariat, with a strong sense of integrity.\nJapan is deeply concerned about recent developments,\nincluding the failure over the oil-for-food programme.\nThe management and administration of the United\nNations system must be transparent and accountable to\nMember States and their citizens. In this regard, Japan\nwill promote and conduct more comprehensive\nperformance evaluation of United Nations activities.\nWith respect to the anachronistic \u00ecenemy State\u00ee\nclauses, I am pleased to note that the leaders resolved\nin the outcome document (resolution 60/1) to delete\nthese obsolete clauses from the Charter at the earliest\nopportunity.\nA comprehensive review is also needed in order\nto reach agreement on a scale of assessment structure\nthat is more equitable and fair. Japan will actively\nparticipate in the negotiations to be concluded by the\nend of next year. In the upcoming negotiation process,\nJapan will make its utmost effort to ensure that the\nstatus and responsibilities of a Member State are duly\ntaken into account in the scale of assessments.\nWe have embarked on a mission to renew the\nUnited Nations. A great deal of work lies ahead. I call\nupon all representatives in this Hall to dedicate\nthemselves to accomplishing this unfinished mission\nby the close of this commemorative session of the\nGeneral Assembly."

        "file_text": "Following closely, as it\ndoes, on the heels of last week\u2019s High-level Plenary\nMeeting, the remainder of the sixtieth session of the\nGeneral Assembly is challenged to take steps towards\nthe early implementation of the agreed outcome. In the\neyes of many, the summit document (resolution 60/1)\nis less than satisfactory in terms of both its scope and\nits substance. Nonetheless, it represents a common\nplatform on which we can build further to reach higher\nlevels of international cooperation.\nTo you, Mr. President, my dear friend, falls the\ntask of spearheading that enterprise. Your outstanding\ndiplomatic experience assures us all that you will\nsucceed in the mandate given to you. If I am to give\nyou any advice on how you should now proceed, I\nwould simply echo \u2014 and then perhaps very slightly\nparaphrase \u2014 the words of Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld, your\ncompatriot and former Secretary-General, when he\nsaid, \u201cNever measure the height of a mountain until\nyou have reached the top\u201d. To this I would add, then\nyou will see that the climb was not all that bad.\nWe owe a debt of gratitude to His Excellency\nMr. Jean Ping of Gabon, the outgoing President, for his\neffective stewardship of the work of the Assembly\nduring the fifty-ninth session. To the Secretary-General\nI wish to express our appreciation for his effort to\nequip our Organization for the challenges that we\nconfront today.\nI would also like to offer our appreciation and\nthanks to our host country, the United States, and to\nrenew to it our assurances of sympathy with regard to\nthe severe losses suffered in the wake of Hurricane\nKatrina.\nAs was stated earlier by President Jagdeo of\nGuyana (see A/60/PV.8), international development\ngoals \u2014 and especially the Millennium Development\nGoals, which were set at the Summit five years ago and\nwhich we have just reviewed \u2014 remain an important\nbenchmark for global development. Aimed at securing\nthe important prerequisites for our economic and social\nadvancement in such areas as health, education and\nother basic services, they must be fully embraced and\npursued by the international community.\nMy own country has been diligent in working\ntowards those objectives. Through a visionary poverty-\nreduction strategy and the allocation of more resources\nto the social sector, we have been able to improve the\nlot of the disadvantaged among our population and\nenlarge their opportunities for a better life.\nUnfortunately, however, further progress is now being\njeopardized by a number of untoward developments.\nAmong these has been the recent revision of Europe\u2019s\nagriculture policy, and more particularly the European\nCommission\u2019s proposal to drastically reduce the price\nfor the sugar exports of African, Caribbean and Pacific\nStates. That proposal, if implemented, will seriously\naffect our own sugar industry and will plunge many of\nour people who depend on it into extreme poverty.\nOur economy stands to lose some $40 million per\nyear, a sum that nullifies the $8 million which we will\nhave received as a result of the recent Group of Eight\ndecisions on debt relief. The result is an example of the\nskewed and often incoherent policies pursued by some\ndeveloped countries. Without consultation or warning,\nthey adopt measures that wreak enormous havoc on the\neconomies of developing countries, particularly the\nsmall and the vulnerable.\nThe only hope on the horizon for us lies in the\npromise held out by several recent initiatives, such as\nthe Millennium Challenge Account of the United\nStates, the International Finance Facility of the United\nKingdom, the Action Against Hunger and Poverty\nInitiative, led by Brazil and other States, and, more\nlatterly, the levy on air travel suggested by France and\n11\n\nothers for the financing of development. As the review\nof the Millennium Development Goals has revealed, an\nadditional $50 billion will be needed annually to reach\nthe targets set. New and additional resources are\ntherefore clearly required if we are to make any impact\non global poverty.\nWhile we in the developing world would prefer to\nrely on trade instead of aid for our development, the\nprospects for improving our position are bleak. The\nroad from Canc\u00fan to Dalian to Hong Kong has been\ntedious, strewn with obstacles and, now, highly\nuncertain. As in New York, developed countries seem\ncontent with making broad declarations rather than\nspecific commitments. The calls by small economies\nfor special and differential treatment have thus far been\nonly grudgingly acknowledged. Yet, without full regard\nfor paragraph 35 of the Doha Declaration, countries\nlike mine are likely to be further marginalized by the\nglobal economy.\nEconomic and social progress will come to the\ndeveloping world only when its countries are allowed\nto have a say in the decision-making on development\nissues. The chapter in the 2005 Human Development\nReport on our interdependent world quotes an African\nproverb that states that \u201cUntil the lions have their\nhistorians \u2026 tales of hunting will always glorify the\nhunter\u201d (p. 113). It is therefore time for the developing\nworld, which has long been considered only an object\nin the development process, to be given a more active\nand participatory role in the process. Only then will we\nbe able properly to address the outcome of our policies.\nMany of the prescriptions for poverty eradication\nhave been based on the time-worn theory of\ndevelopment that posits that the increasing economic\nprosperity of the developed world will eventually raise\nthe standard of living for all States \u2014 that is to say,\nthat a rising tide lifts all boats. But any serious analysis\nof that development paradigm as it has functioned over\nthe past several decades will amply demonstrate that\nthat is a very flawed concept. The gap between rich\nand poor countries continues to widen, a reality to\nwhich the 2005 Human Development Report amply\ntestifies.\nThere therefore has to be a serious global\nrethinking of what constitutes real and sustainable\ndevelopment. We cannot avoid the conclusion that\nwhile the realization of the Millennium Development\nGoals will provide the necessary foundation for\ndevelopment, true economic and social progress cannot\nbe achieved in the absence of a more comprehensive\npolicy framework that encompasses significant\nassistance and investment flows, wider debt relief,\nmore equitable trade and economic cooperation and the\ntransfer of science and technology for development\npurposes. That realization has led my Government to\nadvocate at the United Nations the promotion of a new\nglobal human order: a more comprehensive and holistic\nstrategy based on equity and social justice.\nWith regard to the second major area of concern\naddressed in the Secretary-General\u2019s report entitled \u201cIn\nlarger freedom\u201d (A/59/2005) \u2014 namely, the issues of\ndemocracy, human rights and security \u2014 let me say\nthat Guyana, as a newly restored democracy, fully\nsupports the promotion of all fundamental human\nfreedoms and values. After all, they constitute the\nbedrock of the United Nations Charter and the basic\nrights of our peoples. We therefore welcome the\ninitiative to establish a Democracy Fund to propagate\nthe democratic ideal, as well as the setting up of a\nHuman Rights Council to replace the current\nCommission on Human Rights.\nRaising the status of the Commission on Human\nRights can do much to enhance respect for human\nrights. We are concerned, however, about the\nrepresentative character of the proposed Council and\nwould be seriously distressed if it were to emerge as an\nelite directorate sitting in judgement of other States\ndeemed to be less than equal. The holier-than-thou\nattitude of some countries on matters relating to\ndemocracy and human rights is not acceptable in an\nOrganization founded on the principles of the equality\nof States, mutual understanding and respect. No one is\nperfect, and we all fall short of the glory of God. It\nwould therefore be imperative for the General\nAssembly, in its further consideration of that proposal,\nto carefully examine such issues as the criteria for\nmembership, size and voting procedures, in order to\nensure that the principles of the Charter are not\nvitiated.\nFinally, there is the third leg of the report\u2019s\nthematic tripod, namely, security. As is now\nuniversally recognized, security is a sine qua non for\nthe protection of democracy and human rights, as well\nas for the promotion of development. It is therefore\nessential, in view of the vast array of threats to\ninternational peace and security, that we mount the\nnecessary defences against the spread of terrorism,\n12\n\ntransboundary crime, arms and drug trafficking,\ndisease and the increasing incidence of natural\ndisasters, which must now be an integral process of our\ndevelopment analysis. Unfortunately, however, the cost\nof such measures takes a very heavy toll on our limited\nhuman and financial resources \u2014 resources that can be\nbetter spent in the area of development.\nTo illustrate the challenge we face, let me cite the\ncase of my own country, which, after suffering a\ndisastrous flood earlier this year that led to a loss of\nalmost 60 per cent of our gross domestic product\n(GDP) \u2014 according to an assessment by the Economic\nCommission for Latin America and the Caribbean \u2014\nnow faces spiralling oil prices, amounting, in terms of\nexpenditure, to 24 per cent of GDP and heavy revenue\nloss to our sugar-export earnings. How can one speak\nmeaningfully in such circumstances of achieving the\nMillennium Development Goals? Small countries like\nours have to find solutions to these pressing problems,\nor else run the risk of being thrust further back into\nunderdevelopment.\nFor several decades now, we have been seeking to\nreform the United Nations system to make it more\nresponsive to the challenges of our times. To some\nextent we have succeeded in our effort but, clearly,\nmuch more remains to be done. We therefore urge the\nPresident to hold to his promise and to pursue the\nrevitalization of the General Assembly, the most\ndemocratic and representative of the United Nations\norgans, to enable it to promote the high principles and\npurposes of the Charter. The potential of the\nAssembly\u2019s role in fighting the scourge of war and\npromoting development is yet to be fully explored and\nexploited. At the same time, it is necessary to bring\ndevelopment issues, which are now largely the purview\nof multilateral financial institutions, more fully within\nthe ambit of the United Nations, particularly the\nEconomic and Social Council, where developing\ncountries can have a greater voice on matters\npertaining to their welfare.\nOf some urgency is the reform of the Security\nCouncil, the organ responsible for the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. It is time that the\nCouncil be made more equitable in its composition,\nmore democratic in its decision-making and more\neffective in its operation. The deliberations of the\nrelevant working group have generated wide-spread\nagreement on the need for expansion of the Council\u2019s\nmembership. The various permutations have been\nexplored, and all options are on the table. We are now\noffered a historic opportunity to reform the Council \u2014\nan opportunity that, if not taken now, may not soon\ncome our way again. My delegation therefore urges the\nAssembly to expedite and conclude its work in this\narea.\nThe latest proposal for an advisory Peacebuilding\nCommission is a welcome one, since there is a clear\nrelationship between conflict and development. Much\ntoo often, the gains made in the area of conflict\nresolution are rapidly negated by the lack of\naccompanying measures to preserve stability and\nencourage development. Such a commission, if\nproperly conceived and constituted, can usefully\ncomplement and optimize the work of the principal\norgans of the United Nations.\nIn the end, however, if we are to achieve a\nstronger, more democratic and effective United\nNations, we will have to go beyond the reform of its\norgans and agencies to a reform of the attitudes and\nbehaviour of States, which, while giving lip service to\nsuch concepts as partnership, cohesion and\ninterdependence, fail to practice those virtues in their\nrelations with other States. There is always a vast\ndivide between declarations and deeds. Yet, the\nimplementation of the common agenda that we have set\nourselves at the sixtieth session is not possible without\na greater commitment to change.\nAs the 2005 Human Development Report states, it\ncannot be business as usual for the United Nations. The\nMillennium Declaration must be more than a paper\npromise. We need to\n\u201cmobilize the investment resources and develop\nthe plans needed to build the defences that can\nstop the tsunami of world poverty\u201d. (2005 Human\nDevelopment Report, p. 2)\nThat is the challenge issued to the sixtieth session\nof the General Assembly, and the yardstick by which\nits success will be judged. For the sake of the billions\nwho continue to live in fear and want, we must seek to\nachieve that larger freedom that is the birthright of all\nhumankind."

        "file_text": "The\nsummit of our leaders is over. Each of us here at the\nGeneral Assembly has different feelings about it. Mine,\nI must say, are anxiety and hope. I am anxious not\nabout the future of the United Nations as an\nOrganization \u2014 its existence, after all, is not an end in\nitself \u2014 but about what the future of the United\nNations holds.\nI place my hope in the future of the United\nNations, because the present does not evoke unbridled\noptimism. There is but one source of optimism for all\nof us: that the summit, just finished, may serve as a\nwake-up call for us.\nErnest Hemingway, an American who lived in\nEurope, evoked John Donne, who wrote, \u201cnever send\nto know for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee\u201d. This\nturned out to be appallingly apt. Hemingway\u2019s \u201cFor\nWhom the Bell Tolls\u201d was written in the late 1930s and\nis set at the time and in the country where Guernica\nwas destroyed. It is no coincidence that a depiction of\nthat destruction hangs outside the Security Council\nChamber. We all know what happened afterwards:\nfrom the ruins of the world the United Nations\nemerged.\nBelarus is not a doomsayer. Indeed, we ourselves\nexperienced the utter horror of the Second World War\nin greater measure than anyone else and we do not\nwant to see it repeated. But during the sixtieth\nanniversary year of the victory and of the founding of\nthe United Nations, it is quite appropriate to recall\nthese things.\nI do not want to state the obvious: that the United\nNations is the Organization of all States, large and\nsmall, rich and poor. In this Organization everyone has\nequal rights and all work together to create the main\nproduct: peace. Yet I have to mention this because\nunder the banner of reform there is a move to turn our\nOrganization \u2014 de facto and de jure \u2014 into an\ninstrument for the domination of some States by others.\nWe all have witnessed this.\nA short while ago it was officially proposed that\nwe approve a new decision-making procedure for the\nspecialized agencies: those who pay more would have\nmore votes. Now it is being proposed that we elect\nmembers to the main human rights body of the United\nNations on the basis of subjective criteria. This is a\ndangerous trend, and a deviation from the United\nNations Charter. It will lead to the splintering of the\nUnited Nations.\nDoes the United Nations really need reform\nwhich creates preconditions for the more frequent and\nmore arbitrary use of force at the sole discretion of the\nmighty? We are against reform which would turn the\nOrganization created out of the ashes of the Second\nWorld War into an instrument of diktat by the militarily\nand economically most powerful States. Does the\n17\n\nUnited Nations need reform which would divide\ncountries into those \u201cworthy\u201d and those \u201cunworthy\u201d of\ninternational assistance, into pupils and teachers in\nmatters of governance and social development? We do\nnot want such reform.\nTo preserve and build upon the core values of the\nUnited Nations Charter, taking into account the\nrealities of today, is the major task of genuine reform\nthat our Organization really needs. The diversity of\nroutes to progress is among those core values. At the\nsummit, the President of the Republic of Belarus\nstressed that this can ensure the stability of the world\nand is an enduring value of our civilization (see\nA/60/PV.5). In today\u2019s unipolar world, this value is not\nonly belittled but challenged as well.\nWhat is behind the calls we heard in this Hall last\nweek to \u201chelp those who wish to help themselves\u201d? In\npractice this is a selective approach which recognizes\nthe right to development only for those countries which\nhave adopted government and economic reforms in\naccordance with a strictly defined model. Let us\nconsider whether we need to clone this model the\nworld over. Does it represent the strength and the value\nof our civilization? Does it represent the value of the\nUnited Nations? What can this one-sided world give to\npeople? Will it be a comfortable home for our\nchildren?\nToday, as never before, we need to take an honest\nlook at our world, which would allow us to discuss\ncritical problems in a free and transparent manner and\nto look together for ways to solve them.\nAn honest look at today\u2019s world, for instance,\nwould not allow us to overlook the problem of\ntrafficking in human beings. This disgrace of the\ntwenty-first century has overtaken all regions of the\nworld. The most vulnerable \u2014 women and children,\nwhose protection should be the priority task of the\nUnited Nations \u2014 serve as living merchandise. Forced\nadolescent labour, the sexual enslavement of women\nand girls and trafficking in human organs should be\ndecisively opposed by all States and prohibited in their\nlegislation.\nThere is much to do in this sphere. Today, after\nall, fewer than half of Member States have ratified the\nProtocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking\nin Persons, Especially Women and Children. Just over\na dozen countries have adopted national strategies or\naction plans to combat trafficking in human beings.\nBut it will be possible to turn this social evil back only\nthrough a universal effort. In that respect, we consider\nit extremely important that all parties involved in that\ncriminal trade be held responsible, including the\nconsumers of those human commodities. It is high time\nfor us to launch a decisive and organized campaign at\nthe United Nations against all forms of trafficking in\nand exploitation of human beings, and to forge a global\npartnership against slavery and trafficking in human\nbeings in the twenty-first century.\nLooking honestly at today\u2019s world we cannot\nignore the long-term effects of the Chernobyl disaster.\nThe largest manmade disaster of the twentieth century,\nit has negatively impacted on the lives of millions of\npeople and caused enormous economic damage. In\nBelarus alone, the disaster caused US$ 235 billion in\ndamages. The Government of Belarus has\naccomplished much in the years since the disaster to\nminimize its effects. Now the time has come to assess\nthe effectiveness of international assistance in that area\nand to chart the priorities for our joint work for the\ncoming decade. Those are the issues that will be on the\nagenda of the international conference on the\nChernobyl disaster to be held in April 2006 in Minsk.\nWe call on Member States and all those who care about\nthe fate of the millions of Chernobyl victims to support\nthe Assembly\u2019s adoption of the draft resolution on\nChernobyl. Finally, we propose the convening of a\nspecial meeting of the General Assembly on 26 April\n2006 to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the\nChernobyl tragedy.\nBelarus is a country that is used to relying on\nitself. We are not seeking any unfair international\nadvantages nor do we follow anyone else\u2019s political\nlead. We have confidence in the strength, talent and\ndiligence of our people. That is what allows us to speak\nand act in a principled and honest fashion in the\ninternational arena, without reference to the wishes of\nthe powerful.\nIt is precisely for that reason that we stand for an\nopen and honest dialogue at the United Nations. This is\nour common home. Here, the same simple,\nunconditional and clear principle should apply for all\ncountries: equal among equals. The future of the\nUnited Nations rests on that. Belarus is ready to work\nwith everyone to make that future happen."

        "file_text": "Allow me to congratulate you most warmly, Sir, on\nyour election as President of the General Assembly.\nThrough you, I would like also to thank your\npredecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, for the manner in which he\nconducted the preparatory work for the summit of\nHeads of State and Government which has just taken\nplace. We are very grateful to him for having\nsuccessfully met that challenge.\nEven though we had hoped for a more ambitious\nagreement, the summit allowed us to create a much-\nneeded new impetus and new strategic guidelines for\nour Organization. Only a stronger and more legitimate\nUnited Nations will be able to respond to the\nchallenges of the twenty-first century and implement\nthe collective security consensus that we endorsed in\nthe summit's outcome document.\nBelgium is a strong advocate of efficient\nmultilateralism. I emphasize the word \\\"efficient\\\"\nbecause this is not just a declaration of faith. We need\ncredible structures and strong institutions capable of\neffectively implementing our international\ncommitments and addressing our common concerns. It\nis all too easy to indulge in rhetoric; we have to\ntranslate our words into action. That is why, in that\ncontext, I am pleased with the progress made during\nthe summit.\nI am particularly pleased with the consensus\nreached whereby security, peace, development and\nhuman rights are not only interlinked but mutually\nreinforcing. That is a significant step forward in our\nefforts to build a more peaceful, more prosperous and\nmore equitable world. That idea will guide our actions\nand form the basis of our approach. Without peace,\nthere can be no development, and human rights can\noften be sorely tested. In the absence of development\nand respect for human rights, stability and security\nbecome elusive.\nThe link between development, stability and\nhuman rights becomes most acutely apparent in fragile\nor failing States. These are often States devastated by\nconflict or by civil war - States whose leaders are no\nlonger capable of meeting the basic needs of their\npeople. Often, their economic situation has deteriorated\ndramatically, and sometimes their society itself is in\ndisarray. A large number of the people of such States\nmay be displaced. They may have fled, may be subject\nto abuse or exploitation and therefore cannot enjoy any\nof the guarantees that a State should be able to provide\nto its citizens.\nSome States are at risk of becoming zones of\nlawlessness, in which terrorist and criminal activities\ncan thrive. The uncontrolled exploitation of natural\nresources can fuel all sorts of criminal networks or\nconflicts - often with an ethnic dimension - in which\nlarge numbers of weapons can circulate uncontrolled.\nSuch States must return to peace, stability and the\nrule of law. They must take control of their own future\nand gradually begin to consider their prospects for\ndevelopment. This is not an easy task. The challenge is\ntremendous. Almost simultaneously, it is necessary to\nrebuild State institutions; disarm combatants, give\nthem new prospects and reintegrate them into\ncommunities that are often impoverished; reorganize\nthe army and security forces; and give the State the\nmeans to restore its authority, organize elections and\ncreate conditions conducive to development.\nWe must help them break that vicious circle and\nregain their place in the community of nations. In that\nrespect, the establishment of a Peacebuilding\nCommission is crucial. The creation of such a\nCommission not only illustrates our common resolve to\nhelp such States on their path to recovery; it allows us,\nfirst and foremost, better to coordinate and focus our\nefforts. Political, humanitarian, military and financial\nresources must be mobilized and used effectively to\nachieve our common goals.\nThat is particularly true in the case of sub-\nSaharan African countries that are ravaged by deadly\nand prolonged conflicts, with the primary victims\nbeing the civilian population.\nThe establishment of such a Commission would\ngenerate great hope. It is our common responsibility to\nmake it a success. Belgium wants to contribute\nactively, including by sharing the experience it\nacquired in the transition processes in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo and in Burundi.\nBelgium also attaches great importance to\npromoting the protection of human rights. My country\nwelcomes the strengthening of the Office of the High\nCommissioner for Human Rights and the decision to\nestablish a Human Rights Council. But we regret that\nthe summit was not able to finalize the Council\u00eds\nmodalities.\n11\n\nBelgium has fully supported the reform and will\ncontinue to focus on it. Democracy and respect for\nhuman rights are some of our common values and\nunderpin our efforts to promote peace and stability.\nFrom now on, those values will be part of our\ncollective security consensus and must be incorporated\ninto our global approach throughout the entire United\nNations system. They are our common responsibility.\nAmong the summit's other achievements, I\nshould like also to highlight the \\\"responsibility to\nprotect\\\". This represents a step forward in the quest for\nsolutions to the most glaring injustices. In the\naftermath of the genocides that marked our last\ncentury, we solemnly pledged that such atrocities\nwould never happen again.\nLet me now turn to good governance, which is\nessential if our efforts to create a more stable and\nprosperous world are to be successful. The summit\noutcome document repeatedly underlines its\nimportance, and rightly so.\nGood governance is not a moralistic concept\nimposed from the outside. It is not about giving good\nor bad grades, and even less about good and bad\nstudents. It is not for others to say what are good\npolicies and what are bad policies. No \u00f3 good\ngovernance is synonymous with effective governance\nand goes hand in hand with sovereignty. It is about\ngovernance that can produce results, make a difference\nfor citizens and create fertile ground for development.\nWithout it, the support of the international community\ncannot produce the desired results. Without it, the aid\nof the international community will not find the fertile\nground essential to create the conditions for greater\nprosperity and stability.\nWe have pledged to attain the objective of\nallocating 0.7 per cent of our gross national product to\nofficial development assistance. We will keep our\npromise. But we are aware that development is not\nonly a question of money; first and foremost, it is a\nquestion of the effective use of resources. The\nnecessary conditions must be established. What matters\nis the outcome on the ground. Poverty is not inevitable;\nall peoples have a future that belongs to them. They\nmust take charge of it.\nWe accordingly have stated, in paragraph 11 of\nthe summit outcome document (resolution 60/1), \\\"good\ngovernance and the rule of law ... are essential for\nsustained economic growth, sustainable development\nand the eradication of poverty and hunger\\\". In the same\noutcome document, we also clearly reaffirmed our\ncommitment to good governance and the rule of law,\nand reaffirmed that each country must take\nresponsibility for its own development. Those are the\nterms of our global partnership for development, as set\nout in the Millennium Declaration, the Monterrey\nConsensus and the Johannesburg Plan of\nImplementation.\nAll components of the international community\nhave demonstrated generosity. That is particularly true\nof the European Union. But the international\ncommunity can hardly be held responsible for the\nfailure of States to protect or assist all or part of their\npopulations. It is difficult to understand why today we\nmust launch donor appeals to deal with the large-scale\ndestruction of houses by a Government that\ndeliberately leaves some 500,000 of its citizens\nhomeless.\nThat reasoning with regard to the subject of good\ngovernance also applies to the similar concepts of\ndemocracy and the rule of law. Those are extremely\nimportant objectives, both for the development of our\nsocieties and for the security of States. But, neither\ndemocracy nor the rule of law can be artificially\nimposed from outside. This is not about dictating\nexogenous models; we must take a bottom-up approach\nin creating suitable conditions for the emergence of\nmechanisms that ensure people's equitable\nparticipation in their own governance, in a spirit of\ninclusivity. In that regard, our first priorities should be\nthe modernization of societies and States and the\nemancipation of women and children and their\ninclusion in the global dynamic. Past experience shows\nthat the shortest path to democracy and the rule of law\nis the modernization of society. The role - indeed, the\nresponsibility - of the international community is to\ngalvanize that modernization process.\nWe have a great responsibility. Before the end of\nthe year, the Peacebuilding Commission must be\nestablished. We also have the task of making the\nHuman Rights Council operational. I sincerely hope\nthat the spirit that prevailed during the summit will\nalso guide the work of the sixtieth session of the\nGeneral Assembly. We must continue to show\ndetermination, perseverance and vision in carrying out\nour work. Only through constant commitment will we\nmake the United Nations the primary instrument for\ninternational relations.\n12\n\nThat is the important task ahead of us. Our own\ncredibility is at stake. We must once again make the\nUnited Nations the instrument par excellence of our\nstrategy to build a more stable and more prosperous\nworld for all. Our peoples demand that. Belgium is\nwilling to rise to that challenge and to shoulder its\nresponsibilities."

        "file_text": "Let me first welcome\nyou, Sir, to your position. I know we will enjoy\nworking with you, given our past experience. Let me\nalso express our appreciation to the outgoing President\nfor the leadership that he provided during the previous\nsession.\nWhen the Millennium Summit was held in 2000,\nin another New York and another era and before\nunspeakable events overtook our agenda, the lack of\nuniversal economic development was the supreme\nchallenge and security concern that we had. That is\nwhy the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were\ncreated. It took the commitment and firm belief of\nalmost 200 of our world leaders to come up with\nsimple, obvious, straightforward objectives, which I\nthink can be best summed up by Amartya Sen\u2019s\neloquent formulation, \u201cDevelopment as freedom\u201d. Five\nyears later, I think these goals are still relevant and\nthey are no less imperative. Pretending that anything\nless would do is, I think, disingenuous, dangerous and\nunfair.\nIf, today, our focus is on global security, and we\nall clearly understand and see that the path to security\npasses through development, then we should recall\nEleanor Roosevelt, who 60 years ago, working on the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, stated that\nmen in need were not free. Indeed, only with the\nrealization of these Goals can we enable men to live in\ngreater freedom.\nIn Armenia, where our resources are very limited\nbut the will of people is very strong, we have been\nexperiencing good economic growth. In the past four\nor five years, we have indeed seen double-digit\neconomic growth, and we understand that our biggest\nchallenge today is to translate that high economic\ngrowth into progress in human development. Each year\nin Armenia we look forward to the publication of the\nHuman Development Report because we see it as a sort\nof report card that shows how our country is doing. In\nthe past four or five years we have been making steady\nprogress. This year we placed eighty-third, ahead of all\nof our neighbours.\nWhile we should not underestimate this progress,\non the other hand, we do not want to exaggerate it. We\nhave to look at this index, at its promise, and see what\nproblems we facing that we need to address and what\ngaps need to be filled.\n22\n\nFirst, we have to accelerate our efforts to reduce\nthe level of poverty in our country. Societies are judged\nby the way they treat their most vulnerable. In\nArmenia, the poor are in the rural areas and we have to\nmake sure that economic development can trickle out\nto our rural areas from the cities. For us, economic\ndevelopment is comprehensive rural development. It is\nour plan to identify those areas that can provide\nopportunity for rural people so that they can develop\nand unleash their capacity for production. Just as with\nthe MDGs, there must be a partnership between rich\nand poor. In our case, we are trying to create such a\npartnership so that we reduce the numbers of poor in\nour country more rapidly.\nSecondly, we have to turn democracy into a tool\nfor development. Democracy means not only elections.\nDemocracy and democratic institutions are not simply\nends for their own sake. They have to provide, and\nthey will provide, a better environment for political\nand economic development. We think we need to\ncreate transparent, solid, open institutions so that we\ncan limit the action of the elite, and create a level\nplaying field for the entire population.\nWe are pleased with the ranking that we have\nachieved. But we are satisfied only because we know\nwe have achieved this against all odds: against our\ngeography, against our history and against attempts in\nour region to isolate Armenia.\nArmenia is a small, landlocked country. We do\nnot have the natural resources our neighbours have. It\nhas become customary to say that our greatest natural\nresource is our population, and indeed it is. But let me\nsay that, if we had the oil resources, we would have\nused those revenues to double our education budget,\nbecause we understand that education is development.\nEducation creates dreams for our youth and provides\nthe means to achieve them. If we had the oil revenues,\nwe would double our social security budget, because\nwe clearly see that there is a gap between the dreams of\nour people and the prospects of achieving them. If we\nhad the oil revenues, we would double our efforts in\nthe area of environmental protection, because that is\nthe best investment a society can make.\nBut one thing we would not do is to double our\nmilitary budget. We will not create imaginary outside\nenemies to justify our own inaction and failures. We\nwill not pretend that there are simplistic, fanatical\nsolutions to complicated social and economic\nproblems. In other words, we think the military option\nis not available as a tool in domestic and foreign\npolicy.\nWhen it comes to regional conflicts, advocating\nmilitary solutions is not only unrealistic but is also a\nclear manifestation of a patent lack of understanding of\ndemocracy, rule of law and human rights. The founders\nof this institution, the United Nations, clearly indicated\nand knew that security, development and human rights\ngo hand in hand.\nBut self-determination is a human right and the\npeople of Nagorny Karabakh have aspired to it, fought\nfor it and earned it. They had to face the aggression of\na Government they did not choose, but they fought for\nself-determination and they earned it. It was a fight\nthat was not of their choosing and the right they fought\nfor was neither abstract nor excessive. What they want\nis what we all want, the right to live on their own land,\nin their own homes, in dignity, safety and security.\nThe people of Karabakh have achieved that, and\nsubsequently they have demonstrated to the world that\nthey can sustain their de facto independence, that they\ncan rule themselves, create democratic institutions and\nconduct elections.\nCountries like mine come to such gatherings and\nmeetings with huge expectations, because we want to\ncontribute, to participate and to be involved in the give\nand take. But, if you think that because I am the\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of what is obviously a\nsmall country, and frankly, an imperfect one, I do not\nhave the right to expound on our common future, allow\nme for a moment to speak, not as a foreign minister,\nbut as a citizen of the world.\nThe prospect of United Nations reform is only the\nbeginning of achieving the promise of a world\nOrganization that would better resemble the realities of\nthe current world. If we cannot find common ground, if\nwe cannot agree to reform this institution today or\ntomorrow or next week or this year, I believe that one\nday we will have to do it. We cannot simply go on\npretending that we do not know our history. We cannot\ngo on pretending that the world has not changed. We\ncannot go on pretending that we do not understand that\nthere are new realities. It is not 1945 any longer.\nStill, it is very encouraging that the principles\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter \u2014 written\nthree generations ago \u2014 remain valid, relevant and\n23\n\nsignificant today. That is because the spirit of San\nFrancisco in 1945, and the global Charter that was\nforged there, were revolutionary. The Charter affirmed\nthe obligation and accountability of one generation to\nanother, of one State to another other, and that together,\nStates can and must create a safer world. The formula\nthat was worked out then to achieve those goals\nworked.\nToday, we need to rework that formula,\nreaffirming, first and foremost, our responsibility and\naccountability to our citizens and Governments, the\nresponsibility of international institutions to their\nmembers and of States to each other.\nWe need to democratize international relations\nand international institutions. We need fair, earned\nrepresentation around the decision-making table.\nEarned representation: that is, countries that are\ncommitted to democracy, human rights and the rule of\nlaw should have the right to sit on the Human Rights\nCouncil; countries that are serious about social and\neconomic development should occupy seats on the\nEconomic and Social Council; and countries that are\ncommitted to world peace and security, that are serious\nabout the dignity of the world community, should\nassume a leadership role in the world community.\nThose are not ambitious goals. It is only natural\nthat our national interests will differ. That is why the\nUnited Nations must step in to fill the gap, enabling us\nto work together in exchange for commitment and\naction.\nIt all boils down to our accountability to our\nchildren. What will we say to our children if we do not\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals in the next\ndecade, when we are living in an era that has witnessed\nthe creation of huge wealth in the world economy, but\nwhere half of the world\u2019s population still lives in\npoverty, far from benefiting from the fruit of that\ngrowth? What if we, in our region, miss the\nopportunity to make peace and put war, its\nconsequences and its legacy, behind us? How, then, are\nwe going to be able to look our children in the face?\nWhat if we reject that chance to learn from our past, to\ncome to terms with our history, if we refuse to take our\ncommon and joint responsibility to intervene and\nprevent conflict, letting Governments time and again\ncommit torture, ethnic cleansing and genocide against\ntheir own populations? What will we then tell our\nchildren?\nWhen the United Nations was created 60 years\nago, it gave the people of the world hope and faith in\ntheir leaders, in their future and in the lives of their\nchildren. Today, having witnessed the huge calamities\nand catastrophes, both man-made and natural, which\nhave occurred recently, there is a clear need to restore\nthe faith of the peoples of the world.\nLooking at the damage caused by last year\u2019s\nAsian tsunami and the recent Hurricane Katrina,\nlooking at the violence that is being perpetrated in\nDarfur and the carnage that we witnessed in London,\nwe are questioning ourselves, our neighbours and our\nassumptions. The answer must be united momentum,\nunited effort, united resources and united action by\nnations united. The United Nations can still be that\nanswer."

        "file_text": "After the celebratory and\npowerful statements made here by leaders from all four\ncorners of the world during these past few days\ncommemorating the sixtieth anniversary of this\nOrganization, all that is left for Ghana to do is to\nemphasize a few points in this annual general debate of\nthe General Assembly.\nThe record attendance of heads of State and\nGovernment at this year\u2019s meetings is evidence that,\nmore and more, nations of the world are accepting and\nlooking up to the United Nations to provide the moral\nand practical framework and leadership for the shaping\nand governance of the onrushing global village.\nWithout doubt, the Organization has become both the\nmain centre for the mobilization and deployment of\nresources for the relief of victims of natural and man-\nmade disasters alike, and also the chief agency and\ncatalyst for the spread of opportunities for progress and\ndevelopment for all humankind. Reassuringly, it is\ngalvanizing the conscience of humankind to resist and\ndesist from inhuman conduct, whilst putting in place a\nglobal social safety net for the poor, the weak and the\nhandicapped in a world of strident competition.\nGhana will therefore continue to contribute to the\nongoing debate on United Nations reform, especially\nthe strengthening of the Organization\u2019s institutions at\nall levels. The reforms must radiate the spirit of\ncommon humanity in which each person is his\nbrother\u2019s keeper. That will engender the trust needed to\nanchor the tolerance and goodwill which must be the\ncornerstone of the globalization process.\nThe increasing realization of our common\nhumanity will lessen the divisive tendencies of racial,\nreligious, political, gender, cultural and other social\ncategorizations. Already, the world, under the\nleadership of this Organization, is doing well in its\nmany dramatic rallies in rushing aid to victims\nwherever disaster occurs, such as the Indian Ocean\nStates after the tsunami and the aftermath of Hurricane\nKatrina in New Orleans, here in the United States of\nAmerica.\nIn spite of those positive developments, however,\nthe persistent and worsening carnage and mayhem\ncaused by terrorism still seem to lurk everywhere.\nNowhere and nobody seems to be safe any longer.\nWhatever its cause, terrorism cannot be justified or\nrationalized in terms of a solution, since its effects do\nnot discriminate between the perceived guilty and the\ninnocent. That is why the world must stand together\nand try to eradicate it.\nAfrican nations are now showing a strong\ndetermination to end the conflicts that have bedevilled\nthe continent for decades. The setting-up of the New\nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD) and\nthe African Peace and Security Council under the\nauspices of the African Union is a demonstration of\nthat resolve. Through NEPAD, Africa has identified the\nfactors of good governance, the culture of democracy,\nthe rule of law, free and fair elections, sound economic\nmanagement of States, and State support for and\npartnership with the private sector as critical for\nsustained socio-economic development, peace and\nstability.\nFor accelerated economic growth, Africa is\ngenerally agreed that the way forward is through\npartnerships among the African nations and with the\nrest of the world to create economies of scale and to\nattract both domestic and foreign direct investment.\nThat will create opportunities for employment, the\ntransfer of know-how and markets to combat the\ndebilitating poverty. The world community must\nsupport Africa in those ground-breaking efforts.\nAfrica believes that the realization of the agenda\nunder the Doha Round could also bring significant\nbenefits to developing countries. But alongside those\nefforts must come support for the call for greatly\nenhanced economic aid from the United Nations and\nthe developed world for the struggling third world to\nnurture itself into the fitness required for the\ncompetitiveness that the global market demands. The\nsame rationale must back the various initiatives aimed\nat providing assistance for the prevention, care and\ntreatment of HIV/AIDS, malaria and other infectious\ndiseases. It is only by containing those diseases that the\ncontinent\u2019s development can be kept on course.\nThe empowerment of women and children is\nmoving apace on the continent. In that regard, Ghana\nhas established a Ministry of Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s\nAffairs to spearhead policies and programmes to\npromote gender equality and enhance the status of\nwomen.\nThis is a historic moment of truth for the\ninternational community. The destiny of the United\n18\n\nNations and humankind is in our hands. We have the\nchoice to save it, and the time to act is now."

Samoa pledges to\nyou and to Sweden its full support and cooperation\nthroughout the sixtieth session of the General\nAssembly.\nI also want to pay tribute to your predecessor,\nMr. Jean Ping of the Gabonese Republic, for his\noutstanding service and effective guidance during the\nfifty-ninth session.\nJust a few days ago in this very Hall, we met to\ntake stock of progress and map the way forward in the\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals\n(MDGs). The MDGs are not merely a set of targets, but\nencompass a process which addresses the varied\nchallenges to human development. While some\nprogress has been made over the past five years, much\nmore remains to be done.\nIt is therefore imperative that concerted global\nefforts be strengthened, in terms of political\ncommitment and resource mobilization, if the outcome\nof the summit envisaged in the summit outcome\ndocument is to be achieved.\nSamoa is progressing well towards achieving the\nMDGs by the target period of 2015. Challenges\nremain, however, and they are being addressed through\nlegislative and policy initiatives and the creation of\ninnovative partnerships with the donor community and\ncivil society.\nSamoa reiterates its support for the ongoing\nefforts to modernize and strengthen the United Nations.\nWe thank the previous President of the Assembly, as\nwell as the Secretary-General, for their laudable work\nand tireless efforts in advancing the reform and\nrevitalization of the Organization.\nIt is our belief that reform measures must provide\nfor a transparent, democratic and expanded Security\nCouncil, in both the permanent and non-permanent\nmembership categories, and for an effective and\nstrengthened Organization that reflects the realities of\nthe twenty-first century. Substantive changes are\ntherefore required with regard to both the General\nAssembly and the Security Council, as well as to other\nbodies of the United Nations system.\nWe congratulate President Ping, in particular for\nhis stewardship and leadership throughout the\nnegotiations for and the adoption of the summit\ndeclaration last week. This is the sixtieth anniversary\nof the United Nations; the time is surely ripe now to\nimplement the reforms needed to revitalize our\nOrganization and enable it to effectively realize the\nprinciples and goals identified in the declaration.\nThe courageous efforts of the Israeli and\nPalestinian authorities to find a sustainable peace\nsolution deserve our applause and prayers for\ncontinuing success. While there have been positive\ndevelopments in the Middle East, the violence and acts\n7\n\nof terrorism in Iraq and in other parts of the region\nremain causes for grave concern.\nTerrorism, perpetrated by those with no respect\nfor human decency and life, continues to plague our\nworld. No cause or grievances can justify acts that kill\nand maim innocent people. Heinous and murderous\nacts of terrorism serve only the purposes of those who\nwant to destabilize society and usher in a dark age for\nour world. Samoa therefore condemns terrorism in all\nits forms in the strongest terms and will continue to\nsupport the international campaign to overcome that\nscourge to human dignity and security.\nThe peacekeeping and security advocacy work of\nthe United Nations around the world has our full\nsupport. Samoa presently has police contingents\nserving with peacekeeping missions in Timor-Leste\nand in Liberia. Within our Pacific region, Samoa also\ncontributes police support to the Regional Assistance\nMission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) under the\nauspices of the Pacific Islands Forum. RAMSI\nconforms to its regional responsibilities under Chapter\nVIII of the United Nations Charter and recognizes the\nsovereignty of the Solomon Islands.\nSamoa is pleased to note that the membership of\nthe International Criminal Court will soon number 100.\nSamoa adds its voice to the appeal for the early\nratification of and accession to the Rome Statute\nestablishing the Court by those States that have not yet\ndone so. The Court brings to justice those who commit\ngenocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes and\nis therefore an important institution in upholding\ninternational humanitarian standards and the protection\nof human rights. For those reasons, it would be a\nmistake to undermine the effectiveness of the Court in\nany way. Instead, the Court should be given the\nnecessary support to give it universality.\nSamoa remains extremely concerned about the\nproliferation of nuclear weapons and their threat, not\njust to international peace and security, but to the very\nexistence of life on our planet. We regret deeply that\nthe Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, held in May\n2005, was unable to agree on steps to strengthen the\nnon-proliferation regime. The Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) are\nthe main instruments for controlling the spread of\nnuclear weapons.\nThe South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty\nhighlights the seriousness with which the issue of the\nthreat of nuclear weapons is viewed in our region and\nwe call on States who have not done so to ratify the\nTreaty\u2019s Protocols. Clearly, adherence to the\nrequirements of the NPT, the CTBT and other\nconventions on disarmament is vital. Samoa therefore\njoins the call for all United Nations Members to sign\non to those treaties and for States parties to honour\ntheir obligations to them.\nSmall arms and light weapons have been used\ntime and again in violent conflict, contributing to the\ndestabilization and devastation of communities in\nmany countries, including in the Pacific. The\nproliferation of small weapons is a major problem. We\ntherefore fully support the holding of a review\nconference on small arms next year, in particular with a\nview to concluding a treaty to control the trade in small\narms and stop them from reaching areas of violent\nconflict.\nAs the current Chair of the Pacific Islands Forum,\nI wish to report that since the General Assembly\nsession last year new and positive developments have\ntaken place in the Pacific region. The programme of\nPacific Regional Assistance to Nauru, a regional\nresponse to assist Nauru rebuild its economy, is in\nprogress. With assistance from the United Nations, an\nautonomous government is now being established in\nBougainville. I am also pleased to announce that the\nPacific Plan \u2014 a road map to further strengthen\nregional cooperation and integration to achieve our\nregion\u2019s priority goals of economic growth, sustainable\ndevelopment, good governance and security \u2014 is\nnearing completion and is expected to be considered\nand approved by Pacific Forum leaders at their next\nsummit, in Papua New Guinea, in October of this year.\nThe Pacific Plan will also improve Pacific countries\u2019\ncapacities to achieve the Millennium Development\nGoals.\nThe Mauritius Strategy for the Further\nImplementation of the Programme of Action for the\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates, adopted in January 2005, sets out long-term\naction plans for the sustainable development of small\nisland developing States (SIDS). While we accept that\nthe primary responsibility for the implementation of\nthe Mauritius Strategy lies with us, there is still a\ncritical need for the sustained and long-term\ncommitment of our partners to focus on the special\n8\n\ncase of SIDS and to take their specific vulnerabilities,\nand the challenges generated thereby, into account. We\ntherefore call on the United Nations system and the\ninternational community to provide the necessary\nsupport to implement and monitor the Mauritius\nStrategy.\nAs has often been repeated from this rostrum,\ntrade is the surest path to greater wealth and a vital\ncomponent of sustainable development for SIDS. We\ntherefore support the successful conclusion of the Doha\nRound, which took the vulnerabilities of small States\nfully into account in the negotiations, particularly with\nregard to special and preferential treatment for small\neconomies.\nLet me conclude by reaffirming Samoa\u2019s\ncommitment to multilateralism and to the purposes and\nprinciples of the United Nations."

        "file_text": "On behalf of\nthe Government of the Republic of San Marino, I wish\nto congratulate Ambassador Jan Eliasson on his\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its\nsixtieth session. I also wish to express to the outgoing\nPresident, Mr. Jean Ping, our deepest gratitude for his\ncommitment and determination in fulfilling his\nmandate.\nAt the outset, I would also like to express my\nappreciation for the result of the outcome document. I\nam confident that, with a clear mandate for our heads\nof State and Government, we will be able to reach our\ngoals.\nThe United Nations is at an extremely important\nand critical juncture. Indeed, the challenge of United\nNations reform has become inevitable and necessary in\nlaying the foundations of its future activity. It is now\nall too clear that the reform will involve its major\nbodies, working methods and management of human\nand economic resources. The United Nations structure\nwill be modified with the aim of showing the entire\nworld that the Organization is an efficient and\n16\n\ndemocratic body that can guarantee peace and\ndevelopment.\nThe reform, which will lead to tension and\nrequire sacrifices, will be criticized by a number of\nStates, as is the case with all difficult compromises.\nThe process will be long and encounter numerous\nobstacles, but it is necessary and indispensable.\nSan Marino believes that the reform process\nalready under way will not stop. However, changes will\nhave to be wide-ranging and take account of the need\nto face important issues, such as the reform of the\nSecurity Council. Most importantly, the reform will\nhave to be supported by the widest possible consensus\nand based on two principles: democracy and\ntransparency. We hope the enlargement will take into\naccount the widest possible geographical and regional\nrepresentation and that the solution\u2019s methods and\nideas will not be forcibly imposed or privilege the\ninterests of only a few countries. We endorse the\nprinciples of \u201cUniting for consensus\u201d and are ready to\nconsider any proposal that does not create fractures and\ncan establish a new and lasting balance.\nFor San Marino, the United Nations must be\nbased upon democracy, which gives it its legitimacy\nand moral strength. Streamlining structures and\nprocedures is also necessary to greater effectiveness,\nbecause it is in the field, among people, that the United\nNations really fulfils its mission. Indeed, it is the\npeople who determine the importance of this\nOrganization in the improvement of their lives.\nWith regard to some essential aspects presently\nunder discussion, San Marino feels that the proposed\ncreation of a human rights council may not solve the\nbasic problem of the Commission on Human Rights,\nwhich is politicization. However, San Marino is of the\nview that human rights protection deserves the same\nconsideration given by the Economic and Social\nCouncil to social and economic aspects and by the\nSecurity Council to peace and security.\nThe human rights council should be directly\naccountable to the General Assembly and have a\nbroad-based composition allowing for the adequate\nparticipation of small and medium-sized countries.\nMoreover, the specific competencies of the new\ncouncil vis-\u00e0-vis the Third Committee should be\nestablished in order to avoid duplication of activities\nand inefficiencies.\nThe proposed peacebuilding commission is an\nexcellent institutional response to post-conflict\nsituations. The commission should play an important\nrole not only in the resolution, but also in the\nprevention of conflicts. Moreover, it should find ad hoc\nsolutions for countries in transition from\ntotalitarianism or institutional anarchy to democracy.\nIn our view, the commission should submit\nrecommendations to the Security Council on measures\nto be adopted to guarantee consistency in peace\ninterventions, economic recovery processes, the\nrebuilding of national institutions and public\nadministration, and the strengthening of democracy\nand the rule of law. Moreover, we believe that the\nCommission should be composed of members of the\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social\nCouncil, as well as of countries directly involved in\nspecific situations.\nJust a few days ago, the majority of the world\nleaders gathered in this very Hall to discuss what has\nbeen done so far to achieve the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals. Over the past five years,\ndevelopment assistance activities have fallen short of\nexpectations. We sincerely hope that the recently\nconcluded summit will promote and encourage stronger\ncommitment by all developed and developing\ncountries.\nSan Marino has followed very attentively the\nreform process initiated by the Secretary-General and\nhas actively participated in the discussions of the\nPanel\u2019s report and of the Secretary-General\u2019s report\nentitled \u201cIn larger freedom\u201d, as well as in the\nnegotiations of the outcome document of the General\nAssembly. We would have liked the latter document to\ncontain more incisive and comprehensive proposals.\nSan Marino is aware that development is the sine\nqua non condition for achieving the Millennium Goals.\nToday, in the twenty-first century, more than a billion\npeople still live on less than a dollar a day and 30,000\nchildren die every day from hunger. Those figures\ncannot leave us indifferent. Only by eradicating\npoverty, underdevelopment and epidemics, and by\nforgiving the crushing debt of developing countries,\nwill collective well-being be achieved.\nPeace and security are intimately linked to the\nMillennium Goals, as they are essential for a country to\nimprove its economic and human conditions. Peace and\nsecurity cannot be separated from concerns about\n17\n\nterrorism, as evidenced by the numerous recent\ncowardly attacks. Terrorism must not divert the\ninternational community from its commitment to\npromoting democratization, the culture of peace and\nrespect for religions, ethnic groups and different\ncultures.\nAll States must share the responsibility for\nfighting terrorism and cooperate at the regional and\ninternational levels to implement specific and effective\npreventive measures. Every State must adopt the\nnecessary legislation to break the vicious cycle of\nterrorism and to prevent its financing through\neconomic and banking cooperation.\nThe principle of \u201cthe responsibility to protect\u201d is\nan extremely interesting concept. That idea, however,\ncan be accepted only if understood not as a violation of\nnational sovereignty, but as a duty of all States vis-\u00e0-\nvis countries plagued by massacres, genocide and\nhumanitarian crises.\nSan Marino is closely following developments in\nthe peace process in the Middle East. The decision of\nthe Israeli Government to remove its settlers from the\nGaza Strip and the West Bank has been one of the most\nsignificant steps in the implementation of the road map\nand Prime Minister Sharon has showed great courage\nand determination, despite all domestic difficulties, in\ntaking such a decision.\nSan Marino shares the hope of the international\ncommunity that the Palestinian Government will also\nfully respect its commitments and, by completely\nrejecting terrorism perpetrated by extremist groups,\nwill maintain and strengthen the dialogue and\nconstructive relations responsibly established with the\nIsraeli Government.\nWe welcome with great satisfaction the recent\nelections held in the new Afghanistan, now on its way\nto democracy and with a higher degree of freedom, as\nwell as the elections and approval of the new\nConstitution in Iraq, which we hope may lead to a real\ninstitutional, social and cultural rebirth of that country.\nWe cannot fail to address and stress the situation\nof women and children in our discussions on the\nconcerns to be addressed at the beginning of this\nMillennium and on the development of humankind.\nChildren, in particular, are most vulnerable to war and\nfamine and bear the brunt of adult actions and\ndecisions. Bombings and conflicts, malnutrition,\npoverty, treatable diseases, child labour and sexual\nabuse cause them great suffering and death. If people\nwere merely to stop and think of those children, many\nof the worst events in the world could be avoided.\nThis year, my country has undertaken a number\nof humanitarian initiatives in favour of children,\nmainly in Africa, with the support of our institutions.\nLet me mention, in that regard, the recent unanimous\ndecision of my Parliament in favour of programmes\nimproving childhood conditions in Uganda.\nPoverty and hunger are the prison in which many\nwomen eke out their existence, victims of injustice and\ndiscrimination. Our inability to free those women,\ndespite all the means available, is one of the major\nscandals of our day. At a time of economic well-being\nand progress, though not widespread, complicity with\nthat injustice through negligence or incapacity is\nunacceptable. The mass media now at our disposal do\nnot allow us to ignore that situation. The\nimplementation of Beijing and Beijing+5 is crucial to\ndemolishing the walls of that prison and to\nguaranteeing respect and development for the women\nof the twenty-first century.\nLast year, San Marino ratified the Convention on\nthe Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against\nWomen and, last June, Parliament approved accession\nto its Optional Protocol. I deposited our instruments of\naccession upon my arrival here in New York.\nMoreover, San Marino is tirelessly committed to\nsupporting women\u2019s complete integration into and\nequality in its society.\nOn this occasion, I would express the hope that\nthe international community will strengthen its efforts\nto protect the environment and prevent natural\ndisasters. To that end, international cooperation is of\nthe utmost importance, and the Kyoto Protocol is a\nparticularly important instrument for our country.\nOn that subject, I wish to reiterate my country\u2019s\ncondolences and solidarity to the people tragically\nstruck by natural disasters, such as those in South-East\nAsia some months ago and, more recently, along the\ncoasts of the Gulf of Mexico in the United States of\nAmerica.\nThe Millennium Development Goals, peace\nprocesses, fighting injustice and our many other great\nchallenges may seem impossible to face, but\nhumankind has the necessary resources and\n18\n\ninstruments to achieve those objectives and the United\nNations is one of the major tools at our disposal. I am\nconfident that the Organization will be up to that noble\ntask. To that end, I express my most sincere wishes to\nyou, Sir, to the Secretary-General and to all colleagues,\ndiplomats and officials who believe in the ideals of the\nUnited Nations."

        "file_text": "It is a pleasure to join\npreceding speakers in congratulating Mr. Jan Eliasson\non his election as President at the sixtieth session of\nthe General Assembly. In particular, I welcome the fact\nthat the international community has given him the\nhonour of being elected President of the General\nAssembly, at its present session at which we are\ncommemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the\nOrganization. Moreover, at the present session we\nshall, above all, work to implement the commitments\nundertaken by the heads of State or Government to\nstrengthen United Nations reform and adapt the\nOrganization to the changes on the international stage\nso that it can remain the forum for coordination and\ndebate, an irreplaceable instrument for conflict\nprevention and management and the body for\nupholding international law and the integrity of States.\nI also congratulate the President at the fifty-ninth\nsession, Mr. Jean Ping, Minister of State and Minister\nfor Foreign Affairs, Cooperation and la Francophonie\nof the Gabonese Republic. With his great human\nqualities and his skill as a statesman, he carried out his\nmission with tact and personal engagement.\nFinally, allow me to convey to Secretary-General\nKofi Annan the encouragement and the gratitude of\nMr. Joseph Kabila, President of the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, for his commitment to finding\na solution to the crisis in the Great Lakes region and\nfor the importance that he attaches to the protection of\nthe values of human dignity.\nMr. Eliasson is presiding over the General\nAssembly at a pivotal moment for our Organization. It\nwould be hard not to make a connection between the\nhistory of my country, the President\u2019s mandate and the\ndestiny of an eminent citizen of his country, Sweden,\nwho gained fame in my country for his commitment to\nthe cause of peace. I am referring to Mr. Dag\nHammarskj\u00f6ld, the second Secretary-General of the\nUnited Nations.\nAs the President has assumed his functions in\nSeptember, it should be recalled that on 20 September\n1960, my country became a Member of the United\nNations. And on 18 September 1961, the late\nSecretary-General Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld gave his life for\nhis commitment to the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo. I pay tribute to the memory and the courage of\nthat hero, as well as to the civilian and military\nmembers of the United Nations Operation in the Congo\nwho lost their lives alongside our soldiers while\ndefending the sovereignty and the integrity of our\nterritory.\nA comparison of the United Nations involvement\nin the Congo in 1960 and that of the present reveals a\nnumber of similarities, including the tireless dedication\nto the cause of peace demonstrated by the Blue\nHelmets. My country has twice benefited from peace\noperations, and we know the price paid by United\nNations forces to save us from disaster. Our first-hand\n31\n\nexperience of United Nations intervention strengthens\nour belief that now, more than ever, the world needs a\nstrong, reformed United Nations.\nAs discussions on Security Council reform have\nreached a crucial stage, it is time for us to acknowledge\nthat, in spite of its limitations, the United Nations \u2014\nthe forum of nations \u2014 has become the conscience of\nhumanity. Its present and future role can be addressed\nonly when one reflects on recent changes in the world\nand on the Organization\u2019s capacity to adapt to the new\nchallenges posed by development, the debt crisis, the\nspecific needs of the least developed countries,\nterrorism and the issues of human rights, peace and\ncollective security.\nIn that context, it is desirable for the United\nNations to modify its structure in order to be better\nable to face new and old challenges and promote the\nvalues of our civilization, founded on the principles of\nfreedom and democracy.\nThe desired enlargement of the Security Council,\nas envisaged, is now a requirement of the greatest\ndemocratic importance. But while it is necessary, it is\nnot in itself sufficient to ensure the harmonious and\nefficient functioning of the United Nations system. We\nmust go further, beyond mere expansion, to realize the\nambitions that Member States have for the United\nNations. Security Council reform should not\novershadow the need to review the other United\nNations organs, in particular the Economic and Social\nCouncil, the Secretariat and the General Assembly,\nwith a view to strengthening their mandates, and\nenabling the President of the General Assembly to play\na primary role in seeking solutions to international\nproblems.\nAlso in the context of reform, my country looks\nforward to the establishment of the new Peacebuilding\nCommission and to the creation of multi-year standing\nfunds. That would enable countries emerging from\nconflict to receive real, substantial contributions in\nsupport of rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts and\nwould help those countries lay the foundations for\nsustainable development.\nThe international community has invested heavily\nin the work of rebuilding State structures in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and has provided\nsignificant support through the United Nations\nOrganization Mission in the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo (MONUC). I convey the deep gratitude of\nthe Congolese people.\nIn the context of the holding of transparent\nmultiparty elections to put an end to the crisis of\nlegitimacy and the endless loop of transitions, the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo is taking giant steps\ntowards concluding the transition process. I would like\nto assure the Assembly of the determination of the\nGovernment of National Unity to carry out the\ntransition in accordance with the constitutional\ntimetable.\nThe adoption by referendum of a draft\nconstitution by the end of the year will make the\nprocess irreversible. The elections must take place.\nAnd it is certain that they will take place, because of\nthe great determination of the Congolese people and\nthe great commitment of the Government of National\nUnity. The harmonious progress in the process, despite\nsome logistic constraints related to the immense size of\nthe national territory and the complexity of the voter\nregistration process, leads us to predict with confidence\nthat the various electoral deadlines will be met. To\ndate, nearly 12 million voters have been registered,\nbearing out the enthusiasm that has been in evidence\nsince the start of the registration process.\nIt is now urgent to quickly stabilize the security\nsituation, including, in particular, through the prompt\nresolution of the worrisome issue of the disarmament\nof foreign armed groups, which threaten to disturb,\neven compromise, the proper holding of elections.\nIt should be recalled that it is urgent to support\nthe efforts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to\nput an end to the presence of armed groups in the\neastern part of the national territory and ensure their\nrepatriation, in accordance with the relevant\nresolutions of the Security Council, the African Union\nand the Economic Community of Central African\nStates. Adequate support for the training and equipping\nof our restructured and integrated armed forces, as well\nas the firm engagement of MONUC, will lead those\ngroups to disarm. However, the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo has never preferred the military option or\never felt that it was the only possible way to ensure the\nrepatriation of the foreign armed elements that have\nproliferated in the North and South Kivus. Therefore\nwe have maintained contacts, through various\nintermediaries, with representatives of the Front\nd\u00e9mocratique pour la lib\u00e9ration du Rwanda, which has\n32\n\nkept open the possibility of sustained voluntary\ndisarmament followed by the voluntary repatriation of\nRwandese armed elements. Two sets of consultations\nwere held \u2014 in March and in September 2005 \u2014 but\nso far they have not led to the hoped-for results. If they\nfail, we will have to reconsider the option of forced\ndisarmament, no matter what the cost for the\nCongolese armed forces, to whom it will fall to enforce\nit.\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo is\ngrateful to the Security Council for having authorized\nMONUC to take action under Chapter VII of the\nCharter of the United Nations, whose application has\nhad real results in Ituri. Recourse to Chapter VII in\nother areas, however, in particular in the North and\nSouth Kivus, has not yet had the full deterrent effect\nanticipated. Therefore, is it not time to consider, as the\nSecurity Council has wished, what assistance to\nprovide to the Forces arm\u00e9es de la R\u00e9publique\nd\u00e9mocratique du Congo to realize the forced\ndisarmament of the militias? Naturally, the successful\noutcome of such an operation will also depend on the\ndetermination of the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo and of MONUC, and, above all, on the sincere\ncommitment of our neighbours. The latter must refrain\nfrom any form of negative interference that would\ncompromise efforts to neutralize the militias and other\narmed groups.\nBeyond our security and strictly political\nconcerns, we must also meet the legitimate needs of a\npopulation that for years has been deprived of its basic\nsubsistence requirements. The economic and social\npolicy of the Transitional Government seeks, in the\nshort term, to meet the requirements to combat poverty,\nas well as to restructure the legal and financial sectors\nand to help restart productive activities \u2014 areas where\na certain degree of success has been achieved. The\nState budget has increased substantially, the exchange\nrate has been stabilized, inflation is under control and,\nfor the past three years, growth rates have ranged from\n6 to 7 per cent. Those favourable economic developments\nhave enabled us to launch a number of recovery plans\nin the areas of basic infrastructure and education, as\nwell as in the field of health, by combating major\nepidemics and pandemics.\nBut the pace of progress in the social sphere is\nslow: very slow, in view of the people\u2019s numerous\nexpectations. In order to consolidate the gains we have\nmade, we will need to pick up the pace of our activities\nand rapidly institute social initiatives that will have a\nvisible impact. We therefore welcome the\ncommitments made by our bilateral and multilateral\npartners to assist us in that direction.\nThe Government of the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo is well aware of the importance of regional\ncooperation and of good-neighbourliness. For that\nreason, we support the Secretary-General\u2019s initiative \u2014\nin conjunction with the Group of Friends of the Great\nLakes Region \u2014 to organize in Nairobi an\nInternational Conference on Peace, Security,\nDemocracy and Development in the region.\nMy country has been the main battleground of an\narmed conflict, with a toll of over 3 million dead,\nmassive infringements of human rights and of\ninternational humanitarian law, the destruction of\nhospitals, schools, roads and bridges and the looting of\nnatural resources and other forms of wealth. For that\nreason, my country hopes to be one of the main\nbeneficiaries of the special reconstruction fund that has\nbeen set up within the framework of the International\nConference on the Great Lakes region, and a priority\nzone in the subregion for rehabilitation and\ndevelopment.\nThe trials experienced by the Congolese people,\nand by all the peoples of the Great Lakes region,\nenable us to understand the aspirations for peace\nvoiced by other peoples. We therefore support the\npeace process in the Middle East. The Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo welcomes the withdrawal of\nIsraeli troops from the Gaza Strip. We believe that that\ninitiative is an important step forward, one that should\nbe consolidated in order to ensure peace and to put an\nend to the cycle of violence in that region. The\nsensitivity and the complexity of that situation further\nemphasize the commitment made by the State of Israel\nand by the Palestinian Authority to reach a negotiated\nsolution to the crisis in the Middle East.\nI also wish to commend the United Nations and\nthe African Union for their efforts to bring the\nelections in Burundi and the Central African Republic\nto a successful conclusion. The positive outcome of the\nreconciliation processes in those two countries, as well\nas the prospects for positive developments in the\nsituation in the Congo, bode well for the emergence of\na new period of stability, democracy and prosperity for\nCentral Africa.\n33\n\nIn view of new threats, I wish to reaffirm the\ncommitment of the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nto the principles upon which our collective security is\nbased. The coming years will be a time of increased\ncompetition among nations in the areas of trade,\nfinancial markets and research, including nuclear\nresearch; rapid globalization, made possible through\ninformation and communication technologies, has\ngiven rise at times to sometimes uncontrolled\nliberalization and bitter competition. It is thus our\nhistoric responsibility to equip the United Nations with\nthe resources and structures not only to keep the\npeace wherever necessary and to guarantee our\ncollective security wherever it is threatened, but also to\nbetter address issues of economic and social\ndevelopment, to establish more equitable rules of the\ngame for international trade, to fight collectively and\neffectively against illiteracy, ignorance, intolerance,\nepidemics, disease and natural disasters, and, naturally,\nagainst terrorism, violence and injustice in all their\nforms so that we can build a more brotherly, peaceful,\nhumane and just world."

        "file_text": "I would like to join those\nwho have expressed thanks to the Secretary-General\nfor his efforts in recent years to address the very\nserious issues facing the international community.\nIceland had high expectations for the results of\nlast week\u2019s summit, which were met only partly in its\noutcome document (resolution 60/1). Much further\nwork is needed. While most of the key values in the\nCharter were reaffirmed, it is Iceland\u2019s view that\nhuman rights and the accountability of States to their\ncitizens were insufficiently dealt with.\nThe United Nations Charter guarantees equality\namong nations and provides a basis on which they can\nlive together as good neighbours. However, the Charter\nnot only addresses how relations should be conducted\namong Governments; it also specifies how\nGovernments should conduct themselves towards their\npeoples. That is what the Secretary-General has called\nthe accountability of States to their citizens.\nIceland supports the Secretary-General\u2019s strong\nstatement on the responsibility borne by the\ninternational community in cases of massive human\nrights abuses or genocide. The United Nations has\nmade significant progress in that respect by recognizing\nthe existence of an international responsibility to protect.\nThe Security Council and other institutions have thus\nbeen given a clear mandate \u2014 indeed, a clear duty \u2014\nto act where crimes against humanity are committed.\n6\n\nDemocracy and respect for universal human\nrights are of central importance to security and\ndevelopment. Iceland supports the establishment of the\nUnited Nations Democracy Fund and will contribute to\nit. We are also strongly in favour of reforming the\npresent human rights machinery. The Commission on\nHuman Rights is dysfunctional and devoid of\ncredibility; deliberations on human rights have suffered\naccordingly. Moreover, the credibility of the entire\nUnited Nations Organization is threatened. There now\nexists a summit mandate to establish a Human Rights\nCouncil, which will be responsible for promoting\nuniversal respect for the protection of all human rights\nand fundamental freedoms. For Iceland, the ideal\nHuman Rights Council would be smaller than the\nCommission and would be in session all year so that it\ncould respond to emergencies. The composition of the\nnew Council will be fundamental to its effectiveness. It\nmust not include major human rights abusers.\nAt the summit, Member States committed\nthemselves to making every possible effort to conclude\na comprehensive convention on international terrorism.\nSuch a convention must unconditionally condemn\nterrorism. If it is to be fully effective, it must include a\nlegal definition of terrorist acts.\nUnfortunately, the threat of terrorism, combined\nwith that of weapons of mass destruction, is not dealt\nwith in the outcome document, which fails to address\nthe proliferation of such weapons. Proliferation is a\nprofound danger which the United Nations cannot\nignore but must confront in a decisive manner.\nIceland welcomes the emphasis placed by the\ndocument on investing in prevention, peacemaking,\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding. We welcome in\nparticular the proposal to create a Peacebuilding\nCommission and a Support Office within the\nSecretariat. Iceland is willing to take part, along with\nother Member States, in ensuring that both are up and\nrunning by the end of the year.\nI must express disappointment at the fact that the\ngroup of four proposal for reforming the Security\nCouncil has not yet received the support it deserves.\nWhile not perfect, it remains the most practical basis\nfor reforming the Council. That approach therefore\ncontinues to have Iceland\u2019s firm support. The Council\nmust reflect the world as it is and be representative.\nIceland has previously, in this very forum, expressed\nits interest in participating actively in the work of the\nCouncil in the years 2009 and 2010.\nThe Millennium Declaration provides a platform\nto address poverty in the developing countries.\nDeveloped countries have committed themselves to\nproviding the necessary support in the form of official\ndevelopment assistance. It is no less important for\ndeveloping countries to create a transparent and\naccountable environment that respects good\ngovernance and the rule of law, in order to attract\ndomestic and foreign investment, which fosters the\ngrowth of a vibrant private sector. It is also important\nfor developed and developing countries to ensure a\nsuccessful outcome of the current World Trade\nOrganization negotiations.\nThe Government of Iceland has acknowledged\nthe great challenge posed by the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals. Accordingly, it will continue\nsubstantially to increase Iceland\u2019s official development\nassistance in the coming years.\nIceland is committed to reform of the United\nNations and to finding common ways of dealing with\nthreats to international security. The outcome\ndocument has serious shortcomings, and the risk\nremains that the United Nations could be further\nweakened. Member States must ensure that the process\ncontinues and that it will, in the coming weeks and\nmonths, deliver on the fundamental issues at hand in\nthe interests of peace and prosperity in the world."

        "file_text": "Seven days ago, from this rostrum, I\nwarned that the situation in Kosovo and Metohija - a\nprovince of Serbia administered by the United Nations\nsince 10 June 1999 - poses a serious threat to the\n20\n\nstability of the Balkans. Serbia and Montenegro\nsupports the conclusion of the International Contact\nGroup that there will be no return to the situation\nbefore 10 June 1999.\nI would like to recall that, before 1999, the\nregime in Serbia insisted on the limited autonomy of\nKosovo, while the Albanian political leaders insisted\non its independence. Those two opposing positions led\nto an armed conflict, and later to NATO air strikes\nagainst Serbia and Montenegro. That conflict ended\nfollowing the adoption of Security Council resolution\n1244 (1999), which called for a protectorate in Kosovo\nbut did not call into question the territorial integrity of\nSerbia and Montenegro.\nThe Contact Group's conclusion that there will be\nno return to the situation before June 1999 has to apply\nequally to both sides - Serbian and Albanian.\nConsequently, there can be neither limited autonomy\nnor independence for Kosovo. By proposing a status\nthat was greater than autonomy but less than\nindependence for Kosovo, the democratic Government\nin Belgrade demonstrated its full commitment to\nreaching a compromise solution. Unfortunately, the\nKosovo Albanians, only interested in independence,\nhave not budged an inch from their 1999 position.\nUnfortunately, I have to note that the\ninternational community is partly to blame for the\ntragic position the Serbian and other non-Albanian\nminorities in Kosovo find themselves in, as well as for\nthe political extremism of the Albanian majority and\nthe many crimes that have been committed. The\nstandards set for Kosovo are not even close to being\nfulfilled. Are we therefore going to abandon the\n\u00ecStandards before Status\u00ee policy? From 10 June 1999\nto the present, approximately 200,000 Serbs and\nMontenegrins, as well as Turks, Croats, Roma, Jews\nand other non-Albanians, have been expelled from\nKosovo. Close to 80 per cent of the territory is now\ninhabited only by Albanians. Several hundred Serbs\nhave been killed, including many children.\nApproximately 40,000 Serbian homes have been\ndemolished or set on fire, as well as 150 churches and\nmonasteries that were centuries old. The remaining\nSerbs and other non-Albanians live in so-called\nenclaves, without guarantees for their personal safety\nand their freedom of movement. No one in present-day\nEurope is so tragically unprotected.\nIn spite the foregoing, we hope that the United\nNations military and police forces will remain in\nKosovo. Without their presence, the tragedy of Serbs\nand other minorities would be complete. Troops from\nthe United States, Italy, France and other countries\nshould be given credit for keeping the Serbian\nChristian monasteries designated or nominated as\ninternational world heritage sites from being blown up\nor set on fire. We would like to thank the United\nNations and ask the United Nations forces to stay in\nKosovo as long as necessary.\nFor months now, Albanian extremists have been\nopenly threatening to launch a pogrom against the\nremaining Serbs, Montenegrins and other\nnon-Albanians - and even against United Nations\nforces - unless Kosovo's independence is proclaimed.\nRecent killings of young Serbs announced the\nbeginning of that scenario. Ultimatums and threats to\ncommit crimes and terrorism cannot be accepted\nanywhere in the world, including in Kosovo. I hope\nthat that will finally and decisively be made clear to\nthe Albanian majority in the province. Serbia and\nMontenegro demands a European level of human rights\nprotection for national communities in Kosovo,\nprotection of churches and monasteries and recognition\nof the European status of the existing State borders\nwith the Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of\nAlbania. No more and no less is acceptable, either\nunder the Charter of the United Nations or under\nSecurity Council resolution 1244 (1999). Our rights do\nnot threaten any right of the Albanian majority. An\nindependent State of Kosovo is not a guaranteed right,\nbut an extreme demand.\nWe are truly and fully committed to a\ncompromise, but compromise does not mean that one\nside gets everything while the other side gets nothing.\nWe are for reconciliation and a common European\nfuture, in which Serbs, Montenegrins and Albanians\nwill be good neighbours and best friends for each\nother.\nA stable and European Kosovo means a stable\nWestern Balkans region, and vice versa. The choice is\nobvious."

I can assure him that in\nfulfilling his challenging and responsible duties, he\nwill have the support and full cooperation of the\ndelegation of Hungary. Our tribute and thanks are also\ndue to his predecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, who served us\nwith exemplary devotion and honour.\nEffective multilateralism remains an important\nobjective of the foreign policy of Hungary. Therefore,\nwe are pleased to see the United Nations standing\nready to face the emerging threats and challenges by\nmaking efforts to adapt its activities to the realities of\nour contemporary world.\nThe United Nations has served for 60 years as the\ncore institution for collective security. In our global\nand interdependent world we have to acknowledge that\ndevelopment, peace, security and human rights form an\nindispensable foundation for the security and well-\nbeing of our times.\nMy Government is particularly pleased that issues\nsuch as the fight against terrorism, international\nprotection of human rights, the proposed Human\nRights Council, the establishment of the Peacebuilding\nCommission, the reform of United Nations\nmanagement, as well as challenges related to\ndevelopment, have found proper reflection in the\nrecommendations of the summit.\nInternational terrorism continues to be a major\nthreat to our societies. The recently experienced\nhorrors of terror are sowing the seeds of instability all\nover the world. Hungary, along with its partners in the\nEuropean Union and NATO, strongly condemns all\nforms of terrorism. Measures taken in the course of\ncombating terrorist forces, however, must always\nremain in conformity with basic international\nstandards, in particular with human rights and refugee\nand humanitarian law. We believe that the United\nNations needs to accord top priority to the fight against\nthe scourge of terrorism. My country is keen to see the\nelaboration and adoption by the General Assembly of a\ncomprehensive convention on terrorism, which would,\namong others things, give the proper legal definition of\nterrorist acts.\nFreedom, democracy and human rights should\nconstitute the basic framework of life for every\nindividual. We know from experience that they are not\ngranted automatically; they must be won and enforced\nthrough hard and persistent efforts. It is of paramount\nimportance therefore that essential human rights-\nrelated activities, such as servicing the treaty\nimplementation machinery or monitoring undertaken\nby the special procedures, are given their due share in\nthe funding provisions of the United Nations regular\nbudget.\nDriven by the objective to promote democracy in\nthe world, the Government of the Republic of Hungary\nhas established the Budapest International Center for\nDemocratic Transition. The Center is set to provide\nassistance for democratic reforms drawing upon the\nexperience of countries that have recently undergone\npolitical, economic and social transition. These\nnations, having had to face and address the challenges\nof transition in the recent past, can probably best serve\nas helping hands to countries in need in this regard.\nIt is in the same spirit that Hungary warmly\nwelcomes the establishment of the United Nations\nDemocracy Fund. The Budapest International Center\nfor Democratic Transition will be eager to coordinate\nits activities with the Fund in the framework of a close\ncooperative relationship.\nHungary finds the resolution to establish a new\nUnited Nations mechanism dealing with the rights of\npersons belonging to national, ethnic, religious and\nlinguistic minorities to be highly encouraging. The\nappointment of an independent expert on minority\n11\n\nissues is an important step in the right direction. The\nUnited Nations however still has a long way to go in\nmeeting the full scope of its responsibilities with\nregard to the international protection of minority\nrights.\nEducating young generations about the lessons of\nthe past is an essential tool to combat discrimination\nand intolerance. For this reason a day of Holocaust\nremembrance has been introduced into Hungarian\nschool curriculum. It is in that same spirit that Hungary\nsupports the proposal to place Holocaust remembrance\non the agenda in the United Nations General Assembly.\nHungary recognizes that development is a central\ngoal by itself and is ready to reaffirm its commitment\nto eradicate poverty and promote sustainable\ndevelopment and global prosperity for all. As a new\nEuropean Union member, Hungary is ready to\ngradually increase her official development assistance.\nThe European Union recently made important\ndecisions in support of Africa\u2019s development efforts.\nWe reaffirm our commitment to contribute urgently to\nmeeting the special needs of that continent.\nWe are encouraged to see that after so many years\nof wars and violence, democratic changes are bearing\nfruit for the peoples of the Western Balkans. It is more\nthan promising that the political and economic\nperspectives offered by the European Union and NATO\nare the main driving forces today for the countries of\nthis region.\nIn order to find lasting solutions to the yet\nunresolved challenges of the Western Balkans, it is\ncrucial to tackle the basic issues of security and\nstability in their broader regional dimensions.\nRegardless of its future status, it is vital that Kosovo be\ntransformed into a viable entity, capable of exercising\nfirm administrative control with a stable law and order\nsituation and a transparent, dependable economy.\nGiven the turbulent history of the Balkans, no long-\nterm solution is conceivable without establishing\nharmonious inter-ethnic relationships. Well-defined\nand strictly implemented minority rights are the\nprimary precondition for peace, stability and prosperity\nboth in Kosovo and in the broader Western Balkans.\nThe Middle East conflict has wide-ranging\nimplications on global peace and security, on the\nprospects of the world economy and, last but not least,\non the fight against international terrorism. Hungary is\nof the firm view that the road map, based on the two-\nStates principle, still gives us the best chance for\nreaching a just and lasting solution.\nThe implementation of the Gaza disengagement\nplan by the Government of Israel has been a step of\ntruly historic proportions. Thus, the Middle East peace\nprocess has been given a new lease on life, but its\nsustainability is subject to further consistent, bold\nmeasures by both sides. In order to maintain the\nmomentum, Israel needs to return to the road map,\nwhile the Palestinian National Authority has to\ndemonstrate its own commitment to the peace process\nby carrying out the long overdue internal reforms and,\nmost importantly, by eradicating terrorism and taking\nthe law and order situation under effective control.\nThe continued instability in Iraq is a matter of\ngrave concern. Hungary strongly condemns the acts of\nviolence and terrorism in Iraq, which aim to undermine\nthe process of reconstruction and political\nnormalization. In spite of the alarming security\nsituation and the obvious internal instability, the\npolitical transition in Iraq is making progress in line\nwith Security Council resolution 1546 (2004). The\napproval of the recently drafted constitution is\nindispensable to carry on the political process. Further\nconsistent efforts are required to properly engage all\nIraqi communities in building a united, stable and\ndemocratic country.\nLet me reiterate Hungary\u2019s continued commitment\nto provide assistance to the people of Iraq in their\nefforts to build a democratic and prosperous country\nthat will soon take its due place in the family of\ndemocratic nations.\nHungary viewed the successful presidential\nelections last October as an important milestone on the\nway to political stabilization in Afghanistan. The\nparliamentary elections held only days ago marked a\nfurther major step leading to the establishment of\nproper democratic institutions in that country. Hungary\nis proud of the humanitarian assistance it has provided\nto the people of Afghanistan, as well as of the\ncontribution it has made to facilitate the process of\npolitical stabilization. My country is ready to undertake\nfurther commitments in order to assist the Afghan\npeople in rebuilding their country in peace and\nsecurity.\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\nalong with their means of delivery continues to\nundermine international peace and security. The threat\n12\n\nthat terrorist groups and non-State actors will acquire\nnuclear, biological and chemical weapons is a major\nconcern to us all. At the last session of the General\nAssembly, Hungary expressed its strong support for the\nfull implementation of Security Council resolution\n1540 (2004), and called on all States to establish\neffective national export controls. We have noted with\nsatisfaction that a great number of Member States had\nsubmitted comprehensive reports on their national\nmeasures serving the aim and purpose of the\nresolution.\nThe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (NPT) is still a cornerstone of international\npeace, security and stability. The 2005 NPT Review\nConference, however, failed to live up to our\nexpectations. The international community needs to\nfulfil its responsibility in preserving the integrity of the\nTreaty while promoting its universal character.\nRecognizing the grave threat posed by biological\nweapons, Hungary will work together with other\nnations in the run-up to the upcoming Biological and\nToxic Weapons Review Conference. Hungary will\nstrive to explore opportunities to strengthen the\nBiological and Toxin Weapons Convention.\nMy country remains committed to the Ottawa\nConvention banning landmines. We will have\ndestroyed all equipment under the provisions of the\nConvention by the end of 2005, well in advance of the\ndeadline.\nAt the current session, beyond the wide range of\nissues to be tackled, we have to make important\ndecisions to put on track the implementation of the\noutcome document adopted by the High-level Plenary\nMeeting of the General Assembly. If we are guided by\na sense of common responsibility and firmly anchored\nrealism, the momentum for reform will be maintained.\nThe delegation of Hungary stands ready to work in\npartnership with other delegations to make this happen."

        "file_text": "Let me begin,\nMr. President, by congratulating you upon your\nelection as President of the General Assembly and\nassure you of my country\u2019s unwavering support for\nyour endeavours. Your previous experience at the\nUnited Nations ensures that under your guidance the\nAssembly will continue to promote the values and\nprinciples of our Organization.\nI also wish to extend our sincere thanks to the\noutgoing President, Mr. Ping. His tireless efforts in all\nfields, particularly in the preparations for the High-\nlevel Plenary Meeting, have been exemplary.\nGreece fully subscribes to the statement delivered\nearlier by the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom\non behalf of the European Union, as well as to the\nEuropean Union priorities presented to the General\nAssembly.\nI would also like to express our appreciation to\nthe Secretary-General for his relentless efforts to\npromote peace and security and to safeguard the moral\nauthority and the pre-eminent role of our United\nNations.\nAt the beginning of the twenty-first century, we\ncontinue to face many threats and challenges that\nundermine the basic values and principles of our\nsocieties and test our will and determination to abide\nby the obligations and restraints inherent in those\nvalues and principles. Only through concerted\ncollective action, dialogue and mutual understanding\ncan we confront them and pave the way for a better and\nbrighter future.\nTerrorism has emerged as the most important\nchallenge of our times, creating an atmosphere of\ncollective fear, intolerance and a never-ending cycle of\nviolence. Throughout history, violence has never\nproven to be an answer to our problems. Peace,\nstability and security can only be achieved through\ntolerance, acceptance and the realization that our\ncommon interests far outweigh our differences. There\nis no justification whatsoever for terrorism. It is high\ntime for an urgent collective effort to put an immediate\nend to that modern scourge.\nNatural disasters, like the tsunami in Asia and the\nrecent hurricane in the southern part of the United\nStates \u2014 with so many victims and unimaginable\ndestruction \u2014 also demonstrate sufficiently the\nimportance of international cooperation and the urgent\nneed for human solidarity.\nI am fully aware of the importance of economic\ndevelopment for a considerable part of the world.\nSecurity and sustainable development go hand in hand.\nOur collective commitment and efforts are needed to\ncorrect the imbalances and disparities in the world. It is\nonly a matter of time before extreme poverty, hunger\nand the catastrophic impact of widespread diseases will\nlead to strife, internal or external. The foremost\nexample of that is in Africa, where the vicious cycle of\npoverty, conflict and HIV/AIDS produces an explosive\ncombination ripping apart the fabric of their societies\nand threatening them with unprecedented and dire\nconsequences.\n22\n\nMultilateral cooperation is the only way to a\nbetter world. The international multilateral system\nmust be enhanced and strengthened. Greece fully\nparticipates in the policies formulated by the European\nUnion and the various international organizations that\ncontribute to the economic development of all areas of\nthe world in order to redress existing imbalances.\nWe appreciate the value of cultural diversity in a\nworld unfortunately so often divided by discrimination.\nWe believe in dialogue among cultures, among people\nand among societies. We fully support the peaceful\nresolution of all our disputes on the basis of\ninternational law and the United Nations Charter. We\nare deeply committed to the United Nations and what it\nrepresents and to effective multilateralism and the pre-\neminence of international law.\nLooking at Greece\u2019s immediate neighbourhood,\nthe Balkans, we realize that it has not yet been fully\ntransformed into a region of peace, stability and\nprosperity.\nIn Kosovo, the trauma created by the repression\nof the past and the inter-ethnic violence that plagued\nthe region for so long has yet to be healed. There is a\nneed for a settlement that is in conformity with\ninternational legality, as expressed by the United\nNations, and with European standards and values \u2014 a\nsettlement which will enhance regional stability.\nWe remain convinced that European integration is\nthe only way to find permanent solutions to existing\nproblems and challenges in the area. At the same time,\nregional cooperation must be strengthened so as to\neffectively address the problems of the neighbourhood.\nGreece, which holds the chairmanship-in-office of the\nSouth-East European Cooperation Process, is\ndetermined to strengthen the institutional aspects of\nthat process and to develop it into the real voice of the\nregion.\nI deeply regret that the Cyprus problem remains\nunresolved. In the 31 years of military occupation of\nmore than one third of the territory of Cyprus, Greece\nhas strongly supported every attempt and initiative by\nthe United Nations to achieve a comprehensive\nsettlement of the Cyprus problem.\nIn the light of the outcome of last year\u2019s\nreferendums, which should be fully respected, any new\ninitiative will have to be carefully prepared so as to\nensure real chances for success. For our part, we are\nready to work towards building the necessary common\nground, which will render possible the re-launching of\nmeaningful negotiations.\nOur ultimate goal remains an agreed solution\nbetween the two parties. We remain steadfastly\ncommitted to reaching a just and viable solution for the\nreunification of the island following negotiations on\nthe basis of the Secretary-General\u2019s plan and the\nrelevant Security Council resolutions, and in\nconformity with European Union principles and acquis.\nIn this endeavour, Greece will spare no effort.\nThe climate of our bilateral relations with Turkey\nover recent years has been constantly improving. We\nhave made vigorous efforts to put our relations on a\nnew, solid track. Significant progress has been\nachieved in several areas of our bilateral cooperation,\nand Turkey\u2019s European Union perspective will further\nbroaden the scope of our relations.\nThe latest developments in the Middle East allow\nus to maintain a certain level of reserved optimism.\nThe Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and parts of the\nnorthern West Bank does, indeed, constitute an\nimportant milestone. This is a momentous opportunity\nto revitalize the road map and to move the process a\nstep closer to achieving a fair, lasting and\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East.\nThe road map remains the framework for the\nachievement of a just and lasting peace. Both parties\nshould concentrate on fulfilling their respective\nobligations and commitments and refrain from any and\nall unilateral actions which threaten to prejudge the\noutcome of final status negotiations and undermine\nefforts at building confidence on the ground.\nOur shared goal remains the realization of a two-\nState solution: Israel and a democratic, viable and\nterritorially contiguous State of Palestine, living side\nby side in peace and security.\nWith regard to Iraq, Greece underlines the\nimportance of its territorial integrity and unity in the\nframework of a federal system. We remain particularly\nconcerned, however, about the ongoing violence,\nwhich makes it imperative to follow the timetable of\nthe political process that will lead the country to\nnormalcy, which is of vital importance for peace and\nstability in the entire region. We fully support Iraq in\nthis difficult mission.\n23\n\nMy country has a long, historic relationship with\nthe African continent and its peoples. We have\nwitnessed with great concern the series of conflict\nsituations that have been plaguing Africa for many\nyears. We are following developments in all cases and\nare trying to make positive contributions, whether in\nthe Sudan, in the Democratic Republic of Congo or\nother countries of West Africa, in the settlement of the\ndispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and elsewhere.\nThe emerging pivotal role of the African Union in\ndealing with African crises has our full support and\ndeep appreciation.\nLast Friday, we adopted a historic declaration,\nwhich constitutes a new and important step in the\ndirection of enforcing collective security and\nstrengthening the United Nations capacity to deal with\nthe new challenges and threats that our societies are\nfacing today. Our efforts should now focus on the\nimplementation of the commitments made, so that\ngenerations to come can live in a better and more\nsecure world."

        "file_text": "At the outset I\nwould like to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your\nelection to the presidency of the sixtieth session of the\nGeneral Assembly. I have known you personally for a\nlong time as a very skilful and highly professional\ndiplomat and I wish you every success in making new\nachievements in that highly responsible post. I would\nalso like to express our appreciation to your\npredecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, for the competence and\ndedication with which he guided the work of the fifty-\nninth session of the General Assembly.\nWhile it is too early to assess the impact of the\n2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1)\nadopted at the High-level Plenary Meeting, I will\nventure to say that the path leading up to it was thorny,\nif not challenging, at times.\nAzerbaijan has always been and will remain\ncommitted to the purposes, principles and values\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter and other\nlandmark documents. Respect for the norms and\nprinciples of international law and diligent observance\nof international obligations by Member States serve as\nindicators of their adherence to those values and\nprinciples.\nAzerbaijan fully supports a collective approach to\nsecurity. We are committed to taking concerted action,\nin conformity with the United Nations Charter, to\nremove threats to peace and security, foster sustainable\n24\n\neconomic development and support democracy-\nbuilding and protection of human rights.\nWe reaffirm our determination to continue the\nreforms that will eventually improve the functional\ncapacity of the United Nations and its decision-making\nprocesses, especially with regard to crisis and conflict\nmanagement.\nSince our accession to the United Nations, the\nOrganization has been closely associated in our society\nwith our hopes for the liberation of the territories of\nAzerbaijan occupied by Armenia. Although the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE) is deeply involved in the settlement process,\nthe prompt response of the Security Council to the\noccupation of the territories of Azerbaijan and the\nadoption of four Security Council resolutions \u2014 822\n(1993), 853 (1993), 874 (1993) and 884 (1993) \u2014 still\ngives us hope for the peaceful settlement of the conflict\nin and around the Nagorny Karabakh region of the\nRepublic of Azerbaijan. The principles unanimously\nadopted by the Security Council in those resolutions\ncontinue to be the basis for the settlement of the\nconflict.\nLast year the General Assembly\u2019s consideration\nof the agenda item entitled \u201cThe situation in the\noccupied territories of Azerbaijan\u201d played a crucial\nrole in attracting attention to the dangerous practices\ncarried out by Armenia in the occupied territories of\nAzerbaijan.\nAs for the negotiation process itself, I must admit\nthat we are now at a critical juncture where the chances\nfor resolution of the conflict are cautiously optimistic.\nThe Government of Azerbaijan remains committed to\nthe peaceful settlement of this protracted conflict,\nbased on respect for the norms and principles of\ninternational law, the implementation of the relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions and related OSCE\ndocuments and decisions. We expect that the Armenian\nside will take a similarly constructive approach and\nwill not miss this window of opportunity.\nThere is no room for illusions. Azerbaijan will\nnever compromise its territorial integrity. Only the\nreturn of all the occupied territories to Azerbaijan will\nhelp restore our trust and confidence in Armenia and\nits declared intention of establishing good-neighbourly\nrelations with Azerbaijan. Such a step would remove\nthe label of aggressor from the Government of\nArmenia \u2014 a label it inherited after it occupied the\nterritories of Azerbaijan \u2014 and allow both parties to\nbenefit from the opportunities the settlement of the\nconflict will bring.\nWe are ready to provide security assurances for\nthe Armenian population of the Nagorny Karabakh\nregion of Azerbaijan. As for the status of the region, it\nis necessary to create favourable conditions for the\nsecure and dignified return of the expelled Azerbaijani\npopulation to the Nagorny Karabakh region and to\nother occupied territories, to establish normal living\nconditions there and to provide opportunities for\neconomic development for both communities.\nOnce the agreement is achieved, for both political\nand legal guarantees of its implementation we will\nneed the international community\u2019s support for the\ndeployment of multinational peacekeeping forces,\ndemining, the restoration of communications, the\nrehabilitation of lands and the provision of security\nguarantees for the population in the Nagorny Karabakh\nregion of Azerbaijan, including the creation of local\npolice forces in the region for both Armenian and\nAzerbaijani communities.\nLast but not least, I should like to make a point\non conflict resolution. It concerns the issue of the\ncommunication of Armenians living in the Nagorny\nKarabakh region of Azerbaijan with Armenia and that\nof Azerbaijanis living in the Nakhchivan region of\nAzerbaijan with the rest of the country. We suggest that\nthe so-called Lachin corridor \u2014 which should be called\na road of peace \u2014 be used by both sides in both\ndirections, provided that security on the road is ensured\nby the multinational peacekeeping force in the initial\nstage.\nThe road\u2019s importance extends beyond the\npractical benefits of direct transport communications\nbetween Armenia and Azerbaijan; the road should be\nconsidered, first and foremost, as the path leading to\npeace and cooperation in the South Caucasus region.\nToday, from this rostrum, after the recent meeting of\nthe Presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia, held in\nKazan on 26 August 2005, I urge the Armenian side\nnot to miss this opportunity to move the negotiation\nprocess forward with the assistance of the\nCo-Chairmen of the OSCE Minsk Group, in\naccordance with the key understandings reached in the\nPrague process.\nAzerbaijan believes that development reinforces\ndemocratic transformation, the rule of law and respect\n25\n\nfor human rights. We agree that it is urgent and\nimportant to achieve the international development\nagenda. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)\nremain an indispensable part of that agenda and\nrepresent measures of States\u2019 contributions to and\nimpacts on global efforts in their quest for a better\nexistence.\nCooperation in the areas of debt, assistance and\ntrade can open up new opportunities for development\nfinancing and can reinforce national efforts to mobilize\nneeded resources. Here, the special development needs\nof Africa deserve serious attention. Azerbaijan\ntherefore welcomes the recent decision by the Group of\nEight Governments to cancel the debt of heavily\nindebted poor countries.\nWe also consider official development assistance\nto be an important investment in self-sustaining\ndevelopment. We firmly believe that, if aid is to be\neffective, greater interagency coordination is required\nat all levels. The United Nations Development Group\nand the United Nations Resident Coordinator have a\ncritical role to play in this field. We fully support the\nstrengthening of both structures.\nYet another area requiring increased cooperation\nis international trade. Addressing issues related to\nimproving market access and terms of trade as well as\novercoming supply side constraints can revive the\nDoha round. Azerbaijan believes that the 2005 world\nsummit will renew the sense of urgency to build strong\npolitical will and a coherent policy approach aimed at\ncreating a more favourable multilateral trade system\nduring the forthcoming ministerial meeting of the\nWorld Trade Organization, to be held in Hong Kong. In\nthe meantime, we believe that the development\nchallenges of landlocked developing countries should\nbe effectively addressed, bearing in mind the recently\nadopted Asunci\u00f3n Platform for the Doha Development\nRound.\nWe recognize the crucial role of regional\norganizations, including United Nations regional\ncommissions, in enhancing regional cooperation to\npromote sustainable development. Azerbaijan places\nemphasis on the development of transregional transport\nand communication lines and makes its contribution\nthrough the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline and the\nBaku-Tbilisi-Erzerum natural gas pipeline. We also\nlook forward to the building of a new Baku-\nAkhalkalaki-Tbilisi-Kars railroad.\nAzerbaijan is committed to poverty eradication\nand has identified it as an overarching goal in its\ndevelopment strategies. Although we are encouraged\nby the implementation perspectives presented in the\nreport of the Millennium Project, we highlight the need\nfor assistance to complement the efforts of national\nleadership, especially in the areas of capacity-building,\nscience and technology and environmental protection.\nThe achievement of the Millennium Development\nGoals requires not only public investment in\ninfrastructure and human capital, but also investment\nin improving governance, which includes an efficient,\nproperly resourced and adequately staffed institutional\nsystem as well as political accountability, transparency\nand participation. Azerbaijan attaches particular\nimportance to progress in this area. In recognition of\nthe central role of good governance in poverty\nreduction and development, we have formulated\nadditional national MDGs to address governance\nissues. Specific targets in that area include, inter alia,\nreform of the overall State system of public\nadministration, legislation and policy by the year 2015.\nRecognizing the destructive effects of natural\ndisasters on the sustainable development of countries\nand communities, Azerbaijan, as a disaster-prone\ncountry, believes that efforts aimed at disaster\nmitigation should place particular emphasis on\nawareness-raising programmes and on the development\nof early warning capacities.\nIt is clear that national ownership of the design,\nimplementation and coordination of humanitarian\nresponse and transition programmes in both post-\ndisaster and post-conflict situations is essential to\nensure the desired impact and the sustainability of such\nprogrammes. However, there is a need for the efficient\nsharing of responsibilities between national authorities\nand international humanitarian and development actors,\nparticularly in protracted humanitarian situations with\nmass displacement and limited national capacities to\ntackle all existing problems. Humanitarian assistance\nand funding should not be limited to providing\nimmediate responses to crises; they must take into\naccount long-term needs in the transition phase.\nPromoting human rights and the rule of law has\nbeen an integral part of our national development\nstrategy as a result of our conviction that the full\nenjoyment of human rights, while a goal in itself,\nserves as a foundation for sustainable development. We\n26\n\nneed to increase our ability to deal with human rights\nchallenges and to adequately respond to them,\nparticularly in times of conflict and crisis.\nIn conclusion, I would like to assure the\nAssembly that Azerbaijan will remain committed to the\nideals that are the foundation of the Organization, and\nto express my confidence that at this critical juncture\nfor multilateralism, the international community will\nspare no effort to make the United Nations more\nefficient and more relevant to the needs of its Member\nStates."

        "file_text": "First of all, let me take this opportunity to congratulate\nMr. Jan Eliasson on his election to the high position of\nPresident of the General Assembly and to wish him\nevery success in guiding the work of the session. I\nwould also like to thank his predecessor, Mr. Jean Ping,\nfor his able leadership as the President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-ninth session.\nIt is obvious that the years-long process of\nreorganizing the entire system of international\nrelations, in particular reform of the United Nations,\nhas been unreasonably delayed. The 2005 summit was\nan important stage in exploring mutually acceptable\nformulas and in adopting goals whose implementation\nwill lead us to the achievement of development and\nsecurity.\nSome of the decisions taken at the summit were\nmedium-term and others long-term in nature. But, in\nour view, our primary task is to ensure their full\nimplementation and not to allow inertia to impede this,\nas has been the case in the process of implementing the\nMillennium Development Goals.\nStrengthening the capacity of the United Nations\nto achieve its goals in the three areas of development,\nsecurity and human rights requires appropriate and\nactive adaptation of the entire United Nations system.\nIn this connection we consider it important to make the\nfollowing comments. First, regardless of how\nimportant it is to reform and modernize the United\nNations, there is, at present, no alternative to the\nOrganization.\nSecondly, further delay in reform of the most\nimportant bodies of the Organization will negatively\nimpact its role in the modern world. There is a real\ndanger that if the United Nations fails to take action, its\ncoordinating role will gradually pass to other\ninternational structures, which lack the degree of broad\nrepresentation that the United Nations enjoys.\nThirdly, the reform of three main bodies of the\nUnited Nations \u2014 the General Assembly, the Security\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council \u2014\nshould provide balance in their work. In that regard, we\nconsider it to be in our common interest that Security\nCouncil reform not be prolonged. It should be carried\n26\n\nout during the main part of the sixtieth session, before\nthe year is out.\nFourthly, regional approaches should be given\npriority in dealing with development, security and\nhuman rights issues. The effectiveness of the principle\nof moving from regional to global approaches has\nalready been proved on many occasions.\nAt present, Uzbekistan is implementing its\nnational goals for economic development. It is carrying\nout economic reforms and taking measures to\nstrengthen regional economic cooperation. However,\nany national efforts need to be supported by\ninternational economic structures. It is important that\ngenuine conditions for an equal and fair international\neconomic order be established. International donors\nmust provide their full support for regional\ncooperation, and interested developing countries, in\nturn, need to make that kind of cooperation an integral\npart of their national strategy.\nWe believe it important for the concerned\nregional commissions of the United Nations \u2014 the\nEconomic Commission for Europe and the Economic\nand Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific \u2014 to\nstrengthen their work to assist economic development\nin Central Asia, with a view to the greater and broader\ninvolvement of the countries of the region in\ninternational economic relations and investment\ncooperation. We are of the view that the international\ncommunity, including the United Nations, should pay\nserious attention to the question of creating a Central\nAsian common market capable of ensuring the rational\nand effective use of the rich potential and resources of\nthe region.\nUzbekistan supports all efforts to ensure\nsustainable development. Member States should pool\ntheir efforts to tackle problems of environmental\ndegradation, shortages of water resources and drinking\nwater and the deterioration of environmental\nconditions in cities and industrial zones. The global\nenvironmental agenda also calls for the pressing issues\nof desertification, biodiversity and climate change to\nbe addressed.\nActs of terrorism carried out in many regions of\nthe world, including Central Asia, have once again\nreminded us of the need for a critical assessment of the\npractice of international cooperation, including within\nthe United Nations, to counter that plague of the\ntwenty-first century, which threatens rich and poor\nStates alike. It is unacceptable to further delay taking\nmeasures against those international centres of\nterrorism and extremism that \u2014 under the guise of\nespousing universal human values \u2014 in fact develop\nand disseminate ideologies of fanaticism. In that\nconnection, we welcome the Security Council\u2019s most\nrecent counter-terrorism resolution \u2014 resolution 1624\n(2005) of 14 September 2005 \u2014 on the suppression of\nincitement to terrorist acts. At the same time, we\nbelieve it is crucial not to allow double standards in the\nimplementation of that instrument. Those\nconsiderations should also be concerns in the process\nof drafting a universal convention on international\nterrorism.\nA powerful accomplice of international terrorism\nis drug trafficking. Unfortunately, no actual progress\nhas been seen in reducing drug production in\nAfghanistan. On that issue, we need to move urgently\nfrom words to action. In that connection, we are\ncounting on the international community\u2019s firm support\nfor Uzbekistan\u2019s initiative to establish a Central Asian\nregional information and coordination centre to counter\ntransboundary crimes related to drug trafficking.\nThe President returned to the Chair.\nTogether with the pressing problems of\ndevelopment and security there is the issue of human\nrights. That issue is central to forging a new path in\ninternational relations, and to United Nations reform,\nin particular. In his report, \u201cIn larger freedom\u201d\n(A/59/2005), the Secretary-General notes that\ninternational treaties adopted over the past six decades\nform an impressive normative basis for ensuring full\ninternational acknowledgement and respect for human\nrights and freedoms. There is no doubt that protection\nof human rights needs to be one of the core tasks for\nthe United Nations.\nUzbekistan is a party to all the major\ninternational human rights instruments and it is\nsteadily moving towards democracy and the formation\nof a civil society. One important step in that direction\nwas the decision to abolish the death penalty in the\ncountry, as proposed by Uzbekistan\u2019s President Islam\nKarimov.\nWe are convinced that reform of the United\nNations human rights system needs to be carried out\nstep by step, consistently, and taking into account the\nconcerns of all interested parties. Along with political\nrights, it is necessary to strengthen other human rights,\n27\n\nincluding socio-economic and environmental rights.\nWe reiterate our position that it is unacceptable to\npoliticize the issue of human rights or to be selective in\nreviewing human rights situations, even more so when\nUnited Nations bodies or mechanisms are involved.\nThe establishment of a stable and long-lasting\npeace in Afghanistan is of strategic value for\nUzbekistan. In that context, we welcome the\nparliamentary elections that were held in Afghanistan\non 18 September. That event has become another\nimportant step towards restoring statehood to\nAfghanistan. Uzbekistan supports the efforts aimed at\nthe prompt stabilization of the situation in Afghanistan.\nConsidering Afghanistan to be a part of the Central\nAsian region, we encourage its active participation in\nregional integration processes. Uzbekistan is providing\nbroad support to the Afghan people, as well as to\nrelevant mechanisms of the United Nations and other\ninternational organizations, to aid the reconstruction\nprocess in that country.\nFive years after the Millennium Summit, Member\nStates have adopted an historic decision to launch\nreform and renovate the mechanisms of the United\nNations. We have a unique opportunity to carry out\nmore far-reaching reforms to adapt the Organization to\nnew realities. The aim of those reforms is to ensure the\nwell-being and prosperity of all our peoples. Today the\ntime has come to make decisions and take action. Any\nprotraction of the process could seriously paralyse the\nsystem of international relations, allow current threats\nand challenges to become irreversible, and lead to a\nsituation in which the international community is\nunable to take timely and appropriate measures.\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate the\nreadiness of Uzbekistan to cooperate actively with\nother States in creating more effective and just United\nNations."

        "file_text": "One week\nago, the world summit sent a message of hope for\npeace, development and human rights for all, and took\na number of steps towards institutional reform at the\nUnited Nations. The summit meeting has achieved\nmuch. It has also left a lot undone and has not met our\nexpectations in several areas. We agree with the\nGeneral Assembly President\u2019s assessment that only the\nwork we do over the next few months will allow us a\nfinal assessment of the value of the outcome document.\nThe summit certainly did not achieve the\ncomprehensive breakthrough we had hoped for. We\ntherefore look forward to working under the\nPresident\u2019s guidance on the follow-up and\nimplementation and welcome the fact that he has\nstarted this process immediately. Institutional change\nmust be the focus of our attention over the next few\nmonths, both through the creation of new bodies and\nthe adaptation of existing ones. We will give particular\nattention to the Human Rights Council, the Security\nCouncil, the General Assembly and the Secretariat.\nWe shared the general relief at the last-minute\nagreement on the outcome document, since a lack of\nsuch agreement would have been disastrous. We had\ncreated expectations that were much higher than what\nwe could have possibly achieved, at a time when the\nUnited Nations seemed more in need of reform than\never before. The reputation and the worldwide image\nof the United Nations is clearly not what it used to\nbe \u2014 the oil-for-food scandal, cases of sexual\nexploitation by United Nations peacekeepers, inaction\nin the face of mass crimes and humanitarian crises\nhave overshadowed the many success stories that this\nOrganization has to tell.\n15\n\nIt is important to move on from the oil-for-food\nscandal. Moving on, however, must not mean that we\nignore, yet again, the fact that the massive abuse and\nmismanagement revealed in the Volcker reports are but\none expression of what is a systemic problem. Too\nmuch went wrong in the oil-for-food programme, and\neverybody involved failed in their responsibilities in\none way or another, including the Security Council. No\nbureaucracy can be changed overnight, as we all know\nfrom our national experience; but it is clear that only a\nmore accountable Secretariat, one that works without\nundue pressure from us, the Member States, can restore\nthe confidence of the peoples it is meant to serve.\nAccountability must also be a key principle for\nthe intergovernmental bodies and thus guide us in our\nwork on the relevant reforms. We are concerned at the\nincreasingly skewed institutional balance within the\nOrganization. The Security Council has clearly taken\non a role that goes far beyond the central place it was\ngiven under the Charter. Indeed, its activities are\nincreasingly venturing into the domains reserved for\nthe General Assembly, in particular.\nThis entails a twofold risk. On the one hand,\nmany countries increasingly feel a lack of ownership of\nthe Organization, although collective ownership based\non the principle of sovereign equality is one of the\ncornerstones of the Organization. On the other hand,\nthe Security Council is at risk of being paralysed by the\nsheer amount of issues on its agenda. The answer to\nthis challenge is clear: we need a stronger General\nAssembly that asserts its central role and carries out its\nfunctions effectively. In parallel, the Security Council\nmust become more transparent and accountable in\norder to truly carry out its functions on behalf of the\nentire membership.\nThe lack of a solution to the complex issue of\nSecurity Council reform is a disappointment to many.\nEnlargement and a more representative Council are\nclear necessities, and we will do our part to achieve an\nearly solution, with the strongest possible political\nsupport. In addition, and not less importantly, we must\nalso improve the working methods of the Security\nCouncil, as stated in the World Summit Outcome\n(resolution 60/1). Transparency, accountability and\nstronger involvement of States that are not members of\nthe Council are of decisive importance to enable it to\ntruly act on behalf of the membership, as mandated by\nthe Charter. We will work hard for early and concrete\nresults, since effective changes in the daily workings of\nthe Council would benefit the entire membership.\nWe routinely repeat our annual call for a stronger\nGeneral Assembly. Small steps are taken every year,\nand all of them are important. It appears to us,\nhowever, that the most essential efforts to revitalize the\nGeneral Assembly do not come from measures\ncontained in General Assembly resolutions. Rather,\nMember States must ensure that the Assembly is seized\nwith truly relevant topics that are treated efficiently\nand effectively. We may deplore the migration of topics\nto the Security Council that we think should be dealt\nwith instead by the General Assembly. This trend,\nhowever, will continue unabated unless the Assembly\nproves to be a central decision-making body that takes\nits responsibilities seriously. The Assembly is what we,\nas Member States, want it to be. A genuine and\nsustained effort is, therefore, required from all of us.\nWe continue to fully support the early\nestablishment of a Human Rights Council to replace\nthe Commission on Human Rights. Like others, we\nwere disappointed at the meagre substance on this\ntopic that found its way into the outcome document.\nThe Organization needs a standing body that\neffectively promotes human rights worldwide, swiftly\nresponds to gross and systematic violations of human\nrights and reflects the importance of human rights for\nthis Organization. Close cooperation with a\nstrengthened Office of the High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights will be essential. The Council must not\nduplicate the work carried out by other bodies, in\nparticular the General Assembly. It must, therefore, not\nbe a remake of the Commission on Human Rights with\na new label. We look forward to working with the\npresidency towards an early solution that would add\nconcrete value for the protection and promotion of\nhuman rights.\nMr. Loizaga (Paraguay), Vice-President, took the\nChair.\nWe consider the recognition of the \u201cresponsibility\nto protect\u201d as one of the most positive elements in the\noutcome document. The main obligation for its\nimplementation naturally falls to the Security Council.\nThe Council has to ensure that disgraceful inaction,\nsuch as in the case of the genocide in Rwanda, cannot\never occur again. When the lives of innocent civilians\nare at stake, such a responsibility must not be\ncompromised by political considerations. Collective\n16\n\naction to prevent and respond to genocide, crimes\nagainst humanity and war crimes must, therefore, not\nbe made impossible by a veto or threat of veto by one\nof the permanent members of the Council. We hope\nthat the Council will stand up to the challenge raised\nby the summit. The membership as a whole clearly has\na shared obligation in this respect.\nOur achievement in the Summit Outcome on the\n\u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d stands in stark contrast to\nour silence on the importance of fighting impunity for\nthe worst crimes of international concern. More\nprogress has been made in this area in the past few\nyears than in almost any other area of international\nrelations. Transitional justice is now an inevitable\nelement of any serious effort to help societies in post-\nconflict situations. There is now a close and well-\nestablished relationship between the International\nCriminal Court and the United Nations, in particular\nafter the Security Council decision to mandate the\nCourt to investigate the crimes in Darfur. We trust that\nefforts to fight impunity will remain a high priority for\nthe Organization, recognizing the central role of the\nInternational Criminal Court in that respect.\nWhile it may be premature to pronounce a final\njudgement on the value of the outcome document, one\nthing can be said with certainty: that document is a\nreflection of what is agreeable five years after the\nMillennium Summit. It is remarkable how uneven\nprogress has been in several areas. Major advances,\nsuch as the decision to fill an institutional void by\ncreating a Peacebuilding Commission, are\naccompanied by major failures, such as the absence of\nany agreement in the area of disarmament and non-\nproliferation. We have no choice but to build on the\npositive elements of the Summit Outcome and to find\nearly solutions to institutional questions, in particular.\nProgress in those areas should help us to intensify our\nwork and eventually to find agreement on unresolved\nquestions in vital areas such as disarmament and non-\nproliferation. In this way, we can make the summit a\nturning point in the history of the United Nations.\nTwo years ago, the Secretary-General said that\nwe had reached a fork in the road; that observation was\nrepeated many times during the process leading up to\nthe summit. So where are we today? Looking back at\nwhat we have achieved, it seems that we have taken the\nadvice of Yogi Berra, one of the great legends of the\nCity of New York, who said: \u201cWhen you come to a\nfork in the road, take it!\u201d"

        "file_text": "At the end of the first five years of the third\nmillennium, this Organization must go through a phase\nof maturity after sixty years of life, enough time to\nhave formed a collective understanding of the major\nproblems still facing mankind and to find the most\neffective ways to address them. Recent facts show that\nthis is the reality that we shall have to deal with for\nsome time in the future.\nThere are many challenges facing the United\nNations, both internal and global problems. By way of\nillustration, I should like to refer to two of those\nchallenges: one internal, namely, the much-needed\ndemocratization of this Organization and the other\nexternal, the problem of poverty, which is the most\nimportant, growing and alarming problem of\n36\n\ncontemporary society. I should like to invite all\ndelegations to give these two problems careful thought.\nDemocracy, at the current stage of human\ndevelopment, is the highest form of political\norganization. Democracy, owing to its very nature and\nas a vital condition, implies the equal exercise of rights\nas the ideal way to reach the best possible living\nconditions. What is valid for one country taken\nindividually applies even more to organizations in\nwhich many sovereign nations are represented, all with\nequal rights.\nThe United Nations is the most emblematic case\nin the modern society of nations. As a result, it should\nbe the true embodiment and example of the equal\nexercise of democratic rights. If we agree on this basic\nprinciple, one question immediately comes to mind: is\nthis Organization a democratic institution? Are its\npractices useful, as we have seen in very recent\ndecisions adopted by a small number of Members in a\ndocument presented in the first meeting? Is this a\nuseful example of a transparent democratic exercise on\nthe part of the sovereign nations represented here?\nThe answer, regrettably, is a resounding \u201cno\u201d. On\nthe contrary, what we have seen is a dangerous process\nin which oligarchies are being built, where a small\ngroup of countries usurp the right to take decisions\nwithout taking into account the vast majority of\ncountries that ultimately represent the overwhelming\nmajority of the global population. This is what usually\nhappens with matters affecting the fate of billions of\nhuman beings.\nFor those reasons, when we talk about reform, the\nfirst thing to do is to define the nature of this reform,\nwhich can have no other goal than the democratization\nof this Organization. That means giving decision-\nmaking power in fundamental matters to the General\nAssembly and ending once and for all the\nOrganization\u2019s oligarchic and, very often, autocratic\npractices, which diminish its authority in the eyes of\nthe world.\nIn our humble but firm opinion, this is the major\nchallenge the Organization faces internally. Its very\nexistence depends on the successful resolution of this\nissue. We have no doubt about that, and let us not\ndoubt it.\nIn the external sphere, the most important\nchallenge lies in the agonizing escalation that daily\ntraps millions of human beings living in poverty.\nPoverty \u2014 as we have heard here in many statements \u2014\nis the result of an unjust system of distribution of the\nearthly goods of men that therefore denies men any\nspiritual value. It is an unfair system of distribution\nthat stems from a distorted matrix whose dominant\nforce is a ruthless thirst for profit and in which\ngrowing wealth is based on the expansion and\ndeepening of poverty. This is the reality that we see\nday after day, not only, to the surprise of many, in the\nso-called poor countries, but also in countries where\nopulence is obscenely on display, every second,\nthrough the mass media, attracting millions of people\nwho are trying to improve their living conditions, only\nto crash into a wall raised by those who preach market\nfreedom and the free movement of capital but who do\nnot tolerate the movement of human beings except\nwhen they are needed as a labour force to further\nexpand their wealth.\nThis is the painful truth that the tragedy of\nKatrina has revealed. It is a painful reality that has\nprofoundly shaken all of those for whom nothing about\nhuman beings is strange, wherever it may occur.\nThese problems should have become the focal\npoints of the entire document that was approved in a\nstrange \u201cconsensus\u201d \u2014 a word I do not hesitate to\nplace between quotation marks. Little attention has\nbeen paid to this drama. But the drama is there; it is\nboiling across the world. That generates instability,\nbecause if there is one thing that human society is not\nmade for, it is suicide. It seeks desperate forms of\nsurvival, and that is why, as the great Peruvian Cesar\nVallejo said once, it lights its captive torch and prays\nangrily. These are days of suffering but also days of\nanger in many parts of the world, and that generates\ninstability. If we want stability in the world, let us\napply social justice, a new system of distribution\namong regions and a new system of solidarity for\ndistribution within nations that cannot be limited to\ncharity or assistance often delivered under humiliating\nconditions.\nThere are many ideas that bring us to this\nmeeting, I am sure. On some of the most important\nproblems we have already defined our position in\nprevious statements. We will continue doing so in this\nsession. For the time being, we would simply add a\nbasic item: how difficult it is to realize man\u2019s\ndemocratic dream when man finds himself prevented\nfrom satisfying his most basic conditions for a life of\n37\n\ndignity: health, nutrition, a roof over his head and the\nopportunity to enjoy basic rights.\nWe trust in the wisdom of the peoples and the\nnew leadership that through its voice speaks for silent\nmillions. We trust in the struggle of those who, as the\ngreat Mart\u00ed said, have thrown in their lot with the poor\nof the earth. Thus some day, in the not-so-distant\nfuture, we will find ourselves in a better world, with a\nlife worth living and a United Nations strengthened by\nthe essential values of men and women of dignity, who\nare the majority on this planet."

        "file_text": "Taking\nthe floor for the first time before this Assembly, it is\nmy genuine pleasure warmly to congratulate you, Sir,\non your election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its sixtieth session. Your election was a\npersonal honour to you and a recognition of the\ndiplomatic skills that we all acknowledge. It also\nenhances the prestigious image of your country. Please\nrest assured of the support of the Union of the\nComoros as you complete your exalted mission.\nYour predecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, deserves our full\nadmiration and congratulations on the effectiveness and\ndevotion with which he led the work of the fifty-ninth\nsession.\nI also wish to reiterate our confidence in\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan and above all to express\nour gratitude for his tireless commitment to establishing\na more just, peaceful and prosperous world.\nOur world faces challenges and threats that\njeopardize our security and prosperity. And yet, we\nhave also seen unprecedented technological and\nscientific development. That disparity highlights the\nstark reversal of our human values and of the basic\nprinciples of promoting peace, respect for human\ndignity and international solidarity.\nIs there any need to list the modern scourges that\nhave engulfed every region of the world: extremism,\nterrorism, ethnic cleansing and others? In addition to\nthat stark assessment of the state of the world \u2014 a\nresult of the failure of the human conscience \u2014 we\nhave also been struck by natural disasters, including\nfloods, hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions,\ntidal waves and, sadly, many others.\nTo cite just the most recent example, Hurricane\nKatrina, which devastated Louisiana, is a striking\nillustration of that phenomenon. Through me, the\nGovernment of the Union of the Comoros offers its\ndeep sympathy to the United States of America\nauthorities and the entire American people.\nLike the victims of natural disasters, the victims\nof violence and human injustice have no recourse other\nthan this Organization, entrusted with the most noble\nmission of defending and preserving their dignity. But\nthe Organization will need a new impetus to spur\ninternational action worthy of the expectations of our\npeoples.\nWe must therefore redefine our vision of world\nsecurity. We must keep the human being at the heart of\nour considerations and take every parameter of human\nsecurity into account. Indeed, there can be no lasting\npeace while poverty, disease, despair, war and\noppression persist. In a word, there can be no peace if\nwe are insecure about our daily lives and the future.\nThere is an ineluctable link between peace and the\ndevelopment to which we all aspire. We must therefore\nset ourselves a code of good behaviour and create a life\nin which the law reigns supreme.\nWe must reinvigorate and re-energize the United\nNations in order effectively to prepare it to face the\nproblems of the modern world. At the same time, the\ncomposition of its bodies should be as representative as\npossible so as to enshrine and embody its universality\nand safeguard the sovereign equality of States,\nespecially the smallest among them. As the supreme\nglobal institution, the United Nations should also\noperate on the basis of rules and norms recognized and\napproved by all, which will strengthen its credibility.\nOnly thus will we will truly be able to solve the\nproblems of terrorism, addressing them at their roots,\nand express our sympathy for and solidarity with those\nwho have devoted their entire lives to fighting\nexclusion and injustice.\nAt this very moment, I have a deeply considered\nthought for all those who have fought for noble causes\nthroughout the world. The brotherly people of\nPalestine offers a perfect illustration thereof. Indeed,\nthe aspirations of the Palestinian people are those of a\nnation reclaiming its dignity and security. In the\ninterests of all the peoples of the Middle East, the\npeace process must continue, because building and\nmaintaining peace is essential to our world. It is critical\nthat a Palestinian State be established and allowed to\nlive in peace, security and stability with the State of\nIsrael and its other neighbours.\n19\n\nMy country welcomes Israel\u2019s withdrawal from\nthe Gaza Strip, a decisive step in the quest for a timely,\njust and equitable solution to that long drawn-out\nproblem. We are convinced that this gesture augurs\nwell for the region and peoples concerned.\nAs for Iraq, adequate conditions must be\nestablished to promote genuine progress towards\npeace, which will guarantee the stability necessary to\nthe country\u2019s socio-economic development.\nThe situation in Asia also deserves the focused\nattention of the international community. The stalemate\nin the issue of the Chinese province of Taiwan, to cite\njust one instance, is not conducive to the promotion of\nstability in that part of the world. That is why, in its\nconcern for the ongoing prevalence of law in\ninternational relations, and in order to guarantee\nrespect for the national unity of countries, the Union of\nthe Comoros urges the General Assembly to heed the\nlegitimate claims of the Government of the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China over the Chinese province of\nTaiwan.\nWith regard to Africa, we welcome the imminent\nsettlement of certain crises, including in the Republic\nof the Sudan, where current developments are opening\nthe prospects for effective national reconciliation. The\nGovernment of the Union of the Comoros encourages\nthe Sudanese parties to persevere along that path.\nAs to other crises that remain unresolved, we\nurge the international community to play a lead role in\nfinding solutions. Indeed, stability remains a\nparamount condition for the success of Africa\u2019s\neconomic development efforts through the New\nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development and other\nregional and international initiatives seeking the same\ngoal. Likewise, those efforts will remain inconclusive\nso long as HIV/AIDS, malaria, drepanocytosis and\nother diseases continue to rage in our countries. Other\nthreats include drought, famine, locust infestations,\nextreme poverty and the debt burden stifling the\neconomies of our countries. We therefore commend the\ninitiative of convening a summit to assess the\nMillennium Development Goals, which should allow\nfor the adoption of new arrangements for the\nachievement of the Goals by 2015.\nEnvironmental problems affect all States and are\na source of genuine concern to us all. Unbridled\npollution, the destruction of the ozone layer,\ndeforestation, rising sea levels \u2014 in a word, the\nceaseless deterioration of the environment \u2014 require\nus all to heighten our awareness of those global threats.\nAnd yet, while such problems may affect any\nnumber of States, we should recall that some \u2014 the\nsmall island developing States in particular \u2014 have\nspecific characteristics that must be taken into\nconsideration and addressed with greater attention. The\nUnion of the Comoros itself recently suffered a\nvolcanic eruption that severely damaged our\nenvironment. Such continuous threats to our countries\ncall for the timely establishment of mechanisms to\nprevent and manage natural disasters.\nWe welcome regional initiatives, including those\nundertaken by the Indian Ocean Commission, to better\nmanage such situations and we urge the international\ncommunity also to provide us with its invaluable\nassistance. I take this opportunity to thank the\nGovernment of France, the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme, and all other friendly\ncountries and specialized agencies of the United\nNations that have greatly helped us to grapple with and\nmanage that disaster.\nI spoke earlier of the inequalities prevalent in our\nworld. They are manifest at many levels, to be sure, but\nthe socio-economic aspect is the most glaring. Long\nmarginalized in world decision-making, our countries\nof the South continue to suffer the consequences of our\neconomic fragility. The rules of the game in world\ntrade exclude us de facto from the playing field.\nMoreover, the paucity of new information and\ncommunications technologies in the South is a striking\nreminder of the vast abyss in that field between our\ncountries and those of the North.\nDebt continues to burden many countries of the\nSouth, despite the fact that, thanks to a sudden surge of\ngenerosity and, above all, responsibility on the part of\nthe wealthy countries, some saw their situation\nrevisited and improved by the cancellation of their\ndebt. That only highlights the urgency of the need to\nassess the economic and financial situation of the\ncountries of the South in order for them to be\ngenuinely integrated into the dynamic of globalization.\nIf the disparities in and slow pace of the\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals in\ngeneral are to be redressed, a world partnership is\nneeded. In that context, special attention must be paid\nto the least privileged social strata, including by\n20\n\nproviding access to financial services through the\npromotion of microfinancing and microcredit.\nFurthermore, we must address and objectively\nanalyse the issue of debt. We must prioritize the\ncancellation of the public debt of the heavily indebted\npoor countries, the least developed countries, and the\nlow- and medium-income developing countries.\nFinally, international action should promote a fair,\nregulated, open and non-discriminatory trading system,\nnotably by facilitating the developing countries\u2019\naccession to the World Trade Organization.\nThe United Nations is an irreplaceable forum. As\nthe crucible of our warning cries and our hopes for a\nbetter world, it remains the perfect framework for\ndiscussing the world situation and for opening a\nwindow on the situation in each of our countries.\nWith respect to the Union of the Comoros, I am\npleased to announce from this rostrum that we have\ncompleted our establishment of new institutions, which\nare now operational. We thank everyone for their\nimportant contributions to that end. We now have the\ntwo-fold duty to consolidate the valuable achievements\nof national reconciliation and to promote our country\u2019s\nsocio-economic development.\nWith our development partners, we are therefore\nstriving to reinvigorate our cooperation and redirect it\ntowards the well-being of our people. In the same vein,\nthe achievement of the Millennium Development Goals\nis a priority of the Government of the Union of the\nComoros.\nFurthermore, my country completed a staff-\nmonitored programme of the International Monetary\nFund in January 2005 and is working to streamline its\npublic finances with a view to concluding a Facility for\nPoverty Reduction and Growth programme with the\nBretton Woods institutions so as to mobilize the\nfinancial resources necessary to implementing its\ndevelopment priorities.\nIn that respect, the Comoros authorities are also\nattempting to implement a recommendation from the\ninternational community to convene a donors\nconference on our behalf. I therefore have the pleasure\nof informing the Assembly that such a meeting, critical\nto my country\u2019s economic and social future, will be\nheld on 8 December in the Republic of Mauritius under\nthe auspices of the African Union. On behalf of my\ncountry, I call on the international community to help\nus to ensure the gathering\u2019s success.\nI also take this pleasant opportunity warmly to\nthank the Republic of Mauritius for its generous offer\nto host that important conference. In particular, we thank\nMauritian Prime Minister Navinchandra Ramgoolam for\nhis readiness to co-preside the conference.\nIn the same vein, on behalf of the Government of\nthe Union of the Comoros, I pay a well-deserved\ntribute to the Republic of South Africa for its ongoing\nsupport for the Comoros and for having successfully\ncoordinated the efforts of the African Union and of\nregional countries to achieve national reconciliation in\nmy country. The people of the Comoros sincerely and\nhappily welcome the tireless interest of Mr. Thabo\nMbeki, President of the Republic of South Africa, in\nthe future of our country and his willingness to co-\npreside the donors conference.\nI cannot conclude without raising here the issue\nof the Comorian island of Mayotte. Following a series\nof consultations held between French and Comorian\nauthorities in their common concern to find a solution\nthat will preserve the friendship and cooperation\nbetween the two countries, safeguard the interests of\nboth States and satisfy the aspirations of the entire\npopulation of the archipelago, a new process has been\nlaunched. It will promote direct dialogue between the\ntwo parties with a view to finding a solution that\nprotects everyone\u2019s interests in accordance with the\nlaw.\nThe Comorian Government has invested a great\ndeal of hope in the new dynamic. It believes that it can\ntrust the French Republic to strive for a joint and\nhonourable resolution of the situation. I therefore take\nthis opportunity to reaffirm my sincere thanks to all the\nfriends of the Comoros, who have never failed in their\nsupport, their encouragement and their solidarity with\nmy country in the quest for a solution to the issue in\nline with the law. I also wish to assure them, on behalf\nof the Government of the Union of the Comoros, that\nthey will always be kept up-to-date on developments in\nthe issue and, whenever necessary, involved in the\nprocess.\nWorking for peace means fighting all that fuels\nextremism and every source of frustration. Working for\npeace also means investing all necessary resources in\ndevelopment, without which humankind has no dignity.\nThe health of our world depends on our Organization.\n21\n\nLet us strive for its renewal, for more peace, for\nhappiness and for greater human dignity. Let us strive\nfor equal opportunity for all."

A substantial increase in financial\nresources, to be provided on a more predictable basis\nand free of conditionalities, is needed for this matter.\nWe commend the various initiatives that have\nbeen launched so far, and we would like to call on our\ndeveloped partners to continue rendering their support\nto the efforts of developing countries.\nTrade can play an important role in promoting\neconomic growth and development, and in that regard\nwe reiterate our position for a trading system that is\nuniversal, rule-based, non-discriminatory, open and\nequitable. We furthermore expect that the upcoming\nmultilateral round of trade negotiations will fully take\ninto account the needs of developing countries.\nWe would like to note the laudable initiatives of\nseveral developed countries for facilitating market\naccess for the least developed countries. However, for\nmany middle-income countries, like Suriname, who are\ncalled upon to diversify their economies, measures\nhave yet to be taken to facilitate their market access for\ngoods and services into the markets of the developed\ncountries.\nSixty years ago, in the aftermath of the Second\nWorld War, world leaders vowed to save succeeding\ngenerations from the scourge of war and thus came\ntogether and established the United Nations. Faced\nwith both old and new challenges to international\npeace and security, the international community should\nmore than ever be determined to live up to that crucial\npromise.\nThe spread of infectious diseases such as\nHIV/AIDS, the indiscriminate effect of the forces of\nnature thereby causing widespread despair and\ndestruction, the uncontrolled proliferation of small\narms and light weapons, just to name a few, are\ntestimony of the transnational nature of contemporary\nchallenges the world is facing today.\nWe therefore need an effective system of\ninternational cooperation to collectively deal with both\nold and new threats to international peace and security.\nIt is imperative to redress the major setbacks in\nnuclear disarmament and arms control. We will have\nfailed future generations if we cannot even reach\nagreement on the general principles governing those\nimportant issues.\nWe cannot but agree with the Secretary-General\nwhen he once stated, \u201cThere is nothing small or light\nabout the consequences of the uncontrolled spread and\nmisuse of small arms and light weapons\u201d (A/58/138,\np. 4). In Suriname, as is the case for many countries in\nthe Caribbean region, this phenomenon is associated\nwith drug trafficking and other cross-border criminal\nactivity. In this regard we would like to pledge our\nsupport to the ongoing efforts in the United Nations to\naddress this critical issue that threatens the economic\nand social fabric of our society.\nMy Government strongly condemns all acts of\nterrorism committed by whomever, wherever and for\nwhatever purposes. With the growing interdependence\nin the world, terrorism constitutes a grave danger for\nrich, poor, large and small countries alike. We would\nhowever like to bring to mind that the fight against\nterrorism should, at all times, take place in accordance\nwith international law and with respect for human\nrights, tolerance and the peaceful coexistence of\npeople.\nThe fight against terrorism must address its root\ncauses. Suriname, being a multi-ethnic, multireligious\nand multicultural society, believes that increased\ntolerance and dialogue could make a positive\ncontribution to the goal of increased security.\nWe therefore continue to support the dialogue\namong civilizations and remain convinced that a\nculture of peace can be significantly enhanced through\nthis dialogue in order to promote mutual\nunderstanding, respect and tolerance among regions,\ncultures and peoples.\nRespect for human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms remains of great importance to the\nGovernment of Suriname. The creation of a Human\nRights Council, as was agreed to in the outcome\ndocument, should not only result in a renaming of the\nCommission on Human Rights; we have the daunting\ntask ahead of us of restoring credibility to the human\nrights machinery by addressing the shortfalls of the\nCommission on Human Rights and ensuring that the\nHuman Rights Council becomes a more effective and\nobjective organ.\nThe United Nations should resolve to come to the\nrescue of people confronted with genocide, ethnic\n29\n\ncleansing and crimes against humanity. We must\ncontinue to discuss the framework to be associated\nwith this difficult task. But more importantly, the\nUnited Nations, through its Charter provisions, should\nfind ways and means geared towards preventing these\natrocities from reoccurring.\nThe international community has some time ago\nexpressed the need for a more effective and efficient\nOrganization that would be better able to address the\nmany challenges our world is facing today and make it\nmore responsive to the aspirations of the world\u2019s\npeople. Suriname continues to believe in the values of\nthe United Nations as the supreme multilateral\ninstitution and supports the efforts of strengthening the\nOrganization through reform.\nMore than ever, good intentions must give rise to\nconcrete achievements. We must translate\ncommitments into action. We owe it to the many\npeople living in extreme poverty who do not have\naccess to safe drinking water and do not have proper\nhealth care.\nAchieving such a global society requires the\ninvolvement, determination and commitment of all\nactors \u2014 State and non-State \u2014 as well as coordinated\nand comprehensive actions by all such actors in the\nglobal fight against poverty and injustice.\nOur shared objectives require more than a\nreaffirmation of the importance of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals and the availability of financial\nresources. It requires understanding between developed\nand developing countries. It requires political will,\nwhich is a condition sine qua non in our efforts to\nachieve our global commitments.\nI am convinced that the recently concluded high-\nlevel gathering of world leaders generated the renewed\npolitical commitment to further the cause of global\npartnership between the developing and developed\ncountries to promote development and continue the\nfight against poverty and hunger.\nIn conclusion, let me remark that we have to act\nnow. We cannot build a world of peace and security\nwithout economic and social development and without\nrespect for human rights."

        "file_text": "I would\nlike to extend the sincerest condolences of the people\nand Government of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay to\nthe victims of Hurricane Katrina, as well as to all the\ncitizens of the world, men and women, old and young,\nwho are victims of natural disasters, of the fury of\nnature, which is showing us that it will no longer be\nabused by mankind.\nI come from Uruguay, a small South American\ncountry, whose main wealth is its vocation for peace,\nits drive for freedom and the democratic commitment\nthat its people have been forging for generations.\nI convey the greetings of the people and\nGovernment of Uruguay to this forum, which is the\nbroadest, most representative and most important\nforum in the world today. It is a greeting that is\ndemanding, committed and hopeful.\nThe greeting is demanding because we are living\nat a very particular time in the history of mankind. In\nfact, at very few moments in history have we seen\ncircumstances so rich in paradoxes and so poor in\nparadigms as the present one. Never before has\nmankind had at its disposal such scientific and\ntechnological progress and such a significant cultural\nheritage to guarantee a life in dignity. However, never\nbefore has mankind suffered so much inequality,\nintolerance and uncertainty.\nWe know that we have reached this point, but we\nare uncertain about where we are heading. We cannot\nbe passive witnesses to the situation; no one can wash\nhis hands of his own problems nor of problems that\nseem remote. We cannot resign ourselves to a future\nthat is an unchanging extension of the present. There is\nno reason whatsoever to give up the hope of a utopia,\nwithout which darkness could be our fate.\nOur greeting is committed because we all bear the\nresponsibility, which we cannot abdicate, of being the\nmasters of our own lives and the architects of our own\nfutures. This task is a road on which neither privileges\nnor condemnations are allowed; we are all travelling\non an equal footing. Nor does this road permit\nshortcuts. History is neither a gallery of national heroes\nnor a calendar of outstanding events: history is made\nby people day by day.\nIn this context, we upon whom our peoples have\nconferred the task of governing have a very demanding\nresponsibility ahead of us. And that is because\ngoverning means managing with efficiency and\ntransparency: it means articulating in a democratic\nfashion this rich and complex network that is society.\nBut to govern means also to envisage the future and to\ncall upon people to build that future among all and for\nall.\nOur greeting is hopeful as well. Although we do\nnot overlook the risks, the difficulties and the limits\nwithin the national, regional and global contexts, we\nbelieve in human beings, we believe in society. We\nbelieve in democracy as a means to govern but also as\na human impulse and as a state of society.\nAlthough I said this during our statement at the\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting which took place in this\nsame Hall a few hours ago, I wish to reiterate before\nthe Assembly that the Eastern Republic of Uruguay\nreaffirms the principles that have characterized its\nforeign policy.\nFirst is the firm commitment to peace,\nsovereignty, democracy and solidarity. When I speak\nabout peace, democracy, solidarity and freedom I\nwould like to recall that six days ago marked the thirty-\nsecond anniversary of the occasion when a man gave\nhis life defending peace, democracy and freedom. I\nwould like thus to pay tribute to Salvador Allende.\nThe second principle is the firm rejection of any\nkind of terrorism, violence and discrimination. The\nthird is the inalienable right of every State to safe and\nstable borders and to be completely free to exercise its\nsovereignty and self-determination, and fourth is\nrespect for international law as the best guarantee of\nthe sovereignty of peoples and their peaceful\ncoexistence.\n28\n\nThe fifth principle is non-alignment and non-\nintervention in affairs that come under the domestic\njurisdiction of States. Sixthly, we reaffirm\nmultilateralism as a means to strengthen international\nlaw, enhancing the role of the United Nations. Seventh,\nwe acknowledge the indivisibility of all human rights,\nbe they political, social, economic, civil or cultural,\nincluding those of a collective nature such as the right\nto development and to a safe environment.\nIn conformity with these principles, Uruguay first\nof all deems it necessary to move forward with the\nreforms that will allow the United Nations to fully\nfulfil its commitments. Because such reforms are of a\ncomplex nature, they should be undertaken with a\nsense of history and with political will, and without\nhegemonic intentions.\nSecondly, Uruguay renews its commitment to the\nMillennium Goals, which in our country means the\ndesign and implementation of a system of integrated\nand global social policies that address the poverty and\ndestitution suffered by almost one million Uruguayans\nand that, at the same time, are part of a strategy of\nchange and development.\nThirdly, Uruguay reiterates its will to continue\nparticipating in United Nations peacekeeping\noperations and will contribute its efforts to improving\nthe security and the conditions of service of those\nmissions.\nWe also express our support for the Secretary-\nGeneral\u00eds initiative to create a Peace Commission, to\nwhich, we believe, Uruguay could contribute,\ncontinuing its support for peacekeeping missions and\nthe expertise acquired in rebuilding devastated\ncountries.\nThere is no peace in intolerance and terrorism, no\nfreedom in poverty, and no democracy in inequality. It\nis crucial to reject every expression of violence, but\nbefore rejecting it, it must be avoided by attacking its\nroots.\nThis is quite simply because every human being,\nsimply by being human, has the right to live in dignity.\nSocieties where there is a contrast between an opulent\nfew and a neglected majority are not prosperous.\nSocieties where to be born is a problem, to be young is\nsuspect, to get an education and a job is a privilege and\nto grow old is a curse have no future. This is the way\nwe see it in Uruguay. We have learned this from those\ngenerations that preceded us in building a country that,\nthough it has its own unique features, is not atypical of\nnor alien to the Latin American context.\nWhile it is true that the first half of the last\ncentury was a favourable period for Uruguay, it is also\ntrue that - due to a combination of external\ncircumstances and domestic structural weaknesses -\nthe last fifty years were a period of economic\ndeterioration, impoverishment and even an institutional\nbreakdown in 1973.\nWe Uruguayans regained democracy in 1985, and\nthe current Government, which took office exactly 200\ndays ago, is working hard to heal the wounds\ndictatorship caused through human rights violations.\nWe are not hostages to the past, but Uruguayan society\nneeds to know the truth about what happened to ensure\nthat never again will it happen - never again.\nNevertheless, with the commitments that we have\nassumed to Uruguayan society - whose will is our\nmandate \u00f3 the Government of which I am head is\npromoting changes: changes which are necessary,\npossible, responsible and gradual, changes with\npolitical and social support, changes that do not\noverlook reality but do not give up on the dream of a\nUruguay with human development, with productive\neconomic growth and with a safe environment, a\nUruguay fully integrated into its own region and into\nthe international arena. We are not starting from\nscratch, but we have a lot to do to achieve this utopia,\nthe dream of which motivates us as a nation.\nIn conclusion, this is exactly what I wished to\nconvey to members on behalf of the Government and\nthe people of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay: far\naway, in the forgotten southern part of South America,\nthere is a country that does not resign itself to\ndifficulties, that is building its own destiny and that,\nfaithful to its tradition, wishes to join in building a\nbetter world, working alongside all our dear brethren,\nthe citizens of the world."

        "file_text": "Allow\nme, Sir, to express the congratulations of the\nGovernment of Panama on your election to preside\nover this historic session of the General Assembly.\nI would like to congratulate warmly the\nSecretary-General for the dedicated manner in which\nhe has undertaken the difficult task of reforming the\nUnited Nations so as to ensure that it will be able to\naddress the challenges of the twenty-first century.\nI wish to express my special thanks in particular\nto the outgoing President of the General Assembly,\nMr. Jean Ping, for his efforts in leading the\nconsultations and reflections in order to attain\nagreement and, in particular, for placing his trust in the\ndelegation of Panama in order to facilitate this process.\nThe United Nations was conceived on a\nfundamental premise, that of the legal equality of\nStates, which at the time was more of an aspiration\nthan a reality. However, much progress has been made\non the path towards building a world where the power\nof reason, justice and dialogue settle disputes between\nnations and not military or economic power.\nMy country can confirm that the United Nations\nand the international community have created effective\ninstruments and institutions to ensure that equality\nprevails over the deep divide between the\nindustrialized countries and the developing countries.\nPanama has gained full control of its territory and\nrecovered the Canal thanks to its visionary leaders, but\nalso to a large extent due to the implementation of the\nprinciples of international law that the United Nations\nhas staunchly defended and through the support of the\ninternational community.\nPanama can never remain indifferent to the\ndestiny of the Organization. As one of the signatories\nof the Charter and beneficiary of its institutions,\nPanama understands the need to adapt the Organization\nto the reality of our time. The formulas used for\nbringing this adaptation about must focus on increased\nparticipation of States in the Organization\u2019s decisions\nand must aim at the full legal equality of all States, an\naspiration that has yet to become a reality, but which,\nnevertheless, remains the mainstay of the United\nNations.\nWe cannot afford to delay in bringing about a\nradical change in the rules that currently govern\neconomic relations among States, because, while in the\nUnited Nations we are slowly progressing towards\nequality and agreement, the world is rushing towards\nan abyss of inequality and disagreement.\nDespite the efforts undertaken by a number of the\nleast developed countries to adapt their institutions to\nmodels that were supposed to help reduce inequalities,\npractice has shown that there is no one-size-fits-all\nsolution that can be applied across the board to all\ncountries. Indeed, the application of rigid solutions has\ncontributed rather to a further widening of the gap\nbetween countries.\nAmid such uncertainty concerning our public\ndevelopment policies, unforeseeable events \u2014 natural\ndisasters, epidemics and, currently, the rising price of\noil, an indispensable driver of production and\n15\n\ngrowth \u2014 have completely altered the balance of\nforeign and domestic affairs. Moreover, it is unclear\nwhether the negative impact those events have had on\nour economies will vanish automatically once the\nphenomena that have created them disappear. Indeed, it\nappears that we are caught in a vicious and hopeless\ncircle: the differences that have led us to accept urgent\nchanges have, in turn, created more difference and\ngreater resentment in the least developed countries,\nwith more failed States and therefore greater insecurity\nin the global village.\nThe price of oil for non-producing countries has\nfurther deepened that divide, as it takes away from the\nresources necessary for their development. To give an\nexample, over the past three years the cost of net\nimports of oil for Panama has shown a 250 per cent\nincrease. That is the situation for the majority of the\ncountries in our region, as well as for those in other\ncontinents, with very few exceptions. Countries like\nours that are net importers of oil have to produce more\nin order to export more and thereby to be able to\nimport the same number of barrels of oil.\nRising oil prices are due to the sharp increase in\ndemand by the major consumers, which have not\nadopted effective policies to reduce their dependency\non hydrocarbons.\nEven more serious is the fact that fuel prices have\nrisen so dramatically and have wreaked such havoc in a\nnumber of countries they threaten to create political\ninstability and provoke economic crises.\nIt is only with the technical and financial\ncooperation of developed countries \u2014 in particular in\nthe field of energy \u2014 that we can achieve the transfer\nof technologies that can help us to produce cleaner and\ncheaper energy. As a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol,\nPanama has submitted projects with clearly identified\nrequests for financing that deserve to be supported by\nmultilateral funding institutions and by those countries\nthat cause the greatest pollution.\nEnergy dependency is compounded by the\ndifficulties that countries face in importing technology\nand holding on to their human resources, in particular\nthe most qualified among them. Workers that have\nmigrated to richer countries send home financial\nremittances that can temporarily supplement the\nincome generated by our national economies but that,\nin the long term, prevent us from exploiting our most\nimportant asset \u2014 our most highly qualified human\nresources. Those workers contribute to the innovative\ngrowth that our nations require. The result is the\naccumulation of innovative capital and productive\nlabour in the most developed countries, with a\ncorresponding impoverishment of countries most in\nneed of those resources, generating yet greater\ndivergence and more inequalities. In other words, the\nexodus of human capital, while providing a source of\ncurrency in the short term hampers our countries\u2019 long-\nterm development.\nOur countries must be able to compete even in\nthe absence of a level playing field. We must as a\npriority put an end to tariff barriers to trade, which\nprevent developing countries from putting their\nproducts on the markets of rich countries and from\nhaving access to better technology, not only productive\nbut also information technology.\nAs a result of the widening gap with regard to\naccess to technology, our countries have fallen behind\nin their efforts to advance and to ensure the well-being\nof their people. Moreover, it has served to perpetuate\nthe differences in living conditions between developed\ncountries and those that are still struggling to emerge\nfrom underdevelopment.\nThe situation is similar with regard to the\nobstacles that impede access to basic medicines to\nimprove public health in areas as sensitive as AIDS\nand malaria. Those obstacles take the form of patents\nthat grant quasi-monopolistic powers to the\npharmaceutical companies that produce those\nmedicines.\nIn addition, the already devastating differences\nthat exist between States are even greater than the\nstatistics currently show, using simplistic and rigid\ncriteria such as per capita income, which does not\naccurately reflect reality. Forty per cent of the\nPanamanian population lives below the poverty line,\nbut we are nevertheless statistically designated as a\nmedium- to high-income country and therefore our\naccess to external aid is very limited. Figures provide\nonly a lifeless snapshot of a country. Behind that, or\nperhaps in spite of that, there is a human reality: that of\nmen, women and children who suffer from hunger and\nconstraints. Those people are not even aware of the\nexistence of the United Nations, but they are fully\nentitled to the benefits of modernity. Instead, their way\nof life is being relentlessly handed down from one\ngeneration to the next.\n16\n\nThe international community has demonstrated\ngreat resolve in the fight against terrorism and\ninsecurity and it is prepared to make even further\nsacrifices, if necessary. However, it is time to\nrecognize that hunger and poverty also undermine the\ninternal security of our countries and endanger\ndemocracy. It appears that the world only responds to\nheadlines, but every day poor countries suffer from\nmisfortunes and constraints that do not produce\nheadlines for the tragic reason that the international\ncommunity seems indifferent in some cases or has\nquite simply resigned itself to them.\nThere is no point in asking a developing country\nto rectify so many deficiencies within a reasonable\ntime frame if it cannot even have access to funds on\nmore favourable and predictable terms than those\ncurrently being offered by the international capital\nmarket.\nImproving the quality of life of our citizens \u2014 a\ngoal that the United Nations has set itself \u2014 depends\non the increasing use of physical and financial capital,\nas well as the national labour force, in activities that\ngenerate growth and promote innovation. The material\nwell-being of our societies will be achieved when more\npeople work and each of those workers is more\nproductive.\nOur countries are not begging for favours. What\nwe are demanding is a more level playing field. The\nmarkets of industrialized countries are blocked by\nprotectionist tariffs and by non-tariff barriers, which\nimpede access to them by the rest of the world. The\nmost developed countries pursue agricultural policies\nthat seriously exacerbate poverty in developing\ncountries. For one thing, their domestic production\nreceives billions of dollars in subsidies. The surplus\nthus created is then dumped on world markets at prices\nthat significantly reduce the income of the traditional\nexporting countries.\nTherefore Panama welcomes the commitment of\nthe United States of America, announced last week\nfrom this very rostrum by its President, to eliminate all\nsubsidies that \u2014 as he himself recognized \u2014 have\ncreated poverty in many countries. If all those\ncountries that subsidize their products to the detriment\nof free trade were to adopt here a similar commitment\nand to implement it swiftly, then the United Nations\nwould have solid grounds to celebrate its sixtieth\nanniversary as an historic and highly significant\noccasion.\nFor its part, Panama reiterates today that the\ncanal linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans will\nremain open and secure, demonstrating the high degree\nof efficiency to which the international community is\naccustomed. We have analysed the needs of\ninternational trade and, aware of Panama\u2019s role in the\nera of globalization, we shall take a definitive decision\non the canal\u2019s extension through a national referendum.\nOur countries should not be condemned to\nstagger from one crisis to the next. By emphasizing the\nneed to combat the alarming levels of poverty and\nabject poverty, humankind\u2019s collective conscience will\nemerge in favour of development and progress. This\nOrganization was created at the end of the cruelest war\nof all times in order to protect humankind from the\nhorrors of a similar conflict and to ensure that peace\nand harmony would prevail throughout the world.\nPanama welcomes the progress that has been\nmade towards that goal and rejects any attempt to delay\nthe application of peaceful solutions to regions that\ncontinue to suffer a high level of political tension that\nseriously endangers peace. That is our vision of the\ninequalities of a society founded on the principles of\nthe twentieth century, and an expression of cautious\noptimism about the opportunities to blaze a new trail\nfor the benefit of our people, who want to leave their\nfears behind and to attain the dreams that all are\nentitled to simply by virtue of being alive."

        "file_text": "I have the honour\nto inform the members of the General Assembly of the\nsuccessful conclusion of the parliamentary and\nprovincial elections that took place in my country two\ndays ago. As stated by President Karzai, \u201cthe holding\nof these elections was a major success for the people of\nAfghanistan and a major defeat for those attempting to\nderail the political process\u201d. In defiance of the threats\nposed by the enemies of peace and stability in\nAfghanistan, Al-Qaida and the Taliban, millions of\nmen and women enthusiastically travelled to polling\nstations to cast their votes. With the conclusion of\nthese elections, the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan\nhas now completed the final phase of the Bonn\nAgreement, sponsored by the United Nations in\nDecember 2001.\nThe determination and political will expressed by\nthe people of Afghanistan have made possible the\ngradual, yet arduous, transition towards stability and\ndemocracy in Afghanistan. During the course of the\ntransition, Afghanistan successfully convened two loya\njirgas, adopted a new Constitution enshrining the\nprinciples of democracy, held its first-ever presidential\nelections and, most recently, concluded its\nparliamentary and provincial elections.\nIn this context, allow me to express on behalf of\nthe people and the Government of Afghanistan our\nmost sincere gratitude and appreciation to the United\nNations, the NATO-led International Security\nAssistance Force, coalition forces, Provincial\nReconstruction Teams, international observers and\nother international partners for the assistance rendered\ntowards achieving this objective.\nAllow me to highlight briefly some of the other\nachievements that have taken place during the past four\nyears. The Government of Afghanistan continues to\nmake significant progress with regard to the reform of\nthe security sector and the formation of the national\narmy and police in order to further extend and\nconsolidate peace and authority throughout the country.\nThe disarmament and demobilization of 60,000 former\ncombatants has been completed. In that regard, the\nGovernment of Afghanistan reaffirms its commitment\nto complete the reintegration of ex-combatants as the\nfinal phase of a successful disarmament, demobilization\nand reintegration process.\nSignificant progress has been made in the\npromotion and protection of human rights and\nfundamental freedoms. Our new Constitution\nguarantees equal rights for men and women, freedom\nof expression, freedom of press and political pluralism.\nThe Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission\nhas been institutionalized as an independent body in\naccordance with our Constitution. The Commission\ncontinues to fulfil its mandate.\nWe have also witnessed the enrolment of more\nthan 5 million children, both boys and girls, in school.\nRepatriation of millions of refugees from neighbouring\ncountries has also taken place during the past four\nyears. The significant increase in the role of women in\nthe social, political and economic life of the country is\nalso worth mentioning.\nThe cultivation of opium poppy and the\nproduction of narcotic drugs in Afghanistan remains a\nprime concern of my Government. The establishment\nof a counter-narcotics ministry, the creation of a\nspecial tribunal to prosecute those associated with the\ncultivation, production and trafficking of illegal drugs\nand the formation of the Committee on Counter-\nNarcotics, chaired by President Karzai, are only some\nof the initiatives taken by the Afghan Government\naimed at combating and eliminating the scourge of\nnarcotic drugs.\nI am pleased to refer to the recent report of the\nUnited Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, which\nrightly reflected a 21 per cent decrease in the\ncultivation of opium poppy in Afghanistan during the\ncurrent year. However, in order to build on this\nachievement, we must offer alternative livelihoods to\nrural communities. A successful strategy in combating\nillicit drugs requires additional measures aside from\n25\n\nasking farmers to plant substitute crops. We have to\nprovide them with agricultural assistance, invest in\nirrigation, build roads and provide electric power and\nassistance in generating non-farm employment in rural\nareas.\nMany of the achievements realized in\nAfghanistan since the signing of the Bonn Agreement\nwould not have been possible without the vigorous\nsupport of the international community. I take this\nopportunity to extend our deep gratitude to all\ninternational partners and lead nations which offered\ngenerous support throughout the process. In this\ncontext, we emphasize the importance of the sustained\nengagement and support of the international\ncommunity over the coming years for the rehabilitation\nand reconstruction of Afghanistan, as well as for the\nconsolidation of peace and security.\nDespite the achievements to which I referred\nearlier, the people of Afghanistan continue to face\nmany challenges in their daily lives. Extreme poverty,\na high rate of infant and maternal mortality and a lack\nof resources necessary to ensure basic social services\ncontinue to exist.\nThe outcome document adopted on 16 September\n2005 (resolution 60/1) has laid the foundation for a\nmore effective and efficient United Nations better able\nto address issues relating to development, peace and\nsecurity, human rights, reform of the United Nations\nand achievement of the Millennium Development\nGoals.\nThe Government of Afghanistan welcomes the\nproposal adopted in the outcome document with regard\nto the establishment of a Peacebuilding Commission.\nAs a country emerging from years of conflict,\nAfghanistan fully understands the need for a\ncoordinated, coherent and integrated approach to post-\nconflict peacebuilding. My Government also supports\nthe decision that the Commission should begin its work\nby no later than 31 December 2005.\nAs a result of ongoing efforts by Afghanistan and\nthe international community to combat international\nterrorism, my country no longer serves as a base for\nAl-Qaida and the Taliban. However, the people of\nAfghanistan continue to suffer from the scourge of\ninternational terrorism. Terrorism remains one of the\nmain challenges to peace, stability and sustainable\ndevelopment in Afghanistan. The continued infiltration\nof Al-Qaida and Taliban extremists in the south and\nparts of the east of the country remains a factor\ncontributing to insecurity in my country.\nWe therefore reiterate the importance of a sincere\ncommitment by all the countries of the region to\ncombating that scourge. The Government of\nAfghanistan once again vehemently condemns\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. In that\ncontext, we support every effort aimed at the\nsuccessful conclusion of a comprehensive convention\non international terrorism by the end of the sixtieth\nsession of the General Assembly.\nThe Secretary-General clearly highlighted the\ninterrelationship between development and security in\nhis report \u201cIn larger freedom\u201d (A/59/2005), which, in\nparagraph 2 of the annex, states, \u201cThere will be no\ndevelopment without security and no security without\ndevelopment\u201d. The case of Afghanistan could not be\nmore relevant in that respect.\nAchieving the Millennium Development Goals in\nAfghanistan is not just a desirable humanitarian\nobjective, but a necessity for the security of the\ncountry, the region and the world. Attaining the Goals\nwill require a substantial amount of international aid,\nprovided in a coordinated and sustained manner.\nMy Government is in the process of preparing\nAfghanistan\u2019s national development strategy, which\nwill be presented at the donor conference on\nAfghanistan scheduled to take place early next year.\nThe national development strategy encompasses a clear\napproach to achieving our national development goals\nand addresses vital areas such as capacity-building,\nfiscal sustainability, building infrastructure and\nprioritizing projects. The Afghanistan national\ndevelopment strategy will also present Afghanistan\u2019s\noverarching strategy for promoting growth and\nreducing poverty, and will serve as the country\u2019s\noverall strategy for attracting international assistance.\nThe national development strategy will be\nprepared in a consultative process with all\nstakeholders, including donors, civil society, the\nprivate sector and provincial councils. Through a post-\nBonn compact, Afghanistan will subscribe to a new set\nof timetables and benchmarks for providing security,\nbuilding democratic institutions, protecting human\nrights and reducing extreme poverty in accordance\nwith our MDG targets, reforming the administration,\neliminating corruption, ending the production of and\n26\n\ntraffic in narcotic drugs and developing cooperation\nwith our neighbours.\nAs a landlocked country, Afghanistan will not be\nable to achieve its intended economic goals without the\nsupport and mutual cooperation of its neighbours. The\nGovernment of Afghanistan emphasizes the importance\nof regional economic cooperation for the benefit of all\ncountries in the region. Trade plays a major role in\npromoting economic growth, employment and\ndevelopment for all. The volume of trade between\nAfghanistan and its neighbours has been growing\nsteadily. Just last year, the estimated value of trade\nbetween Afghanistan and its neighbours amounted to\n$1.5 billion.\nI would like in conclusion to express\nAfghanistan\u2019s full commitment to the implementation\nof the outcome document. We are of the conviction that\nthe adoption of that historic document will further\nenhance the central role of the United Nations in\naddressing the threats and challenges facing humanity\nat the dawn of the twenty-first century."

        "file_text": "At the\noutset, I should like to congratulate you, Sir, on your\nelection as President of the sixtieth session of the\nGeneral Assembly. My delegation is confident that\nyour knowledge and vast professional experience will\nensure strong and competent leadership of the\nAssembly.\nLet me also pay well-deserved tribute to your\npredecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, whose tireless efforts\nguided Member States through the difficult\nnegotiations that resulted in the adoption of the\noutcome document of the High-level Plenary Meeting.\nA few days ago, speaking from this rostrum,\nPresident Vladimir Voronin of the Republic of\nMoldova reaffirmed my country\u2019s unwavering support\nfor the United Nations and its commitment to work\ntogether with other Member States to renew and\nstrengthen the United Nations system. We need an\neffective United Nations, a richly diverse organization\nthat is united in its resolve and able to address the\nchallenges and threats confronting the contemporary\nworld.\nThe 2005 World Summit Outcome provides a fair\nassessment of the threats and challenges facing us in\nthe areas of peace, security, development and human\nrights and rightly emphasizes their interconnected\nnature. World leaders agreed on a number of concrete\nactions and steps that need to be undertaken in all those\nareas. Those measures might not meet everyone\u2019s\nexpectations, but they reflect a degree of consensus\nthat is both challenging and inspiring.\nSince one of the world summit\u2019s aims was to\nassess implementation of the Millennium Declaration,\nit is heartening to see the strong and unambiguous\ncommitment of donor and developing countries to\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.\nThe measures outlined in the areas of financing\nfor development, debt cancellation, trade promotion,\ninvestment and other specific areas of development\nneed to be fully implemented. Developed and\ndeveloping countries must build their declared global\npartnership for development on the basis of mutual\ntrust and respect, while the effectiveness and quality of\naid can be ensured through a balance of appropriate\nfinancing, good governance and sound policies.\nIn the area of peace and security, the Republic of\nMoldova welcomes the unequivocal condemnation of\nterrorism and supports the call to conclude and agree\non, during the current session of the General Assembly,\na comprehensive convention on international terrorism\ncontaining a legal definition of terrorism. During the\n2005 summit, the Republic of Moldova signed the\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of Acts\nof Nuclear Terrorism, which is further proof of our\nongoing commitment to multilateral efforts aimed at\n28\n\nstrengthening the United Nations counter-terrorism\nlegal framework.\nMy country welcomes the decision to create a\nPeacebuilding Commission, which it considers to be\none of the main achievements of the summit. As\nenvisioned, that body has the potential to bring much-\nneeded coherence to our strategies for post-conflict\npeacebuilding and recovery, provided that we succeed\nin making it operational by the end of this year.\nUnfortunately, the outcome document pays far\nless attention to conflict prevention and conflict\nresolution, especially with regard to internal conflicts.\nMany regional organizations have been entrusted,\nunder the provisions of Chapter VIII of the Charter,\nwith dealing with a number of conflicts that are at the\ncentre of the Security Council\u2019s attention. But, as the\nreport of the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges\nand Change (A/59/565) rightly pointed out, the efforts\nof regional organizations do not absolve the United\nNations of its primary responsibilities for peace and\nsecurity. The United Nations needs to reach out more\nsystematically to those regional organizations, and\nsteps should be taken to increase their accountability,\nparticularly in the case of protracted or frozen\nconflicts, where a situation does not improve or even\nworsens over the years.\nWe would also like to recall the High-level\nPanel\u2019s proposals aimed at enhancing the capabilities\nand the role of the United Nations in conflict\nmediation, which were set aside in the discussions.\nOne of those proposals was to give the Department of\nPolitical Affairs additional resources and to restructure\nit in order to provide more consistent and professional\nmediation support. No conflict in the world should be\nleft without the attention of the United Nations,\nregardless of whether it is on the Security Council\u2019s\nagenda or not.\nLike many Member States, we regret the failure\nto reach agreement on a section on non-proliferation\nand disarmament in the summit outcome document.\nBut that must not preclude further common efforts to\nbuild consensus around the global nuclear non-\nproliferation regime and the pursuit of nuclear\ndisarmament.\nWe appreciate the outcome document\u2019s support\nfor the implementation of the Programme of Action to\nPrevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in\nSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. But\nto make a real difference, Member States should\nexpedite and conclude negotiations on legally binding\nagreements on the marking and tracing of small arms\nand light weapons, as well as their brokering and\ntransfer.\nThe Republic of Moldova fully endorses the\ncommitment to create a Human Rights Council. We\nlook forward to speedy and productive negotiations on\nthe Council\u2019s mandate, size, membership and working\nprocedures. We have high expectations of that standing\nbody\u2019s ability to protect and even enforce respect for\nfundamental human rights, especially in cases of\nhumanitarian crimes and violations in conflict zones\noutside the control of sovereign States. My country\nalso supports the decision to strengthen the Office of\nthe High Commissioner for Human Rights and its field\noffices.\nAs a country that has placed the concepts of\ndemocracy and rule of law at its core since gaining\nindependence, the Republic of Moldova welcomes the\nreaffirmation of democracy as a universal value in the\noutcome document and the creation of the new\nDemocracy Fund.\nThe success of United Nations reform depends on\nthe ability of Member States to implement measures\nthat revitalize the General Assembly and enhance the\neffectiveness of the Economic and Social Council and\nthe Secretariat. Although the issue of the enlargement\nof the Security Council proved to be highly divisive, an\nenormous amount of work has been done to explore\ndifferent options. We all agree that the expanded\nCouncil should be representative, efficient and\ntransparent. We should continue to seek consensus\nbased on those principles.\nThe triangle of development, peace and freedom\nis of direct relevance to the Republic of Moldova. Our\nyoung democracy is struggling with the difficulties of\ntransition and suffers \u2014 as it has for more than 13\nyears \u2014 from a protracted, unsolved conflict inspired\nand supported from abroad. It sees the fundamental\nfreedoms of a significant number of its citizens\nviolated by an aggressive separatist regime.\nAs representatives of my country have stressed in\nthe Assembly over the years, settling the internal\nconflict in the Transnistrian region of the Republic of\nMoldova is our greatest priority. Separatism is not only\nthe main threat to our country\u2019s peace and security; it\nis also the main obstacle to the further consolidation of\n29\n\nthe independence and the statehood of the Republic of\nMoldova and a hindrance to its economic development.\nThe reintegration of the country, with respect for the\nprinciple of territorial integrity and sovereignty, is a\nprerequisite for a stable and prosperous Republic of\nMoldova able to achieve its internal and external\nstrategic objectives.\nThe Republic of Moldova has worked faithfully\nand constructively towards that end for many years,\nlooking for a peaceful, just and lasting solution to\npolitical conflict and fostering dialogue with the self-\nappointed Transnistrian leaders, with the help of\nmediating countries and the Organization for Security\nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Unfortunately, all\nefforts have been in vain and have only demonstrated\nthe ineffectiveness of the old format. With support and\nencouragement from abroad, the separatist leaders have\nbeen using the negotiation process to claim legitimacy\nfor themselves as the representatives of the will of the\ninhabitants of the Transnistrian region of the Republic\nof Moldova, and have promoted the idea of a pseudo-\nState, for which there are no ethnic, religious or other\nplausible grounds. In the meantime, the region has\nbecome a centre of illegal and criminal economic\nactivity, trafficking, arms production and proliferation\nand a threat to the stability and security of that part of\nthe European continent. The region\u2019s multinational\npopulation lives under constant pressure from the\nseparatist regime\u2019s propaganda and under the\nsurveillance of its security structures. The people of the\nregion are constantly being intimidated and harassed.\nThat situation cannot go on indefinitely. There is\na growing sense of urgency in Moldovan society,\nexpressed in the unprecedented consensus and the\nresolve of all political parties with respect to the ways\nand means of settling the conflict. Political momentum\nis growing, as Ukraine has advanced a new plan for a\nsettlement. Following that development, the Parliament\nof the Republic of Moldova passed several laws related\nto the Ukrainian plan, including the law on\nfundamental regulations of the special legal status of\nsettlements on the left bank of the Nistru River \u2014\nTransnistria \u2014 of 22 July, 2005.\nThe Republic of Moldova has been calling for a\nnumber of concrete actions to create the conditions for\na lasting solution to the conflict, including the\nfollowing elements.\nFirst, our Government has called for the\ncomplete, unconditional and transparent withdrawal of\nforeign troops and munitions from the territory of\nMoldova, in accordance with the relevant decisions of\nthe OSCE Istanbul Summit. The foreign military\npresence is used as external pressure and provides a\npolitical shield for the separatist authorities.\nSecondly, it has called for the establishment of\ntransparent and effective control over the Transnistrian\nsegment of the Moldovan-Ukrainian border. We highly\nappreciate the decision of the European Union to assist\nin monitoring that border segment, which should help\ncurb illegal commercial activities and all trafficking. In\nthat context, we support the early signing of the\nmemorandum of understanding on the European\nCommission Border Assistance Mission to the\nRepublic of Moldova and Ukraine, and we express our\nsatisfaction at the readiness of the Ukrainian\nauthorities to cooperate in that respect.\nThirdly, the Government has called for the\ndemocratization and demilitarization of the\nTransnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova\nthrough the development of civil society, political\nparties and a free press, as well as through respect for\nhuman rights and freedoms, the disarmament and\ndismantlement of illegal military units, militias and\nsecurity structures. Only after creating a vibrant and\npolitically open society \u2014 a process that should be\ncarried out under the close monitoring of the\ninternational community \u2014 can one envisage the\npossibility of free and democratic elections in\nTransnistria to establish genuine, responsible\nrepresentatives of the population of the region.\nThe Republic of Moldova has been pleading for a\nnew negotiating format by connecting the European\nUnion and the United States. New inputs, ideas and\npractical contributions are needed to move the process\nforward. The same is true of the current peacekeeping\nmechanism, which is far from meeting the recognized\nstandards of an unbiased attitude and should be\nreplaced by an international mechanism of military and\ncivil observers under an OSCE mandate.\nThe reintegration of the country would give new\nimpetus to our efforts for sustained economic\ndevelopment. The country\u2019s strong economic\nperformance, reflected in its stable and sustained\neconomic growth over the past four years, as well as\nthe quality of our country\u2019s poverty reduction and\n30\n\neconomic growth strategy paper and the Government\u2019s\nsteady commitment to fully implementing it,\ndemonstrate that the Republic of Moldova is on the\nright track to increasing the well-being of our citizens\nand improving the country\u2019s socio-economic\nindicators, including through achievement of the\nMillennium Development Goals.\nThe Republic of Moldova has irreversibly chosen\nthe path of European integration as the strategic\nobjective of its foreign policy. We are aware of the full\nextent of changes, reforms and improvements we have\nto achieve internally to meet the rigorous European\nstandards for economic development, good\ngovernance, democracy, political freedom and human\nrights. Our optimism with respect to Moldova\u2019s\nsuccessful achievement of its aspirations is rooted in\nthe firm will of the entire society to mobilize our\nresources to achieve that objective.\nSuccessful and complete implementation of the\nEU-Moldova Action Plan will give us the opportunity\nto rise to a new level of contractual relations with the\nEuropean Union, as set out in that document. It will\nalso be decisive for achieving further internal reforms\nand general progress in the country. The recent first\nevaluation of the implementation of the EU-Moldova\nAction Plan showed encouraging results and steady\nprogress. The Government is committed to the full\nimplementation of that comprehensive document,\nwhich will open, we hope, a clear European\nperspective for our country.\nMy country is ready to work tirelessly to make\nour Organization stronger, more efficient and able to\nfulfil the ambitious goals set by our leaders at the 2005\nworld summit. Only through collective action carried\nout in a spirit of global partnership will we be able to\ncreate a better, more secure world for the generations\nto come."

Allow me to also express\nour gratitude to Mr. Jean Ping for his untiring activity\nin guiding the fifty-ninth session of the General\nAssembly.\nLast week the High-level Plenary Meeting\nconcluded its work, which resulted in the adoption of\nan outcome document, reflecting the Meeting\u2019s\ncommitment to attaining the Millennium Development\nGoals.\nThe United Nations is an irreplaceable structure\nof multilateral inter-State interaction. Therefore, the\nquestion on how it will respond to the hopes and\naspirations of every Member will determine its\nviability. We agree with the Secretary-General that the\nOrganization \u201cremains fully engaged in conflict\nresolution, peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance,\ndefence of human rights and development around the\nworld\u201d. (A/60/PV.2)\nWe support the proposals contained in the\noutcome document on strengthening the United\nNations in areas of development, ensuring collective\nsecurity, counteracting terrorism, ensuring the dignity\nof the individual and reforming the Organization.\nWe are in favour of strengthening the role of the\nUnited Nations, and urge more transparency in its work\nand an improvement of its structure. The activities of\nits bodies should be conducted on the basis of a wide\nconsensus among Member States. We welcome the\nefforts of the Secretary-General aimed at preventing\nconflicts and strengthening preventive activity in that\narea.\nWe support the efforts against terrorism by the\nSecurity Council\u2019s Counter-Terrorism Committee. Its\nrole is invaluable in coordinating and exchanging\ninformation and analysing trends.\nThe present session is devoted to an appraisal of\nthe progress made by States in achieving the\nMillennium Development Goals. Therefore, allow me\nto share with you information on how Turkmenistan is\nimplementing the Goals.\nReforms are being implemented in Turkmenistan\nin the economic and social sphere, in accordance with\nthe national programme of social and economic\ndevelopment for the period until 2020. The reforms\nhave assisted in establishing a powerful industrial\npotential, creating a market model for administration\nand the private sector of economy, and ensuring\ndignified living conditions for the people.\nTurkmenistan possesses huge energy resources,\ngas and oil industries being the main sources of\ndevelopment of the national economy. The energy\npotential of Turkmenistan is currently estimated at\nmore than 45 billion tons of oil equivalent, or a fifth of\nall world reserves of natural gas and oil.\nThanks to the national programmes developed in\nthe early years of independence, the reforms have\nintroduced a new type of industry. Turkmenistan, by its\nown national resources, has invested $30 billion in the\nnational economy and has built over 1,050 industrial\nplants and factories possessing highly sophisticated\nequipment.\nWe have been successfully developing new\nbranches of industry, namely, the oil and gas, energy,\ntextile and food sectors. In the textile industry, we have\nestablished new specialized companies and large\nintegrated textile plants, organizing large-scale\nproduction of various cotton fibre products, 60 per cent\nof which is exported. The textile industry represents\n28 per cent of the overall volume of production of our\nmanufacturing industry.\nThe agrarian sector of the economy has\nundergone complete reconstruction. Since the middle\nof 1995, all collective and State farms have been\nabolished. Reform has been directed at transferring\nland to private ownership and long-term lease and\nexpanding the areas of privately-held lots. The\nGovernment has undertaken measures to stimulate\nprivate agricultural production. Half of the cost of\n33\n\ntechnical services is borne by the State. The population\nhas been exempted from payment of taxes on land,\nhouses, construction and the maintenance of cattle and\npoultry. All these and other measures have\nstrengthened agriculture and have stimulated a growth\nin production.\nThis year Turkmenistan harvested a record 3.1\nmillion tons of wheat. At the current stage of\ndevelopment, consumer demand in our country is met\nmainly by domestic production, practically ensuring\nfood independence for the country.\nTurkmenistan attaches great importance to the\ncreation and expansion of its railway infrastructure,\nwhich meets the highest modern standards. Today, the\nrailway system of Turkmenistan covers more than\n2,000 kilometres. In recent years two new railways\nwere constructed and a third is under way, which has\nincreased the size of the system by nearly 500\nkilometres.\nThe country has become a vital part of the\ncommon international transport system. The Trans-\nAsiatic Railway has created a steel variant of the\nancient Silk Road, and this connects Turkmenistan\nwith the countries of Europe and the Asian continent\nand promotes social and economic development.\nTurkmenistan attaches great importance to social\nprotection. Ensuring dignified living standards,\nsecurity, rights and freedoms of citizens and\nstrengthening the legal basis of society is our internal\npolicy. During the entire transition period, the\nPresident and Government worked to provide social\nsupport to the population. Since 1993 they have given\nto their citizens gas, electricity, water, salt, health\nservices and education free of charge.\nThere is a large-scale housing construction\nprogramme. Citizens are guaranteed ownership of\ncomfortable well-designed homes on financially\nattractive terms, with loans extending over a 15-year\nperiod and the future homeowner\u2019s employer paying\n50 per cent of the costs. Thanks to free education and\ngood access, the country has a high level of education\nand literacy. Turkmenistan has achieved success in\nother areas, in particular the protection of the rights of\nchildren and the defence of their interests. This is a\nclear confirmation of our tireless fulfilment of our\nobligations under the Convention on the Rights of the\nChild.\nWorking with the United Nations Children\u2019s\nFund, in 2000 we successfully implemented a programme\nfor the protection of mothers and children, the\ncomprehensive development of children and the\npromotion and well-being of the youth.\nThe country has achieved wide immunization\ncoverage, which has led to a significant reduction in\ninfectious diseases among children. A lot of work is\nbeing carried out in the areas of maternal and child\nhealth, education and social protection. In Turkmenistan,\nwe are the fourth country in the world to be recognized\nby the United Nations as a State that has introduced\nuniversal iodization of salt in accordance with accepted\ninternational standards. In this connection it has been\nnoted that our country consistently carries out its\nobligations, not only with regard to iodine deficiency\nbut also with regard to the micronutrients that are\nneeded for the development of a growing child\u2019s body.\nFor many centuries, our country has been a\ncrossroads of routes between East and West and South\nand North and has been a key link in the Great Silk\nRoad, which served as a road of peace and dialogue for\ncultures for almost one and a half thousand years. This\nled to the creation of a special spiritual atmosphere in\nour Turkmen land, and it is not accidental therefore\nthat the national mentality of the Turkmens was\ngenerated in its essence as internationally oriented,\nseeing the individual as the supreme value, and rooted\nin openness, tolerance, respect for the culture of other\npeoples and natural peacefulness.\nThe political system of the State recognizes the\nimportant role played by civil society. Public\nassociations and professional and artistic unions play\nan active role in determining the economic, social and\ncultural policies of the State.\nTurkmenistan has historically respected religious\nfreedom for its citizens and strictly respects generally\nrecognized international norms and principles in the\narea of freedom of worship. As a result, more than 100\nreligious organizations are registered in Turkmenistan.\nThe State guarantees the freedom of religion and\nbelief, the equality of faiths before the law and the\nright of everyone independently to determine his or her\nrelationship to religion.\nTurkmenistan recognizes the primacy of\nuniversally recognized norms of international law and\nhas joined or ratified the fundamental international\ninstruments in the area of human rights. An important\n34\n\nmeasure in this area has been Turkmenistan\u2019s\ndeclaration of its status of a permanently neutral State,\nand this has been approved by the General Assembly.\nTurkmenistan has assumed its international obligations\nin that connection and has fulfilled them over the past\n10 years. These obligations are incorporated in the\nconstitutional laws on the neutrality of Turkmenistan\nand on its international obligations in the field of\nhuman rights.\nIn 1999 we abolished the death penalty.\nTurkmenistan has adopted specific political, economic\nand social measures for the protection of the rights of\nrefugees, who arrived in our country between 1991 and\n1997. During this period, about 20,000 refugees from\nTajikistan, Afghanistan, Armenia and other countries\narrived to Turkmenistan. Under the decree of the\nPresident of Turkmenistan, more than 16,000 of them\nreceived citizenship or residence permits.\nWe welcome efforts of the Secretary-General of\nthe United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan, aimed at\nstrengthening the United Nations. We are grateful to\nthe United Nations, its Secretariat, its specialized\nagencies such as the United Nations Development\nProgramme, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, the\nUnited Nations Population Fund, the World Health\nOrganization and others, who have coordinated and\nprovided invaluable assistance to the development of\nour State.\nTurkmenistan along with many other States has\nhigh hopes in the United Nations and calls for its\nstrengthening and the broadening of its role in the\nworld."

        "file_text": "Just a few days\nago, in this same Hall, the follow-up High-level\nMeeting was held on the Millennium, bringing together\nan unprecedented number of high political leaders from\nall over the world. After a process of discussion and\nnegotiation, both lengthy and thorough, we adopted\nwhat should serve as our road map for the period to\ncome. The final document should not only inspire but\nalso give specific direction to, the actions of the\ninternational community in the United Nations.\nWhile not all our expectations or ambitions were\nrealized in that document and considerable gaps cry\nout to be filled \u2014 I am thinking particularly of the\ncrucial areas of disarmament and non-proliferation \u2014\nwe must, nevertheless, welcome the fact that around\nthe central pillars of the United Nations, namely,\ndevelopment, peace and human rights, broad agreement\nhas crystallized and a new international agenda has in\nfact emerged.\nIt is particularly appropriate and propitious that\nthe current regular session of the General Assembly\nhas opened immediately following on the important\nHigh-level Meeting. While we may feel that the\nfoundation was laid during that important event, what\n14\n\nwe have to do now is to complete what has been\nundertaken, consolidate the sections of walls that have\nbeen erected and build those parts that have only been\nsketched out \u2014 and here I am thinking particularly of\nthe Human Rights Council \u2014 and provide our project\nwith a sound roof.\nRenewal of multilateralism in the context of the\nspecial conditions at the beginning of this century and\nthe reform of the United Nations must be conducted\nwith determination, driven by a real sense of urgency\nin the light of the significance of the task that awaits us\nand the crucial matters at stake for billions of men and\nwomen.\nKnowing as I do, Sir, your personal commitment,\nyour dynamism and your numerous qualities, I am\nconvinced that you will direct the work of the sixtieth\nregular session of the General Assembly in such a way\nso as to ensure that we can, all together, carry out the\nurgent mandate entrusted to us by the High-level\nMeeting and, more particularly, by our peoples, who\nhave placed their hopes on a revamped and\nstrengthened United Nations system. It is in this spirit\nthat my country is prepared to subscribe with\nconviction to the accountability pact proposed by our\nSecretary-General, whom I would, once again, like to\ncongratulate for what he has been doing at the head of\nour Organization.\nI would note with satisfaction your intention, Sir,\nto present a detailed and operational workplan in order\nto organize our work as effectively as possible so that\nwe can complete the tasks awaiting us according to a\nfixed timetable. We have to provide concrete evidence\nthat our Assembly will not go back to business as usual\nonce the spotlights have been switched off.\nFor all those \u2014 and I am one of them \u2014 who\nbelieve that our Assembly, a veritable parliament of the\nnations of the world, has a paramount role to play in\nthe emergence of a strong political consensus at the\nworld level, the quick adoption of specific operational\ndecisions should deal a sound rebuff to all those\nCassandras, all those cynics and all those who uphold\nthe status quo that opposes change.\nIn his opening statement at the sixtieth regular\nsession of the General Assembly, our Secretary-\nGeneral clearly defined the mission that awaits us in\nthe coming months. Among the subjects that claim our\nattention, I would focus on the following: human\nrights, in order to strengthen the impact of this\nessential dimension in all the activities of the United\nNations, particularly through the immediate creation of\na Human Rights Council on the basis of the positive\ngroundwork laid in the preparatory work of the High-\nlevel Meeting; the establishment of the Peacebuilding\nCommission, an innovative body; the reform of the\nmain bodies of our Organization, including the urgent\nneed to enlarge the Security Council in both categories\nof membership in order to make the Council more\nrepresentative of the realities at the beginning of the\ntwenty-first century and to make it more transparent\nand more effective; giving concrete form to the idea of\n\u201cthe responsibility to protect\u201d, whose confirmation in\nthe final document is one of the main breakthroughs of\nthe recent High-level Meeting; and finally, the reform\nof the administrative and financial management of the\nUnited Nations in order to consolidate the effectiveness\nand integrity of the Organization.\nLet me also devote a few minutes to the question\nof development. Development remains the main\npolitical and moral issue of our time. It must be noted\nthat progress towards the Millennium Development\nGoals has been uneven and some backward movement\nmust be acknowledged, particularly in sub-Saharan\nAfrica. The recently published Human Development\nReport notes that\n\u201cIn the midst of an increasingly prosperous\nglobal economy, 10.7 million children every year\ndo not live to see their fifth birthday, and more\nthan 1 billion people survive in abject poverty on\nless than $1 per day. The HIV/AIDS pandemic\nhas inflicted the single greatest reversal in human\ndevelopment. In 2003, the pandemic claimed 3\nmillion lives and left another five million people\ninfected.\u201d (Human Development Report 2005, p. 1)\nIn view of these alarming facts, setting up and\ncreating a genuine partnership for development, based\non the groundwork of the Monterrey Conference and\non the basis of shared responsibility borne by both the\ndonor countries and the recipient countries, remains a\nmatter of priority. The countries of the South must take\ntheir own development in hand by defining detailed\nnational strategies that are effective and directed\ntowards good governance and combating corruption.\nThe countries of the North must fulfil their\ncommitments in matters of trade, debt reduction and\nenhancing the quality of aid and good practices.\nParticular emphasis should be laid on increasing\n15\n\nfinancial flows for development. In this connection,\nwhen Luxembourg occupied the presidency of the\nEuropean Union during the first half of this year, the\nmember States of the European Union took the historic\ndecision to commit themselves on a precise timetable\nto make a considerable increase of their official\ndevelopment aid (ODA) in order to achieve the target\nof 0.7 per cent of their gross national products by 2015\nat the latest. Four of the five countries, including my\nown, that have achieved or gone beyond 0.7 per\ncent \u2014 a target reconfirmed by the High-level\nMeeting \u2014 are member States of the European Union.\nThe Government of Luxembourg has confirmed its\nintention to increase its ODA contribution in the years\nto come to one per cent of its gross national income.\nUnfortunately, too often the fruits of development\nare erased by natural or man-made disasters. In the\nSudan, in the Great Lakes region and elsewhere, this\ntruth is demonstrated daily. There can be no\ndevelopment without security. There can be no security\nwithout development.\nThat is why I particularly welcome the agreement\nreached during the summit on the establishment of a\nPeacebuilding Commission. That should make it\npossible for us to contemplate the tremendous\nproblems of transition confronting the countries\nemerging from conflict from an overall viewpoint,\nbringing together the dimensions of crisis management,\nhumanitarian aid, reconstruction of State structures and\nlocal and legal structures and providing essential\npublic goods and services, while at the same time re-\nlaunching the process of economic and social\ndevelopment.\nOn the basis of the mandate given by the summit,\nLuxembourg actively supports the reform of the\nCentral Emergency Revolving Fund, which should take\nshape in coming months so that this renovated Fund\ncan become fully operational by the beginning of 2006.\nMy country has already announced, just a few days ago\nhere in New York, that it would be making a\ncontribution of $4 million to the capital of this Fund,\nand other States have also confirmed large\ncontributions.\nIf development is, according to the well-known\nformula, the new name of peace, we cannot fail,\nnevertheless, to note that numerous international\nconflicts and intra-State conflicts and hotbeds of\ntension continue to dot the face of the world.\nPeace and stability in the Middle East continue to\nbe at the forefront of our concerns.\nThe current President of the Council of the\nEuropean Union, my friend Jack Straw, recalled two\ndays ago from this rostrum the spirit in which the\nnegotiations on the nuclear issue were conducted with\nIran in recent months. Cooperation and respect for\ninternational norms and treaties, rather than\ndiscrimination or a desire to create dependency, were\nwhat motivated us in this case. In the Paris Agreement\nIran subscribed to a total suspension of all activities\nconnected with enrichment and all reprocessing\nactivities. It is that commitment that made it possible\nto develop political and economic cooperation with the\nEuropean Union. It is that commitment \u2014 which, I\nhardly need to recall, has been ratified by the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency \u2014 that I today\ncall upon Iran to respect.\nIn this context, I should also like to welcome the\nagreement that was reached just today with the\nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea to abandon all\nnuclear programmes and to rejoin the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty (NPT). This is excellent news.\nOn 22 June 2005, more than 80 countries and\norganizations met in Brussels at the International\nConference on Iraq, sponsored jointly by the European\nUnion and the United States, with the presence of our\nSecretary-General, and expressed their support for the\nIraqi Transitional Government and its political,\neconomic and security priorities. That important\nConference made it possible, in particular, for the\nStates members of the European Union to reaffirm\ntheir unanimous and united support for a secure, stable,\nunified, prosperous, democratic Iraq, respectful of\nhuman rights, which will benefit fully from the\nexercise of its sovereignty, cooperate constructively\nwith its neighbours and with the international\ncommunity, and end violence in that country. And it is\nour Organization that, more than ever, must be a\ndriving force, play a leading role, in that context.\nThe Near East has only rarely been the scene of\npositive developments. This is why I should like\nparticularly and expressly to welcome the political\ncourage of the leaders of the two sides regarding the\nsuccessful withdrawal from Gaza and certain parts of\nthe north of the West Bank. Now we should take\nadvantage of that positive dynamic to launch a genuine\npeace prospect based on the road map, which continues\n16\n\nto be the essential framework in this matter. The\nconditions to promote the emergence of a climate of\npeace were recalled by the European Council on 16 and\n17 June 2005. In particular, the fact that the Palestinian\nAuthority is taking control of Gaza now provides it\nwith an opportunity to demonstrate its institutional and\nadministrative maturity, particularly as regards\nmaintaining law and order and combating terrorism.\nThe cessation of all acts of violence by the parties is\nalso an essential requirement.\nRegarding the crucial question of Israeli\ncolonization activities in the occupied territories, the\nEuropean Council noted that \u201cthe policy of\ncolonization is an obstacle to peace and threatens\nmaking virtually impossible any solution based on the\ncoexistence of two States\u201d. In the same context, the\nEuropean Council expressed concern at the\ncontinuation of the building of the separation barrier in\nthe occupied Palestinian territory, including East\nJerusalem and its surrounding areas, which contradicts\nthe pertinent provisions of international law. At the\nsame time, of course, the Council recognized the right\nof Israel to protect its citizens against attacks.\nLet us assume that the next meeting of the\nQuartet, which will be held in New York tomorrow,\nwill find political formulas that will make it possible to\ncontinue the positive dynamic of disengagement from\nGaza and will clear the way for a just and lasting peace\nin this divided part of our world.\nAs very often happens, patches of clouds and\nglimmers of hope are mingled when we analyse the\ninternational situation, but one thing remains constant,\nand that is the central role of the United Nations in the\nsearch for international peace and security. Sixty years\nafter the signing of the San Francisco Charter, we have\nall met together here to confirm our contract of\nconfidence with this Organization, the United Nations,\nwhich is our common heritage \u2014 a United Nations\nrenovated and reformed, synchronized with the threats\nand challenges of our times and able to respond to the\nexpectations of the peoples of the world. As a\nsignatory to the Charter in 1945, Luxembourg, as far as\nit is concerned, is ready to renew this pledge of\nconfidence with enthusiasm, confidence and\ndetermination."

        "file_text": "I am pleased to join those \nwho have spoken before me in congratulating you, Sir, on \nyour election to the presidency of the sixtieth session of \nthe General Assembly. For us in Zambia your election is \nespecially significant given the historic bond of friendship \n \n \n05-51226 9 \n \nthat exists between our countries. It was in our country \nthat your illustrious compatriot, then Secretary-General \nDag Hammarskj\u00f6ld, lost his life in 1961 while on a \nmission for peace in the Congo.  \n I pay tribute to your predecessor, His Excellency \nMr. Jean Ping, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \nRepublic of Gabon, who presided over the fifty-ninth \nsession, for his selfless commitment and devotion to \nthe search for consensus on the outcome document \nwhich the Assembly adopted two days ago (resolution \n60/1). My delegation\u2019s appreciation also goes to the \nSecretary-General, His Excellency, Mr. Kofi Annan, \nfor his outstanding leadership and dedication to the \nwell-being of the Organization. \n Five years ago we committed ourselves to eight \nidentifiable Development Goals. Today we have \nrecommitted ourselves to uphold the principles and \nmeet the Goals set out in the historic Millennium \nDeclaration. We hope that the commitments we have \nundertaken will not remain mere empty words but that, \nthis time around, the international community will \nmake a concerted effort to implement them. In this \nregard we are inspired by the report of the High-level \nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change (A/59/565). \nThose of us from Africa see the report of the Secretary-\nGeneral (A/59/2005) as an opportunity to realize the \ngoals set out in the Organization of African Unity\u2019s \n1997 Harare Declaration, which called for the reform \nof the United Nations Security Council. \n My delegation supports the demand of the \nAfrican Union for two permanent seats on the Security \nCouncil, with all the privileges attached to such seats, \nincluding the right of veto. Our position is not meant to \nfrustrate the reform process. The African region \nconsiders the reform of the Organization as an \nopportunity to correct historical injustices that stand as \na dark cloud over our people. We would actually prefer \nthat the right of veto be removed from the United \nNations, as it is undemocratic. We are, however, aware \nthat some permanent members of the Security Council \nare reluctant to give up the veto power at the moment. \nIt is in this regard that Africa, like other regions, \ndeserves the right of veto, as the absence of that right \nwill only serve to perpetuate the marginalization of the \ncontinent. \n The position I have outlined does not in any way \nmean that Africa is against the expansion of the \nSecurity Council to include other important countries \nthat contribute to international peace and security. Let \nme reaffirm in this regard that Zambia supports the \nfour candidate States of Brazil, Germany, India and \nJapan for permanent membership of the Security \nCouncil with full privileges, including that of veto \npower. I am only stressing that Africa is entitled to, and \ndeserves the right of, permanent representation in the \nSecurity Council, with the right of veto, not only as a \nmatter of correcting an historical injustice against \nAfrica but also to uphold the democratic principles of \nregional equality. \n Two days ago we adopted the outcome document \nof the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General \nAssembly on the review of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). The High-level Plenary \nMeeting provided a rare opportunity for us to share \nexperiences in the implementation of the development \nagenda, in particular, and highlighted the need for \nenhanced international cooperation and coordination if \nwe are to achieve much-sought-after economic \ndevelopment. While the document does not contain \neverything we would have wanted to include, it \nnevertheless represents an important basis for \ncontinued dialogue during this session. \n Since 2001 Africa has been implementing the \nNew Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD), \nwhose main objective is to enhance the capacity of \nAfrican countries to reduce the high incidence of \npoverty on the continent and to strengthen efforts to \nachieve sustainable economic development. While we \nacknowledge the support that the international \ncommunity has so far rendered to the realization of \nNEPAD\u2019s objectives, it is also true that this support \nthat has proved to be insufficient. \n It is the view of my Government that while \nofficial development assistance (ODA) may help in the \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals, \ntrade would help to sustain those gains. In this regard, \nZambia urges all stakeholders to bring to a speedy \nconclusion the Doha round of trade negotiations, which \nwill act as a catalyst towards achieving sustainable \ndevelopment. The external debt problem is still a major \nhindrance to development. The current unfavourable \nterms in agriculture and commodity trading make the \nproblem even more unbearable. \n My delegation commends the United Nations for \nsupporting the efforts of the African Union\u2019s peace \ninitiatives on the continent. The Pan-African \n  \n \n10 05-51226 \n \nParliament and the Peace and Security Council are part \nof the infrastructure in support of peace and security. In \nthis regard, I wish to pledge Zambia\u2019s continued \nsupport of the process. \n Zambia, as one of the core States of the Great \nLakes region, would like to associate itself with the \nremarkable progress that continues to be made in the \nareas of peace and security in the subregion since the \n17 November 2003 report of the Secretary-General to \nthe Security Council on preparations for an \ninternational conference on the Great Lakes region \n(S/2003/1099). We are encouraged by some positive \ndevelopments brought about so far through the process \nof regional ownership and international partnership and \nthe combined efforts of the United Nations, the African \nUnion, the Group of Friends and the subregional \nGovernments concerned. \n My Government will continue to play its part in \nthe fight against international terrorism. Zambia rejects \nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We are \ndetermined to work with the rest of the international \ncommunity to implement the counter-terrorism \nstrategy.  \n Zambia is committed to promoting and respecting \nhuman rights, the rule of law and democracy. In \nZambia we believe that democracy is a universal value. \nWe believe therefore it is under conditions of \ndemocracy that all human rights are protected. \n Allow me to conclude my statement by referring \nto the efforts my Government is making to fight \ncorruption. The nation as a whole has realized that the \nstate of our economy could have been much better if \nall the resources available had been utilized properly. \nIn this regard, one cannot overemphasize the fact that \ncorruption erodes the incomes of households and \nbusinesses, thus defeating efforts to reduce poverty. I \nwish to explain that the Zambia Task Force on \nCorruption is an instrument for development that my \nGovernment hopes will enhance the capacity to utilize \npublic resources for purposes that benefit the nation as \na whole. More important, the attainment of the Heavily \nIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative completion \npoint by my country can, in large measure, be \nattributed to the success of the campaign against \ncorruption, which prompted the Government to \nintroduce stringent financial controls and transparent \nand accountable public expenditure measures. The \nUnited Nations should consider increasing its resources \nin the fight against corruption. \n As we mark the sixtieth anniversary of this, our \ngreat institution, we cannot but conclude that its \nimportance and continued relevance to mankind is \nbeyond question. It is in that context that we need to \nrevitalize it in order for it to fulfil the ideals for which \nit was established. "

        "file_text": "Allow me to extend to you, \nSir, our sincere congratulations on your assumption of \nthe presidency of the sixtieth session of the General \nAssembly and to express our confidence in your ability \n \n \n05-51226 5 \n \nto guide our work throughout the session. In the same \nbreath, let me also express our appreciation to your \npredecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, for managing successfully \nthe very difficult business of the fifty-ninth session. \n Although we began our last session with a \nweighty agenda, we were able to reach general \nagreement on a number of important issues in the area \nof development. We are yet to agree on other pressing \nissues, such as the reform of the Security Council and \nthe composition of a new Human Rights Council. \n For many years we have spoken in favour of an \napproach to international peace and security that is \nfirmly rooted in the principle of multilateralism and the \nprovisions of the Charter of the United Nations. We \nmaintain that any diversion from this approach is \nunacceptable, undesirable and devoid of legal \njustification. We are pleased to note that the majority \nof views expressed during the last session reinforced \nthat principle.  \n Our expectation is that the Security Council in its \ncurrent form, or in whatever character and composition \nit will eventually take, will, like all other bodies of the \nUnited Nations, limit itself to what is contained in its \nmandate. We do not subscribe to the suggestion that all \nproblems \u2014 social, cultural, economic and health, \namong others \u2014 are necessarily threats to international \npeace and security and should therefore be referred to \nthe Security Council.  \n Recently we witnessed the United Kingdom \nabusing its privilege and acting dishonestly as a \nmember of the Council by seeking to score cheap \npolitical points in its bilateral dispute with us. We were \ndragged on to the Council\u2019s agenda over an issue that \nhas no relevance to the maintenance of international \npeace and security. Let me pay tribute to those \nmembers of the Security Council who saw through this \ncheap politicking and manipulation of procedures \u2014 \nwhich the same country, by the way, has vowed to \nresume as soon as the Council is appropriately chaired. \nIt is my hope that other Member countries will join us \nin rejecting this neocolonialist attempt and blatant \ninterference in the internal affairs of Zimbabwe. But \nthen, is it not obvious, that Britain under the regime of \nTony Blair has ceased to respect the Charter of the \nUnited Nations? Witness its being a principal member \nof the illegal anti-Iraq coalition that went on a \ndevastating campaign in that country in complete \ndefiance of the United Nations Charter. Any State or \ngroup of States that commits such an act of aggression \non another, justifying it on blatant falsehoods, surely \nbecomes guilty of State terrorism.  \n Zimbabwe is a country at peace with itself and \nwith its neighbours and offers absolutely no threat to \ninternational peace and security. Is it not therefore \nsurprising that Britain and its Anglo-Saxon allies have \nembarked on a vicious campaign of first peddling \nblatant lies intended to tarnish it and then appealing to \nEurope and America for sanctions against it?  \n Those imperialist countries have unashamedly \nabused the power of the media by hypocritically \nportraying themselves as philanthropists and \ninternational saviours of victims of various calamities. \nYet they have remained silent about the shocking \ncircumstances of obvious State neglect surrounding the \ntragic Gulf coast disaster, where a whole community of \nmainly non-whites was deliberately abandoned to the \nravages of Hurricane Katrina as sacrificial lambs, and \nsacrificed to which god one cannot tell. Most of the \nvictims were blacks. And we are bound to ask what \ntransgressions we, the blacks of this world, have \ncommitted? Was it not enough punishment and \nsuffering in history that we were uprooted and made \nhelpless slaves, not only in new colonial outposts but \nalso domestically at home, through a vicious system of \ncolonialism that made us landless, propertyless and \nmere slaves and serfs in our own lands?  \n Must we again in this day of humanitarian ethics, \nthis day of the sacred principles of the equality of \nmankind and the rights of men and women, this day \nthat has seen us assemble here to save, enhance and \nprolong life, become victims of callous racial neglect? \nWe of Africa protest that in this day and age we should \ncontinue to be treated as lesser human beings than \nother races.  \n We reiterate our deep sympathies and \ncondolences over the massive loss of life that occurred \nin the Hurricane Katrina disaster. If, as we are told, \nmany who survived the wrath of Hurricane Katrina are \nstill dispersed, the question we ask ourselves is where \nthey are and for how long will they remain where they \nare. We ask further whether they will ever get back, \ntruly rehabilitated, to their original homes \u2014 properly \nrehabilitated also, homes which at present are mere \nwreckages. Where, I ask, are the Zimbabwe-famous \nUnited Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-\nHABITAT) and the Commission on Human Rights? \n  \n \n6 05-51226 \n \nWhy should they maintain an ominous silence? For \nhere is real homeless work for HABITAT and the \nCommission on Human Rights. This indeed is where \nthey rightly belong and not anywhere in Zimbabwe. We \ndo not need them there. \n With reference to the vexatious issue of the \nreform of the Security Council, we have made our \nviews known through the African Union. We seek fair \nand equal treatment as partners in this community of \nnations and pledge our commitment to work with \nothers in pursuit of that objective. \n The promotion of human rights is one of the \nmajor aims of the United Nations as enshrined in its \nCharter. As such, the subject rightly occupies space on \nthe agenda of each session of the General Assembly, \nincluding this one. We believe that the United Nations \nshould make every effort to promote and protect the \nfull enjoyment of human rights, including the right to \ndevelopment. Regrettably, we have seen over the years \na deliberate tendency to create a distorted hierarchy of \nrights, with the sole mischievous purpose of \noverplaying civil and political rights while \ndownplaying economic, social and cultural rights. That \nexplains why the whole human rights agenda, instead \nof being a cooperative exercise, has degenerated into a \nWestern-managed kangaroo court, always looking out \nfor \u201ccriminals\u201d, as they call them, among developing \ncountries. Hence, we continue to argue that the human \nrights discourse needs to be rid of selectivity and \ndouble standards and to be approached without hidden \npolitical agendas. \n The African Union has indicated its support for \nthe establishment of a Human Rights Council that will \nbe subordinated to the General Assembly. Zimbabwe \nsubscribes fully to that position. We believe, however, \nthat a correctly sized and properly structured Council, \nwith equitable geographical representation, will be a \nmajor step in addressing the deficiencies of the current \nCommission on Human Rights. \n At the beginning of the last session (see \nA/59/PV.5) I informed the Assembly that despite the \nrecurrent droughts that we had experienced, Zimbabwe \nhad the capacity to cope with its situation of hunger \nand was thus not appealing for humanitarian \nintervention. In spite of that message, our detractors \nand ill-wishers have been projecting a false picture of \nmass starvation. There has been none of that. Recently, \nparticularly in the aftermath of our urban clean-up \noperation, popularly known at home as Operation \nMurambatsvina, or Operation Restore Order, the \nfamiliar noises re-echoed from the same malicious \nprophets of doom claiming that there was a \nhumanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe. Those unfounded \nalarms are aimed at deliberately tarnishing the image \nof Zimbabwe and projecting it as a failed State. We \nfind it strange and obviously anomalous that the \nGovernment of Zimbabwe should be maligned and \ncondemned for restoring order and the rule of law in its \nmunicipal areas. Our detractors fail to acknowledge \nthat Operation Restore Order soon gave way to a well-\nplanned, vast reconstruction programme through which \nproperly planned accommodation, factory shells and \nvending stalls are being constructed in many areas of \nthe country for our people. We have rejected the \nscandalous demand, as expressed in Special Envoy \nAnna Tibaijuka\u2019s report, that we lower our urban \nhousing standards to allow for mud huts, bush latrines \nand pit toilets as suitable for our urban people and for \nAfricans generally. Nothing can be more insulting and \ndegrading of a people than that. Surely we do not need \ndevelopment in reverse. \n Let me conclude by making my message to our \ndetractors very simple and clear. The people of \nZimbabwe came through a protracted guerrilla struggle \nto establish themselves as a free \u2014 I emphasize \n\u201cfree\u201d \u2014 and sovereign nation. We indeed went \nthrough long and bitter times to get our freedom and \nindependence, and to be where we are today. We \ncherish that hard-won freedom and independence, and \nno amount of coercion, political, economic or \notherwise, will make us a colony again. But we also \ncherish peace and development and good regional and \ninternational relations. Together with all other nations \nof good will, we will continue to work tirelessly for a \njust, peaceful and prosperous world. "

        "file_text": "The sixtieth anniversary of the United\nNations coincides with the commemoration of my\ncountry\u2019s twenty-fifth year of independence. The\npreamble to the Constitution of Saint Vincent and the\nGrenadines reaffirms that our nation is founded on the\nbelief in the supremacy of God and the freedom and\ndignity of man. Our national motto, Pax et justitia \u2014\nPeace and justice \u2014 symbolizes both our reality and\nour dream. The universal ideals which inspired the\nfounding fathers of the United Nations are those which\nprompted the lofty proclamations in my nation\u2019s\nConstitution. The United Nations Charter taught us a\ntruth, as though engraved on a tablet of stone, that\nwhile some sleep to dream, we must dream to change\nthe world for the better.\nWe in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines accept\nunequivocally the fulcrum around which the outcome\ndocument of the High-level Plenary Meeting revolves,\nnamely, to create a more peaceful, prosperous and\ndemocratic world, and to undertake concrete measures\nto continue finding ways to implement the conclusions\nof the Millennium Summit and other major United\nNations gatherings so as to provide multilateral\nsolutions to the problems which touch and concern\ndevelopment, peace and collective security, human\nrights and the rule of law, and the strengthening of the\nUnited Nations.\nYet the outcome document, though certainly a\ncodified and presumably consensual package, falls\nshort of what is truly demanded by these extraordinary,\nchallenging times in the first decade of the twenty-first\ncentury. The larger and more powerful nations are\ngripped by an unreasonable fear which, in the process,\nconstrains them from being reasonably fair. Less\npowerful nation-States and those which are small and\nweak internationally often beat their collective chests\nwith an unbecoming self-righteous purity that restrains\nthem from knowing or understanding what impurity is,\neven within themselves.\nSo, an unwholesome stand-off results.\nMeanwhile, around us all, there is a carnival of misery,\na festival of guns. A Caribbean poet laureate tells us\nthat the faces of men and women are strained and\nanxious. Many, if not most persons, become\nsceptical \u2014 nay, cynical \u2014 of the grand efforts of the\nworld\u2019s leaders. They search instead for an amazing\ngrace which makes the blind to see and the wretched to\nbe saved. Along the way, the majesty of faith becomes\nmetamorphosed, in too many of the world\u2019s\ninhabitants, into a believer\u2019s extremism. Man\u2019s reason\ncannot quite fathom, this side of eternity, the evil\nwhich extremism breeds. That is an enduring\nconundrum of our times which, in this earthly city, we,\namidst all our limitations and weaknesses, must seek to\naddress appropriately with all our possibilities and\nstrengths, but without the baggage of economic,\nmilitary or cultural imperialism.\nEconomic imperialism muzzles the mouth with\nthe food that it eats to live and thus builds resentment\nin that very mouth that eats, and even more so among\nthose who receive no food to eat. Military imperialism\n13\n\nbegets armed resistance in which a triumph is but a\npause in its impermanence. Cultural imperialism\ndistorts the mind, but in that very distortion the seed of\nits rejection germinates, blossoms and bears a bitter\nand even chauvinistic fruit. The presumed solutions of\nthe powerful have been shown, historically, to be\nmirages. Surely, there must be a better way. Nelson\nMandela has taught us that. Together, we are the world;\nwe are the future. But of all time, only the future is\nours to desecrate; the present is the past, and the past is\nour fathers\u2019 mischiefs.\nUnderlying all of this is a seemingly intractable\nsocio-economic product of modern globalization \u2014 the\ncontradiction between, on the one hand, a growing\ninequality in income distribution globally and, on the\nother, the increasing commonality of consumption\npatterns. Modern communications, including the\nrevolution in information technology, have connected\nthe world as never before. Yet, that very enhanced\nconnection breeds, justifiably, a great impatience\namong those who are most disadvantaged. Economic\nadjustment has to be made more swiftly. Time is of the\nessence, but that very swiftness engenders socio-\neconomic dislocation, which poses immense\ndifficulties for political management.\nThose profound challenges require a series of\nmeasures, including more official development\nassistance more speedily disbursed, a fair system of\ninternational trade, international peace based on tried\nand tested principles of international law, appropriate\nreformation of the United Nations and its associate\ninstitutions, and a more tolerant and educated\npopulation worldwide. But we must set about doing so\nimmediately with conviction, resolution, solidarity and\ndignity. The alternative is apocalypse now.\nNo difficulties, no hardships, no crises, can\njustify terrorism. Terrorism wounds the poor and\ndisadvantaged ever so much. Its barbarism must\ncontinue to be resisted by civilized peoples and nations\ninternationally. No space must be given to terrorism.\nA small multi-island nation like Saint Vincent and\nthe Grenadines has a bundle of special needs. We are,\ntherefore, encouraged by the collective recognition by\nall the Member States of the United Nations that\nspecial needs and vulnerabilities attend small island\ndeveloping States. We are heartened, too, by the\nreaffirmation of the Member States\u2019 commitment to\naddress these special needs and vulnerabilities. There\nare reams of paper commitments in the Mauritius\nStrategy adopted by the International Meeting to\nReview the Implementation of the Programme of\nAction for the Sustainable Development of Small\nIsland Developing States, in the Barbados Programme\nof Action and in the outcome document of the twenty-\nsecond special session of the General Assembly.\nWe realize that the just-concluded United Nations\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting has undertaken to promote\ngreater international cooperation and partnership for\nthe implementation of the solemn commitments\nthrough, among other things, the mobilization of\ndomestic and international resources, the promotion of\ninternational trade as an engine for development and\nincreased international financial and technical\ncooperation.\nThese splendid commitments and undertakings,\nlike all words, must be made flesh if they are to signify\nanything. To be sure, heard melodies are sweet, but\nthose unheard will be sweeter in uplifting action. In\nthis regard, I reaffirm, without here repeating, all that I\nstated in my speech to this body last Friday,\n16 September, on the development agenda focused on\nthe Millennium Development Goals and a sustainable\ncondition beyond them for countries like my own.\nCertainly, a fair resolution to the banana trade impasse\nin Europe must be fashioned without condemning our\npoor banana farmers and workers to further penury and\nmisery.\nThe recent occurrences in Asia, the Caribbean\nand the southern United States of devastating storms\nand hurricanes, and in Africa, of terrible droughts,\ndemand a more coordinated and rational approach\ninternationally to issues of climate change, disaster\npreparedness, and post-disaster rehabilitation. By and\nlarge, there have been ad hoc national, as distinct from\ninternational, approaches. To the extent that\ninternational mechanisms exist for prompt and\nappropriate relief work, they are clearly inadequate for\nthe tasks at hand.\nThis is undoubtedly an area in which the United\nNations and one or more of its agencies or associate\ninstitutions ought to be able to make a significant\ndifference to the well being of real flesh-and-blood\npeople. After all, natural disasters respect no territorial\nboundaries or power blocs; calamities from nature have\na studied ideological neutrality. They are the same sad\nsongs heard from ancient times by emperor, vassals\n14\n\nand clown; and in modern times, increasingly by the\nrich and the poor. But they afflict the poor more\ndisastrously than any other group. This matter demands\nurgent international attention. The pain and anguish\nevoked by President George Bush in his most recent\nspeech on the Katrina disaster must surely move to\nconcerted international action even those who stand\namid the alien corn.\nA sustained, coordinated response is needed if we\nare to avoid an ignoble \u201cdisaster fatigue\u201d that treats a\nnatural disaster in one country as a momentary\ndistraction from normalcy, as television images\ndetermine, until the next one arrives. Grenada is a case\nin point. It was laid waste in September 2004 by\nHurricane Ivan, but its recovery effort has been slowed\nby the focus on the more recent catastrophes from\nnature in South Asia, Niger and the southern United\nStates. Grenada still cries out for massive international\nassistance. We must help. There is still an enduring\nneed, even after the television cameras have gone\nelsewhere. This applies, too, in relation to man-made\ndisasters, such as in Darfur.\nThe ever-deteriorating state of affairs in our\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) neighbour Haiti\ndemonstrates vividly the inherent dangers of meddling\nwith the democratic process. Since I spoke on the\nissue, more in sadness than in anger, one year ago, the\nsituation has disintegrated. The so-called Government,\nimplanted without any mandate from the people, has\nneither the political will nor the popular support to\nundertake the measures necessary to return that poor,\ntraumatized country to some semblance of normalcy.\nThere has been no serious effort at disarming the gangs\nthat roam the towns and countryside and practice mob\njustice. Political victimization continues apace with the\ncruel detention and violation of the human rights of\nformer Prime Minister Yvon Neptune, the most glaring\nexample; while, on the other side of the coin, the\ndecision of the Supreme Court to quash the sentences\nof 15 thugs from the Front for Advancement and\nProgress in Haiti (FRAPH), convicted of involvement\nin the 1994 Raboteau massacre, has all the elements of\npolitical motivation.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines, with its\nCARICOM partners, is anxious to welcome Haiti back\ninto the organs of our regional body. But it would be a\nbetrayal of all that we hold dear to ignore the\ninterruption of democracy, the abuses of human rights\nand the breakdown of law and order merely to appease\nperfidious power. We support the work of the United\nNations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH),\nwhile believing that the United Nations forces have\nneither the manpower nor the resources required to\nperform the miracle that they have been entrusted to\nconjure.\nFrom time to time, one or more of our traditional\nfriends and allies have shown displeasure at one or\nmore of our decisions in the field of international\nrelations. Some appear not to appreciate the necessity\nand desirability of small States, such as Saint Vincent\nand the Grenadines, seeking, and oft-times finding,\nmore economic and political space to enhance their\ncapacity to address more efficaciously the harsh winds\nfrom the external political economy and to do so in the\ninterest of our people\u2019s humanization. No one has\nanything to fear from us. None of our friends can\nreasonably ask us to adopt their enemies as our own. It\nis part of our quest to get adversaries to speak sensibly\nto one another and resolve their differences,\nparticularly if they are our neighbours. We pick fights\nwith no one; and we do not pick other people\u2019s fights.\nOne of the best and most loyal friends over our\ncountry\u2019s 25 years of independence has been the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan. Our relationship has\nbeen exemplary and is characterized by mutual respect,\nsolidarity and a desire for international peace, in\naccordance with the principles enshrined in the Charter\nof the United Nations. Taiwan, a magnificent political\nexpression of the Chinese civilization, has partnered\nbeautifully with Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, a\ncomponent of our Caribbean civilization. We\nunequivocally support the quest of Taiwan to be\nrepresented at the United Nations and other\ninternational bodies. It is unfair, unreasonable and\nirrational to exclude a country of 23 million persons,\nwith a thriving economy and a nobility of purpose,\nfrom the United Nations. Further, we urge the United\nNations to take the lead in promoting constructive\ndialogue and friendly engagement between the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and the Republic of China\non Taiwan. Bellicose conduct across the Taiwan Strait\ncannot be condoned in a world striving for enhanced\npeace and collective security.\nLet me end by expressing the hope that the\nUnited Nations may achieve, in the next 60 years,\ngreater and greater success in its goals of bringing\nhope to the hopeless, providing food for the hungry\n15\n\nand spreading peace, stability and sustainability for\nnow and forever. Let this not be the road less travelled."

        "file_text": "At\nthe outset, allow me to express my great pleasure in\nattending this sixtieth session of the General Assembly\nand in addressing you on behalf of the Council of\nMinisters of Bosnia and Herzegovina. I should also\nlike to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your\nelection and at the same time to express my sincere\nappreciation to Mr. Jean Ping for his successful\npresiding over the fifty-ninth session of the General\nAssembly.\nLet me start by making reference to the historic\nsummit that took place last week. In its sixtieth year of\nstriving for global peace, the United Nations has\nreached maturity. Our planet is not what it was 60\nyears ago, and we will leave it to historians to say\nwhether our generation is better than earlier\ngenerations.\nWe need to be able to face the challenges of\nglobalization in the twenty-first century armed with\ncapacity and competence. We need to show\nmultilateralism and cooperation, relying on the basic\nvalues outlined in the Charter. Above all, we need to\nidentify explicit obligations and ensure that they are\nfulfilled. The United Nations, unique and uncontested\nwhen it comes to global credibility and capacity,\nshould not be content to be simply what it used to be.\nThis Organization needs to be reformed, not only to\nquiet the criticism but also more importantly to earn\nunequivocal respect.\nThe strength and efficiency of the United\nNations, like in any other organization, depend on the\ncollective strength of its Members. Its strength stems\nfrom the unity of the Member States. Our\nOrganization, as imperfect as it is, reflects today's\nworld, the international community and our entire\ngeneration. The High-level Plenary Meeting's outcome\ndocument is encouraging because it summarizes the\nissues on which we reached consensus, but it has fallen\nshort of providing the timeframe and methods for\nachieving important goals.\n2\n\nIt is a pity that reform of the Security Council has\nlost momentum and has been postponed to the future.\nOur enthusiasm in supporting the establishment of the\nHuman Rights Council was overshadowed by the fact\nthat the final document has not defined the modalities\nfor realizing this idea in a precise timeframe. We\nstrongly urge the appointment of a facilitator who will\nstreamline the General Assembly's efforts to see this\nnewborn get on its feet.\nAs for the responsibility to protect, which found\nits rightful place in the outcome document, we would\nlike to point out the paramount role of preventive\ndiplomacy. From our painful experience we have come\nto realize the importance of fact-finding missions and\nearly warning systems for potential or imminent\nconflicts.\nIn order to have efficient early warning, we need\nto strengthen the Secretariat's Department of Political\nAffairs. Staff from countries emerging from conflict or\nfrom post-conflict societies, staff with first-hand\nexperience could be an asset to that Department. That\nwould allow us to restore the credibility of the United\nNations, which was in great part overshadowed by non-\ngovernment organizations such as the International\nCrisis Group.\nHaving travelled the path from being the subject\nof Security Council emergency meetings to being a\npotential candidate for a non-permanent seat on the\nSecurity Council in 2010-2011, Bosnia and\nHerzegovina strongly supports the outcome document's\nconclusion that the Council should stay committed to\nits primary responsibility under the Charter and\nmaintain international peace and security, rather than\nexpand its agenda at the expense of the General\nAssembly.\nAnother of today's serious challenges, one that\nBosnia and Herzegovina is dealing with quite\nsuccessfully, is the war on terrorism. It is certain that a\nglobal threat requires a global response, and that is\npossible only through the United Nations. The\ndefinition of terrorist acts, the unequivocal\ncondemnation of such acts by the international\ncommunity, the identification of means of international\ncooperation in the fight against terrorism and the\nunhindered functioning of international justice can be\nachieved only through the United Nations. A special\nMinistry for Security has been established in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina, aimed not only at improving\ndomestic security but also at contributing more\neffectively to the global fight against terrorism. The\nanti-terrorist team that operates under this Ministry has\nalready blocked the bank accounts of suspect\nindividuals and organizations and has brought a\nnumber of charges. We have signed all the international\nconventions against terrorism, and we stand ready to\nmake a constructive contribution to the drafting the\nUnited Nations Comprehensive Convention on\nTerrorism, as agreed in the outcome document.\nThe summit's accomplishments are quite\nencouraging, demonstrating the power of universalism\nand multilateralism and their superiority over\nunilateralism. We made this Assembly an arena of\nagreement, instead of an arena of conflict. The lesson\nlearned in Bosnia and Herzegovina has taught us that if\nwe find enough strength and courage in ourselves to\nprove our commitment to these principles in practice,\nthe course of history can be changed towards peace,\nstability and prosperity for all.\nWith no intention to go too far into the past or\ninterpret facts that already belong to the archives, I\nmust remind you that we are marking two anniversaries\nthis year: Srebrenica and Dayton. The close to 8,000\nnames of Bosniacs on the list in the Srebrenica report\nconfirm the terrible truth about the genocide that took\nplace in that city. That crime was committed 50 years\nafter the liberation of Auschwitz, when it was vowed\nthat that would never again happen. Yet it happened\nagain: not once but twice. We now have the power and\ninstruments to prevent anything similar from ever\nhappening again.\nThe Dayton Agreement, the peace agreement that\nwas reached in Dayton and signed in Paris and often\ncriticized for its complicated and unfeasible provisions,\ndid stop the war and enabled freedom of movement. It\nmeant a new beginning for Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nHowever imperfect, it provided the framework that\nenabled us, 10 years down the line, to turn the situation\naround and complete fundamental reforms that have\nbecome part of our everyday life, namely, the creation\nof a single defence system with a Ministry of Defence,\nthe unification of two economic spaces, the merger of\ntwo intelligence services, a single Customs service and\nrevenue system, standardization, to mention but a few.\nObvious limitations imposed by the Dayton\nframework, for example the problems faced in police\nreform, will be dealt with in accordance with\n3\n\ninternational standards, just as we did with defence\nreform. International standards and good democratic\npractices will take us to the future, free of fear and\ntension. We believe that the road that Bosnia and\nHerzegovina is resolutely following provides an\nimportant international experience. Peace is now firm\nand the State reintegrated, as the situation in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina clearly shows.\nWe have done more in terms of integration and\nnation building over the past three years than in the\nprevious seven. I would like to bring to your attention\nthe important fact that the international affirmation of\nBosnia and Herzegovina and fulfilment of our\nobligations are interconnected. There is a correlation\nbetween encouragement and obligations on the one\nside and multiple reforms on the other.\nA key feature of all reforms to date is the fact that\nthey have all been implemented through political\nagreement. They were not a result of international\npressure and they were not imposed by the current\nHigh Representative. Entities have agreed to transfer\ntheir jurisdictions to the State. Establishing and\nrunning the State-level Ministry of Defence was a\ncrucial step forward in terms of NATO's Partnership\nfor Peace programme. Numerous institutions and\nagencies in the field of public health now operate with\nState-level mandates as well. We are in the final phases\nof introducing a single-rate value-added tax in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina, which will strengthen and\naccommodate the business environment for foreign\ninvestment. We have recorded continued growth in\nforeign direct investment over the past two years,\nwhereas growth in the gross domestic product for 2004\nwas almost 6 per cent \u00f3 a record for our region.\nOf course, one of our most important\ninternational obligations is cooperation with the\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former\nYugoslavia (ICTY), and we pay a great deal of\nattention to it. Despite the fact that the Republika\nSrpska in Bosnia and Herzegovina has also made\nsubstantial progress in this area this year, we are\ndiscouraged by the fact that the two most wanted war\ncriminals have not yet been brought to justice. Obvious\nimprovement in cooperation with The Hague, sudden\nvoluntary surrenders to the Tribunal after years of\nhiding and the locations from which runaway criminals\nare being extradited clearly point to the level of\nresponsibility of Serbia and Montenegro with regard to\nthis entire matter, especially as compared to the\nresponsibility of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We are\nextremely concerned by the fact that many criminals\nstill at large have obviously used Belgrade as an escape\nroute and to secure hideouts outside the region.\nThe reform of the justice system has resulted in\nthe establishment of the institutions of State\nProsecutor, the National Court and the High Judicial\nand Prosecutorial Council of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nWe are the first country in the region to meet the\ninternational standards required for the processing of\nwar crimes cases. The State-level Council will operate\nunder optimal technical conditions and in accordance\nwith the best European practices.\nThe process of organizing trials in the countries\nwhere crimes have been committed is somewhat\nhindered by the dual citizenship issue. However, we\nhope to have that matter resolved shortly, with the\nassistance of the relevant international institutions.\nActing in accordance with its international\nobligations, Bosnia and Herzegovina supports all\nactivities and peace initiatives aimed at conflict\nprevention, peacebuilding and safety in post-conflict\nzones. Despite our limited capacities, Bosnia and\nHerzegovina participates in international peacekeeping\noperations. We have military observers in Congo,\nCyprus, Ethiopia and Eritrea, as well as civilian police\nofficers in Liberia and Haiti as part of United Nations\noperations there. We also sent a mine-clearance team to\nIraq as a sign of our support for Iraqis in the process of\nestablishing a democratic State.\nWith regard to the situation in Iraq, we are\npleased to see consensus among members of the\nSecurity Council in connection with the transfer of\nauthority from the occupation forces to the legitimately\nelected judicial and executive authorities, as that will\nled to establishing Iraq as a sovereign and democratic\ncountry. That is a necessary precondition for the\nbeginning of comprehensive reforms of the Iraqi State\nand society.\nReconstruction will still remain the key issue for\nIraq's citizens. The United Nations should play a more\nimportant role in that connection. The Organization\nprovides humanitarian aid to Iraq and is helping to\nrebuild its infrastructure and Government institutions.\nThe firm determination of the Members of the United\nNations to assist in establishing stability and security\nby participating in reconstruction and providing\n4\n\nassistance in the form of human resources or technical\nsupport is vital.\nBosnia and Herzegovina supports the\ncomprehensive implementation of the Programme of\nAction adopted at the United Nations Conference on\nthe Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in\nAll Its Aspects.\nWe have also supported the outcome of the\nspecial session of the General Assembly devoted to\nAIDS by creating a special national council for the\nprevention of AIDS. The council will meet all required\ninternational obligations in that area by the end of this\nyear.\nWith regard to the financing of international\npeacekeeping operations, we are quite aware that that\nissue is key to accomplishing the goals of the United\nNations. We also recognize that a shortfall in funds can\nindeed hinder the protection of human lives. We call\nfor a more balanced and fair basis for contributions.\nWe also call upon developed countries to set a good\nexample for other countries as they need to\ndemonstrate clearly that we all share this obligation.\nBeing an underrepresented country at United\nNations Headquarters, and in the United Nations\nsystem overall, we would like to see more balanced\nrepresentation. Bosnia and Herzegovina is keen to see\nits nationals being selected for high-ranking positions\nin the Organization, as we in fact have high-quality\npersonnel to offer.\nOn behalf of the citizens of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, allow me to take this opportunity to once\nagain express the gratitude that we feel for the\nassistance that the international community has\nprovided us during times of hardship.\nThe Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina will\ntake immediate steps to prepare, by the end of next\nyear, a national strategy to achieve the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals. That strategy will include special\nemphasis on transparency, good governance, better\nemployment and better use of domestic resources.\nLastly, allow me to share a final thought. We\nbelieve that helping underdeveloped countries and\npost-conflict societies is not charity, but rather an\ninvestment in the future of the entire world."

        "file_text": "A few days ago,\nthis Hall was the venue of an unprecedented landmark,\na historic gathering of a large number of heads of State\nor Government who converged to review and assess\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals,\nto renew their commitment to the United Nations and\nthe principles of its Charter and to underline their faith\n10\n\nand conviction in the valuable contribution of the\ninternational Organization which, by promoting the\nprinciples of peace, security and prosperity, is building\na better world \u2014 a world free of the problems and\nchallenges currently afflicting the international\ncommunity and forming a threat to world peace and\nsecurity. Those problems and challenges include\nterrorism, poverty, hunger, the proliferation of weapons\nof mass destruction, the spread of contagious diseases,\nenvironmental degradation and the persistent and\nflagrant violation of human rights. The international\ngathering was an acknowledgement that multilateralism\nis the only viable option for addressing those issues\nand challenges, whose implications and dangers\ntranscend geographical borders. Therefore, because of\ntheir nature, no country can confront them alone.\nAlthough Kuwait welcomes the adoption of the\noutcome document (resolution 60/1) of the High-level\nPlenary Meeting, we express our disappointment that it\ndid not include the issues of disarmament and non-\nproliferation. We hope that the international community\nwill reach a consensus regarding the importance of full\nand non-selective implementation of all disarmament\ntreaties, particularly the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\nof Nuclear Weapons, whose three main pillars are nuclear\ndisarmament, non-proliferation and the peaceful uses of\nnuclear energy. The international community must\nredouble its efforts to totally eliminate all weapons of\nmass destruction. We hope that the commitments and\nobligations agreed upon will be duly implemented.\nKuwait, for its part, will fulfil its obligations and\ncomply with all relevant international conventions,\ntreaties and United Nations resolutions. We hope that\nthe next few years will see significant strides in the\nefforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals\nby 2015 and that our joint efforts will result in the\nstreamlining of international cooperation and\ncoordination mechanisms.\nIn that context, Kuwait wishes to commend the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his efforts and\ninitiatives to reform the Secretariat with a view to\nenhancing its accountability and transparency and\nimproving the performance of United Nations staff in\norder to meet the demands of the constantly changing\ninternational environment. Kuwait is actively\nparticipating in the ongoing consultations on the reform\nof United Nations organs such as the General Assembly,\nthe Economic and Social Council and the Security\nCouncil.\nWe hope that a consensus will eventually be\nreached on Security Council reform that will achieve\nour common goal: improving the Council's role and\neffectiveness, so that it can fulfil its Charter mandate,\nwhich is the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity. Council reform should also ensure broader\nrepresentation of regional groups, including in\nparticular Arab and Islamic representation, which\nwould make Council resolutions more transparent and\neffective.\nThe phenomenon of terrorism has become a\ndirect and immediate threat to international peace and\nsecurity. Its dangers have spread to affect many\ncountries throughout the world. The 11 September\n2001 attacks in the United States of America, the\nevents currently unfolding in Iraq and the recent\nbombings in London and Sharm el-Sheikh have\nprovided indisputable proof that terrorism neither is\nassociated with, nor specifically targets, a particular\nrace, religion or culture. Therefore, the responsibility\nfor combating terrorism is collective and must be\nshouldered by all Member States without exception.\nWhile the State of Kuwait reaffirms its principled\nposition rejecting terrorism in all its forms and\nmanifestations, we wish to emphasize the need to\ncombat terrorism within a framework of international\nlegitimacy that recognizes the legitimate rights of\npeoples and brings about justice and stability. We also\nstress the importance of commitment and adherence by\nMember States to the 12 international conventions on\nterrorism, as well as to the International Convention\nfor the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism,\nwhich Kuwait signed last Friday. We believe that that\nis the ideal way to eliminate this phenomenon, to curb\nits effects and to tackle its root causes.\nIn that regard, the State of Kuwait reaffirms its\nsupport for the proposal put forward by the Custodian\nof the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah Bin\nAbdulaziz Al-Saud of the fraternal Kingdom of Saudi\nArabia, to establish an international centre to fight\nterrorism. We believe that such a centre would put in\nplace an effective mechanism for collecting and\nexchanging information on this phenomenon.\nIraq continues to find itself in a critically difficult\nsituation of instability and insecurity because of the\nalmost daily terrorist attacks mounted by terrorist\ngroups, including the vanquished fleeing remnants\nloyal to the former Iraqi regime. Those terrorist attacks\n11\n\nlargely impede the efforts of the Iraqi Government to\nrebuild in the wake of the devastation left by the\nformer regime as a result of its hostile policies towards\nits own people and neighbouring countries.\nThe State of Kuwait continues to lend support to\nour brothers in Iraq with a view to rehabilitating and\nrebuilding their country. Our approach stems from our\nbelief that stability in Iraq is ultimately in the interest\nof stability in this vital region of the world and would\nhave positive implications for its security and progress.\nWe are fully confident that the fraternal people of Iraq\nwill eventually overcome this difficult period in their\nhistory and that they will persist in building democratic\ninstitutions, in adopting the text of their new\nconstitution and in laying the ground for the\nforthcoming legislative elections.\nIn the same vein, we wish to stress Kuwait's\ncommitment to the unity, sovereignty and political\nindependence of Iraq. The State of Kuwait looks\nforward to establishing solid fraternal relations with\nthe new Iraq on the basis of mutual respect, good-\nneighbourliness and adherence to bilateral agreements,\nto the relevant United Nations resolutions and to the\nresolutions of international legitimacy, as they\nconstitute the fundamental pillars of the new and future\nrelationship between the two brotherly countries.\nFurthermore, we welcome the Iraqi Government's\ndetermination to try the leaders of the former regime\nfor all the crimes against humanity that they have\ncommitted against the people of Iraq. The trials should\nalso cover the crimes committed against the Kuwaiti\npeople, including the invasion of the State of Kuwait\nand the killing of Kuwaiti prisoners and third-country\nnationals.\nKuwait reaffirms its full support for the struggle\nof the Palestinian people to attain all their legitimate\npolitical rights. Kuwait demands that Israel move\nforward in fulfilling all its commitments and\nobligations under the relevant United Nations\nresolutions, primarily Security Council resolutions 242\n(1967), 338 (1973) and 1515 (2003), in accordance\nwith the principle of land for peace and the provisions\nof the Arab peace initiative, the bilateral accords it\nsigned with the Palestinian Authority within the\nframework of the peace process, and the road map,\nwith all its provisions and obligations. Israel must also\nend its policy of oppressing the Palestinian people,\ndismantle the separation wall and release all\nPalestinian detainees.\nThe State of Kuwait views the Israeli withdrawal\nfrom the Gaza Strip as a first step to be followed by\nadditional measures to be taken by Israel to end the\noccupation, in compliance with the relevant United\nNations resolutions and in preparation for the\nestablishment of an independent Palestinian State on\nPalestinian national soil, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its\ncapital. Kuwait hopes that the Israeli withdrawal will\nlead to the resumption of peace efforts in the region to\nensure full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Syrian\nArab Golan to the borderline of 4 June 1967 and its\nwithdrawal from the rest of the Arab territory in\nsouthern Lebanon. Thereafter, a settlement should be\nreached through negotiations among all parties\nconcerned to establish a just, comprehensive and\nlasting peace in the region \u2014 a peace that would be\nenhanced by making the Middle East region, including\nthe Gulf region, a zone free of weapons of mass\ndestruction.\nIn view of Kuwait's keen interest in the\nmaintenance of security and stability in the Gulf region\nand given our close ties with the brotherly United Arab\nEmirates and with the friendly Islamic Republic of\nIran, we support the position of the member States of\nthe Gulf Cooperation Council regarding the three\nislands of the United Arab Emirates. It is our hope that\nthe two countries will agree on a negotiation\nmechanism to resolve their dispute over the three\nislands, in accordance with the principles and norms of\ninternational law and good neighbourly relations.\nIt is our sincere hope that the resolutions on the\npromotion of sustainable development adopted at\nnumerous international meetings and conferences\nconvened by the United Nations and other\norganizations, as well as those goals in the High-level\nPlenary Meeting's outcome document, will lay the\ngroundwork for a new partnership between the\ndeveloped and the developing nations, thus\ncontributing to the stability and the growth of\neconomic relations among those States. We also hope\nthat those resolutions will help create a balanced and\nfair international trading system in which each party\nassumes its responsibilities.\nTo create that kind of partnership, the economic\nstructures of the developing countries need to be\nstrengthened and the developed countries should fulfil\n12\n\ntheir pledges to provide financial and technical\nassistance and alleviate and cancel the debts of the\npoorest countries. They should also remove trade\nrestrictions and tariffs on products made in poor\ncountries and give those countries access to\ntechnology, enabling them to fully participate in the\nnew economic system. All these measures would help\nput their peoples on the right track to development and\nprosperity.\nIn that context, the State of Kuwait is proud to\nhave honoured all its international obligations. It will\ncontinue to support economic development\nprogrammes in developing countries through the\nKuwait Fund for Economic Development. For the\nrecord, the Fund has so far extended $12 billion in\ndevelopment assistance to more than 100 countries in\nvarious regions of the world. Kuwait will also strive to\nensure the stability of global oil markets, with a view\nto maintaining the pace of development and economic\ngrowth for all.\nAs we observe the sixtieth anniversary of the\nestablishment of the United Nations, Kuwait remains\nhopeful, confident and optimistic about the role of the\nUnited Nations and its capability to deal with\ninternational issues that pose a threat to world peace\nand security.\nTo that noble end, the international community\nmust rally behind the United Nations and forge ahead\nat an even faster pace. We look forward to sincere and\nmeaningful cooperation and partnership to tackle the\ncurrent challenges. Furthermore, we must strive to\ncreate a future characterized by the values and ideals of\nfreedom, justice and equality which, together, underpin\nsecurity and stability across the world."

        "file_text": "I wish to congratulate you\nmost warmly, Mr. President, on your unanimous\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at\nits sixtieth session and to assure you of my delegation\u00eds\nfull support. May I also express our profound\nappreciation to your distinguished predecessor,\nMr. Jean Ping of Gabon, for the effective leadership he\nprovided during the fifty-ninth session.\nI am most delighted and indeed honoured to\naddress this Assembly for the first time as President of\nthe Republic of Namibia. I stand before you with the\ndemocratic mandate given to me by the people of\nNamibia during our presidential elections in November\n2004 and following my inauguration on 21 March\n2005.\nAt the same occasion, we celebrated 15 years of\nour national independence, which, as the Assembly\nwill recall, was brought about by a long and bitter\nstruggle waged by the people of Namibia under the\nleadership of the national liberation movement,\nSWAPO, with wide international support, and thus\nculminating in the implementation of Security Council\nresolution 435 (1978).\nI recall these important events in our history to\nunderline the fact that Namibia\u00eds nationhood is directly\nlinked to the United Nations. In this regard, allow me,\ntherefore, on behalf of the Government and people of\nNamibia and indeed on my own behalf to express our\nsincere appreciation and gratitude to the men and\nwomen of the United Nations family, who stood side\nby side with us until final victory was achieved.\nAs we mark the sixtieth anniversary of the United\nNations, it is indeed proper and fitting to reflect on the\nachievements and setbacks of our Organization since\nits inception. In this exercise, we must be guided by an\nhonest and objective analysis of events along the path\nwe have travelled so far.\nIn this connection, I would like to take this\nopportunity to commend our Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, most sincerely for his tireless efforts\nto  strengthen the United Nations system through the\nproposed reforms. Indeed, the challenges we face today\nrequire renewed commitment and visionary leadership\nto ensure efficient and effective service delivery to all\nhumanity.\nWhen we address the crucial issue of the reform\nof the United Nations system, we must be guided by\nthe principles of democracy, equity, justice and fairness\nfor all. At the centre of this overdue exercise must be\nthe compelling need to serve all our people better,\nregardless of their race, religion or status of\ndevelopment.\nWith specific reference to the Security Council,\ngenuine democratization and reform can take place\nonly when all its members are accorded the same\nprivileges - including the veto power, which is\ncurrently enjoyed only by a few member States, who\nuse it for national self-interest. That creates resentment\nand mistrust from those who are negatively affected by\nthe abuse of veto power.\nIt is against this background that African States\nadopted the Harare Declaration in 1997, in which they\n20\n\ndemanded that the veto power be abolished. However,\nif the veto power is maintained, it is only logical that\nnew permanent member States who join the expanded\nSecurity Council must of necessity be accorded the\nsame rights and privileges. Otherwise, such reform will\nbe cosmetic at best, and meaningless at worst.\nOn this very crucial matter, Namibia fully stands\nby the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration,\nas reaffirmed by the Fourth Extraordinary Summit of\nthe African Union, held in Addis Ababa on 4 August\n2005. We collectively maintain that the African\ncontinent, which has been underrepresented for so\nlong, deserves two permanent seats with veto power\nand five non-permanent seats on the Council. This\ndemand is logical, reasonable and justifiable. We\ntherefore call on all regions to support Africa\u00eds\nposition. It is indeed only when we stand together on\nfirm principle that we can effect real and meaningful\nchange in our only truly international Organization, the\nUnited Nations.\nConcerning the General Assembly, Namibia holds\nthe strong view that that organ, which provides a\ngenuinely democratic and representative platform for\nall Member States to be heard, should play a critical\nrole in the entire reform process of our international\nOrganization. We are equally of the strong conviction\nthat the authority of the General Assembly should be\nreasserted, to ensure that its resolutions and decisions\nare binding and enforceable.\nIn this crucial process, our highest priority should\nbe our collective commitment to ensure sustainable\nsocial and economic development on a global scale. In\norder to achieve that goal, we must be guided by a\nstrong spirit of human solidarity and a shared sense of\njustice and fairness for all.\nFor many developing countries, implementation\nof the Millennium Development Goals is severely\nhampered by the lack of adequate resources,\ncompounded by other challenges, including the\nHIV/AIDS pandemic, malaria and tuberculosis, as well\nas other socio-economic difficulties. Against that\nbackground, the Economic and Social Council must be\nstrengthened and given sufficient resources, together\nwith the United Nations agencies, in order to take the\nlead in implementing effective human-centred country\nprogrammes.\nWe accept the fact that Governments in\ndeveloping countries have a responsibility to work\ntogether and to encourage the active participation of\nthe private sector, civil society and other stakeholders\nin bringing about sustainable social and economic\ndevelopment for all segments of our society.\nIt is equally important that Governments and\ninstitutions in the economically advanced countries\noffer genuine partnership by providing new and\nadditional resources, commensurate with their\ncommitments in line with the Millennium Development\nGoals. To that end, if the countries regarded as low-\nmiddle-income countries are to meet the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals by 2015, they will require\nincreased support from the international community,\nincluding market access as well as access to financial\nsources such as the International Development\nAssociation and official development assistance.\nOur ability to effectively eliminate threats to\ninternational peace and security will depend on the\nmanner in which we address the social and economic\nchallenges facing our peoples at the global level.\nIn our review, during the 2005 summit, of the\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals\nand of other decisions taken by major international\nconferences, it became clear that we still have a long\nway to go to honour our commitments. It is therefore\nimportant that we narrow our differences and form a\ncommon front with a common objective to better serve\nhumanity. We should therefore make collective and\neffective use of existing multilateral mechanisms,\nespecially the United Nations, in order to succeed in\neliminating current and future threats.\nThe process of decolonization has not yet been\ncompleted. The peoples of Palestine and of the Western\nSahara continue to suffer under foreign occupation and\nare denied the exercise of their inalienable rights to\nself-determination and national independence. It is our\ncollective responsibility to rectify that historical\ninjustice. In that regard, we call for the immediate and\nunconditional establishment of an independent State of\nPalestine and the full implementation of the United\nNations settlement plan for Western Sahara.\nI am equally concerned at the fact that the people\nof Cuba continue to suffer from the effects of the\nunilateral embargo imposed on them by the United\nStates of America. We call on the international\ncommunity to demand the unconditional lifting of that\nembargo.\n21\n\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate my\nGovernment\u00eds hope that, when we accept our collective\nresponsibility, the United Nations can and will succeed\nin preserving international peace and security and\ntherefore guarantee equality and justice for all\nhumanity. We, the peoples of the United Nations, must\ndo what is required to bequeath to the next generations\na better future. To that end, the Government and the\npeople of Namibia pledge our total commitment."

        "file_text": "Today, we have\ngathered here to exchange views about the world, its\nfuture and our common responsibilities towards it. It is\nobvious that the future of the world is intertwined with\nits current state and with the prevailing trends, which\nexhibit signs of hope and despair.\nOn the one hand, certain hopes and opportunities\nexist, and the General Assembly is convened on the\nbasis of those hopes. Today, human thought reflects\nsignificant commonalities that provide an appropriate\nfoundation upon which to build. With the passing of\nthe era of agnostic philosophies, humanity is once\nagain united in celebrating monotheism and belief in\nthe Creator as the originator of existence. That is the\ncommon thread that binds us all together. Faith will\nprove to be the solution to many of today\u00eds problems.\nThe truth will shine the light of faith and ethics on the\nlives of human beings; it will prevent them from\nengaging in aggression, coercion and injustice; and it\nwill guide them towards care and compassion for\nfellow beings.\nAnother hope is found in the common global\nappreciation of the sources of knowledge. Although\nreason, experience and science are among the valuable\nsources of knowledge, the darkness of the Middle Ages\nprevented major portions of the Western world from\nappreciating them. This reactionary tendency deprived\nmany of access to various scientific findings and\nknowledge and led to the exclusion of other sources of\nknowledge, namely God and knowledge based on\nrevelation from the life of human beings in the West \u00f3\ndivine knowledge that was disseminated by such\nprophets as Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus and\n5\n\nMohammad. Today, agnostic thinking is on the decline\nand humanity is equally enamoured of religion,\nscience, knowledge and spirituality. This is an\nauspicious beginning.\nDivine prophets teach us about proper regard for\nthe exalted state of human beings on earth. The human\nbeing is blessed with dignity, manifested most\nimportantly in being the viceroy of the Almighty on\nearth. The Almighty placed humans on earth to develop\nit, to institutionalize justice, to overcome their egoistic\ntendencies and to praise no lord but the Almighty.\nFaith and good deeds can bring deliverance and the\ngood life, even in this world. Attaining this depend on\nhuman will, that is, the will of each and every one of\nus. We must heed the call of our common primordial\nnature and achieve the realization of this good life.\nOn the other hand, the prevalence of military\ndomination; increasing poverty; the growing gap\nbetween rich and poor countries; violence as a means\nto resolve crises; the spread of terrorism, especially\nState terrorism; the existence and proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction; the pervasive lack of\nhonesty in inter-State relations; and disregard for the\nequal rights of peoples and nations in international\nrelations constitute some of the challenges and threats\nfacing us.\nAlthough these challenges are very real, we\nbelieve we are not predestined to experience them. Our\ncommon will not only can change this course but, in\nfact, can lead us to a life filled with hope and\nprosperity. Divine revelation teaches us that\n\\\"The Almighty changes the fate of no people\nunless they themselves show a will for change\\\"\n(The Holy Koran, XIII:11).\nHow can we influence the future of the world?\nWhen and how will peace, tranquillity and well-being\nfor all come about? These are the fundamental\nquestions before us.\nWe believe that a sustainable order - in which\npeace and tranquillity can flourish - can be realized\nonly on the basis of the two pillars of justice and\nspirituality. The more human society departs from\njustice and spirituality, the greater the insecurity it will\nface, so much so that a relatively small crisis - such\nas a natural disaster - can lead to various aberrations\nand inhumane behaviour.\nUnfortunately, the world is rife with\ndiscrimination and poverty. Discrimination produces\nhatred, war and terrorism. They all share the common\nroot of a lack of spirituality coupled with injustice.\nJustice is about equal rights; the equitable\ndistribution of resources in the territories of different\nStates; the equality of all before the law; and respect\nfor international agreements. Justice recognizes the\nright of all to tranquillity, peace and a dignified life.\nJustice rejects intimidation and double standards. As\nthe eminent daughter of the Prophet of Islam said,\n\\\"Justice brings tranquillity to our hearts.\\\"\nToday, the world longs for the establishment of\nsuch justice. If humanity heeds the call of its\nprimordial nature with firm resolve, justice will follow.\nThat is what the Almighty has promised and what all\npeople of goodwill from all religions are waiting for. If\nthe prevailing discourse of global relations becomes\none of justice and spirituality, then durable peace will\nbe guaranteed.\nConversely, if international relations are defined\nwithout justice or spirituality and are void of moral\nconsiderations, then mechanisms for promoting\nconfidence and peace will remain insufficient and\nineffective.\nIf some, relying on their superior military and\neconomic might, attempt to expand their rights and\nprivileges, they will be performing a great disservice to\nthe cause of peace and, in fact, will fuel the arms race\nand spread insecurity, fear and deception. If global\ntrends continue to serve the interests of small,\ninfluential groups, even the interests of the citizens of\npowerful countries will be jeopardized, as was seen\nduring recent crises and natural disasters such as the\nrecent tragedy of Hurricane Katrina.\nToday my nation calls on other nations and\nGovernments to move forward towards a durable\ntranquillity and peace based on justice and spirituality.\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran was born of a\nmovement based on the pure, primordial nature of a\npeople who rose up to regain their dignity, esteem and\nhuman rights. The Islamic revolution toppled a regime\nwhich had been put in place through a coup and that\nwas being supported by those who claim to be\nadvocates of democracy and human rights. For 25\nyears they thwarted the aspirations of the nation to\ndevelopment and progress through the intimidation and\n6\n\ntorture of the population and submission and\nsubservience to outsiders.\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is the manifestation\nof true democracy in the region. The discourse of the\nIranian nation is focused on respect for the rights of\nhuman beings and on a quest for tranquillity, peace,\njustice and development for all through monotheism.\nFor eight years, Saddam's regime imposed a\nmassive war of aggression and occupation on my\npeople. It employed the most heinous weapons of mass\ndestruction - including chemical weapons - against\nIranians and Iraqis alike. But who, in fact, armed\nSaddam with those weapons? What was the reaction of\nthose who now claim to fight against weapons of mass\ndestruction to the use of chemical weapons back then?\nThe world is witness to the fact that the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran, because of its humanitarian\nprinciples - even during the most trying of times and\nwhen it was sustaining the highest number of\ncasualties - never allowed itself to use such weapons.\nThousands of nuclear warheads stockpiled in various\nlocations, coupled with programmes to further develop\nthese inhuman weapons, have created a new\natmosphere of repression and the rule of the machines\nof war, threatening the international community and\neven the citizens of the countries that possess them.\nIronically, those that have actually used nuclear\nweapons and continue to produce, stockpile and\nextensively test such weapons; that have used depleted\nuranium bombs and bullets against tens, perhaps\nhundreds, of thousands of Iraqis and Kuwaitis, and\neven their own soldiers and those of their allies,\nafflicting them with incurable diseases; that blatantly\nviolate their obligations under the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT); that have\nrefrained from signing the Comprehensive Nuclear-\nTest-Ban Treaty (CTBT); and that have armed the\nZionist occupation regime with weapons of mass\ndestruction \u00f3 they are not only refusing to remedy\ntheir past actions, but, in clear breach of the NPT, are\ntrying to prevent other countries from acquiring the\ntechnology necessary to produce nuclear energy for\npeaceful purposes.\nAll of these problems emanate from the fact that\nthe elements of justice and spirituality are missing in\nthe way powerful Governments conduct their affairs\nwith other nations.\nAfter 11 September, a particular radical group\nwas accused of terrorist activities, although it was\nnever explained how such huge intelligence-gathering\nand security organizations had failed to prevent such\nan extensive and well-planned operation.\nWhy have Powers that not so long ago were\nsupporting the activities of such groups in Afghanistan,\nthereby portraying themselves as supporters of human\nrights and of the Afghan people, overnight turned into\ntheir most fierce critics? Are we to believe that their\nbenefactors - those very same hegemonic Powers -\nhave lost control? If so, would it not be better for those\nPowers to adopt an honest and transparent approach to\nthe international community, provide precise\ninformation about the main elements and their weapons\nand financial support system, and accept responsibility\nfor their inhuman actions against nations and countries,\nthereby assisting peoples and nations in addressing the\nroots of terrorism correctly, wisely and sincerely?\nWe must endeavour to achieve sustainable\ntranquillity and peace based on justice and spirituality.\nTerrorism and weapons of mass destruction are\ntwo major threats facing the international community.\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran, as one of the main\nvictims of terrorism and chemical weapons, fully\nappreciates the difficulties involved in combating these\nmenaces. Today, the most serious challenge is that the\nculprits are assuming the role of the prosecutor. Even\nmore dangerous is that certain parties, relying on their\npower and wealth, are trying to impose a climate of\nintimidation and injustice on the world. They are\nbullying others, while using their huge media resources\nto portray themselves as defenders of freedom,\ndemocracy and human rights.\nPeople around the world are fully aware of what\nis happening in occupied Palestine. Women and\nchildren are being murdered and teenagers are being\ntaken prisoner. Houses are being demolished and farms\nare being burned down. Yet when the people of\nPalestine resist these conditions, they are accused of\nterrorism. At the same time, the occupier, which does\nnot abide by any principles, terror being part of its\nstated and regular policy, enjoys the support of the\npreviously mentioned Governments. Let me be still\nmore blunt. State terrorism is being supported by those\nwho claim to fight terrorism.\nHow can one talk about human rights and at the\nsame time blatantly deny many people the inalienable\n7\n\nright of access to science and technology, which have\napplications in the fields of medicine, industrial\nproduction and energy, and hinder their progress and\ndevelopment by means of force and intimidation? Can\nnations be deprived of scientific and technological\nprogress through the threat of use of force and on the\nbasis of mere allegations of possible military\ndiversion? We believe that all countries and nations are\nentitled to technological and scientific advancement in\nall fields, and particularly to the peaceful technology to\nproduce nuclear fuel. Such access cannot be restricted\nto a few, depriving most nations and thereby\nestablishing economic monopolies which are then used\nas an instrument to expand domination.\nWe have gathered here to defend human rights in\naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations and\nto prevent certain Powers from claiming that some\ncountries have more rights or that some countries do\nnot have the right to enjoy their legitimate rights.\nWe must not, at the beginning of the twenty-first\ncentury, revert to the logic of the Dark Ages and try\nonce again to deny societies access to scientific and\ntechnological advances. The United Nations must be\nthe symbol of democracy and of the equal rights of\nnations. If we talk about the equal rights of nations in\npolitical forums, we must talk of the same concept in\nthis forum as well. Similarly, if we talk about the right\nof sovereignty, then all nations must be allowed to\nexercise their rights on an equal footing and in a\ndemocratic process.\nThe United Nations will be able to be the\nstandard-bearer of democracy in the world when it,\nitself, is a manifestation of democratic process. I\nreiterate that sustainable tranquillity and peace can\nonly be built on justice and spirituality.\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is a symbol of true\ndemocracy. All officials, including the Leader,\nPresident and members of the Islamic Consultative\nAssembly, city and village councils are elected through\nthe vote of the citizens. The Islamic Republic of Iran\nhas held 27 national elections in 27 years. This\nshowcases a vibrant and dynamic society in which\npeople participate broadly in political life.\nBecause of its key importance and influence in\nthe important and strategic Middle East region, the\nIslamic Republic of Iran is committed to contributing\nactively to the promotion of peace and stability in that\nregion.\nThe Saddam and the Taliban regimes were both\nthe products of foreign Powers. The people of\nAfghanistan and of Iraq know very well who supported\nthose two regimes. Today, to establish peace and\nsecurity in the region, foreign occupation forces must\nleave and completely hand over the political and\neconomic sovereignty of those two countries to their\npeoples.\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran will continue to\nprovide full and comprehensive support to the people\nof Iraq and Afghanistan and to their elected\nGovernments and will actively help them establish\norder and security. My country will continue to expand\nits sincere cooperation and interaction with them.\nIn Palestine, a sustainable peace will be possible\nthrough justice, an end to discrimination, an end to the\noccupation of Palestinian land, the return of all\nPalestinian refugees and the establishment of a\ndemocratic Palestinian State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as\nits capital.\nToday, more than ever, nations need constructive,\npositive and honest cooperation and interaction in\norder to enjoy a dignified, tranquil and peaceful life\nbased on justice and spirituality. Let us enter into a\ncollective covenant to realize this legitimate aspiration\nof our nations.\nHere, I should like to talk briefly about the\napproach and initiative of the Islamic Republic of Iran\non the nuclear issue. Nuclear weapons and their\nproliferation, on the one hand, and attempts to impose\nan apartheid regime on access to peaceful nuclear\nenergy, on the other, are two major threats to\ninternational tranquillity and peace.\nKeeping in mind that in past years no serious\nefforts complemented by practical mechanisms have\nbeen made to move towards full disarmament and,\nmore specifically, to implement the decisions and\noutcomes of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) review conferences of 1995\nand 2000, I suggest that the General Assembly, as the\nmost inclusive United Nations organ, mandate an ad\nhoc committee to compile and submit a comprehensive\nreport on possible practical mechanisms and strategies\nfor complete disarmament. Such a committee should\nalso be asked to investigate how, in violation of the\nNPT, material, technology and equipment for nuclear\nweapons were transferred to the Zionist regime, and to\npropose practical measures for the establishment of a\n8\n\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. Some\npowerful States practise a discriminatory approach\nagainst access by NPT States parties to material,\nequipment, and peaceful nuclear technology. In doing\nso, they intend to impose a nuclear apartheid. We are\nconcerned that once certain powerful States completely\ncontrol nuclear energy resources and technology, they\nwill deny access to other States and thus deepen the\ndivide between powerful countries and the rest of the\ninternational community. When that happens, we shall\nbe divided into light and dark countries.\nRegrettably, in the past 30 years, no effective\nmeasure has been implemented to facilitate the\nexercise of the legally recognized right of NPT States\nparties to have access to and to use peaceful nuclear\nenergy in accordance with article IV. Therefore, the\nGeneral Assembly should ask the International Atomic\nEnergy Agency - in accordance with article II of its\nStatute - to report on violations by specific countries\nthat have hindered the implementation of the above\narticle and also to produce practical strategies for its\nrenewed implementation.\nIt is particularly important to note that the\npeaceful use of nuclear energy without possession of\nthe nuclear fuel cycle is an empty proposition.\nCountries and peoples that rely for their fuel on\ncoercive powers and stop at nothing to further their\ninterests may indeed become totally dependent on\nnuclear power plants. No popularly elected,\nresponsible Government would consider such a\nsituation to be in the interest of its people. The history\nof dependence on oil in oil-rich countries under\ndomination is an experience that no independent\ncountry would be willing to repeat.\nThose hegemonic Powers that consider the\nscientific and technological progress of independent\nand free nations to be a challenge to their monopoly on\nthose important instruments of power and which do not\nwant to see such achievements in other countries, have\nmisrepresented Iran\u00eds healthy and fully safeguarded\ntechnological endeavours in the nuclear field as a\npursuit of nuclear weapons. That is nothing but a\npropaganda ploy. The Islamic Republic of Iran is\npresenting in good faith its proposal for constructive\ninteraction and a just dialogue. However, if some try to\nimpose their will on the Iranian people by resorting to\na language of force and threats against Iran, we will\nreconsider our entire approach to the nuclear issue.\nAllow me, as the elected President of the Iranian\npeople, to outline the other main elements of my\ncountry\u00eds initiative regarding the nuclear issue.\nFirst, the Islamic Republic of Iran reaffirms its\npreviously and repeatedly stated position that, in\naccordance with our religious principles, the pursuit of\nnuclear weapons is prohibited.\nSecondly, the Islamic Republic of Iran believes\nthat it is necessary to revitalize the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and, as I\nproposed earlier, to create an ad hoc committee to\ncombat nuclear weapons and abolish the apartheid that\nexists in the field of peaceful nuclear technology.\nThirdly, the fuel cycle of the Islamic Republic of\nIran is not technically different from that of other\ncountries that have peaceful nuclear technology.\nTherefore, as a further confidence-building measure\nand in order to provide the greatest degree of\ntransparency, the Islamic Republic of Iran is prepared\nto engage in serious partnerships with the private and\npublic sectors of other countries in the implementation\nof a uranium enrichment programme in Iran. That\nrepresents the most far-reaching step - beyond all\nrequirements of the NPT - proposed by Iran as a\nfurther confidence-building measure.\nFourthly, in keeping with Iran\u00eds inalienable right\nto have access to a nuclear fuel cycle, continued\ninteraction and technical and legal cooperation with the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency will be the\ncentrepiece of our nuclear policy. The initiation and the\ncontinuation of negotiations with other countries will\nbe carried out in the context of Iran\u00eds interaction with\nthe Agency. With that in mind, I have directed the\nrelevant Iranian officials to compile the legal and\ntechnical details of Iran\u00eds nuclear approach, based on\nthe following considerations.\nFirst, international precedent tells us that nuclear\nfuel delivery contracts are unreliable, and no legally\nbinding international document or instrument exists to\nguarantee the delivery of nuclear fuel. On many\noccasions such bilateral contracts have either been\nsuspended or stopped altogether for political reasons.\nTherefore, the Islamic Republic of Iran, in its pursuit\nof peaceful nuclear technology, considers it to be\nwithin its legitimate rights to receive objective\nguarantees for uranium enrichment in the nuclear fuel\ncycle.\n9\n\nSecondly, in its negotiations with the European\nUnion three, Iran has tried in earnest to demonstrate\nthe solid and legitimate foundations of its nuclear\nactivity in the context of the NPT and to establish\nmutual trust. The selection of our negotiating partners\nand the continuation of negotiations with the European\nUnion three will be commensurate with the\nrequirements of our cooperation with the Agency\nregarding the non-diversion of the process of uranium\nenrichment to non-peaceful purposes, within the\nframework of the NPT. In that context, several\nproposals have been presented that can be considered\nin the context of the negotiations.\nThirdly, the discriminatory approach with respect\nto the NPT, focusing on the obligations of States\nparties while disregarding their rights under the Treaty,\nshould cease.\nAs the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, I\nassure the Assembly that my country will do\neverything in its power to contribute to global\ntranquillity and peace, based on the two values of\nspirituality and justice, and on the principle of equal\nrights of all peoples and nations. My country will\ninteract and cooperate constructively with the\ninternational community to face the challenges before\nus.\nFrom the beginning of time, humanity has longed\nfor the day when justice, peace, equality and\ncompassion would envelop the world. All of us can\ncontribute to the establishment of such a world. When\nthat day comes, the ultimate promise of all divine\nreligions will be fulfilled with the emergence of a\nperfect human being who is heir to all prophets and\npious men. He will lead the world to justice and\nabsolute peace.\nAlmighty Lord, I pray to you to hasten the\nappearance of your last repository - the promised one,\nthat perfect and pure human being, the one who will\nfill this world with justice and peace. O Lord, include\nus among his companions, followers and those who\nserve his cause."

        "file_text": "It is a\npleasure for me to express on behalf of my delegation\nwarm congratulations on the outstanding election, of\nthe President to lead the sixtieth regular session of the\nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations. I see the\nselection as a tribute to his excellent qualities as a\ndiplomat without equal and recognition of the tireless\ncommitment of Sweden to the noble causes of our\nOrganization. He may be sure that in the discharge of\nhis lofty mission, Senegal\u2019s support is completely\nunderstood.\nAllow me to take this opportunity to say how\nmuch we have appreciated the commitment and the\nflair that his predecessor, my friend and brother, His\nExcellency the Minister of State Jean Ping, discharged\nhis mandate at a decisive point in the existence of the\nUnited Nations. Whatever the results of the\nnegotiations under way for a just and in-depth reform\nof our Organization, our brother Jean Ping will have\ngiven the most of himself, and we all owe him\ngratitude and respect.\nI should also like here to pay tribute to the\nunfailing dedication to the causes of our Organization\ndisplayed by His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, the\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, a dedication\nthat was recently reflected in his excellent and timely\ninitiative to submit to Member States a substantial\nnumber of proposals aimed at ensuring the rebirth of\nthe United Nations and making it possible to envisage\na new dawn for multilateralism.\nThis year\u2019s general debate has been symbolic and\nstrategic in nature in that it is being held following the\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting, which mobilized all of our\nleaders and was an expression of the will of all of the\nMember States to make the necessary adjustments for a\nrevitalization of the founding values of the United\nNations and for a better consideration of the aspiration\nof all peoples.\nThis is a crucial meeting carrying as it does\nwithin it the great hopes of the disadvantaged\npopulations of the world, victims of endemic\nunderdevelopment. The major results of this summit, in\nmy view, are an expression of the faith of the\ninternational community in spirit and solidarity,\ninterdependence and international cooperation, the\nraison d\u2019\u00eatre of the United Nations, at a time when our\nsocieties are faced with an increasingly complex\ninternational environment characterized by a\nglobalization that is still not being clearly defined.\nAlthough there are signposts, the road before us\nis still long, and so great is the lag behind of many\ndeveloping countries, particularly on the African\ncontinent, in achieving the Millennium Development\n13\n\nGoals, that billions of men and women around the\nworld should be helped to free themselves from\ndifficulties and from exclusion and despair so they can\nfully enjoy the dividends of peace and security.\nThis is why my delegation strongly hopes that\nthis act of faith will be translated into tangible actions\nand into results that are palpable for all. This is\nprecisely what the Secretary-General invited us to\nconsider in highlighting in his report of last March the\nindivisibility of the three pillars of development,\nsecurity and human rights.\nTherefore, we must all act. For us, a developing\ncountry, acting means implementing strategies that will\nbe beneficial for development, supported by clear-\nsighted policies of good governance and the rule of law\nincluding all sectors of society. And for the developed\ncountries this means scrupulously honouring the\ncommitments undertaken in terms of resolving the\nquestion of debt, promoting a just and equitable trade\nand improving the volume and quality of aid\nmechanisms.\nBy the historic decisions that it is calling for, the\nagenda established by the summit confirms eloquently\nthe firmness of the commitments of heads of State and\nGovernment to focus on fighting for development,\nwhose ultimate goal is the harmonious integration of\ndeveloping countries in the globalization process.\nHowever, the heavy interdependence of the world\neconomy and the demands for peace naturally call for a\nreal global partnership, which includes a sharing of\nresponsibilities and takes into account the specific\nneeds of developing countries.\nNevertheless, the desired increase in assistance to\ndeveloping countries is not a sufficient condition for\nthem to have lasting inclusion in the globalization\nprocess. We also need to rationalize this assistance and\nto improve the delivery mechanisms. Indeed, despite\nthe recent measures of debt cancellation for certain\nAfrican countries and the Heavily Indebted Poor\nCountries Debt Initiative, the debt burden continues to\nhamper any improvement in the economies of\ndeveloping countries, which now find themselves in\nperpetual dependence on donors.\nClearly, Africa is falling further and further\nbehind the objectives of the Millennium Development\nGoals and will continue to do so if its debt burden is\nnot drastically alleviated. Since the mechanisms\nplanned for bringing the continent out of debt have not\nyet borne fruit, we should, apart from the partial\nmeasures which we should welcome, envisage bolder\nand more durable solutions.\nBased on this concern, the African ministers of\nfinance met to discuss the strategy for debt reduction in\nAfrica in May of this year in Dakar, under the aegis of\nthe African Union. This was in preparation for a\nconference during which the President of the Republic\nof Senegal, His Excellency Abdoulaye Wade, proposed\nto the African Union that it conduct an \u201cx-ray\u201d of\nAfrican debt.\nThe economic recovery of the developing\ncountries is all the more delayed in that they continue,\nhelplessly, to be buffeted by an unfair and unbalanced\nworld trade environment due to protectionist policies\nand export subsidies which distort the whole idea of\ncompetitiveness and divert trade from the objective of\ndevelopment. This contributes to making producers in\nthe poor countries more vulnerable and explains the\nhigh hopes that we place in the next World Trade\nOrganization Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong in\norder to conclude the Doha cycle for development and\ndesign a multilateral trade system that is non-\ndiscriminatory and equitable for all. We welcome the\nparticular attention being given increasingly to dealing\nwith the specific needs of Africa in the international\ndevelopment agenda.\nUnfortunately, we cannot fail to deplore the fact\nthat, paradoxically, the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s\nDevelopment (NEPAD), adopted by this Assembly,\ncontinues to suffer from a deficit in implementation\ndue partly to internal inertia and to slow multilateral\nsupport, particularly in terms of financial\ndisbursements.\nI would like here once again to make a serious\nappeal to States and to the agencies of the United\nNations system, including the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions, to make concrete their commitments to\nhelp Africa implement NEPAD \u2014 this ambitious\nprogramme of development.\nOne of the priority sectors of this programme\nremains that of information and communication\ntechnology. In this respect I should like to welcome the\ncreation \u2014 following the first phase of the World\nSummit on the Information Society \u2014 of a digital\nsolidarity fund. This Fund, a proposal of President\nWade, rapidly became an initiative of the African\nUnion and was adopted in March 2005 by the\n14\n\ninternational community in Geneva. It is aimed at\nhelping the countries of the South to bridge their\ndigital divide with the North and to promote\nsustainable development. I should like here to repeat\nSenegal\u2019s invitation to States, local groups, heads of\ncompanies and civil society to contribute in cash and in\nkind to this fund.\nThe many initiatives to be taken in the next few\nweeks and months should not let us lose sight of the\nbattle that we must wage at the worldwide, regional\nand national levels to defeat pandemics of infectious\ndiseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and\npolio, which are decimating our populations. As\nregards HIV/AIDS, the Government of Senegal, which\ndevotes more than one-tenth of its budget to health,\nwill continue through bold actions based on\ninformation, education, awareness campaigns,\nprevention and subsidies to fight pandemics tirelessly.\nHowever, the encouraging results achieved by\nseveral countries, including Senegal, which has\nmanaged to keep the prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS at\none of the lowest levels in the continent, cannot be\nconsolidated without substantial and consistent support\nfrom international partners. Allow me to remind the\nGeneral Assembly of the good news announced just a\nfew weeks ago of the prevalence rate in my country\nfalling from 1.7 per cent to 0.7 per cent.\nI would also like to invite the international\ncommunity to support Africa in its fight against\ndrepanocytosis \u2014 otherwise known as sickle cell\nanaemia \u2014 which has become a public health problem\nin several countries. This disease, apart from the\nsuffering that it inflicts on the populations, is an\nobstacle to development in that it makes sufferers\nunable to work. For that reason the Summit of Heads\nof State and Government of the African Union, held in\nSirte from 2 to 5 July, adopted a decision supporting\nthe inclusion of genetic drepanocytosis on the list of\npriorities for public health. I would thus invite the\nAssembly to join this battle against drepanocytosis.\nEqually vital is the willingness of our external\npartners to commit themselves with Africa to finding a\nsolution to the situation of its agriculture, which\ncontinues to suffer from an environment that is\nincreasingly hostile to the flourishing of design\ncapacities and to transfers of technology central to\ntheir development. This is the thrust of the initiative of\nthe Dakar Agricultural Forum, launched by President\nWade, the first meeting of which was held in February\n2005 in Dakar on the topic \u201cThe world agricultural\ndivide: opening up prospects for agricultural areas in\ndevelopment\u201d.\nThis Forum was an opportunity for a productive\nexchange of views and ideas among officials in the\nsector, representatives of professional organizations,\nnon-governmental organizations, multinational\ncompanies, scientists and academics from all\ncontinents. The Forum considered the possibilities of\npartnerships in order to reduce the agricultural divide\nbetween North and South by using science and the\ntransfer of technology, and discussed successful\nagricultural experiments submitted and presented at\nDakar by experts from several countries. By initiating\nthis project in Dakar, the Government of Senegal\nsought to stimulate thought on an original concept of\ndevelopment, taking into account the political,\ntechnical and sociological constraints peculiar to the\ncountries of the South.\nAnother challenge that has a negative impact on\nagriculture is desertification, which affects nearly one\nthird of the African continent. There was a meeting of\nexperts from more than 30 countries in Dakar from\n26 to 29 July to discuss this problem. That meeting was\nheld on the initiative of President Wade, in accordance\nwith a mandate from his African peers, to consider\ndeveloping the Sahara and its boundaries in the Sahel.\nAs President Wade said, it is a question of \u201chaving a\ngood, hard look at the Sahara\u201d and thinking about the\ncreation of a High Authority of the Sahara based on the\nAmerican model of the Tennessee Valley Authority,\nwhich was a successful example of integrated\ndevelopment.\nWe should like here to invite the international\ncommunity, which decided to proclaim 2006 as the\nInternational Year of Deserts and Desertification, to\nparticipate in this important work of constructing what\nhas been called by President Wade and his brother and\nfriend, President Olusegun Obasanjo, the \u201cGreat Green\nWall of Africa\u201d, to slow the advance of the desert. As\nPresident Wade has said, \u201cEither the desert or the\nhuman being \u2014 one will have to disappear.\u201d We hope\nthat it will be the desert.\nCertainly, the struggle to promote development\nshould go hand in hand with another fight, that for a\nworld where peace, security and the scrupulous respect\nof human rights and individual freedoms reigns. This is\n15\n\nwhy my country fully supports the important\nconclusions of the outcome document of the High-level\nPlenary Meeting, relating in particular to the\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly, the\nrestructuring of the Security Council, the creation of a\nPeacebuilding Commission and of a Human Rights\nCouncil, and also the adoption of the fundamental\nprinciple of the responsibility to protect.\nFrom this rostrum, the President of Senegal, on\nthe question of the expansion of the Security Council,\nrecently made a strong appeal that, first, the historic\ninjustice done to Africa \u2014 the only region of the world\nmissing from the group of permanent members of the\nSecurity Council \u2014 be redressed. Certainly, our\ncontinent would like at the end of the process to\nreceive two permanent seats in the Council, two thirds\nof whose agenda, unfortunately, is devoted to Africa.\nHowever, the proposal of Senegal \u2014 a country that\ndefends the spirit of compromise with other interest\ngroups \u2014 to put Africa at the beginning and at the end\nof the expansion of the Security Council, deserves the\nattention of the entire international community.\nThere is no doubt that the full implementation of\nthe conclusions of the High-level Plenary Meeting will\nmake it possible for our Organization to connect better\nto the realities of this new century. However, the fine\nprospects that have been opened up by the Meeting\nshould not make us forget the serious impact of the\npainful situations to which our world has been a\nhelpless observer for many years. I would just mention\nthree such situations: the disturbing deadlock in\nnegotiations in the area of disarmament, in particular\nnuclear disarmament; terrorism; and the bogging down\nand lack of headway in the peace process in the Middle\nEast.\nIt is not yet too late for the \u201cargument of\npower\u201d \u2014 and nuclear power, which I have just set out\nhere \u2014 to yield to the \u201cpower of argument\u201d of shared\npeace, so that weapons of mass destruction \u2014 nuclear,\nchemical or biological \u2014 can be definitively banned.\nAs regards terrorism, the recent attacks on\nLondon and on Sharm el-Sheikh are painful reminders\nof the persistence of an evil that can only be eliminated\nthrough determined and decisive mobilization by the\ninternational community. This response is all the more\ntimely since the terrorist hydra attacks the sanctity of\nlife, defies all reason and undermines the foundations\nof the rights and freedoms of the individual. It is the\nview of Senegal that, quite frankly, there is no cause\nsufficiently just or sufficiently good to justify the use\nof terrorism and the massacre of women, children and\ninnocent civilians.\nLast but not least, the Middle East continues to\nsend us daily images of a seemingly endless tragedy\nfor the Palestinian people. We note the reluctance of\nthe occupying Power, Israel, to respect the spirit and\nthe letter of the road map, which has been seen in the\nrecent settlements established in \u201cGreater Jerusalem\u201d,\naccompanied by destruction of houses belonging to\nPalestinians and the refusal to give them authorization\nto reunite their families. And we see it once again in\nthe Israeli plan to link East Jerusalem with the\nsettlement of Ma\u2019aleh Adumim in the West Bank.\nThe international community must redouble its\nefforts and vigilance to put an end to the harsh actions\nagainst the Palestinians including the construction of\nthe separation wall and the settlements, and take\nmeasures to enable both parties to work to conclude\nrapidly a mutually advantageous peace.\nIn advocating justice, it seems inconceivable that\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan, with its 23 million\ninhabitants and its impressive economic dynamism,\nshould be kept out of the United Nations.\nThus, we express the hope that, finally, peace will\nreign in all regions of the world, particularly in Africa.\nThis is why we welcome the fact that countries such as\nGuinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone, Liberia or Burundi,\ndespite conflict, are emerging from crisis and\nembarking on the path to reconciliation and\nreconstruction.\nI would like to add just one last word on Guinea-\nBissau. For us, Guinea-Bissau has met its commitments\nas regards the international community, proving its\nmaturity and its attachment and dedication to peace. It\nis thus for the international community to accompany\nthis process now under way in Bissau. To that end, the\nmeeting of donors planned for November should be\nheld without conditions and should lead to substantial\nmaterial and financial support so as to help the people\nof Guinea-Bissau continue to take charge of their\ndestiny.\nI should like to conclude on this point and pay\nwarm tribute to Mr. Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, Secretary\nGeneral of the Organization of the Islamic Conference,\nfor his restructuring efforts to make the OIC a modern\n16\n\nand effective organization more capable of strengthening\ncooperation within the Islamic Oumah and contributing\nto the fight against underdevelopment.\nIn this noble fight, my country, Senegal, remains\nmore determined than ever to work with all of its\npartners in order to bring about a fairer, more peaceful\nand more prosperous world."

        "file_text": " On behalf of the\nGovernment and the people of Nigeria, and in my\ncapacity as the current Chairman of the African Union\n(AU), I would like to extend my sincere\ncongratulations to you, Sir, and your country, Sweden,\non your election as President of the sixtieth session of\nthe General Assembly. I should also commend you for\nthe leadership you provided at the High-level Plenary\nMeeting over the past three days. The theme you have\nchosen for this year\u2019s general debate \u2014 \u201cFor a stronger\nand more effective United Nations: the follow-up and\nimplementation of the High-level Plenary Meeting in\nSeptember 2005\u201d \u2014 is indeed most appropriate and\ntimely, as it encapsulates our common desire for a\nrenewed and invigorated Organization. I assure you of\nthe full support and cooperation of the Nigerian\ndelegation. I would also like to express appreciation to\nyour predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping of the\nRepublic of Gabon, for his leadership and dedication.\nI commend the Secretary-General, His\nExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan, for his tenacity and\nleadership qualities, which sustain the role of the\nUnited Nations and underlie the current reform process\nof the United Nations system.\nYou, Sir, have assumed the presidency of the\nsixtieth session at a time when the United Nations is\nwitnessing epoch-making historic events. The session\nhas in the last three days taken the assessment and\nreview of the five-year implementation of the\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). Besides\npursuing the reform process, launched by the report of\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s High-level Panel on Threats,\nChallenges and Change, entitled \u201cA more secure world:\nour shared responsibility\u201d (A/59/565), and the\nSecretary-General\u2019s own report entitled \u201cIn larger\nfreedom\u201d (A/59/2005), the session will also mark the\ntenth year of implementation of the Declaration and\nPlatform for Action of the Fourth World Conference on\nWomen and the Declaration and Programme of Action\nof the World Summit for Social Development, held in\nBeijing and Copenhagen, respectively.\nI have no doubt, Sir, that, with your vast\nexperience in diplomacy and statecraft, you will pilot\nthe session to a successful conclusion.\nThe United Nations continues to play a pivotal\nrole in the lives of all people with its vast network of\nactivities. In this regard, Nigeria is firmly anchored in\nits belief, commitment to and support for the\nstrengthening of the United Nations and the protection\nof its ideals, in particular, the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, prevention and\nprotection of human rights and fundamental freedoms\nand promotion of international cooperation in solving\ninternational economic, social, cultural and\nhumanitarian problems. There remains so much to do\nin these areas that only a rejuvenated United Nations\ncan optimally respond to the challenges.\n11\n\nLast year, the situation in the Sudan, including\nthe Darfur region, was a cause of serious concern to\nAfrica and indeed to the international community.\nHowever, with the combined efforts of the United\nNations, the African Union and the Intergovernmental\nAuthority on Development (IGAD), we have managed\nto usher in an era of hope in that country. A\nComprehensive Peace Agreement has been signed and\nimplemented on the long-drawn north-south conflict,\nand the fifth round of inter-Sudanese peace talks on\nDarfur resumed in Abuja in June 2005 and is currently\nin progress. I take this opportunity to once again appeal\nto the parties to shed their hard-line approach to\nnegotiation and adopt a policy of give-and-take in the\ninterest of posterity.\nThe international community has demonstrated\ntremendous goodwill in facilitating the peace process\nin Darfur, and this must be sustained by the parties.\nSimilarly, it is equally important to maintain and\nsustain the current level of peace between northern and\nsouthern Sudan. In this connection, I salute the courage\nof the late Mr. John Garang in leading the southern\nSudanese people into reaching an accord with the\nGovernment of the Sudan. We regret the death of\nMr. John Garang and extend our heartfelt sympathy to\nhis family and to the Government and people of the\nSudan.\nThe situation in Somalia continues to give hope\nto the ability of the contending parties to resolve their\ndifferences in the higher interest of their beloved\ncountry. The African Union will continue to play an\nactive role in this regard, together with the IGAD and\ncountries in the region to help Somalis realize their\ndream of a united and peaceful country.\nIn the West African subregion, the African Union\nand the Economic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS) have continued to remain fully engaged\nwith efforts to find a lasting solution to the crisis in\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. In this connection, we acknowledge the\nvaluable support of the United Nations to the peace\nprocess. We appreciate the efforts deployed by\nPresident Thabo Mbeki of South Africa to mediate in\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire on behalf of the AU. In view of President\nMbeki\u2019s report of 30 August 2005 and the recent\ndeclaration that the elections scheduled for October\nmay not take place, it would be necessary for\nECOWAS, and then the AU, to revisit the situation in\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. We will do so in full consultation with\nthe Secretary-General and the Security Council of the\nUnited Nations.\nWe commend the evolving return to democracy,\nreconciliation, security and development in Togo, and\nwe appreciate the efforts of the United Nations, the\nEuropean Union (EU) and other development partners\nin this regard. The elections in Guinea-Bissau have\ncome and gone. The reconciliation process that will\nprecede the inauguration of the newly elected President\nhas begun. Both Togo and Guinea-Bissau will need\nsubstantial support to build their economies, without\nwhich their situations could deteriorate. We call on the\nUnited Nations and its institutions, along with the\nEuropean Union and other development partners, to\nhelp.\nThe AU stands resolutely by its policy of not\naccepting to include among its members any\nGovernment that emanates from outside a Constitution\nand democratic processes. That is the situation now\nwith regard to Mauritania. We are of course\nmaintaining a constructive dialogue and recommending\nan expeditious return to democracy, including national\nreconciliation and the necessary reforms and\nlegislation to move the country forward.\nWe welcome the elections in Burundi and the\nGovernment resulting from that election, which is\nbased on the newly agreed Constitution. We appreciate\nthe role played by all the friends of Burundi who\nhelped to make that happen. Like Togo and Guinea-\nBissau, Burundi will need special assistance to be able\nto consolidate its reconciliation and democracy.\nWe applaud the Secretary-General\u2019s proposal\ncontained in his recent report on the situation in Sierra\nLeone. In particular, we welcome his intention to keep\nthe security, political, humanitarian and human rights\nsituation under close review. The AU is also pleased\nabout the six-month extension of the mandate of the\nUnited Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL)\nand recognition of the need for a strong United Nations\npresence in the country after the withdrawal of\nUNAMSIL. We believe the presence of the United\nNations system will foster confidence and guarantee\nstability during the critical months following its\nwithdrawal. We call upon the international community\nto continue to extend assistance to the Government of\nSierra Leone in its efforts to develop a credible,\neffective and sustainable police force, armed forces and\n12\n\njudiciary, as well as rebuild damaged infrastructure\nnecessary to revamp economic and social activities.\nThe peace process in Liberia is in its most critical\nphase, and calls for the cooperation of all parties in the\ncountry. The AU is closely monitoring developments\nthere. We are optimistic that the elections scheduled for\nnext month will lead to a successful transition. In that\nconnection, the use of propaganda to direct attention to\nissues unrelated to the conduct of the forthcoming\npresidential elections should be avoided and resisted.\nIt is pertinent for me to repeat here what I said\nbefore on the issue of Charles Taylor, who was\nencouraged to leave Liberia in order to avoid a\nbloodbath. He was encouraged by the leaders of Africa\nat the level of the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) and the AU to voluntarily\ngive up power and leave his country, in the interests of\nLiberia, West Africa and Africa, and of world peace\nand security. He was escorted to Nigeria by President\nKuffor, who was the Chairman of ECOWAS at the\ntime, and Presidents Mbeki and Chissano, who were,\nrespectively, the outgoing and incoming Chairmen of\nthe AU. We believe that the cause of peace in Liberia\nwill be served if Charles Taylor stays away, or is kept\naway, from Liberia during the transition or early stages\nof nation-rebuilding in that country following the\nelections.\nWith regard to the Great Lakes region, we have\ntaken note of the realistic decision of the two houses of\nParliament in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to\nextend, for a period of six months, the transition period\nthat expired on 30 June 2005, in accordance with the\nprovisions of the Global and All Inclusive Agreement,\nsigned in Pretoria in December 2002, and in line with\narticle 196 of the transitional Constitution. The AU is\ndetermined to continue to work with the United\nNations to facilitate the peaceful resolution of the\nconflict. In that connection, we reiterate the AU\u2019s call\nto all parties to the conflict in the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo to respect that decision. We hope that this\nwill ensure that the elections provided for by the\nAgreement take place satisfactorily. With the\ncooperation of all parties concerned and the active\nsupport of the international community, we are hopeful\nfor an orderly return to normality and the restoration of\npeace and stability in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo.\nNigeria\u2019s commitment to nuclear non-\nproliferation has never been in doubt. We have always\nsupported the view that it should involve all States.\nDisarmament conventions merit the support of all\nStates, small or large, nuclear or non-nuclear. My\ndelegation regrets the failure of the 2005 Review\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We should not allow\nthe relative stability in our world to lure us into the\nbelief that the need for total disarmament no longer\nexists. Nor can we separate disarmament from non-\nproliferation. Through that we can achieve the goal of\nthe Charter of the United Nations of saving succeeding\ngenerations from the scourge of war and destruction.\nThe availability and wide circulation of small\narms and light weapons poses the greatest danger to\npeace and security, especially in our region. Those\nweapons have helped to prolong conflicts and to\nundermine stability, social peace and security. They\nhave also wreaked devastation on the economies of\naffected States. Nigeria therefore welcomes the\nagreement of June 2005 on an international instrument\nthat would enable States to identify and trace illicit\nsmall arms and light weapons in a timely and reliable\nmanner. However, that is only a stop-gap measure.\nWhat we need is a legally binding international\ninstrument that will regulate, control and monitor the\nillicit trade in small arms, including their transfer to\nnon-State actors. By pronouncing ourselves clearly and\npositively in that regard, Member States would send a\nmessage of their resolve not to encourage or condone\nthe diversion of those weapons to illicit networks.\nTerrorism remains a great threat to peace and\nsecurity at the local, national and international levels.\nIt is inimical to the rule of law, human rights,\ndemocracy and freedom. It impedes sustainable\ndevelopment through the destabilization of States,\nparticularly emerging democracies and nations in\ntransition. Nigeria reaffirms its conviction that\nterrorism cannot be justified under any circumstance,\nand should therefore be combated in all its forms and\nmanifestations. To that end, my country welcomes the\nadoption, on 13 April 2005, of the International\nConvention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear\nTerrorism, and commits itself to work with others to\nmobilize the political will necessary to ensure the early\nentry into force of a comprehensive convention on\nterrorism. We also welcome the Security Council\n13\n\nresolution against the incitement of terrorism and\nterrorist acts.\nAs we embark upon a review of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), the challenges of hunger,\npoverty and disease continue to override our\nconscience as well as the conscience of the\ninternational community. It was our concern regarding\nthose challenges that compelled African leaders to\ncommit themselves to the ideals of the New\nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD), whose\nprincipal objective was to encourage good governance,\ndemocracy, the rule of law, security, stability and\nmacro-economic reforms, among other things. Four\nyears on, NEPAD has made some modest progress that\nreflects our determination to make Africa work for\nAfricans in an interdependent world and towards the\nachievement of sustainable development.\nHowever, notwithstanding our efforts, poverty\nremains endemic in Africa. The dangerous correlation\nbetween grinding poverty and alienation from\ngovernment as a veritable source of political instability\non the continent leaves much to be desired. We are,\nhowever, grateful for the renewed commitment of our\ndevelopment partners to redeem their ODA pledges,\nincrease foreign direct investment, remodel trading\narchitecture and provide better and effective technical\nand structural support to our efforts. We have also\nbegun to emphasize well-managed and development-\nfocused tourism as a veritable source of wealth and job\ncreation and an effective contributor to several of the\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs).\nWe remain committed to providing the necessary\nconducive environment that will encourage investment\nand generate wealth and liberate our peoples from\npoverty. Our agricultural policies and practices are\ntailored to expansion capable of feeding our people,\nexporting some of the produce and providing raw\nmaterials for our industries.\nThe pivotal role of trade as a veritable engine for\neconomic growth cannot be overstated. Access to\nmarkets of developed countries, withdrawal of\nagricultural subsidies as well as elimination of\ndistorting tariffs are measures that should be addressed\ndecisively by our industrialized development partners\nto enhance the ability of developing countries to\nbenefit from trade. The successful completion of the\nDoha multilateral trade negotiations would be a litmus\ntest of our resolve.\nI wish to recognize the statesmanship displayed\nby members of the Paris Club, which recently granted\nAfrican countries, among others, debt cancellation and\ndebt relief. We urge the international community to\nadopt an effective, comprehensive, durable and\ndevelopment-oriented solution to the debt problem of\ndeveloping countries, which has become for them a cog\nin the wheel of development, growth and progress.\nSince 1986, the HIV/AIDS epidemic has rapidly\ngrown into a monster all over the world. In tackling the\nscourge, many African countries, including Nigeria,\nhave adopted the multisectoral response strategy\nrecommended by the United Nations.\nNigeria has followed with great interest and\nparticipated actively in the various proposals on the\nreform of our Organization, the United Nations. We\nstrongly support the proposal for the establishment of a\nPeacebuilding Commission, since this will go a long\nway in filling a yawning gap in the consolidation of\nsustainable peace and security in post-conflict\ncountries, particularly in Africa.\nWe also support the proposed Human Rights\nCouncil. However, we do not believe that the mere\nexchange of the Commission on Human Rights for the\nproposed Council would address perceived deficiencies\nin the promotion and protection of human rights and\nfundamental freedoms, unless the proposed Council\nadopts a new culture of treating all cases of violation\nwith a standard yardstick capable of attracting wide\nsupport and generating confidence.\nAs far as the proposal for the expansion of the\nSecurity Council is concerned, Nigeria has consistently\nsupported, and as a member of the African Union\nFollow-up Mechanism remains faithful to, the\nimplementation of the Ezulwini Consensus. We have\ndone so without any second thought or national\ncolourations with the sole aim of achieving the best for\nAfrica in the obligatory negotiations with other regions\nand Members of the United Nations, whose support\nAfrica must necessarily attract to achieve its\nfundamental requirement of increasing the number and\nquality of its membership on the Security Council.\nFinally, as Chairman of the African Union for the\npast year, I have had the privilege of working closely\nwith brother African heads of State or Government in\ntransforming the African Union into a truly potent and\neffective organization for the development of African\npeoples. Through our collective efforts, we have\n14\n\nbrought hope and confidence to Africa. We do not,\nunder any circumstances, intend to waver in this\nrenewed commitment of repositioning Africa for peace,\nsecurity, stability, growth, sustainable development and\nenduring democracy. I am optimistic that with the\ninvaluable cooperation of the United Nations, our\ndevelopment partners and the international community\nwith respect to the MDGs and other NEPAD initiatives,\nthe African Union will successfully pursue the noble\nobjectives enshrined in its Constitutive Act."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, please\nallow me, on behalf of the Government of the\nCommonwealth of Dominica, to extend our\ncongratulations to you on your assumption of the\npresidency at the sixtieth session of the General\nAssembly. My delegation is confident that, with your\nexperience and diplomatic skills, you will preside over\nthe Assembly with the effectiveness and the dedication\nrequired to take us through the agenda of the sixtieth\nsession. We extend to your predecessor, Mr. Jean Ping\nof Gabon, our sincere appreciation for his stewardship\nof the fifty-ninth session and for his tireless efforts to\nguide the preparation of the outcome document. Our\nwarm tribute is also due to the Secretary-General for\nhis unqualified dedication to this institution.\nAllow me at the outset to convey our deepest\nsympathies and condolences to the Government and the\npeople of the United States of America in the wake of\nthe deaths and widespread destruction caused by\nHurricane Katrina. We remain concerned about the\npotential devastation that Hurricane Rita is likely to\nunleash in coming days.\nOne week ago, world leaders gathered here at the\nhistoric High-level Plenary Meeting and demonstrated\ntheir collective political will to overcome the many\nchallenges facing the world. They charted a clear\ndirection for a future of peace and prosperity for all\nhumankind. They reaffirmed their commitment to\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals\n(MDGs), underscored the continuing relevance of the\nUnited Nations and its indispensable role in the\ncollective management of the many problems faced by\nthe global community, and provided clear\nrecommendations for the reform of the Organization.\nThe outcome document, while falling short of our\nexpectations, presents a platform for multilateral\nsolutions to the broad range of global problems related\nto development, peace and security, human rights, the\nrule of law and the reinvigoration of the United\nNations. The Commonwealth of Dominica is\ncommitted to the Millennium Development Goals and\nembraces the renewed pledge to save humanity from\nthe scourge of war, disease, famine and poverty. We\nwill work with all Member States to ensure a future\nbased on hope and prosperity instead of one of despair\nfor the poor and the marginalized of this world. We\nnow have before us the monumental task of ensuring\nimplementation and tangible outcomes.\nFulfilling that task, which our esteemed leaders\nhave accorded to us, requires the determined will of all\nMember States. It will also require a commitment to\nthe collective will and a retreat from preoccupation\nwith self-interest and narrow national agendas. If\nnothing else, the sixtieth session should go down in\nhistory as the session at which we, the Member States,\nrenewed our commitment to the ideal that inspired the\n31\n\nvisionary founders: building a peaceful and prosperous\nworld in which all peoples live together in harmony,\nfree from want and fear.\nDominica, a small island developing State,\nwelcomes the particular attention given in the outcome\ndocument to the special needs and vulnerabilities of\nsmall island developing States. It is a source of great\nencouragement to us that the Member States of the\nUnited Nations have demonstrated an appreciation of\nthe challenges that confront all small island developing\nStates.\nThe Mauritius Strategy for the Further\nImplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action\nis a realistic and attainable blueprint that underscores\nthe pivotal areas for interventions to build the capacity\nof small island developing States to confront their\nvarious sustainable development challenges. We\nappreciate the support of our friends and development\npartners and appeal for their continuing commitment to\nthe proper and effective implementation of the\nMauritius Strategy.\nProgress in the development arena will require\nstrong political will for the implementation of the\ncommitments we have undertaken and which we\nreaffirmed together in the outcome document of the\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting. These concern primarily\nthe implementation of the Millennium Development\nGoals and the revitalization of the international\npartnership for development, with the attendant\nmobilization of financial resources, as well as the\nfulfilment of the commitment made by many\ndeveloped countries to reach the target of 0.7 per cent\nof their gross national product for official development\nassistance by 2015. Dominica takes this opportunity to\nexpress its appreciation to those countries that affirmed\ntheir intention to fulfil their obligations in that regard.\nMy delegation feels strongly that the consensus\nwe reached in the High-level Plenary Meeting\nrepresents a good foundation for a greater consensus\ntowards achieving the development priorities of the\ndeveloping countries. The United Nations must play a\npivotal role in ensuring that the issues of trade, debt\nrelief, investment and industrial modernization receive\nthe highest priority if the global objective is to raise the\nstandard of living of the people of the developing\ncountries.\nWe congratulate the Group of Eight for the\ncommitment adopted at the Gleneagles Summit, giving\nmuch-needed debt relief to 18 heavily indebted poor\ncountries. However, a similar initiative is now required\nfor small island developing States and middle income\ndeveloping countries that are being strangled by heavy\ndebt burdens and the simultaneous erosion of their\npreferential trading arrangements.\nSouth-South cooperation has been growing over\nthe last two decades, and through that mechanism\nmany avenues have opened for enhanced trade\nrelations and cooperation in the transfer of know-how\nand technology. Dominica welcomes the establishment\nof the South Fund for Development and Humanitarian\nAssistance and the generous initial pledges of the\nGovernments of Qatar, India and China to this Fund.\nEqually deserving of commendation is Venezuela\u2019s\ninitiative in the Caribbean, called Petrocaribe, which\nwill help Caribbean countries to respond to the\nchallenges posed by the high price of oil.\nAid without trade cannot be a viable proposition\nfor small island States like Dominica. We are fully\ncognizant that only trade can be the engine of growth\nand development. Dominica and other banana-\nproducing States in the Caribbean have had difficulties\nresponding to the stance of multinational corporations\nfrom the United States and allied Latin American\ncountries that have challenged the preferential access\nfor our bananas in the European Union. We hope that\nreason will prevail, as we count on a fair resolution of\nthe present banana trade impasse in Europe. Only a\npositive outcome will avert a future of persistent\npoverty for banana farmers and workers in the\nCaribbean.\nLet me reiterate that small, vulnerable island\nStates like Dominica need time to adjust to the\ntransition to a fully liberalized global trading regime.\nDominica has made admirable progress towards\nrealization of the MDGs, but such gains could simply\nvanish like a thief in the night if we lose the\npreferential access to the European market for our\nbananas in 2006. For this reason we appeal to the\ninternational community to demonstrate the necessary\npolitical will to ensure that the Doha Development\nRound takes these concerns into account in the quest\nfor a fair and equitable trading system for the benefit\nof all our people.\nThe frequency of devastating storms in Asia, the\nCaribbean and the southern United States and long\nperiods of drought in Africa require a more coordinated\n32\n\nand organized international response. The United\nNations needs to significantly enhance its capacity to\nrespond in a timely manner to disasters in the more\nvulnerable developing countries. Last year many\nCaribbean countries were battered by hurricanes, and\nthe Eastern Caribbean nation of Grenada was in the\nunfortunate situation of facing the onslaught of two\nmajor hurricanes in one calendar year. Grenada still\nneeds additional assistance from the international\ncommunity, and we appeal to all Member States to lend\nsuch assistance.\nDominica has had its share of hurricane\ndevastation. Late last year we experienced devastation\nfrom a series of earthquakes which inflicted significant\ndamage on our fragile infrastructure. We continue to be\nvigilant and have put in place a national disaster\nstrategy to mitigate the adverse effects of such\ndisasters on our population. My delegation once again\nreiterates the appeal made last year in this Hall by\nPrime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit for the creation of a\nglobal insurance fund to assist countries devastated by\nnatural disasters. We call on the international\ncommunity to fully implement the Hyogo Framework\nfor Action 2005-2015, adopted at this year\u2019s World\nConference on Disaster Reduction.\nClimate change is wreaking havoc on small\nisland developing States. It is time for all Member\nStates to accept that climate change and global\nwarming are real and that they are caused by human\nactivity. All Member States must implement the\nprovisions of the Kyoto Protocol.\nMy delegation is concerned about the continuing\ninstability in Haiti. We support the role of the United\nNations Stabilization Mission in Haiti, but we\nappreciate that its limited size and resources are\ninadequate to respond to the complicated political\nsituation in which Haiti finds itself. Caribbean\nCommunity and Common Market (CARICOM) States\nhave already committed technical assistance for the\nelections and are cognizant that elections alone will not\nbring stability to Haiti. Stability will require the\naccelerated disbursement of pledged financial\nresources, more rapid implementation of social and\neconomic project activities, and peacebuilding\ninitiatives.\nTerrorism remains a great threat to peace and\nsecurity at the national, regional and international\nlevels. Dominica condemns all acts, methods and\npractices of terrorism. The recent attacks in London\nand in Egypt underscore the danger of terrorism, which\ntranscends national boundaries and does not\ndistinguish between peoples, cultures or religions.\nDominica is making a great effort to comply with the\nobligations of the various counter-terrorism\nconventions and pledges its support for the conclusion\nof the comprehensive convention on international\nterrorism.\nMy delegation regrets the failure of the outcome\ndocument to address non-proliferation and\ndisarmament in the area of weapons of mass\ndestruction. Relative stability in today\u2019s world should\nnot make us complacent and lead us to compromise on\nthe need for total disarmament. Our continuing lack of\naction on this issue has not served to enhance global\nsecurity with respect to the threat posed by these\nweapons.\nSmall arms and light weapons pose a great\nchallenge to the maintenance of peace and security in\nthe Caribbean region. Narcotics trafficking has brought\nwith it increased circulation of small arms and light\nweapons, which has led to a sharp increase in crime\nand fatal injuries. Dominica therefore welcomes the\nagreement on an international instrument that would\nenable States to identify and trace illicit small arms and\nlight weapons in a timely and reliable manner. What is\nstill needed, however, is a legally binding international\ninstrument that will regulate, control and monitor the\nillicit trade in small arms, including their transfer to\nnon-State actors.\nDominica is appreciative of the recognition\naccorded to indigenous people in the outcome\ndocument. As part of our commitment to the Second\nInternational Decade of the World\u2019s Indigenous People,\nmy delegation will work with other Member States\ntowards the submission to the General Assembly of a\ndraft declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples.\nThe future of the United Nations depends on full\nimplementation of an institutional reform agenda that\naddresses revitalization of the General Assembly,\nreform of the Security Council and improved\ngovernance in the Secretariat. General Assembly\nrevitalization must result in the strengthening of the\nAssembly\u2019s vital role as the chief deliberative,\npolicymaking and implementation-monitoring body of\nthe United Nations. The Secretariat needs to urgently\naddress eroding public confidence through timely\n33\n\nimplementation of the proposals for improvement in its\nmanagement and oversight. Reform of the Security\nCouncil must be pursued to enhance the Council\u2019s\naccountability, transparency and efficiency. Such\nreform must, at a minimum, ensure that the Council\u2019s\nmembership is more representative and remedy the\ncontinuing imbalance in the representation of Africa in\nthe permanent membership.\nWe welcome the initiative to establish a\nDemocracy Fund. Consistent with our support for the\npromotion of fundamental human freedoms and values,\nwe support the establishment of a Human Rights\nCouncil. We also support the proposed Peacebuilding\nCommission as an advisory body.\nLet me conclude by saying that we have a loaded\nagenda for the next decade, and that there are\nnumerous challenges ahead. We wish to emphasize that\nthat agenda can be realized only through multilateral\naction. As we look ahead to 2015, we have the\nhonourable duty to make the United Nations truly serve\nthe people of this global village. We have the\nobligation to ensure that we the peoples of the United\nNations can truly live our lives in larger freedom."

        "file_text": "I wish\nfirst of all to express my sincerest congratulations to\nyou, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly. I wish you success in performing\nthis historic and humanitarian mission in the best\ninterests of humanity at large. I wish also to express\nmy appreciation to Mr. Jean Ping for his efforts in the\nframework of that same mission and goals during the\nprevious session of the Assembly.\nI come from Iraq, the cradle of civilization, a\nmeeting place for a variety of nationalities, religions,\ncreeds and political ideas. I come from a rich and\n36\n\nfertile land which has throughout its honourable past\ngiven the blood of its children, such as Al-Hussein and\nsubsequently Al-Sadr, to protect freedom and human\nrights.\nThis is a unique opportunity for me to make\nheard the strong voice of Iraq. The dictatorship that\nruled Iraq in the past tried to silence that voice by\nsowing death and destruction. Mass graves testify to\nthat. Today it is the terrorists who are trying to silence\nthat voice. I have come here to deliver to the Assembly\na message from my nation, to convey the real picture\nof the new Iraq that is emerging, the power of its\ndetermination and its profound love and feelings\ntowards all other nations.\nIraq is now dealing with various new realities.\nToday \u00f3 released from the restraints of a 35-year\ndictatorship that imposed on Iraq one political,\nsecurity, media and economic option and engendered a\nreal Calvary of suffering for its people \u00f3 Iraq is\nwitnessing a different, multifaceted reality. Throughout\nthat period of great suffering and while the world stood\nidly by, all kinds of crimes and suppression were\ncommitted against Iraqis, Iraqi wealth and resources,\nthe environment, education, the justice system, culture\nand civilization.\nWith the recent successful conclusion of our\npolitical journey - in record time and in spite of all\nthe obstacles and challenges facing it - the Iraqi\npeople can justly be proud of their country and identity\ntoday. Beginning with the elections on 30 January 2005\nand the formation of the Government on 3 May, and\ndespite all the challenges faced over the past three\nmonths, a draft constitution was written and will be\npresented to the Iraqi people for a vote on 15 October.\nThat referendum will allow the Iraqi people to express\nits will and allow it to constitutionally establish the\nrule of law and to create a State in which there is\nequality for all Iraqis.\nThe constitution will allow law and order, justice\nand equality for all Iraqis. Iraqi women will be able to\nparticipate actively in political life and will have their\nrights restored, including the same right that men have\nto pass on their nationality to their children. The\nconstitution grants religious freedom, freedom of\nspeech, and the right to federal and regional autonomy.\nWe are marching resolutely towards political\nstability and economic prosperity and regaining\nsecurity and stability. While there were 61 terrorist car\nbombings in July, that number dropped to nine in\nAugust and September. Likewise, the number of\nassassinations decreased from 225 to nine in the past\ntwo months.\nOn 9 September the Iraqi military attacked\nterrorist hubs in Talafar to restore security and stability\nthere. Our forces adhered to strict rules of conduct,\ndoing their best to protect innocent civilians in that\ntown. Feeling the force of that operation, the terrorists\nfled to commit more crimes \u00f3 this time in the brave\nand heroic city of Khadimiya, where over 160 civilians\nwere killed on 14 September.\nThe Iraqi forces continue to build, to train and to\nbe equipped so that they can take control of all internal\nsecurity matters and do not have to depend on the\nmultinational forces for their security. However, even\nthough some Iraqi cities are already prepared for it, the\ntime has not come for the Iraqi forces to be completely\nindependent. When we are ready and self-sufficient, we\nwill ask the multinational forces to leave our cities.\nThe new political life in Iraq is committed to\nfreedom of the press, freedom of expression, the\nseparation of the legislative, executive, and judiciary\npowers and the reconstruction of Iraq, as well as to\nrealize the aspirations of the Iraqi people to\ndevelopment and progress. Oil production and exports\nhave increased along with the number of employment\nopportunities, income and trade exchange for Iraqis.\nMore is being accomplished in public services and in\nhealth care and ambitious projects are under way to\nreconstruct our infrastructure, especially in the areas of\nhome and road construction. Environmental bureaux\nhave now declared the Iraqi provinces to be free from\nradioactivity.\nI therefore seize this opportunity to urge creditor\nnations to help us by cancelling Iraqi debt or loans.\nThat debt was accumulated under the corrupt policies\nof the previous regime and the Iraqi people have had\nno hand in it.\nFor Iraq to recover its role in the international\ncommunity and to participate effectively in defending\ninternational peace and security and to combat the evil\nscourge of terrorism, it must be allowed to rebuild and\nto implement plans for the development, rehabilitation\nand the rebuilding of its infrastructure. I call on the\ndonor countries to meet their commitments undertaken\nat different international conferences, including in\n37\n\nMadrid, Brussels and, most recently, Jordan, to provide\nfinancial aid to Iraq.\nIraq would like to pay tribute to the constructive\nrole of the United Nations in its special efforts to help\nthe Iraqi people through the special envoy of the\nSecretary-General and the technical election assistance\nteam. While we highly appreciate those efforts, we are\nalso looking forward to having the United Nations\nreturn to Iraq and reopen its offices and agencies in\norder to support the reconstruction and development\nprocess.\nWe also call upon the international community to\nevaluate the need to adopt an international programme\nto protect and preserve the fine cultural and\narchaeological heritage and shrines of Iraq, whose\ncities are steeped in history, from Sumer and Babylon\nto the present.\nToday, Iraq is both a witness to and a victim of\nthe cruel, vicious and merciless attacks of international\nterrorists, who began their global campaign on\n11 September 2001. Alarm bells are ringing in different\ncapitals around the world \u00f3 in Spain, Britain, Turkey,\nEgypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia - as we\nhave all witnessed. Iraq was afflicted with that scourge\nunder Saddam\u00eds regime, whose policy was to rule or\ndestroy people and property with all types of lethal\nweapons. Today the Iraqi people are paying the price of\ncountering terrorism, because it is their homes that are\non the frontlines of the battle. The world must support\nIraqis in fighting the war against terrorism and the\nremnants of the Baath regime so that it can move\ntowards democracy.\nIn order to deal effectively and radically with\nterrorism, we must agree on a definition of a number of\nelements that are closely related to it, including suicide\nand the culture of terrorism, the financing of terrorism,\nadvocacy and propaganda that attempt to legitimize\nterrorism, perpetrators of terrorist acts and State\nterrorism.\nNo country is free of terrorism today. Any\ncountry can be a victim of terrorism at any time. We all\nface this common threat. It brooks no boundaries; the\ngeography of terrorism envelopes all humanity. We\nmust therefore lend a hand to those who are paying the\nprice of terrorism and to its victims. Because of the\ninterdependence of nations, what happens in one\ncountry cannot fail to have repercussions in others.\nThere is also a need to draw a distinction between\nnatural disasters and terrorist disasters caused by man.\nThe former are often uncontrollable. When they occur\nthe entire world mobilizes to provide assistance to the\naffected countries, as we witnessed in the case of last\nDecember\u00eds Asian tsunami and the recent Hurricane\nKatrina in Louisiana. But the calamities of terrorism, if\nallowed, will be as devastating as natural disasters. We\nneed to raise awareness and work together to put an\nend to terrorism and to alleviate its destructive impact.\nIn this regard, we want to express our warmest\nthanks to the people of the United States and to all the\nother peoples who have supported us. We must join\nefforts to triumph over terrorism, because those who\nwin this victory will be able to help others as well. The\nIraqi people are in the forefront of the counter-\nterrorism struggle. Why do those countries that send\nsuicide bombers not send their young people to do\nhumanitarian work to contribute to the reconstruction\nof Iraq instead of sending them to kill children, to\ndestabilize Iraq and its security? Why do they not send\nfunds to invest in Iraq, so that the common interests of\nour peoples and theirs may be achieved and so that the\nstay of the multinational forces may be shortened?\nWhy do the news agencies in these countries not relay\nthe achievements of the new Iraq and convey the real\npicture of the terrorist offensive, which targets popular\nmarkets and civilian gatherings, instead of inciting\nmedia reports that distort facts and falsify realities?\nBut prior to that, we call upon neighbouring countries\nto stand by our people and prevent terrorists from\nentering Iraq, and to commit themselves to protecting\nour common borders for the safety and well-being of\nour peoples. We seek to establish the best possible\nrelations with all countries, especially neighbouring\nones, in order to promote the best interests of all and to\nsafeguard national sovereignty and protect it from any\nforeign interference.\nI would like now to touch on the most important\npolitical problems and the need for these problems to\nbe resolved peacefully in accordance with international\nagreements and treaties. We call for a fair and just\nsolution to the political problems in the Middle East,\nand in particular the Palestinian question, so that this\nregion and all regions of the world will be free from\nweapons of mass destruction and nuclear weapons. We\nalso must affirm the legitimate right of the Palestinian\npeople to establish a sovereign State, ensuring them a\nlife of dignity lived in freedom in a climate of peace in\ntheir own territory. We must all work to spread the\n38\n\nculture of love, peace and coexistence instead of the\nculture of hatred, war, vindictiveness and terrorism.\nIraq, whose children aspire to political,\neconomic, security and developmental reconstruction,\nwants fully to assume its responsibility, both regional\nand international, to safeguard peace and security\nthroughout the region and in the world. Iraq pays\ntribute to the United Nations, which has provided the\nworld with a broad umbrella to prevent wars and\nresolve conflicts. The world today is constantly\nchanging, and this requires dynamic changes in the\nstructure, decision-making and working methods of the\nUnited Nations so it can cope with new world realities\nand meet its obligations. Iraq is undergoing difficult\ntimes, but its aspirations are just and we therefore hope\nthat you will give Iraq your support and that you will\ndisplay solidarity with Iraq, especially as we are on the\nverge of adopting our permanent constitution, a\nconstitution that can ensure independence and a life of\ndemocracy, coexistence, love and tolerance for all."

        "file_text": "I would first like to\ncongratulate Mr. Jan Eliasson upon his election to the\n10\n\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixtieth\nsession. He has an important and challenging task\nahead. In carrying out his duties, he can be assured of\nmy full support and of that of the Maltese delegation.\nI take this opportunity to express our appreciation\nto the outgoing President of the fifty-ninth session, His\nExcellency Mr. Jean Ping. The last 12 months have\ndemanded exceptional leadership and commitment\nfrom the presidency of the General Assembly. I wish to\njoin others in congratulating Mr. Ping on the firm and\nsuccessful way in which he has guided this Assembly\nin the preparations leading to the summit which was\njust concluded.\nThe summit has passed on to us significant tasks\nin the continuing endeavour to sustain and reinforce\nthe processes of multilateral cooperation. It is right that\nwe should take as the central theme of our discussions\nthe follow-up and implementation of the summit\nconclusions.\nIn the light of the discussions our leaders had last\nweek, we approach these responsibilities all the more\ninspired by the imperative for collective action. Such\naction is incumbent on the international community, as\nmuch in dealing with the short-term challenges it has to\novercome as in defining the long-term objectives\nwhich it seeks to achieve.\nAmong the most immediate and visible\nchallenges confronting us is the way in which we\nrespond to the natural disasters which at one time or\nanother engulf peoples and societies around the world.\nThe past 12 months have produced awesome evidence\nof the way in which humanity remains subject to the\nforces of nature.\nThe tsunami late last year and Hurricane Katrina\nonly a few weeks ago are only the most prominent\namong recent major catastrophes which intensify both\nour sense of vulnerability and our sense of solidarity.\nIn extending our expression of grief and sympathy to\nthe Governments and people afflicted by such\ndisasters, the Maltese people have also extended their\noffers of succour and relief.\nWhile times like these remind us that nature can\nbe unpredictable in its ferocity, they also teach us that\nit must always be treated with respect. If managed\nresponsibly, nature\u2019s resources can improve our lives\nconsiderably. However, if those resources are\nruthlessly exploited, humanity will be the ultimate\nloser.\nIt is unfortunate but true that the blind forces of\nnature are not the only cause of extensive suffering\namong fellow human beings. Political and economic\ndevelopments, over which Governments, individually\nor collectively, have at least some element of control,\nare also factors in play. Nowhere are the combination\nof natural and man-made causes more dramatic than in\nthose instances of unregulated and often tragic\nmigration flows.\nOver the last few years, Malta, like many\ncountries, has been caught in the worrisome increase of\nunregulated human trafficking across the\nMediterranean. In our case, as a small island with a\nvery high population density, the problem quickly\nassumed crisis proportions.\nMalta has a strong and longstanding commitment\nto help those who need humanitarian assistance. We\nshall stand by that. We are deeply conscious that long-\nterm action in this area needs to be premised on\nprofound respect for human dignity and strict\nadherence to the rule of law, including international\nhumanitarian law.\nHowever, the international community must not\nallow the rights of refugees and persons requiring\nhumanitarian status in accordance with international\nlaw to be undermined and prejudiced by international\ncriminal organizations specialized in human trafficking\nactivity. In our case, our ability to respond to genuine\ncases is fast becoming overwhelmed by the huge\nincrease in illegal immigrants, who are the object of an\ninternational criminal network of human traffickers.\nIllegal immigration constitutes a collapse of the\ninternational legal order and must be addressed\nunequivocally by the world community as such in\norder to ensure that the rule of international law is\nrestored in that regard. Countries of origin and transit\nneed to assume their responsibility to uphold the rule\nof law by vigorously clamping down on international\ncriminal activity in human trafficking. The United\nNations and its agencies, particularly the Office of the\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, are\ncalled on to address this issue, which, if it is not\naddressed, could prejudice the rights of genuine\nrefugees and persons qualifying for humanitarian status\nin accordance with international law.\n11\n\nAt the same time, the spirit of solidarity inspiring\naction in this area needs also to be put to use in\naddressing the roots of illegal economic migration, a\nphenomenon that is harmful not only to the individuals\nthemselves \u2014 who fall victim to callous criminal\norganizations, often paying with their lives \u2014 but also\nto the economic and social development of the\ncountries of origin.\nFor that reason, we welcome the summit\nstatement reaffirming the principle of solidarity and\nburden-sharing with regard to assisting genuine\nrefugee populations and their host communities. In that\ncontext, we look forward to the General Assembly\u2019s\nhigh-level dialogue on international migration and\ndevelopment, to take place in 2006. It will give us an\nimportant further opportunity to discuss the\nmultidimensional aspects of that problem and identify\nappropriate ways of dealing with them. Malta will take\nan active and constructive part in that dialogue.\nLast week\u2019s summit provided important new\nguidelines in many critical areas requiring collective\naction. In the area of development cooperation, there\nhas been a rededication to the objectives first defined\nin the Millennium Development Goals. Malta joins its\npartners in the European Union in strengthening its\ncommitment towards increased and more effective\ndevelopment assistance in the coming years. We have\nset ambitious goals for the successful completion by\nnext year of the World Trade Organization\u2019s Doha\nRound of multilateral trade negotiations.\nMalta\u2019s national contribution will be\ncommensurate with its possibilities and its level of\neconomic development. Nevertheless, it will take\ninspiration from our constant endeavour to strengthen\nand enlarge the areas of peace, prosperity and security\nfor all peoples of the world. We will have a renewed\nopportunity to reaffirm those commitments in\nNovember, when Malta hosts the next Commonwealth\nHeads of Government Meeting and assumes the\nchairmanship of the Commonwealth for the next two\nyears.\nPeace and prosperity must be rooted in human\ndignity. Our leaders devoted a significant part of their\ndiscussions last week to the question of human rights.\nThe summit decisions on this subject may not have\ngone as far as some of us would have wished.\nNevertheless, they were an important step towards the\nobjective of equipping the United Nations with a more\neffective institutional structure to deal with the defence\nand promotion of human rights worldwide. In the\ncurrent session of the General Assembly, we will aim\nto bring to fruition the summit\u2019s decisions in the area\nof human rights, especially the establishment of the\nHuman Rights Council.\nAnother area where questions of human dignity\nare of paramount importance relates to the principle of\nthe responsibility to protect. Our leaders have taken a\nbrave step by reconciling the different strands of that\nprinciple, which seeks to encapsulate an important\nmoral duty in the development of the law of nations.\nRespect for State sovereignty, the strict parameters on\nthe use of force and the overarching commitment to\nrespect and defend human dignity and the right to life\nowed to all individual human beings are all vital\naspects of the decisions taken by the summit in this\nregard. Further work in that area must continue to be\ninspired by the sense of solidarity which is shared by\npeople around the world and the common, worldwide\nethical responsibility to act to defend the innocent.\nEffective post-conflict peacebuilding is an\nimportant dimension in which the international\ncommunity can give practical expression to the notion\nof collective responsibility. We therefore strongly\nwelcome the agreement to establish the Peacebuilding\nCommission, which underlines and reinforces the\nUnited Nations capacity in the area of peacekeeping\nand peacebuilding. That is an area of international\ncooperation where the interface between action at the\nregional and global levels is critical. The task entrusted\nto us by the summit to finalize the modalities of the\nPeacebuilding Commission by December this year is\namong the most far-reaching responsibilities of the\ncurrent session of the General Assembly.\nAnother area where international cooperation is\nespecially important concerns the fight against\nterrorism. Notwithstanding the differences that might\nremain on the precise interpretation and scope of the\nconcept, there is a widespread commitment to resisting\nand eliminating that outrageous and horrific attack on\nthe everyday order and serenity of life in our societies\nand the right of ordinary people to a secure and\npeaceful life. On the basis of that recognition, we urge\nimmediate steps to intensify and expand concrete\nactions that respond to the immediate concerns of our\ncitizens. The elements of a counter-terrorism strategy\nannounced by the Secretary-General earlier this year\nprovide a useful pointer in the right direction.\n12\n\nWe need to take our collective action against\nterrorism further. Malta believes that no terrorist action\nis ever excusable, and our action against terrorism must\nbe unequivocal, firm and decisive at all times and in all\ninstances. However, we must deeply analyse and\nexamine the roots of the problem. In particular, we\nmust not be passive when we see situations around the\nworld where States have been unable to provide a\nsocial welfare net for their peoples and where, as a\nconsequence, the poor and the desperate conglomerate\naround extremist organizations, which may also\npractice terror while simultaneously providing welfare\nassistance to strengthen their popular base. Social\nresponsibility for the provision of welfare should be in\nthe hands of the State, which represents society in all\nits diversity. In my view, it is imperative that\ninternational development programmes should also\nhave that particular focus. The ultimate objective of the\ncurrent session of the General Assembly should\ncontinue to be progress towards the conclusion of a\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism.\nAside from agreeing on a new set of tasks and\nmeasures for reform, at last week\u2019s summit our leaders\nreaffirmed and further developed the concepts and\nprinciples that lie at the heart of the United Nations.\nThose concepts and principles will inspire the\ndeliberations of the Assembly\u2019s current session as it\nconsiders the many specific issues on its agenda.\nIssues of peace and security are a major part of\nthat agenda. They are particularly poignant today, the\nInternational Day of Peace.\nMalta welcomes the recent evolution of the\nsituation in Palestine, marked by Israel\u2019s\ndisengagement from the occupied territories in Gaza\nand parts of the West Bank. We urge the parties\nconcerned to maintain the momentum for peace that\nhas been created. We acknowledge and salute the bold\nand tough decisions taken by both the Israeli and the\nPalestinian leadership, which are making this\ndevelopment possible. We have a clear sense of the\ncomplexities and sensitivities involved for both sides\nin pursuing their respective actions.\nTogether with our partners in the European\nUnion, Malta wishes to encourage this latest\ndevelopment as a path towards the full resumption of\nthe Middle East peace process. This calls for a\ncontinuing determination by both sides not to allow\nobstacles to stand in the way of their carrying out the\nnext set of actions called for under the Quartet road\nmap: Israel\u2019s freezing of all settlement activity, and the\ncessation of all violent attacks by Palestinians against\nIsraelis everywhere.\nWe are convinced that the ultimate objective \u2014\nthe existence of two neighbouring, viable sovereign\nStates, living in peace and security, is within reach and\ncertainly worth the effort and sacrifice involved at this\nstage.\nIn the Mediterranean, regional cooperation\ncontinues to be strengthened through the Barcelona\nprocess and other initiatives for subregional\nconsultation. Within the broader framework of the\nEuropean Neighbourhood Policy, countries to the north\nand the south of the Mediterranean are working\ntogether on a wide range of actions to further peace,\nprosperity and progress in their region.\nThose actions include areas of primary interest\nfor Malta and its immediate neighbours, such as the\nmanagement of migration flows, the promotion of\nhuman rights, democratization, counter-proliferation\nand counter-terrorism efforts, the acceleration of\nincreased market integration and the objective of\nimproving the social and economic living conditions of\nall peoples in the region, especially the most\nvulnerable among them. The further economic, social\nand political integration of the Euro-Mediterranean\nregion is the primary challenge of the countries\nbelonging to it and would have beneficial\nconsequences for the international community as a\nwhole.\nMalta is particularly interested in developments\nrelating to the future enlargement of the European\nUnion. Following the entry of Bulgaria and Romania in\n2007, the next stages of that process could encompass\na number of countries in our region, such as Croatia\nand Turkey. Malta believes that the further enlargement\nof the Union would provide an impetus for positive\nreform in European countries in general and for the\ncreation of a wider European area of peace, stability,\ndemocracy and human rights dedicated to the\nprosperity of its peoples in a spirit of solidarity.\nMalta welcomes the fact that the European Union\nis increasingly acting as a promoter of peace and\ncooperation in regions beyond its immediate vicinity.\nThat is the case with regard to the framework for wider\ncooperation provided by the Strategic Partnership with\nthe Mediterranean and the Middle East.\n13\n\nThe expansion of political rights and political\nparticipation is an essential dimension of the broader\nstrategy to combat extremism in its various\nmanifestations throughout the world. Malta welcomes\nthe intensifying transatlantic engagement in this regard\nwhich, especially in the Middle East, seeks to foster\nwider participation in support of home-grown\neconomic, political and educational reform efforts for\nsocieties in the region.\nThe European Union is also cooperating\nincreasingly with the African Union in the\nimplementation of actions and decisions agreed within\nthe framework of the United Nations. We hope that that\nencouraging development will further reinforce the\nmany peacekeeping, humanitarian relief and\nreconciliation efforts under way in many parts of the\nAfrican continent.\nThe institutional set-up and functioning of the\nUnited Nations have been the subject of intense\nscrutiny in recent months. This has laid bare some of\nthe weaknesses of our Organization. At the same time,\nit has highlighted the many areas in which our\nOrganization is playing a unique and indispensable role\nin the process of multilateral cooperation. Regrettably,\ninstances of human and institutional failures have been\nbrought to light. At the same time, the much larger\nnumber of instances where the institutions are working\nwell and where individuals are acting with admirable\ncommitment and dedication have also been given\nprominence. In particular, developments in recent\nmonths have placed in a sharper focus the commitment\nand dedication of the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan,\nin carrying out his exceptionally complex and\ndemanding task.\nI would like to take this opportunity to express\nour deepest admiration and support for the Secretary-\nGeneral for the major contribution that he has been\nmaking towards effective multilateralism and respect\nfor the international rule of law.\nOur challenges have never been as global as they\nare today. Recent natural disasters have emphasized to\nall of us our vulnerability as the human race.\nGlobalization in all its aspects, including global\ncommunication, has not only brought home to us the\nimmediacy of events and information, but has also\nfurther accelerated dynamic change in all aspects \u2014\npolitical, economic and social \u2014 in all societies on\nEarth. The situation of constant flux and dynamic\nchange further increases the need for the United\nNations to be a reformed, effective focal point for the\ninternational community, one that is ready to respond\nto, and proactively work to meet, the challenges of\npeace, security and development.\nThis year, which marks the sixtieth anniversary of\nthe United Nations, it is useful for us to approach the\nexercise of reform keeping in mind the words of the\nSecretary-General in his report, \u201cIn larger freedom\u201d,\nthat\n\u201cthe principles and purposes of the United\nNations, as set out in the Charter, remain as valid\nand relevant today as they were in 1945, and that\nthe present moment is a precious opportunity to\nput them into practice\u201d.

It has fostered a partnership with\nneighbouring countries of the Gulf Cooperation\nCouncil and the San\u2019a community for development, as\nwell as its active contribution to the League of Arab\nStates.\nYemen has played a pioneering role with regard\nto political reform and the multiparty system and has\nenabled women to participate actively in the political,\neconomic and social life of the country. Yemen is in the\nprocess of preparing for direct presidential elections, as\nwell as elections for local administrative councils, in\norder to enhance democracy and promote people\u2019s\nparticipation in the administration of the country and in\nachieving decentralization by next September.\n24\n\nYemen would like to thank the international\ndevelopment agency for its support in this connection,\nas well as those States that have supported our\ndemocracy. We hope, however, that we will be\nreceiving more financial and technical support for the\nhigh electoral commission to enable it to efficiently\ncarry out its work.\nIn light of terrorist acts in a number of countries\nof the region and throughout the world, the Republic of\nYemen wishes to reaffirm its clear-cut position that\nthere is a need to have joint responsibility in our\nstruggle against terrorism. We will cooperate with all\nStates and international organizations to deal with this\ndanger and to develop ways for exchanging\ninformation, particularly with regard to the sources of\nfinancing for terrorism and the prosecution of the\nguilty parties. We firmly believe that we should\nconvene an international conference on terrorism to\narrive at a clear definition of the phenomenon, which\nwould draw a distinction between terrorism and the\nright of peoples to self-determination and to resist\nforeign occupation of their territories. We also\ncondemn all forms of terrorism against innocent and\ndefenceless civilians.\nThe expansion of poverty and diseases and the\nlack of education and health services for millions of\npeople in Africa and Asia constitutes a time bomb\nthreatening international peace and security.\nEstablishing peace and stability and putting an end to\nextremism and terrorism are goals that cannot be\nachieved unless rich States revise their economic and\npolitical policies and provide support to achieve peace\nand development. That would enable millions of\npeople to recover their dignity and humanity. In this\ncontext, the Republic of Yemen wishes to reaffirm its\nsupport for the proposal made by the King of Saudi\nArabia, Guardian of the Two Holy Sites, for the\ncreation of an international centre to fight terrorism.\nThe Republic of Yemen is of the view that the\nwithdrawal of Israeli occupation forces from the Gaza\nStrip is a first step on a long path. We reaffirm our\nbelief that this withdrawal is but a part of the road map\nthat should be considered as an integrated\ncomprehensive plan that must be implemented as a\nwhole and not dealt with selectively.\nIn this context, the international community\nshould not be deceived into believing that Israel has\nmade enormous sacrifices by withdrawing from\nterritories occupied by force, or have any sympathy for\nIsraeli settlers who were evacuated, as these\nsettlements were built on land the settlers did not own.\nIsrael should end its occupation of the West Bank,\nremove all settlements there, and demolish the\nseparation wall in accordance with the advisory\nopinion of the International Court of Justice.\nThe peace process is an indivisible whole. Real\npeace can only be achieved when all Arab rights have\nbeen recovered \u2014 first and foremost, the withdrawal of\nIsrael from all occupied territories in Palestine, the\nGolan Heights and southern Lebanon to the borders of\n4 June 1967, the creation of an independent Palestinian\nState on Palestinian national soil with its capital in\nAl-Quds Al-Sharif, and the just resolution of the\nrefugee problem in accordance with General Assembly\nresolution 194 (III) of 1949. We ask the international\nOrganization and the Quartet not to recognize nor\naccept any Israeli guarantees or promises that are\ndesigned to violate the legitimate rights of the\nPalestinian people and its sovereignty and not to\nreward Israeli occupation that seeks to impose faits\naccomplis solutions.\nWe must carefully consider the situation in Iraq\nand see what we can do to assist the Iraqi people to\nachieve its aspirations. There is no doubt that respect\nfor the unity, sovereignty and independence of Iraq,\nnon-interference in its internal affairs, respect for the\nwill of the people of Iraq and their choices in\ndetermining their future, are important tasks that this\ninternational Organization, as well as the international\ncommunity, must help and support. The same is true\nwith regard to the need for all sectors of Iraqi society\nto take part in the political process on the basis of\nconciliation and national harmony, without\njeopardizing Iraq\u2019s Arab identity, civilization and\nheritage. In this context, the people and Government of\nYemen welcome the positive and important role taken\nby the United Nations in support of the constructive\npolitical process. It is important for this international\nOrganization to play a central role in order to help\ncomplete this process and that of the reconstruction of\nIraq.\nIn the same vein, I reiterate the need to urgently\nimplement Security Council resolution 1546 (2004) in\norder to allow Iraq to recover its full sovereignty and\nto put an end to the foreign military presence in that\ncountry.\n25\n\nThe Republic of Yemen is following with\nsatisfaction the positive events that are occurring in\nSudan, which we see as the beginning of a new stage of\nnational reconciliation, peace and stability in the entire\ncountry and as the end of the longest conflict in Africa.\nWe appreciate the role played by neighbouring Arab\nand African States, as well as that by Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan, for their help in achieving\nagreement to ensure Sudan\u2019s territorial integrity, unity,\nstability and security. We hope that the international\nOrganization will redouble its efforts to make sure that\ninternational financial institutions, funds and States\nsupport the process of peace, development and\nreconstruction throughout Sudan, particularly in the\nregions that have been ravaged by war.\nWe are pleased to see progress achieved in\nSomalia. However, we warn of the possibility of\nfurther setbacks in that country. We have no choice but\nto call upon the United Nations and the international\ncommunity as a whole to provide urgently needed\nassistance to the transitional Government in Somalia to\nenable the Government to carry out its work,\nparticularly with regard to ensuring reconstruction and\nthe rule of law. The participation of United Nations\npeacekeeping forces has become more necessary now\nthan ever before. Any reluctance in providing such\nassistance to Somalia will mean that terrorism and the\nforces of violence and extremism will prevail with\nmost serious consequences to that country, to the Arab\nworld, regionally and internationally.\nWith regard to my country\u2019s position on\ndeveloping national capabilities in the area of the\npeaceful use of nuclear energy, we believe that all\nmember States of the International Atomic Energy\nAgency have the right to develop their nuclear\ncapabilities for peaceful purposes, a position that was\nadopted by the Islamic States at the meeting of foreign\nministers of the Organization of the Islamic\nConference, held in Sana\u2019a last June.\nWe further reaffirm the importance of making the\nMiddle East a zone free of nuclear weapons and\nweapons of mass destruction and that the prohibition of\nsuch weapons should apply to all States of the region,\nincluding Israel.\nIn conclusion, allow me once more to\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, and express my best\nwishes to the General Assembly, hoping that our\ncommon endeavour will be crowned with success so\nthat we can achieve peace, security and prosperity for\neveryone."

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Republic of\nSomalia I am very pleased to address this summit here\nin New York marking the sixtieth anniversary of\nUnited Nations and the fifth anniversary of the\nMillennium Summit, which agreed on a number of\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) to reduce\npoverty by 50 per cent by the year 2015. We believe\nthat the eight MDGs are desirable and lofty ones, and\nwe fully endorse them. Unfortunately, given the\ncircumstances of conflict in Somalia, we are unlikely\nto attain all of them. However, we are confident that\nsome progress will certainly be made.\nWith regard to the reform of the United Nations,\nSomalia has committed itself to the position taken by\nthe African Union (AU) at Sirte, Libya.\nI would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm\nSomalia\u00eds appreciation for, and approval of, the United\nNations 60 years of progressive work to maintain peace\nwhile concurrently achieving incremental progress\ntowards a more equitable and liveable world. The\nhistory of the United Nations involvement in Somalia\nis a good example of its invaluable role in helping the\nemerging nations of the world. Despite momentary\nsetbacks, the United Nations has taken a laudable role\nat each juncture of Somalia\u00eds history, from colonialism\nto independence and throughout our nationhood.\nNothing better demonstrates the importance of\nthe United Nations than the nurturing role it played\nduring the sad days of our 15-year-long civil war.\nWhile assisting the destitute and providing safe\nsanctuary for an exodus of Somali refugees to\nneighbouring countries and elsewhere, the United\nNations had the political will to invoke the morally\ncompelling doctrine of humanitarian intervention,\nthereby successfully reversing a calamitous famine that\ncould potentially have wiped out millions of Somalis.\nMoreover, during the two years that the Somalia\nNational Reconciliation Conference met at Nairobi,\nKenya, the United Nations played a helpful role in\nsuccessfully finding a lasting and comprehensive\nsettlement to Somalia's political crisis. The current\nTransitional Federal Government of Somalia is the\noutcome of that political settlement. Allow me to\nrestate here Somalia\u00eds indebtedness and profound\nappreciation to those who selflessly helped us during\nthe Somali National Reconciliation Conference, as well\nas to those who continue to help us in our current\npursuit of a peaceful and well-governed Somalia.\nAmong others, special gratitude goes to the African\nUnion, the Intergovernmental Authority on\nDevelopment, the League of Arab States and the\nEuropean Union, as well as to the Government of\nKenya, for patiently and generously hosting and paying\nfor our long peace process.\n25\n\nWith regard to relocating to Somalia, the nascent\nTransitional Federal Government could not just sit by\nand wait until the international community acted. It\ntherefore took the daring unilateral initiative, on\n13 June 2005, to relocate itself from Nairobi to\nSomalia with minimal help. To the dismay of most\nsceptics, the massive relocation scheme was completed\nwithout any incident. The entire Government is now on\nSomali soil. It is my judgement that we owe a status\nreport to those who earnestly wanted to witness the rise\nof Somalia from the ashes. That report will also be\nuseful to those who may continue to doubt the\neffectiveness of the Transitional Federal Government\nin extricating Somalia from its current predicament of\nchaos and lawlessness.\nThe Government has continued to tackle the\ndaunting tasks inside Somalia at a much faster pace\nthan the international community could have\nanticipated. What is significant here is that the\nTransitional Federal Government is being helped by a\nhidden hand that most observers and political analysts\nof Somalia have typically regarded as a wild card or a\ntotally incalculable factor. They have never clearly\nunderstood the importance of correctly accounting for\nthe level of popular support that the new Somali\nGovernment enjoyed upon relocating to Somalia. The\nhigh popularity of the Transitional Federal Government\nwithin Somalia turned out to be so strong that the\nGovernment owes its very survival to the admiration\nand active support it receives from the local\npopulation. That factor alone has proven to be more\ncrucial to the survival of the Transitional Federal\nGovernment than any other form of assistance.\nWith the support of its citizens, the new\nGovernment has already proceeded to consolidate the\ngains and the outcome of the reconciliation process,\nwith the aim of addressing the formidable expectations\nof the Somali people. As a result, I can confidently\nreport to the Assembly today that our efforts at\nreclaiming Somalia from its lawlessness are already\nunder way and have already produced concrete results\non the ground.\nThe Government has made phenomenal progress\nin the little more than three months since its relocation.\nProgress has been made in the recruitment and training\nof a modest security force comprised of personnel from\nall of Somalia\u00eds regions; in the extension of State\nauthority over much of Somalia; in winning the\nallegiance and support of regional leaders and the\nSomali public at large; in earning and assuming the\nmoral leadership of the nation through responsible\ngovernance and peaceful means; and in creating\noverarching political momentum that powerfully\naugurs for the sure attainment of durable peace and\ncontinuity in Somalia.\nContrary to the fears some may have had,\ntherefore, the advent of the Transitional Federal\nGovernment did not turn out to be some kind of cruel\nhoax or yet another false start for Somalia. The\nsensible actions undertaken by the new Government\ninside Somalia have already established its legitimacy\nand the kind of moral leadership it enjoys inside\nSomalia. The Government is serious and committed to\nthe basic social contract it made with its citizens,\nnamely, to guarantee peace and security to its people in\nreturn for the allegiance they have already conferred\nupon their Government.\nThere is clearly a unique chance for the\nTransitional Federal Government to restore normalcy,\nlegitimacy and lasting peace to Somalia. Regrettably,\nhowever, the situation is not tenable in the long term.\nThe challenges that are hampering the Government\u00eds\nefforts on the ground are all related to the indifference\nof the international community. We believe that the\ninternational community has a moral obligation to help\nthe new Somali Government in its quest for peace,\nstability, territorial integrity and unity in the country in\na manner consistent with the United Nations Charter.\nNow is the time when the international community\nmust assist Somalia in a strong and decisive manner by\naddressing the following three challenges.\nOne of the challenges for the new Government is\nthat most of the international community has yet to\nhonour its obligations with regard to ensuring a\npeaceful and well-governed Somalia. Even much of its\ninitial cheerful pledges to provide material and\nfinancial support to the Government have yet to reach\nus. Consequently, its actual role in our efforts on the\nground remain very confusing to us. We do not\nunderstand the new ambivalence of the international\ncommunity, which seems to have moderated its initial\nenthusiasm to offer Somalia a consolidated rapid\nassistance programme.\nIn order to address that situation, the international\ncommunity must help Somalia by providing the\nnecessary financial and political support for the rapid\nrehabilitation of infrastructures to house the new\n26\n\nGovernment, to provide for budgetary and other\nadministrative expenditures, and to tackle the security\nissues such as recruiting a national police force,\npacification programmes and the implementation of\ndemobilization, disarmament and reintegration\nprogrammes.\nAnother puzzling and more serious problem for\nthe new Government of Somalia is the United Nations\narms embargo on Somalia. The embargo directly\nundermines the Government\u00eds genuine efforts to form a\nnational security force \u00f3 to which it has an inherent\nright in order to protect the public and keep the peace\nby enforcing law and order throughout Somalia. In\naddition, it discourages friendly countries that are\nwilling to offer help to Somalia from doing so,\nespecially in the areas of security and the rule of law.\nMoreover, the embargo has delayed the formal\ndeployment of the African peace support mission in\nSomalia, whose mandate is to protect the Government\nand its premises during its capacity-building stage as\nwell as to help the Government form and train national\nsecurity forces.\nIt does not make sense to help Somalis reach a\ncomprehensive political settlement of their long\nconflict while at the same time denying them the\nability to build the institutions through which they can\novercome lawlessness in their country. With the\ncreation of the new Government and its relocation to\nSomalia, the political conditions and realities that\nprompted the United Nations to impose an arms\nembargo no longer prevail. Whose interests and\npurposes does the embargo continue to serve now that\nthere is a legitimate Government functioning in\nSomalia? In the same vein, in reflecting on the absurd\nposition of a nation or Government whose capacity to\ninstitute its own law enforcement bodies is neutralized,\none wonders what the political or moral relevance of\nkeeping Somalia handcuffed by the old embargo can\npossibly be? To address that predicament we call on\nthe Security Council to assist the efforts of the\nTransitional Federal Government to stabilize the\ncountry by reviewing the merits of the arms embargo\non Somalia and promptly lifting it.\nFinally, the disintegration of the State and the\nabsence of law and order have led to widespread\ncriminal activity by individuals and groups for\nfinancial gain, including by war profiteers and\nterrorists. Those individuals and groups believe that the\nstatus quo in Somalia favours them, and they will\ntherefore do whatever they can to resist the return of\nlaw and order to Somalia, including by renewing active\nhostilities. To address that possible scenario the United\nNations must establish punitive and targeted sanctions\nagainst those who try to spoil Somalia\u00eds chance for\nlasting peace by undermining the ongoing efforts to\npacify the country and by frustrating the effectiveness\nof the Government in upholding the primacy of the rule\nof law.\nThe cost of the prolonged Somali civil war is\nenormous in terms of its direct social, economic,\npolitical and environmental impacts. There is now\nclearly a rare chance for my country to overcome those\nnegative impacts. The performance of the Transitional\nFederal Government on the ground and the overall\npolitical environment in Somalia are very promising.\nBoth Africa and the region have been very forthcoming\nin helping Somalia. It is imperative that the rest of the\ninternational community extend its help to Somalia by\nadopting the three proposals just outlined, thereby\neffectively ending the plight of Somalia once and for\nall.\nAllow me here to make my personal appeal to the\nworld summit not to leave Somalia out in the cold in\nthis crucial period of its pacification and nation-\nbuilding. While many of the countries of the world are\nstruggling to meet their Millennium Development\nGoals, Somalia is struggling to stand on its feet. It\nwould be grave negligence on the part of the\ninternational community if it fails to fulfil its\nobligations towards Somalia in a timely and decisive\nmanner."

        "file_text": "I would like to\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the\npresidency of the current session of the General\nAssembly. May I also express our deep appreciation to\nMr. Jean Ping for so ably guiding the work of the\nGeneral Assembly during its fifty-ninth session.\nI am honoured to address the General Assembly\ntoday in my capacity as Chairman of the Group of 77\nand China. Five years ago, I was among the leaders of\nnations, rich and poor, who met here under the auspices\nof the United Nations and made a compact to rid the\nworld of the most dehumanizing conditions afflicting a\n24\n\nlarge portion of humankind. That was a solemn pledge\nmade by us to the most disadvantaged peoples of our\nworld \u2014 the poor, the hungry, the illiterate, the\nhomeless, the sick \u2014 to infants, mothers and the\nunborn, as well as to nature, which must sustain the\nexistence of the whole human race.\nThis year\u2019s Human Development Report of the\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\nreveals that one fifth of humanity survives on less than\n$1 per day, and that 2.5 billion people fail to earn $2\ndaily. The recently concluded High-level Plenary\nMeeting has revealed that we have made slight\nprogress, more so in a few regions, to meet some of the\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). But we are\nnowhere on track to achieving the promises of any of\nthe major development-oriented United Nations\nconferences or summits held since the adoption of the\nMDGs. Progress has been uneven. At the current pace,\nsome regions and countries will miss several of the\nMDGs by decades. In certain areas, such as the\nelimination of hunger, we could be centuries away.\nWe are likely to miss global targets in the areas of\ninfant and maternal mortality, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis,\nmalaria and other infectious diseases and\nenvironmental sustainability. Limited financial\nresources, debt, restricted asymmetrical trade\nopportunities and HIV/AIDS have been identified as\nmajor inhibiting factors. Beyond those constraints,\nduring the past five years many developing countries\nhave suffered devastating natural disasters, which have\ndisrupted economic growth, damaged production,\ndestroyed infrastructure and dislocated populations,\ncausing economic losses that amount to years of gross\ndomestic product (GDP). Development goals and\ntargets cannot be met within the time frames without a\nmassive addition of resources, both financial and\ntechnical. No one can remain safe and secure, or even\ncontent, while living in an oasis of wealth surrounded\nby a desert of poverty.\nNot to be forgotten is the unfulfilled agenda of\ngender equity. The empowerment of women must be a\nvital ingredient in all our social and economic\nprogrammes.\nWe agreed at Monterrey on a comprehensive\napproach to mobilize the financing needed for real\nglobal development that specified the contributions\nrequired from developing and developed countries\nalike. Our review has revealed that, as a group,\ndeveloping countries have delivered on their\ncommitments. Most have achieved a level of economic\ngrowth and have increased domestic resources and\nforeign-exchange reserves. There has been a\nstrengthened focus on South/South cooperation, which\nhas seen trade among developing countries growing\nfaster than their total export trade and an increasing\nflow of investment.\nAt the second South-South Summit, held in Qatar\nin June, we agreed on a major programme of\nSouth/South cooperation that is already having results.\nI shall cite just two examples. First, the Governments\nof Qatar, China and India pledged donations at the\nSummit to launch a South fund for development and\nhumanitarian assistance. Secondly, last week at\nMontego Bay, Jamaica, the President of the Bolivarian\nRepublic of Venezuela signed, with several Caribbean\nGovernments, the Petrocaribe Energy Cooperation\nAgreement to enhance energy security, facilitate socio-\neconomic development and advance regional economic\nintegration in the Caribbean. This is a most positive\ninitiative at a time of high and volatile energy prices\nand insecure supplies.\nFrom our partners in the developed world there\nhas been a gradual recovery of private foreign direct\ninvestment and in the provision of official development\nassistance (ODA). We welcome the increase in debt\nrelief, including debt cancellation, for many of the\nmost highly indebted poor countries, as well as the\nrenewed focus on Africa and on HIV/AIDS.\nHowever, the review has also revealed some\ntrends that are cause for anxiety, and therefore worthy\nof our attention. First, a significant part of the\nresources mobilized by developing countries has been\nused to finance debt-servicing payments to multilateral\ndevelopment banks and to increase foreign-exchange\nreserves held in developed countries. That has led to\nnet transfers to developed countries every year since\n1998. Secondly, foreign direct investment has been\nconcentrated in, and is becoming almost confined to,\nthe larger, faster-growing developing countries.\nThirdly, the increase in ODA since 2000 has largely\nbeen the result of resources targeted for emergency\nassistance, debt relief and technical assistance.\nTogether they accounted for 50 cents of every aid\ndollar in 2004. Fourthly, debt relief has been limited to\nthose highly indebted poor countries which have\nsatisfied International Monetary Fund (IMF) conditions\nfor disbursements. Fifthly, the terms of trade continue\n25\n\nto work against commodity- and preference-dependent\ndeveloping countries. And sixthly, the sudden erosion\nof trade preferences has created significant economic\nhardships for many developing countries without the\nresources or time to diversify their export base. The net\nresult is that there have been insufficient new resources\navailable to the vast majority of developing countries\nto invest in meeting long-term development goals.\nPolicy space for developing countries to act\neffectively and the timing and quality of the resource\nflows are also very important. In this regard, the Group\nof 77 and China calls for the elimination of aid\nconditionalities which restrict the policy options for\ndeveloping countries and thereby the real effectiveness\nof development cooperation.\nFurther, we stress the need to cease the use of\nunilateral coercive measures against developing\ncountries. It is wrong to apply the weight of economic\npower to pressure developing countries for political\npurposes. This causes severe hardships and jeopardizes\ndevelopment efforts, including the achievement of the\nMillennium Development Goals.\nThere are developing countries which face\npeculiar, if not unique, development challenges. The\nGroup of 77 and China has consistently argued that\nAfrica, the least developed countries, the landlocked\ndeveloping countries and the small island developing\nStates face special and tremendous challenges. These\nare magnified in a globalized, liberalized and\ncompetitive international economic environment and\nwith the increasing incidence of more devastating\nnatural disasters.\nThe arguments are gaining acceptance. There are\nnow internationally agreed programmes for the last\nthree named groups and an emerging consensus for a\nspecial programme for Africa under African\nleadership. The special programmes for these groups of\ncountries were reaffirmed at our High-level Plenary\nMeeting. We now need to implement them with\nurgency.\nWe have long recognized that export trade is the\nmost sustainable source of resources for development\nas well as the best stimulant to investment and\nemployment. The current international trading rules\nand systems are heavily stacked against developing\ncountries. We must resolve to transform international\ntrade into an engine of growth. The policies, rules and\nmodalities of global trade must have development\nfocus. Why have we failed so miserably to fulfil the\nDoha mandate for a development round? We sent only\nthe feeblest of messages from the High-level Plenary\nMeeting to our trade ministers, but unless they are\ngiven firm instructions to afford special and differential\ntreatment to developing countries, the December\nMinisterial Conference of the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO) in Hong Kong will, like those\nheld in Seattle and Cancun, yield a dismal collapse.\nWe agreed in Monterrey that it was necessary to\nreform the international economic system and make it\nmore coherent and supportive of the development\npolicies of Member States. We also agreed that it was\nnecessary to increase the voice and participation of\ndeveloping countries in the international financial and\ntrade institutions. Yet nothing has happened. We cannot\nallow the Bretton Woods institutions to remain forever\nimpervious to our calls. To attain the agreed\ndevelopment objectives, there must be a renunciation\nof the ill-conceived policies imposed on a number of\ndeveloping countries under structural adjustment\nprogrammes begun three decades ago.\nWe might dispute the causes and the sharing of\nresponsibility, but no longer do we dispute the\nawesome reality of climate change. The evidence that\nclimate change poses a long-term challenge to every\npart of the globe is irrefutable.\nDeveloping countries have maintained that\nclimate change and other unsustainable pressures on\nour environment demand urgent attention. Developed\ncountries must take the lead in changing production\nand consumption patterns: in an approach to the\ndevelopment and transfer of environmentally sound\ntechnology to developing countries on a preferential\nbasis; in their level of commitment and support to fight\nagainst desertification and land degradation; and in the\nresources to be devoted to the management of waste\nand in the change towards the promotion of a culture of\nrecycling. We must keep on pressing for the\ndevelopment and adoption of strategies that mitigate,\nand build resilience to, the impact of climate change.\nI have spoken thus far on development issues.\nBut these are closely related to other critical areas of\nthe international agenda. One such area is disarmament\nand arms control, which is in danger of becoming a\nneglected and forgotten goal of the United Nations.\nThe link between disarmament and development is\neven more relevant today. The figures are indeed\n26\n\nstartling. Roughly $1 trillion is now spent annually on\nweapons and military equipment of all kinds,\nconsuming a massive share of the world\u2019s resources. If\nsuch resources were channelled into development, the\nworld would not only be more prosperous, it would be\nmuch safer and more secure.\nOur concern is not just about nuclear weapons. It\nis also about the proliferation of guns of every\ndescription, which endangers the lives of ordinary\ncitizens, undermines the rule of law and threatens\nsocial stability. Those who manufacture such weapons\nmust exercise greater control and support anti-\nproliferation efforts.\nThe United Nations was established 60 years ago\nto bring peace and security to the world, and also to\nplay a major role in promoting development. The\nUnited Nations must not allow, as has appeared to be\nthe case in recent years, any part of its mandate to be\nusurped.\nThe Bretton Woods institutions and the General\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, now the World Trade\nOrganization, have taken dominant positions on\npolicies in areas of their specialization. These policies,\nhowever, have far-ranging implications across the\neconomic, social and environmental spectrum. There is\na glaring gap in overall international development\npolicymaking, and in the capacity to secure coherence\nacross the development, finance, trade and technology\nareas.\nWith renewed priority to development and the\nMillennium Development Goals, United Nations\nreform should empower the Organization by providing\nthe resources and a clear mandate to do at least three\nthings. First, it should ensure system-wide coherence,\nincluding with the Bretton Woods institutions and the\nWTO, in respect to the policies and operational\nactivities which impact the achievement of the agreed\ndevelopment goals. Secondly, it should bring the\nresources of the development-oriented arms of the\nUnited Nations system to focus on development\npriorities that have been identified by Member States.\nAnd, thirdly, it should promote dialogue and\npartnership, review trends, particularly in resource\nmobilization, and implement measures to ensure that\nthe Development Goals can be met within the agreed\ntime frames. These should be the responsibility of a\nrevitalized Economic and Social Council.\nThe future of generations to come rests not so\nmuch on the vigour of our debate and the declarations\nat the sixtieth session of the General Assembly, but on\nthe action we take, commencing right here in New\nYork, to make the United Nations stronger and more\neffective.\nAll our citizens are demanding that collectively\nwe emerge with a clear vision, that we display the\ncourage and unrelenting commitment to build a world\nof peace, justice and equity, which we can inhabit\ntogether in true harmony. They are convinced that it is\nwithin our power to rid the only planet where human\nlife prevails of hunger, ignorance, disease and strife.\nThey believe we can provide shelter to the homeless\nand eradicate poverty everywhere; that once we have\nthe political will and determination, we can prevent\ngenocide and combat terrorism; that irrespective of\ngender, race, colour or religious creed, we can ensure\nfor every person the inalienable right of human dignity.\nLet us spare no effort to build a single world free\nfrom want and fear, free from exploitation and\noppression: a mother Earth where justice, liberty,\nprosperity and the wisdom of creative minds prevail in\nabundance. Let us here resolve to build one world in\nwhich every man, woman and child can realize the true\npurpose of life and enjoy its fulfilment. Let us\ndetermine that the time for action is now and sound the\ntrumpet of hope for all mankind."

The General\nAssembly\u2019s task this year is as crucial as the one that\nMr. Jean Ping, your predecessor, has just completed.\nMy delegation truly appreciated the strong leadership\nof Mr. Ping during one of the most challenging periods\nfor the United Nations. My delegation\u2019s appreciation\nalso goes to the Secretary-General for his tireless\nefforts and active role.\nPermit me at the outset to express my heartfelt\ncondolences to the American people for the devastation\ncaused by Hurricane Katrina. Having suffered from the\nAsian tsunami ourselves last December, our hearts are\ntruly with the American people. In the aftermath of the\ntsunami, we were deeply touched by the outpouring of\nsupport coming to us from around the world. Our\nfriends were determined to do everything possible to\nhelp us get through our darkest days. The Thai people\nshared this spirit, and we also lent a hand to our\nneighbours suffering from the same calamity. We are\nseeing the whole world show the same spirit of shared\nresponsibility coming to the United States in the\naftermath of Hurricane Katrina. We need to move\nforward with this same spirit, this same sense of shared\nresponsibility, as we tackle the old and new challenges\nof our modern world of globalization.\nThere is certainly much to do. In many countries,\nextreme poverty, hunger, deadly infectious diseases\nand environmental degradation continue to do damage.\nThey are silent killers. We cannot and must not ignore\nthem. Every day, 50,000 people continue to perish\nfrom poverty and hunger; 30,000 children will not\nsurvive to celebrate their fifth birthday. Yet, money\nbeing spent on arms and weapons continues to outpace\nmoney being spent on sustaining lives. This is\nunacceptable.\nSixty years ago, the desire to achieve unity in\ndiversity with shared responsibility led to the creation\nof the United Nations. Now at 60, the United Nations\nis living in a world very different from that of 1945.\nToday, challenges to human security and economic\ndevelopment can be just as dangerous to the\ninternational community as traditional challenges in\n20\n\nthe form of military conflicts. The United Nations must\nbe able to act effectively to serve the world\u2019s peoples.\nThe outcome document that was adopted by the\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly\n(resolution 60/1) reflects the shared commitment of\nworld leaders to development, peace and security, as\nwell as human rights and human dignity. It sets the\nstage for the attainment of peace and prosperity\nthroughout the world.\nAs difficult as it was to reach a consensus on the\noutcome document, I believe that it will be even more\ndifficult to translate this consensus into concrete\naction. The road ahead will not be an easy one to\ntravel. We must stay focused on our common\naspirations as we face the difficulties that lie ahead.\nThailand intends to work with the United Nations\nand with all Member States to ensure that the vision of\nour leaders and the aspirations of our peoples lead to\nconcrete results. We will actively participate in\naddressing issues such as the revitalization of the\nGeneral Assembly, the strengthening of the Economic\nand Social Council, the reform of the Security Council\nand the establishment of the Human Rights Council.\nWe see merit in the idea of collective\nresponsibility to protect people from genocide, war\ncrimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.\nTo achieve lasting peace and prosperity, Thailand\nstrongly supports the establishment of the\nPeacebuilding Commission as a mechanism to ensure\nsustainable post-conflict recovery and development.\nWe also want to see extensive management reform to\nmake the Secretariat more efficient, more effective,\nand also more accountable.\nWe must redouble our efforts to break the\nvicious circle of poverty, disease and conflicts. The\nchallenge of our time is to make peace, prosperity,\ndignity and freedom common to all. As Chair of the\nHuman Security Network, we are pleased that a\nhuman-centred approach to security has been embraced\nas an integral part of the new collective security\nconsensus.\nThe eradication of poverty must not be only a\ndream. We must make it happen. The United Nations\nmust mobilize all relevant agencies and marshal\nresources to help developing countries progress in a\nsustainable way. Developing countries must be able to\nidentify and leverage their inner strengths and their\ncomparative advantages. Capacity-building and\ntechnical assistance should be readily available. With\nthe right policies and strategies as well as the\nappropriate infrastructure, developing countries can\nleapfrog up the development ladder in our modern\nworld by making full use of globalization.\nIn that connection, we in Thailand have adopted a\npeople-centred development policy which stands side\nby side with democracy and good governance. At the\ninternational level, we are actively pursuing trade and\ninvestment liberalization. This is our dual-track policy.\nNational efforts must be backed by a supportive\nglobal environment. That means making international\ntrade free and fair, so that it can be an effective engine\nfor sustainable development. When we talk about free\ntrade, we must be mindful that not everyone is equally\nfit to compete in the same system of free competition.\nTwo days ago, from this same rostrum, my Prime\nMinister emphasized that a patient who has just been\nreleased from the intensive care unit of a hospital\ncannot run a race under the same rules and conditions\nas a fit athlete. That is so true.\nThailand welcomes the reaffirmation of the\nMonterrey Consensus and other proposals on\ninnovative financing for development. Financial\nassistance given to developing countries must go\ntowards empowering the recipient countries. We must\navoid creating more dependency traps. We must work\ntogether on the basis of partnership for sustainable\ndevelopment.\nPartnership is also vital in the area of energy. The\nrapid rise in global oil prices is very harmful to\ndevelopment and has the potential to roll back many of\nthe hard-won gains of developing countries. The higher\nthe price of oil, the longer it will take for many\ndeveloping countries to realize the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals. The United Nations should help to\nmobilize worldwide cooperation to ensure energy\nsecurity as well as to develop alternative sources of\nclean energy.\nThe United Nations must also do more to\npromote synergy among Member States through the\nfacilitation of partnership building, such as North-\nSouth, South-South and trilateral cooperation. We want\nto see a new and enhanced strategic partnership for\ndevelopment between the United Nations and its\nMember States.\n21\n\nIn South-East Asia, that is the spirit that is\ntransforming the region. For its part, Thailand has been\nreaching out to forge partnerships for development\nworldwide. Through regional cooperation for\ndevelopment initiatives, such as the Ayeyawady-Chao\nPhraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy\n(ACMECS); the Bay of Bengal Initiative for\nMultisectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation\n(BIMSTEC); and the Asia Cooperation Dialogue\n(ACD), Thailand is constructing layers of building\nblocks that support the development work of the\nUnited Nations.\nWe have shown through our actions that\nassistance for development is not just a one-way road\nfrom North to South. The countries of the South can\nsignificantly help one another to prosper together\nthrough South-South cooperation. Here, we in Thailand\nhave been working closely with other developing\ncountries, sharing our experiences and best practices,\nespecially in areas in which Thailand has expertise,\nsuch as agricultural development and public health.\nMarginalization breeds resentment and anger,\nboth of which are fertile ground for extremism to\nflourish. Development helps to prevent this. Putting a\nhuman face on globalization is as vital as it is urgent.\nTogether, we can create an environment conducive to\nturning back the tide of violent extremism and\ndiscrediting the appeal of terrorism. Religious and\ncultural identities must also be recognized and\nrespected. This is unity in diversity. This is the path of\nmoderation and understanding. This is also a peaceful\nway to fight violence and terrorism. Here, we must\ncondemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,\nby whomever committed, wherever and for whatever\npurposes.\nWe have so much on our agenda. The road ahead\nwill not be an easy one. We must work together to\nensure that we can build strength from diversity, with a\nvery strong sense of shared responsibility. Let us make\nthe United Nations truly serve the people, no matter\nwho they are and no matter where they are. Let us\nensure that \u201cWe the peoples of the United Nations\u201d can\ntruly live our lives \u201cin larger freedom\u201d, as envisioned\nby our founding fathers 60 years ago."

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like to express the condolences of\nthe people of Paraguay over the tragedy caused by\nHurricane Katrina. I express my Government's\nsolidarity with the victims and with the Government of\nthe United States, and I ask God to swiftly assuage the\ngrief of so many families.\nWe are gathered here to commemorate the\nsixtieth anniversary of the United Nations. Six decades\nis time enough to reflect on the historical process of\nthis Organization and, above all, on the debate\nconcerning the relevance of reforming it. This reform\nis absolutely crucial and must be directed not only to\nset up standards that would regulate the capacity of\nPowers to make war; it is of primary importance that\nthe reform promote equitable economic development,\nbecause in a selfish world, where the number of\nsociety\u00eds orphans grows daily, it will be very difficult\nto have global peace.\nChanges cannot be partial or superficial and must\nnot merely satisfy the hegemonistic ambitions of a few.\nWe need to govern globalization with democratically\n17\n\nagreed legal norms and bodies that, through their\ninherent legitimacy, would have the authority to ensure\ncompliance with their regulations.\nIt must be a desire for world balance, not\nfinancial clout within the Organization, that should\ndetermine the direction to be followed in the United\nNations; otherwise, the power of money will prevail\nover the power of justice and the rights of peoples,\nwhich would dangerously thwart the noble mission of\nthe United Nations. This means that reform cannot\ndeepen divisions; that would be illogical. The Charter\nmust reassert the role of unity among diverse nations\nwhich, in spite of their differences, must live together\nand share their resources and values, which give\ndignity to the lives of men and women and of our\npeoples.\nDevelopment in equity and democracy is the\nformula. But to reach this stage, we need more\ninternational trade and cooperation. Lately a wall is\nrising to block our exports, while cooperation is being\nwatered down \u00f3 or the little cooperation that remains\nis undertaken unjustly or according to the mood of\nthose involved. The old promise taken on by the richest\nnations to devote 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) to less developed countries has not been\nrespected thus far, except for the honourable\nexceptions of Norway, Luxembourg, Denmark, Sweden\nand the Netherlands. But it is a hopeful sign that the\nPresident of the United States has said in this forum\n(see A/60/PV.2) that his Government is in a position to\neliminate all the subsidies that cause backwardness and\npoverty for peoples with emerging economies insofar\nas the other rich nations do likewise. That would be of\ngreat benefit to people who are experiencing shortages\ndue to the unfair international order that the President\nof the United States himself mentioned, so that our\npeoples' democracy can be stable and sustainable.\nIt is important to point out that between 1990 and\n2003 the rich countries increased their per capita\nincome by $6,070, while during the same period, their\nassistance per capita fell to one dollar; this reflects the\ngreat stinginess that prevails in the current\nglobalization model. The United Nations has a primary\nrole to play in humanizing that model.\nThe subsidies granted by rich countries to their\nagricultural sectors, as well as the assistance that they\ngive to each other, are a cruel paradox. That assistance\namounts to a little more than $1 billion annually and\nthe subsidies to a little less. That global policy - weak\nin terms of cooperation and perverse in terms of\ntrade - will end by undermining the emerging\ndemocracies in developing countries.\nWe in Paraguay are deeply convinced of those\ntenets. Our wish is to cooperate so that our noble\npurposes will govern the new world order. In our\ndomestic affairs, we have managed to reverse a long\nprocess of deterioration to achieve macroeconomic\nstability and political institutionalization. We are\nworking to increase growth and to strengthen\ndemocracy through good governance, thereby tackling\nand resolving our social problems in a way we had\nnever done in the past.\nToday my country, Paraguay, is becoming a\nnation in a predictable situation and one worthy of\ninternational trust. We are not bound by any political or\neconomic dogma. Rather, we are seeking to liberate our\npeople from crude fanaticism, from ideological\nprejudices, from political violence and from fatalism,\nbecause we believe we are capable of forging our own\ndestiny in a world of greater brotherhood.\nIndeed, Paraguay is rich in development\npotential. We have abundant natural resources: land,\nwater and energy. And, even more important, we have\na young population that is highly motivated to grow, to\nlearn and to work. Even though our economy is still\nsmall, we are adopting policies and plans to expand our\nproduction, increase employment, improve domestic\npurchasing power and increase exports. We are moving\ntowards an economy that can compete in terms of both\nquality and innovation.\nOur country is among those States that lack direct\naccess to the sea. Tragically, Paraguay is landlocked,\nwhich is a considerable obstacle to our aspiration to\nbuild an economy based on production and\ninternational trade. For that reason, we need to create\nspecial lending arrangements for landlocked\ndeveloping countries, ensuring them differential\ntreatment in areas such as lower interest rates and\nlonger grace periods. Such measures could attenuate\nthe comparative disadvantages we feel as a result of\nour geographical situations.\nAnother dimension I would like to touch on is the\nimportance of new information and communication\ntechnologies and of biotechnological and other\nscientific research. The knowledge and use of those\nresources cannot be concentrated in the hands of the\n18\n\nfew. They must be made universally available.\nParaguay believes this to be a necessary prerequisite\nfor the growth of global competitiveness.\nTwo years ago my Government inherited a\nsituation of economic stagnation, recession, sterile\npolitical antagonism, violence, growing poverty and\nweak and unreliable public institutions that led to timid\nsocial policies that were a long way from addressing\nthe Millennium Development Goals. Today we are\nrecovering political and macroeconomic stability,\ndemocratic governance and, above all, trust in the\nParaguayan State and in our business sector. We have\ngreat challenges ahead of us, but, with faith in the\ncapacity of our people, we are tackling them to build a\nmore just international order.\nThe major challenges in my country are tackling\nextreme poverty and health care, which affect the\nneediest sectors of the population: indigenous people\nand small farmers. To address those issues we have\npromoted a rapid increase in spending for social\nservices to put a stop to growing poverty. We are\nfinancing new programmes: a social protection\nnetwork for vulnerable groups, with financial subsidies\nlinked to school attendance; in the field of health care,\na nutrition programme for pregnant women and for\nboys and girls at risk for malnutrition; large-scale\nshipments of seeds for subsistence crops; the purchase\nof land for small farmers, with a view to ensuring\nsocial peace; free medical care for all children under\nthe age of five; concessional electricity rates; and a\nscholarship programme for students from the most\nvulnerable schools. With humility, but also with great\nfaith in the future and in the international community,\ndemocracy and freedom - we in Paraguay are\nbuilding a socially, fiscally and environmentally\nresponsible State.\nIn the international context, we join the appeal\nfor a more just and humane world order in which the\nless developed nations are not condemned for all time\nto discrimination, indifference and backwardness. In\norder to achieve those goals we have no alternative to\nan inclusive multilateralism that offers balance,\nrationality and justice in international relations.\nWe also condemn terrorism in all its forms. We\nbelieve that terrorism is a threat to civilized processes\nand to the imperatives of resolving conflicts and\nestablishing peaceful coexistence in the world in order\nto ensure the development and prosperity of our\npeoples.\nSimilarly, we reiterate, as we have done year after\nyear, our formal support for Taiwan\u00eds inclusion in the\nUnited Nations, so that the brotherly and supportive\nRepublic of China can have a place and become an\nintegral part of our Organization as a full-fledged\nMember, in accordance with the principle of\nuniversality and the norms of international law.\nIn addition, my country is deeply concerned by\nthe instability and high prices in international oil\nmarkets, which militate against our hard-won\nmacroeconomic stability. Our country has not escaped\nthe harmful impact of that phenomenon, given the most\nunjust burden on society: inflation. We are making\nevery effort to control inflation, because we know that\nhigh oil prices have a negative impact on economic\ngrowth and poverty reduction. Today, our Government\nis significantly subsidizing the price of oil, thus\ndepriving the State of major financial resources for\nnecessary social programmes.\nI would like to say at this meeting that Paraguay\nis suffering from a misapplication of international\njustice. There is an attempt to prohibit payments to our\nState from financial transactions carried out by\nrepresentatives of a corrupt dictatorship which, with\nthe complicity of a group of international banks, wants\nto deprive us of resources that we desperately need for\nsocial peace in our country. We hope that the\nappropriate United Nations bodies will not permit the\npeoples of developing economies to be deprived of\nmajor resources through devious legal procedures. We\nhope for justice in this area from international\ninstitutions.\nThe United Nations must either change to lead\nand to take up the challenges of our time, or it will hide\nbehind a superficial change in order to survive and will\nbecome an accomplice in the regression of our peoples\nand the perpetuation of backwardness. This is a crucial\nmoment that we are experiencing as leaders of our\ncountries, sixty years after the creation of the United\nNations and five after the Millennium Development\nGoals. We find ourselves at a crossroads with two\npaths before us: one of injustice and indifference that\nleads to a world that is increasingly poor, unfair and\ninsecure, and the other the path of far-reaching change\nthat leads to peace and global well-being.\n19\n\nI would like to express my hope that this historic\nsession of the General Assembly will obtain the\ncommitments and actions required to reduce and\neliminate the suffering, abandonment and frustration of\nthousands of millions of people and that our efforts\nwill yield its expected fruits for the well-being of\nmankind.\nI trust that God will give us the necessary wisdom\nand strength required to lead our countries along the\npath of liberty, peace, development and justice."

        "file_text": "Allow me, Sir,\nto express the pleasure of the Republic of Croatia at\nyour election to the post of President of the General\nAssembly. At this crucial moment in the history of the\nUnited Nations, we are gratified that a friend of\nmultilateralism will be guiding the work of the\nAssembly. May I also commend the work of your\npredecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, for his remarkable\nleadership and tenacity in bringing the fifty-ninth\nsession to a successful conclusion.\nI would like to extend the sincere condolences of\nthe people of Croatia to the people of the United States\nof America on the loss of life and suffering occasioned\nby Hurricane Katrina. We can take some small comfort\nfrom the fact that at such times of need nations\ninstinctively reach out to help others. This provides\nvivid illustration of the best of humanity and its\nenormous potential to do good and build a better\nworld.\nWe believe that the United Nations continues to\nbe indispensable for building a better world. All States\nbenefit from a strong United Nations. Small and\nmedium-sized States, which form the great majority of\nMembers, can articulate their diverse interests at the\nglobal level through this universal forum more\neffectively than in any other. Croatia remembers that\nthe United Nations played a prominent role in its\nre-emergence as a sovereign State.\nYet the difficulty with which agreement was\nachieved on the outcome document reflects the present\nstate of the world in which we live. We should not look\nat this imperfect document through rose-colored\neyeglasses. Rather, we should grasp the potential that it\nholds for moving towards broader and deeper reforms.\nWhile we may have broad agreement on the goal \u00f3 a\nmore efficient and effective United Nations working in\nthe service of mankind \u00f3 we have created only some\nof the contours of reform. As the Secretary-General has\nreminded us, we should not consider that the job has\nbeen done. The details remain incomplete.\nLet us move now to the details without delay. Let\nus move forward in helping developing countries\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).\nLet us operationalize the Peacebuilding Commission\nand the Human Rights Council. Let us introduce the\nprocesses required to strengthen Secretariat\nmanagement.\nDiplomacy is often about compromise. That word\nhas been used frequently in describing the World\nSummit Outcome document (resolution 60/1).\nHowever, compromise should not be used as a\nsynonym for regression. Development is a pillar of the\nUnited Nations mandate, and the MDGs are\ninternational obligations.\nOver the years, the development dialogue has\nresulted in a number of key international documents,\nwhich bear witness to the progress on poverty-related\nissues and the ways in which we have agreed to\naddress those vital challenges. Johannesburg and\nMonterrey are prominent among them.\nWhile it is important to reaffirm the agreed\ninternational development framework, it is equally\nnecessary to move forward. Comprehensive debt relief,\non which there was progress earlier this year at\nGleneagles, and better trade access to the markets of\ndeveloped countries, which must be an outcome of the\nDoha round, chart the way forward.\nThe road to the achievement of the MDGs on\nwhich we set out five years ago has been an uneven\none. There has been rapid growth in some parts of the\nglobe, resulting in the movement of millions out of\npoverty. At the same time, sub-Saharan Africa has\n15\n\nstagnated. Small island developing States have special\nvulnerabilities which threaten their very existence. The\nachievement of the MDG targets by 2015 requires\nnational and international implementation strategies.\nWe know that the current level of aid is not\nenough to achieve the MDGs. It is necessary to look at\nways to increase the effectiveness of existing aid,\nintroduce innovative sources of financing and adhere to\nthe agreed timetable for progressively increasing flows.\nIn this regard, Croatia supports the Declaration on\nInnovative Sources of Financing for Development.\nAs a country with an economy in transition and\nas a European Union (EU) candidate, Croatia is\nundergoing significant internal structural change and\nexternal policy scrutiny. We seek to balance those often\ncompeting demands by including our MDG obligations\nwithin the context of other policy implementation in\nthe transition and EU accession processes. We have\ndeveloped national development targets based on the\nMDGs, taking into account our progress to date.\nFrom its coastline, with its over 1,200 islands, to\nits Karst hinterland and the mountains and plains\nbeyond, Croatia's environment offers rare diversity in a\nrelatively small geographic area. We are vitally\ninterested in the preservation of our national\nenvironmental heritage, as well as of the whole of the\ncommon environment of mankind. For that reason, we\nwelcome the extensive treatment of environmental\nissues in the outcome document and reiterate our\nsupport for the key concept of sustainable\ndevelopment.\nAn effective multilateral system must rely upon\nthe interaction of States which are responsible\ndomestic and international actors. In recent years,\nthreats to peace and security have become very\ncommon topics of discussion in global affairs. With\ngood reason, much effort has been invested in rallying\nthe required international cooperation for the creation\nof strategies to confront old and new threats to States.\nCroatia believes that the United Nations should\ncontinue to be in the frontline of that process.\nThe fight against terrorism and transnational\norganized crime is among the greatest challenges we\nface. Last week, the Croatian President signed the\nConvention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear\nTerrorism. That Convention, which took several years\nto negotiate, is a step forward towards concluding a\ncomprehensive international convention on terrorism.\nStates must make greater efforts to ensure that it comes\nto fruition during the sixtieth session of the General\nAssembly.\nCroatia regrets that there has been no meaningful\nprogress on disarmament and non-proliferation. The\nongoing stalemate, coming, as it does, in the aftermath\nof the unsuccessful Review Conference of the Treaty\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in\nMay, is a disappointment. We support the recent efforts\nby a number of States in relation to the NPT-based\nupon the three pillars of non-proliferation,\ndisarmament and peaceful nuclear cooperation - as\nwell as the universal adoption of the comprehensive\nsafeguards agreements and additional protocols.\nCountries which have experienced conflict and\nsubsequently rebuilt their national capacities and\ninstitutions understand well the link between security\nand development. Both security and development are\nindividual pillars of the work of the United Nations.\nHowever, we know that together they are vital for\nsustainable development. Security and development are\nmutually reinforcing, providing the foundations for the\nwell-being of individuals and of the States in which\nthey live.\nCroatia took an active interest in the negotiations\non the Peacebuilding Commission. It is clear that such\nan intergovernmental body is needed to fill a void in\nthe United Nations system. While the expertise of the\nUnited Nations in peacekeeping is not in doubt, the\nchallenges of building and entrenching peace are\ndifferent. We have argued for the inclusion in the\nmembership of the Commission of countries with\nnational experience in peacebuilding. We are pleased\nthat that position was reflected in the outcome\ndocument. The inclusion of small States whose own\nexperience has spanned the transition from conflict to\nrelief and, subsequently, development, will add an\nimportant dimension which would be absent if the\nCommission were constituted solely by large, wealthy\nor powerful States.\nThe Peacebuilding Commission should assist\nStates to develop and strengthen their key governance\ninstitutions and assist local authorities in creating the\nconditions for sustainable development, including\neconomic growth. It should always ensure that the\nprocess is one which is driven by the State concerned\nand by the key stakeholders within it. If internal\n16\n\nconflicts can be quelled and prevented from recurring,\nthen we are creating the conditions for a safer world.\nWe believe that the reform of the Security\nCouncil is necessary with regard to both its\nmembership and its working methods. We look forward\nto further progress being made during the current\nsession of the General Assembly on this matter.\nClearly, any solution will require the support of as\nlarge a group of Member States as possible.\nCroatia has been a factor of stability in a\nneighbourhood where past instability has taken a heavy\ntoll, not only on the countries in the region but also on\nthe broader international community. Our enhanced\ncooperation with our neighbours is a sure basis for\nentrenching stability and ensuring preconditions for the\nexpansion of economic opportunities for South-East\nEurope as a whole. We shall continue to play that\nregional role.\nHaving successfully evolved through the\npeacebuilding spectrum, Croatia is now playing its part\nas a contributor to more than half of the United Nations\npeacekeeping operations throughout the world, and\ntraining peacekeepers from emerging troop-\ncontributing countries. We are using our national\nexperience to help others in need.\nWe are now ready to take the next step in our\nresponsibilities as a Member of the United Nations and\nas a global citizen. For that reason, the Republic of\nCroatia has presented its candidature for a\nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council in the\nelections to be held in 2007.\nThe postulates within the United Nations Charter\non human rights serve as a universal measure for all\nnations and peoples. They are at the core of the work\nof the United Nations. That is why we have supported\nthe efforts to reform and strengthen the United Nations\nhuman rights machinery. Croatia supports the decision\nto strengthen the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights and to increase the\nresources allocated to it. Existing machinery in the area\nof human rights - one of the fundamental pillars of\nthe United Nations system - requires such reforms.\nCroatia welcomes the decision to establish a\nHuman Rights Council as a new organ with the\nresponsibility for promoting universal respect for the\nprotection of human rights and addressing their\nviolation, wherever they may occur. We are\ndisappointed that the necessary political will was not\nfound to conclude an agreement on the Council in the\nlead-up to the world summit. However, we will work\nconstructively with other Member States in seeking\nconsensus so that as yet undecided elements relating to\nthat Council can be settled during the sixtieth session.\nCroatia is pleased to see the inclusion of an\nagreement on the \u00ecresponsibility to protect\u00ee in the\noutcome document. The frustration and suffering that\ncan be caused by inaction on the part of the\ninternational community, inert in the face of\naggression, has been witnessed all too frequently. We\nwelcome this positive development as a step towards a\nnew normative framework.\nDemocracy brings freedom for the individual and\ncontributes to the legitimacy of States. As a signatory\nof the Warsaw Declaration: Towards a Community of\nDemocracies, Croatia fully recognizes the importance\nof strengthening democracy and advancing its global\nacceptance as a universal value. Capacity-building can\nstrengthen States by reinforcing the institutions that\nensure the rule of law, equity, access and stable\ngovernment.\nCroatia supports the enhancement of the capacity\nof the United Nations to promote and reinforce\ndemocratic institutions and practices around the world.\nWe welcome the decision to establish a Democracy\nFund and have, as a concrete measure of our support,\nmade a financial contribution towards its\nestablishment.\nOnly an efficiently functioning United Nations\nsystem can respond to contemporary challenges. This\nrequires effective mandates for the principal organs.\nYet, there are distinctly different conceptions among\nMember States of the principle of State sovereignty.\nThese differences, as we have seen in the recent\nnegotiations, impact directly upon the prospects of\nadjusting the mandates and interrelationships of the\nprincipal organs of the United Nations to the realities\nof the twenty-first century. We all have more work\nahead of us on this account.\nCroatia supports the efforts to introduce\nsignificant human resource management reforms in the\nSecretariat. The United Nations cannot afford to have a\nSecretariat that is not managed in accordance with\ncontemporary standards and practices. For the same\nreason, we support system-wide coherence, both in\nmanagement and policy.\n17\n\nThere have been many high-minded words\nuttered on behalf of the United Nations in this Hall\nduring the past week. When we leave this place, let us\nnot forget the principles that we have invoked and the\npledges that we have made. Only this can ensure that\nwe accelerate progress towards achievement of both\nthe MDGs and United Nations reform. For its part, you\ncan be assured that the Republic of Croatia shall\ncontinue to be a constructive participant in these\nefforts."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, your election to the presidency of this\nsession of the General Assembly is indisputably an\nhistoric moment, which Gabon appreciates fully, since\nyour country has succeeded Gabon in this post. Thus, I\nshould like to congratulate you most warmly on behalf\nof my delegation and assure you of Gabon\u2019s support\nthroughout your term. I should also like to express my\ngratitude to the Secretary-General for his immense,\nbold and tireless actions in favour of the reinvigoration\nand the restoration of the prestige of the United\nNations system. Allow me also to pay well-deserved\ntribute to the President of the fifty-ninth session of the\nGeneral Assembly, His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping,\nMinister of State and Minister for Foreign Affairs,\nCooperation and Francophonie of the Republic of\nGabon, for his outstanding contribution to the reform\nof our Organization.\nThe important document adopted last Friday by\nthe High-level Meeting testifies to this reform effort. I\ntherefore welcome the fact that you have invited us to\nfocus our debate on the follow-up to the measures\nadopted by the world leaders last week.\nToday, 60 years after its creation, the United\nNations has stood the test of time. The dysfunctions\nnoted recently highlight the need to press ahead with\nessential institutional reform. In that connection, a\ncomment by Montesquieu comes to mind and I quote,\n\u201cWhen a good thing has disadvantages, it is better to\ndo away with the disadvantages than with the thing\nitself.\u201d The author of The Spirit of Laws was\nsuggesting that we need to make a distinction between\nideals and human endeavour.\nMore than an end in itself, the reform process\nmust, whenever necessary, make it possible to adapt\nthe United Nations to the demands of the times and to\nthe many complex mandates entrusted to it. In this\ncontext, we should pay particular attention to the\nGeneral Assembly. It is the most representative forum\nof the international community, a site par excellence\nfor cooperation, for negotiation and for sharing\nresponsibilities.\nThe United Nations is the seat of legitimacy and\nmoral authority at the international level and it\nparticipates in the ideal of shared destinies of nations\nand the peoples of the world. This is why Gabon\nreiterates yet again its support for initiatives aimed at a\nconsensus-based reform of the Security Council, as the\nCouncil\u2019s expansion should derive from the dual need\nfor representativity and effectiveness.\nOnce reformed, the United Nations can deal\nbetter with the many challenges facing humankind\ntoday, such as HIV/AIDS, environmental degradation,\nterrorism, armed conflicts and poverty. The HIV/AIDS\npandemic, which affects rich and poor nations alike\nwithout distinction, is a serious threat to sparsely-\npopulated countries such as Gabon. More than ever,\ndeveloping countries call upon the international\ncommunity to display effective and active solidarity in\norder to limit the worst effects of this pandemic.\nSince vaccine experiments have not yet been\nconclusive, and the therapeutic trials are still\ninsufficient, efforts must be focused on prevention and\non access to antiretroviral drugs in accordance with the\nagreement concluded within the context of the World\nTrade Organization. Gabon itself has taken solid\ninitiatives, ranging from awareness campaigns to the\nimplementation of action plans such as the\nmultisectoral strategic plan to combat AIDS, in which\nthe First Lady of Gabon, Madame Edith Lucie Bongo\nOndimba, is personally involved. We welcome the fact\nthat the final document of the High-level Meeting\nreaffirmed the commitment of the international\ncommunity to fight HIV-AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis\nand other infectious diseases.\nIt is undeniable that the global challenges are\nnumerous and interdependent. Environmental\ndegradation has become one of the main threats to life\non earth. The consequences of climate change caused\nby human activity are at the root of natural disasters\nthat are unprecedented in scale. The future of\ngenerations to come is thus compromised. It is in this\ncontext that the concept of sustainable development,\nwhich means in fact intergenerational solidarity, must\nbe made systematic, so as to underlie both public and\nprivate policies.\n27\n\nCertainly, the Stockholm conference in 1972 that\nled to the establishment of the United Nations\nEnvironment Programme, the Rio Conference on\nEnvironment and Development in 1992 and the\nJohannesburg Conference in 2002 were important\nstages in the growing awareness of the international\ncommunity. But, we can and must do better. The\nFrench proposal aimed at creating a United Nations\norganization for the environment, in addition to\nexisting mechanisms, seems to us in this respect very\ntimely. We should ensure follow-up to this idea, as\nproposed by the final document of the High-level\nMeeting. Likewise, following an integrated approach,\nwe support the actions taken by the International\nOrganization of la Francophonie to promote the\nenvironment and sustainable development. The most\nrecent Summit of Heads of State of la Francophonie,\nwhich was held in Ouagadougou from 26 to\n27 November 2004, adopted a document along these\nlines entitled \u201cA strategic ten-year framework for\nbiodiversity and the protection of the environment\nthroughout the francophone area\u201d.\nThe common heritage of the environment must be\nthe subject of more ambitious and more generous\ninternational cooperation that seeks to reduce the gap\nbetween two sets of partners that often have\ncontradictory expectations, that is, on the one hand, the\ndeveloped countries, and, on the other, the developing\ncountries.\nWhat can we say about terrorism, that tentacled\ncreature, that inscrutable threat, whose ubiquity evades\nvigilance and even punitive measures? Friendly\ncountries have recently endured tragic experiences, and\nothers, unfortunately, have them nearly every day. It\nhas to be said that on 11 September 2001 terrorism\nsounded the death knell for any feeling of safety.\nOne of the notable points of the final documents\nof the High-level Meeting of last week is the firm and\nunambiguous condemnation of terrorism in all its\nforms and manifestations. This is notable progress that\nwill, I am sure, facilitate the efforts of the international\ncommunity aimed at adopting a comprehensive\nconvention on international terrorism, a task on which\nthe sixtieth session of the General Assembly must\nfocus and to which it must devote itself.\nWishing to support the efforts of the international\ncommunity to stem this scourge, the Head of State of\nGabon has just signed the International Convention for\nthe Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. \u201cPeace\nwithin, peace with others and peace amongst others\u201d is\na tradition on which Gabon prides itself, a tradition\nthat reflects the purposes and principles of the Charter\nof the United Nations.\nAt the beginning of the third millennium, many\nAfrican countries were still in the grip of instability\nand armed conflicts. To find a way out of that impasse\nand steer towards a more stable and prosperous Africa,\nAfrican heads of State and Government set up\nmechanisms within the African Union such as the\nPeace and Security Council, which seeks to manage\npolitical crises and intra-State conflicts. The objective\nof the African States is to equip themselves with the\nmeans to ensure their own security. It is clear that\nregional mechanisms cannot manage indefinitely\nwithout bilateral agreements, multilateral cooperation\nand other relevant alliances. In this respect, allow me\nto commend the active role taken by the United\nNations in maintaining peace in Africa, particularly in\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\nand the Sudan.\nWe also note with satisfaction NATO\u2019s\nwillingness to accept the unprecedented invitation of\nthe African Union, made by the Chairman of the\nCommission, Alpha Oumar Konar\u00e9.\nAllow me also to stress here the role played by\nGabon in all of these peace processes, which have\nresulted in a gradual improvement in the security\nsituation on the continent. The President of the\nRepublic of Gabon, El Hadj Omar Bongo Ondimba,\nhas been fully involved, along with his African peers,\nin the resolution of African crises \u2014 consistently\noffering his good offices and mediation services\nwhenever requested.\nGiven the current situation in the Sudan, with the\ntragic death of the Vice-President, John Garang, the\ninternational community as a whole must ensure that\nthe ceasefire agreement signed in January 2005\nholds \u2014 a necessary condition for the consolidation of\npeace and peacebuilding. I call on the parties\nconcerned to respect their commitments in order that\nthe peace process now under way may be concluded.\nWith respect to Central Africa, we welcome the\nrelative calm seen in countries that were recently in\ncrisis, particularly in the Central African Republic,\nBurundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I\nshould like here to welcome the conclusion of the\n28\n\nelectoral process in Burundi and to express thanks for\nthe contribution made by the United Nations, the\nAfrican Union and South Africa.\nGabon, which made its own modest contribution\nto the process, humbly encourages all of the new\nleaders to display political clear-sightedness and\ntolerance, with a view to the achievement of lasting\npeace. Their decision to create a Peacebuilding\nCommission will no doubt help to enhance the United\nNations peacekeeping machinery.\nAs regards the economy, I need hardly recall that\ndebt represents a major handicap for our countries.\nIndeed, nearly a third of our financial resources are\ndevoted to debt servicing. Thus once again we would\ndraw the attention of the international community to\nthe specific situation involving the indebtedness of\nmiddle-income countries like Gabon.\nIndeed, Gabon remains the only country in sub-\nSaharan Africa classified as a high-level middle-\nincome country, thus making it ineligible for the\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt\nInitiative, despite the political and economic reforms\nunder way for more than a decade. The current surge in\nthe price of oil \u2014 our State\u2019s main budget resource \u2014\nfurther fuels the illusion of a monetary surplus and\ndoes not really help us in the area of development\nfinancing, since the oil bonus basically goes to service\nexternal debt.\nIt is true that at the Gleneagles, United Kingdom,\nsummit last July, endorsing the London Declaration of\n11 June 2005, the G-8 countries and other donors\nundertook important commitments. Gabon, for its part,\nwould like to see those commitments translated into\naction, so as to increase the likelihood of achieving the\nMillennium Development Goals, to which my country\nis particularly committed.\nI also welcome the fact that the summit\u2019s final\ndocument recognized the urgent need to redouble\nefforts to achieve development objectives agreed at the\ninternational level, including the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals.\nIn conclusion, I should like to express the hope\nthat the work of the General Assembly at its sixtieth\nsession will be crowned with success, so that together\nwe can work to bring about a community of peoples\nand nations living in peace, security and stability. May\nGod inspire our work."

        "file_text": "In 1945,\nin the aftermath of a war that tore apart all the peoples\nof the world - a war during which the most basic\nhuman rights were violated - a few leading countries\ncame together at the San Francisco Conference, here in\nthe United States of America, and created the United\nNations. Collective security had to be restored, human\nrights had to be reinstated and our world needed to\nmove towards greater justice and freedom.\nMuch has been achieved over the past 60 years.\nToday, our Organization consists of 191 Member\nStates. We hope - and many heads of State or\nGovernment expressed this wish during the recent\nsummit - that we are beginning a new phase in the\nquest for collective security and respect for human\nrights and in the fight against poverty and disease,\nwhich continue to affect so many peoples.\nTo that end, the international community must be\nbetter represented, particularly in the Security Council.\nFurther progress must also be made through the\nestablishment of the Human Rights Council, the\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals\n(MDGs) to combat poverty and the more efficient\nmanagement of the Organization.\nOnce again, on behalf of His Serene Highness\nPrince Albert II, I wish to pay tribute to the President\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session and\nto you, Sir, on your election to the presidency at the\nsixtieth session. I hope that, throughout our debates at\nthis session, the momentum for change will continue to\nbuild. I would also like to pay tribute to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who has pursued\nthose noble objectives with tenacity and farsightedness.\nThe Principality of Monaco fully endorses the\noutcome document, and will support its\nimplementation so that we can, together, achieve new\nprogress in the coming months.\nThe Government of the Principality of Monaco\nhas, over the past few years, reoriented its international\ncooperation policy in order to contribute more\neffectively to the achievement of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals. Thus, the main focus of Monaco\u00eds\ncooperation policies are those defined in the\nframework of the Millennium Development Goals: the\npreservation of the environment in the broad sense of\nthe term; the fight against poverty; and support for\neducation and health care.\nMonaco's official development assistance (ODA)\nhas continued to increase, multiplying fivefold in the\npast 10 years - an effort that will continue in the years\nto come with a view to reaching the 0.7 per cent target\nas soon as possible. Likewise, we endorse the\nDeclaration on innovative sources of financing for\ndevelopment.\nThrough its voluntary contributions to the United\nNations and several other institutions and agencies,\n34\n\nincluding the United Nations Educational, Scientific\nand Cultural Organization, the World Health\nOrganization, the Joint United Nations Programme on\nHIV/AIDS, UNICEF, the United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP) and the Office of the United\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees, to name but\na few, the Principality sponsors activities aimed at\nassisting developing countries and the most\nunderprivileged populations.\nOver one third of our cooperation funding is\nprovided within the framework of multilateral\nassistance, and the increase over the past few years\nhas, of course, also benefited bilateral assistance.\nThe General Assembly proclaimed 2005 as the\nInternational Year of Microcredit in an effort to\npromote such programmes globally. The Principality\nhas, for many years, accorded special attention to\nmicrocredit, as part of our financing for development\nprogramme, in particular through its cooperation with\nUNDP. In this regard, funds provided by Monaco\nprovide support for small businesses in Africa that are\noperating under conditions of extreme poverty, with a\nview to improving the standard of living of the most\nvulnerable people, particularly women.\nOur cooperation efforts are directed mostly\ntowards the countries of the Mediterranean region and\nthe least developed countries in Africa, especially\nthose of sub-Saharan Africa, because we also believe\nthat we need to open up spaces for regional solidarity\nthroughout the world.\nThe Mediterranean is an ecoregion with which\nthe Principality has, historically, been closely involved.\nThe implementation of cooperation plans to protect the\nMediterranean environment, both coastal and marine,\nis therefore a priority.\nMonaco also provides assistance to a number of\nFrench-speaking countries in areas relating largely to\npoverty eradication, health care and education.\nWorking in complementarity with the Government,\nMonaco\u00eds non-governmental organizations are also\ncommitted in those countries. I would like to\nunderscore that the Principality is ready to participate,\nto the best of its abilities and within its financial\nmeans, in initiatives in the areas of health care and\ntraining.\nDuring his recent address from this rostrum,\nPrince Albert II expressed great sadness in connection\nwith the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina in\nthe United States.\nAlmost one year ago, South-East Asia suffered an\nunprecedented natural disaster. The solidarity shown in\nthe aftermath of that tragedy and the effectiveness of\nthe response to it, on the part of not only humanitarian\nworkers but also civil society, make it clear that the\nresources and the capacity do exist to allow for shared\nresponsibility for the future welfare of the peoples to\nwhom the Charter is dedicated. The Principality of\nMonaco has mobilized` its efforts by undertaking a\ngreat many private and public activities in this respect.\nThe Principality of Monaco has always been a\nstaunch defender of humanitarian law. We support in\nprinciple and on the basis of our convictions any action\naimed at alleviating difficult situations resulting from\nnatural or manmade disasters.\nThe Principality of Monaco is a small State that\nenjoys a certain level of wealth. It cannot change the\nworld on its own, but it intends to set an example in the\nfield of cooperation.\nThe creation of the Human Rights Council and\nthe establishment of a Peacebuilding Commission will\nmark a turning point in the history of the Organization.\nEven more importantly, they represent a response to\ndevelopments in multilateral relations.\nIn keeping with the document just adopted, the\nGeneral Assembly will also have to strengthen the\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights;\nestablish the rule of law assistance unit within the\nSecretariat; and work constructively to ensure that the\nemerging concept of responsibility to protect becomes\npositive law as soon as possible.\nIn this regard, I would insist on the imperative\nneed to put an end to impunity for crimes committed\nagainst children.\nThe defence of the rights and interests of children\nhas always been one of our major concerns. Indeed,\nany act of violence against a child is a violation of the\nlofty principles for which the United Nations stands. In\norder to build \\\"a world fit for children\\\", in compliance\nwith the measures adopted during the special session of\nthe General Assembly on children, held in May 2002,\nthe Government of the Principality is deeply dedicated\nto promoting the concept that there should be no statute\nof limitations for the most serious violations of the\nrights of children, and that we should expand the\n35\n\npowers of national jurisdictions by providing them\nwith universal competence in that area.\nPrince Albert II, during his address to the General\nAssembly at its fifty-ninth session, invited the\ninternational community to give thought to a plan to\naddress the impunity that continues to prevail with\nregard to the most heinous crimes committed against\nchildren.\nIn that context, the Principality has stressed the\npromotion of that concept in the resolution on the\nRights of the Child, adopted last year by the General\nAssembly, and it has reaffirmed its position during the\nsession of the Human Rights Commission held last\nApril in Geneva. It is the wish of the Principality to\npursue its undertaking with the support of the\ninternational community on those crucial matters.\nIn other respects, the Monegasque Government\nhas paid close attention and contributed financially to\nthe global study on violence against children led by\nProfessor Pinheiro, which will present its conclusions\nin October 2006. Likewise, the Principality actively\nparticipated, along with the European Council, in the\ntriennial programme of action - for the period 2005-\n2007 - entitled \\\"Childhood and violence\\\", whose\nconclusions, like that of the global study on violence\nagainst children, will enable us to make specific\nrecommendations to States. The Principality of\nMonaco will always support all international initiatives\naimed at enhancing the protection of children.\nRespect for the environment is also one of our\nconcerns. Mr. President, it was in your country,\nSweden, just over three decades ago that environmental\nlaw was born. The Stockholm Conference saw the\nemergence of a discipline that met a need: to address\nthe protection of natural resources and of our\nenvironment in an organized manner.\nFurthermore, we have decided to join the Kyoto\nProtocol, and we hope, in the tradition of the\nOceanographic Institute \u00f3 created 100 years ago by\nPrince Albert I of Monaco \u00f3 to make our contribution\nto studies on the future of our planet.\nHowever, the United Nations Environment\nProgramme is no longer the ideal forum to coordinate\naction and ensure its effectiveness because of the\nextremely rapid expansion of this field and given the\nmany conventions, protocols and agreements that have\nbeen adopted. That is why we support the idea of\ncreating a United Nations environmental body.\nGlobalization must not make us forget that we\ncome from different regions and cultures that should\nenrich one another and not be a source of clashes or of\nconflicts.\nWe believe in interaction between the United\nNations and regional organizations; one sets the\ngeneral rules, and the others facilitate their\nimplementation at the local level.\nThe reforms just adopted at the High-level\nPlenary Meeting strengthen the unique position of the\nGeneral Assembly as the guarantor of the system\u00eds\ncoherence.\nI can assure the Assembly that Monaco will\ncontinue resolutely to make its contribution, however\nmodest, to building a better world, with full respect for\nour differences."

        "file_text": "At the beginning of the third millennium,\nfaster means of travel that began in the nineteenth\ncentury with railroad technology are today hurtling us\naround the globe at even faster speeds. Dramatic\nchanges are taking place at all levels and in all modes\nof communication. From the train, to the automobile\nand to the airplane, even in space travel, speed is\nerasing spatial barriers. The telegraph, the telephone,\nthe Internet, cell phones, video conferencing: speed is\naltering the way we communicate with one another.\nIn this new age, immensely significant\ndevelopments can take place as more quickly than the\nmind can follow them. But as the philosopher Paul\nVirillio warns us, with every new technology comes\nthe potential for a new accident and with increasing\nspeed comes the threat of ever more horrendous\ncatastrophes. Natural disasters have become magnified\nnot only by increases in population, but by the growing\ndangers of environmental pollution.\nSixty years after the founding of the United\nNations, we live in a faster world, where we have to be\nable to react to events almost immediately. We have to\nensure that even with the feeling of heightened risk\nthat we live with at the beginning of the twenty-first\ncentury \u2014 whether this be due to natural phenomena,\nadvances in technology, the threat of terrorism or the\nfrittering away of resources \u2014 our will to act is not in\nany way diminished. The bar is set very high, but our\ncapacity to act together as a whole can be just as great.\nAnother period of technological innovation also\naffected dramatic changes in the speed and mode of\ncommunication - the printing press. Let us reflect for\na moment about the effects of those changes and what\nwe might learn from them. The printing press fostered\na rapid exchange of information that was readily\navailable to large numbers of people and could not be\ncensored or controlled, although some institutions tried\nvery hard to enact such controls. Out of this explosion\nof information came the glory of a scientific revolution\nbut also the sixteenth-century wars of religion and\nEurope\u2019s first world war, the Thirty Years War of the\nfirst half of the seventeenth century. The promise of\neventual mastery over the natural world was coupled\nwith violent attempts to dominate the minds and souls\nof man.\nIn many ways, our own information revolution\nhas had a similar effect on developments. On the one\nhand, we have reason to hope that the problems facing\nthe world can be solved by technology; on the other\nhand, technology has contributed to the rise of\nextremism and provided the means to unleash violence\nof hitherto unknown proportions.\nThe radical enlightenment, which first began in\nthe Netherlands, a small country but one known for its\ntolerance and liberty of creative thought, offered new\nsolutions to the turmoil and sectarian violence of the\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It developed a\nmode of critique that could be separated from religious\ntruth, and, for the first time in the history of the West, a\nfully modern ethical system. What forms might a\nradical twenty-first century enlightenment take? I\nwould rather hope that we will see a new sense of\n22\n\nhuman values, a recognition that we are united not only\nby our presence in a shrinking world but as members of\nthe human race.\nWe are fully aware that even as this explosion in\ntechnology seems to link all countries in the embrace\nof a globalized media culture, it feeds old\nparochialisms, nationalism and ethnic strife. The gap\nbetween rich and poor, the have and have-not\ncountries, seems ever wider, even as our\ninterconnectedness grows in trade and in labour. But\nwith visions of first-world excess beamed into every\ncomer of the globe, can anyone be surprised that anger\ntowards the West increases? Poverty, discrimination,\nwar, hunger and disease \u2014 this is the daily lot for a\ngreat part of humanity. We see the images every day.\nWe cannot ignore nor can we fear these realities. We\nhave to face them with real development policies\ncoupled with good governance and a just system for\ntrade and dialogue. The Millennium Development\nGoals are our collective responsibility.\nThe legacy of the Renaissance nation State\nremains a powerful concept. Our love for our\nrespective countries and all that this represents to us is\na defining aspect of our identities. So how is it possible\nto overcome the fundamental paradox of this\nOrganization \u2014 to link the pride of our national\nstatehood, which is the source of our material, cultural\nand ethnic differences, to the idea of unity, of being\n\u201cunited\u201d.\nIn part, the answer seems to lie in the potential\nfor rebalancing the global economy, but it also requires\na reawakening of those dulled sensibilities that\nseparate rich from poor, the advantaged from the\ndisadvantaged, the free from the oppressed. The\nMillennium Declaration was a necessary step forward,\nand the current tensions over reform should not distract\nthis body from its ultimate mission.\nWhether we are speeding towards challenges that\nwill take the form of natural or man-made catastrophes,\nwe can be assured that their effects will no longer be\ncontained within national borders. We must prepare to\nrespond to them with a strength and resolve that also\nknows no bounds.\nBefore, I spoke of a small country, the\nNetherlands, and of its history. Andorra is also a small\ncountry that believes in tolerance and respect for our\nfellow man. Our stable relations with our neighbours,\nAndorra\u2019s tradition as a safe haven during European\nwars and conflicts, our parliamentary tradition that\nstretches back to 1419 and our geopolitical realities, all\nmake us believe in and defend the virtues and values of\ndialogue, pacifism and development, which are at one\nwith those of the United Nations.\nIn twelve years of international life, my country\nhas adopted some 130 international conventions and\nhas stated its firm belief in international law, as in the\ncreation of the International Criminal Court. We will\ncontinue in this task, reaffirming our commitment to\nmultilateralism, and by sending to Parliament for\nratification the conventions on terrorism and human\nrights. We also give our support to the creation of a\nCouncil of Human Rights, and we will follow closely\nthe progress made on a new convention in the struggle\nagainst terrorism.\nThe United Nations represents a legacy from a\nperiod of conflict which culminated in the Second\nWorld War, the Cold War, and the nuclear stalemate\nthat followed. While we recognize its imperfections,\nwe must not forget to acknowledge the wisdom of its\nguiding principles: peace between all nations, universal\nhuman rights, and the development of states.\nWe live in a time when the power of a single\nnation is fast becoming an historical illusion. Let us\nwork towards a new enlightenment, the unity of the\nUnited Nations. It is time to work together for the\nUnited Nations."

        "file_text": "It is\nmy pleasure to congratulate you upon your election as\nPresident of the General Assembly during its historic\nsixtieth session. I am fully confident that you will lead\nits deliberations towards a successful conclusion. I also\nwould like to express my appreciation for the\ncontribution of the Foreign Minister of Gabon during\nthe fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I\ncommend the efforts of the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, who has sought to make significant\nchanges to this Organization so as to make it better\nable to meet the demands of the twenty-first century, as\nenvisaged in his report and in his recommendations\nbefore this session.\nThe historical context of the creation of our\ncurrent international order, with its mechanisms and\ninstitutions, is a part of a world different from that of\ntoday. That world preceded both the cold war and\nsubsequent events, developments and changes in\nregional and international arenas. Our session this year\nis, in essence, an important moment in the progress of\ninternational collective efforts, prompting us today to\nseek a new vision and to find systems that are better\ndeveloped in both their means and structures, in order\nto address contemporary dangers and threats, as well as\nrapid world changes.\nThe world today is witnessing many changes that\nare due to the interdependence of States and to various\nfacts, balances and dangers around the world. As a\nresult, we are obliged to revisit the international\ncollective security system, to thoroughly study the\nconcepts and structures of the United Nations and to\nprovide creative initiatives to address such matters in\nthe twenty-first century spirit of modernity. His\nHighness Shaikh Salman bin Hamad bin Isa\nAl-Khalifa, the Crown Prince, underlined this issue in\nhis address on behalf of His Majesty King Hamad bin\nIsa Al-Khalifa, King of Bahrain, before the High-level\nMeeting of the General Assembly on 15 September\n2005.\nThese might be the urgent needs that prompted\nthe Secretary-General to crystallize all this in a series\nof initiatives and meetings at the beginning of the third\nmillennium, by announcing suggestions for the\nmillennium and its development goals. In his important\nreport to this session, entitled \u201cIn larger freedom\u201d\n(A/59/2005), the Secretary-General explained his\nvision in a comprehensive and in-depth manner, along\nwith the bases and aims of the work of the international\norder of our world today. Based on this order we can\nmove towards a modern, capable and democratic\nsystem to achieve the three important types of freedom,\nnamely freedom to live in dignity, freedom from want,\nand freedom from fear. This comprehensive vision of\nthe Secretary-General on issues of international\nsecurity, development and human rights deserves\ncommendation and thorough and deep analysis in order\nto reach a broad international consensus.\nThe dangerous escalation today in terrorism and\nits culture, derived from hatred and fanaticism, are the\nmost serious dangers threatening the international\ncommunity everywhere. They require us to develop an\nintegrated strategy that halts terrorism and the culture\nof death and violence that terrorism advocates. This\nalso re-emphasizes the common responsibility of States\nand societies to find a means to address the root causes\nof terrorism.\nWe must state that an effective counter-terrorism\nstrategy has to balance the needs of human security and\nadherence to international human rights instruments\nand treaties, and has to close loopholes in treaties\ndealing with the phenomenon of terrorism.\nIn this context, the Kingdom of Bahrain has\ncontinued its domestic efforts and its efforts in the Gulf\nRegion with its partner Gulf Cooperation Council\ncountries to fight money-laundering and the financing\nof terrorism in the Middle East and North Africa\ngeographically, and on the security cooperation level,\npolitically and practically. In this regard, the Kingdom\nof Bahrain endorses and supports the proposal of the\nCustodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdulla\nBin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, King of the brotherly\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia, to establish an international\ncentre to fight terrorism. The Kingdom of Bahrain has\n16\n\nalso submitted its instruments of accession to the\nUnited Nations Secretariat in New York for many\nconventions relating to the fight against terrorism, in\naccordance with Security Council resolution 1373\n(2001).\nThe greatest security challenge in the Middle East\nis not simply to end terrorism and violence; it also\nincludes the absence of a just and comprehensive peace\nin the Arab-Israeli conflict, which is an ongoing source\nof confrontation and a threat to stability and which\nbrings despair to those who have legitimate hopes for a\nlife of dignity and regional economic progress.\nWe must not forget that the year 2005 has opened\na path that might lead to an opportunity for peace,\nthrough the positive internal developments on the\nPalestinian side and through Arab and international\nsupport for the new leadership of President Mahmood\nAbbas and his moves towards achieving peace,\nreducing tension, and promoting democracy.\nWe welcome the Israeli withdrawal from the\nGaza Strip and hope that this withdrawal will be a\nsignificant step towards a just and comprehensive\npeace in the area. We also hope that this withdrawal\nwill be a part of the road map plan.\nThe achievement of security, stability and peace\nin the Middle East requires an end to the Israeli\noccupation of all Arab territories and the full\nimplementation of all relevant United Nations\nresolutions, as reaffirmed by the Arab initiative\nadopted by the Arab Summit in Beirut in 2002. That\nwas reaffirmed once again by the latest Arab Summit\nheld this year in Algiers. A just and comprehensive\npeace cannot be achieved, except through the end of\nthe Israeli occupation of the Arab territories occupied\nsince 1967, including the Syrian Golan and the rest of\nthe Lebanese territories, through the return of\nPalestinian refugees and through the establishment of\nthe Palestinian State, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its\ncapital.\nNotwithstanding the democratic choice of the\nIraqi people in the elections last January and the\nappointment of a transitional Government and in spite\nof the steps taken during the political process and the\npreparation of the draft constitution, the situation in\nIraq today remains very delicate and sensitive. It\nrepresents a challenge to international and regional\nsecurity. It threatens not only the security of Iraq and\nthe region, but also Iraq\u2019s unity, its territorial integrity,\ncohesion and the consensus of its people.\nOvercoming this dilemma can be achieved only\nthrough a strong historical national consensus on Iraq\u2019s\nterritorial integrity and ethnic diversity, a\ncomprehensive political process and participation in\nshaping the future of Iraq. This national consensus\nalone is the guarantee for Iraq to overcome its current\npredicament and to move from this difficult ordeal to\nan era of stability, security and peace.\nIn this context, the Kingdom of Bahrain reaffirms\nits support for the Iraqi people and calls upon all to\ncontinue regional and international support for Iraq in\norder that it may fulfil its responsibilities towards its\npeople and the Arab nation as a whole.\nIn the context of regional security in the Gulf\nregion, the peaceful settlement, either through\nnegotiations or international arbitration, of the long\ndispute between the United Arab Emirates and its\nbrother, the Islamic Republic of Iran, regarding the\nthree Emirate islands, especially now that there is a\nnew Iranian leadership, will enable the Gulf region to\ndivert its efforts and natural resources to face the\nchallenges of development, security, peace and\ncooperation.\nIn the area of development and progress, the\nKingdom of Bahrain has followed a policy of\nopenness, reform and participation and democracy\nenhancement, moving towards social, cultural and civil\nmodernization that goes hand in hand with our culture,\ndeep-rooted traditions and values.\nIn the context of its efforts to fulfil the\nMillennium Development Goals, the Kingdom of\nBahrain has taken significant steps to enable women to\nassume positions of leadership in various walks of life,\nby launching a new national strategy to promote\nBahraini women. Accordingly, in putting forward its\ncandidature for the presidency of the forthcoming\nsixty-first session of the General Assembly, it has\nselected a capable person who represents Bahraini\nwomen, and who demonstrates experience, wisdom and\ndiplomatic skill. We hope that this nomination will\nreceive wide agreement among Member States.\nReaffirming its regional and international status\nas an economic, financial and banking centre and as\npart of its efforts to attract greater investment and\ncapital, create employment opportunities for its\n17\n\ncitizens and strengthen the national economy, the\nKingdom of Bahrain has embarked on many major\neconomic and investment projects that will strengthen\nand enhance the economic and trade position of\nBahrain at the regional and international levels.\nEfforts and initiatives have continued over many\ndecades to achieve a collective security system that\nwill free humanity from the dangers of destruction and\nannihilation by prohibiting the proliferation of nuclear\nweapons. However, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\nBan Treaty has not achieved its goals despite accession\nby the majority of countries of the world, including all\nArab countries. In this regard, we call upon the\ninternational community to establish a nuclear-weapon-\nfree zone in both the Middle East and the Gulf region.\nWe hope that sincere and concerted efforts will\ncontinue among Member States to reach a consensus\non the reform of the Organization.\nWe trust that the framework of the proposed\nexpansion of the Security Council will reflect the\nconsensus of Member States with a clear and realistic\nvision and will take into account the interests and\nexpectations of the Arab nations with their profound\ninfluence on the political stability, economy, peace and\nsecurity in the whole world.\nThe recommendations put forward by the\nSecretary-General in his report \u201cIn larger freedom\u201d\n(A/59/2005) represent comprehensive and ambitious\nviews and aspirations in relation not only to the\nSecurity Council, which is entrusted by the Charter\nwith the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity, but also to establishing the basis for the entire\ninternational system.\nWe all look forward, during this session, to the\nopening of historic negotiations on the reforms of\nUnited Nations organs as well as on working methods.\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain supports the United Nations\nreform initiative and believes in the necessity of\ncontinued negotiations and discussions among Member\nStates in order to reach the results that we all aspire to.\nThe world today, this post-cold-war world, is not\nyet free of the scourge of war, and its people are still\nvulnerable to the consequences of terrorism and\nviolence.\nToday, we urgently need a more modern,\nstronger, reinvigorated and more credible Organization:\nan Organization that will bring all nations together and\nbalance their interests, resolve conflicts, build peace\nand security, uphold justice and the rule of law, oblige\nall to abide by the provisions of the Charter and\ninternational legal resolutions, adapt to the changes of\nthe twenty-first century and meet successfully its\nchallenges.\nWe look forward to a reformed United Nations,\nwhich we hope will come into existence soon."

        "file_text": "I\nwould like to add Romania\u2019s voice to those who have\nwarmly congratulated His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson\non his election to the important position of President of\nthe General Assembly. We wish him every success and\nassure him of our full support.\nFor Romania, the political debates at the sixtieth\nsession of the General Assembly have special\nsignificance; during this session, we shall celebrate 50\nyears of presence and active participation in the\ncommon efforts of the United Nations for peace,\nsecurity and sustainable development, to help\npopulations in distress and to promote human rights. It\nis uncontestable that the present international situation\nrequires not only that we take a hard, critical look at\nreality but also that we have the strength to take\nresponsible decisions and strong measures, both\npolitically and at the institutional level, to ensure that\nthe United Nations will be capable of meeting the\nchallenges of the twenty-first century and that it will\ncontinue to play an important role in the service of the\ngreater good.\n(spoke in English)\nRomania aligns itself fully with the statement\ndelivered at the 9th plenary meeting by Foreign\nSecretary Jack Straw of Great Britain on behalf of the\nEuropean Union. In my address I will, therefore, only\ncomplement the key points already made there on the\nchallenges of reform. We can be proud of where the\nUnion stands today on the global scene and of its\nUnited Nations record.\nBy no means is this just another general debate at\nthe start of a new session of the General Assembly. We\nare called upon to rise to the responsibility enunciated\nat the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General\n32\n\nAssembly, which preceded these debates. There, heads\nof State or Government committed all of us, through\nthe 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1), to\ncontinue the efforts to reform our Organization. It is\nnow in our hands to implement our leaders\u2019 decisions\nand make the most of them.\nAgainst this backdrop, I wish to commend\nMr. Jean Ping, President of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-ninth session, for the outstanding work he has\ndone over the past few months, together with his\nfacilitators, and for the way he conducted the\nnegotiations. It was a difficult process, but I believe\nthat we have a document with which we can be\nsatisfied. Many aspects still need further elaboration,\nbut the General Assembly is ready to work on them\nunder the skilful guidance of the current President,\nMr. Jan Eliasson.\nThe United Nations should continue to\naccomplish multilayered objectives and to function as a\ncomplex, effective organization. That is the spirit of\nthe deliberations conducted by our heads of State or\nGovernment and of the decisions they took.\nMuch thus remains to be done in relation to the\nmandate and responsibilities of the First Committee.\nDebates on international security are still dependent on\narrangements put in place during the cold war.\nUnfortunately, almost all multilateral negotiating\nforums seem complacent in their conservatism. Yet we\nall agree that, given those premises, it is difficult to\nadvance the political dialogue and to set new priorities.\nWe need a new dynamic, anchored in a genuine\nreform process. It has to be tailored to respond\neffectively to the most ominous threats to international\npeace and security: terrorism and the proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction. It has to be truly relevant\nto our needs and has to produce equal dividends for all\nin a system based on the concept of collective security.\nSuccess in the area of development calls for\nbroad solidarity in international economic relations.\nRomania has gradually increased its contribution\ntowards resolving global development issues. And\naccession to the European Union will make Romania a\nmember of the world\u2019s largest donor community. The\nUnited Nations must develop and strengthen its\ncapacity to effectively protect and promote human\nrights and fundamental freedoms, by upholding the\nconcept of a \u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d, which calls for\nan international response in cases where a State is\nunable or unwilling to discharge its primary function of\nprotecting the life, property and fundamental rights of\nits own citizens.\nThis imperative is convincingly illustrated by the\nfact that, over the past 15 years, we have witnessed\nhow a number of internal conflicts, which frequently\nhad started as separatist movements, have evolved to\nachieve \u201cfrozen conflict\u201d status. These conflicts have\nbecome breeding grounds for egregious violations of\nhuman rights and abuses, targeting the most vulnerable\ncategories, such as women, children and persons\nbelonging to various minorities.\nIt serves no purpose to debate an ambitious\npolicy agenda unless we have an effective United\nNations system adapted to the new realities of a\nchanging world. Years after the end of the cold war, the\nUnited Nations is still struggling to make the transition\nfrom an organization characterized by ideological\ndifferences to one actively responding to pressing\noperational challenges. Institutional change is an\nabsolute prerequisite for successful policy results.\nOne of the main problems besetting the\nOrganization could, unfortunately, end up by being\nperpetuated \u2014 that is, increasingly high expectations\nand demands, without adequate resources and\nappropriate managerial tools.\nAt a time when some are calling into question the\nrelevance of our Organization and when we have had\nto cope recently with a succession of revelations about\nmismanagement, we, the Secretariat and Member\nStates together, need to act resolutely to ensure the\nefficiency and credibility of the United Nations by\nimproving administrative performance, establishing\nviable mechanisms for the responsibility and\naccountability of the Secretariat, strengthening audit\nand oversight functions and endowing the Secretary-\nGeneral with the authority and flexibility needed to\nmanage effectively the mandates entrusted to him by\nthe membership.\nFor Romania, like other United Nations\nMembers, the Security Council has continued to be the\nbody that monitors international relations with regard\nto critical issues that pose a threat to regional and\nglobal peace. It is highly commendable that the\nSecurity Council has assumed the leading role in\nestablishing early warning and resolve as the\ncornerstones of the United Nations and the\n33\n\ninternational community\u2019s approach to the full range of\nnew threats to international peace and security.\nWith over 2,000 peacekeepers on duty around the\nworld, Romania is a major contributor and a significant\ninvestor in a wide range of United Nations-mandated\nand United Nations-authorized operations; we\ntherefore have a very high stake in their successful\noutcome.\nRomania\u2019s stance has consistently been that\nprotection against security threats means more than just\ntaking a stand at one\u2019s own border; we have to go\nwhere those challenges originate and approach them\nwith resolute action and sustained investment. This is\npart of the rationale for Romania\u2019s joint endeavours\nwith partners and allies in shouldering stabilization and\nreconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan. In both\ncountries, elections are happening, following the\ntremendous dedication and painstaking efforts of,\nabove all, the people of those countries, and also\nbecause of a steadily engaged international community.\nRomania is carrying her share of this burden all the\nway through the process.\nSince 9/11, the international edifice, as well as\nour common values of peace and security, have been\nbadly shaken by an unprecedented surge of terrorist\nactivity. Romania was among the first countries to\nembark on efforts undertaken globally, as well as\nregionally, to combat this scourge. From that day on,\nwe have constantly been at the forefront of the fight\nagainst terrorism, on the ground and through our active\nparticipation in the process of shaping successive\ninitiatives in different forums.\nFurthermore, Romania has carried out her\nspecific contribution to international counter-terrorism\nefforts as an elected member of the United Nations\nSecurity Council by assuming, inter alia, the\nchairmanship of the Committee established pursuant to\nresolution 1540 (2004) on the non-proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction.\nRomania has already advanced to the ratification\nstage of the 12 relevant international conventions\nadopted in this area and has transposed important parts\nof their provisions into its national legislation. I am\nproud to inform delegates that, on 14 September, my\nPresident signed the International Convention for the\nSuppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, which was\nadopted by the General Assembly on 13 April 2005.\nRomania shares the European Union (EU) stand on the\nurgency of adopting of a comprehensive convention on\ninternational terrorism during the sixtieth session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nOur crucial aim is to see the day when the\ninternational community is able to address each and\nevery security challenge, no matter where, by better\npooling existing resources and capabilities.\nWe were pleased to see recognition given in the\nSummit Outcome (resolution 60/1) to the important\ncontribution that regional organizations have made to\npeace and security.\nThe heads of State and Government expressed\ntheir support for a stronger relationship between the\nUnited Nations and regional organizations, under\nChapter VIII of the Charter. They resolved to expand\nthis dimension of the new architecture of international\npeace and security through formalized agreements\nbetween the respective secretariats and, as appropriate,\nthe involvement of regional organizations in the work\nof the Security Council.\nRomania\u2019s particular experience in South-Eastern\nEurope and the Black Sea area indicates that, in such\ncases as conflict management and in handling\nresponses to transnational threats, regional action\nreinforced by meaningful cooperation between the\nUnited Nations and regional organizations is decisive.\nIn the Balkans, the way in which the Kosovo\nissue will be addressed over the coming months is\ngoing to be crucial for the overall prospects for lasting\nstability, integration and prosperity for the whole\nregion. The United Nations-led policy of standards in\nKosovo has improved the situation in the region. The\nprobability of violence and conflict is lower now than\nin the past, and we can start looking more confidently\ntowards the future. However, the job is not yet done.\nSerbs and other ethnic communities in Kosovo still\nfear for their security and cannot live normal lives.\nThere are also too many who are still waiting to return\nto their homes. Therefore, the comprehensive\nimplementation of standards must continue, with\nthorough consideration given to securing and\nprotecting normal relations between ethnic\ncommunities, as well as to the rights and freedoms of\nall people from Kosovo. No one will be able to refer\nrealistically to stability and a political settlement in the\nregion, as called for in United Nations Security\nCouncil resolution 1244 (1999), until such a\nfoundation is achieved.\n34\n\nEast of Romania, in the wider Black Sea area,\ndevelopment is hampered by a lack of overall security\nand stability. I am referring particularly to the\nsituations of protracted conflict in the region, frozen in\na state of uncertainty and disregard for international\nlaw and scrutiny. Besides their negative impact on\ndevelopment and political normalcy, these conflict\nareas also spread modern maladies in the\nneighbourhood, such as organized crime, illegal arms\nand drug trafficking, trafficking in human beings, and,\nnot least, terrorism. The States of the region have to\nrise to meet these challenges together. They will not be\nable to do so without close cooperation. They need\nstrong partners, strategic vision and a coherent, more\ncomprehensive approach. It is clear that we have to\nfind something better and more sustainable than trying\nto put these conflicts in the freezer for decades or\nyears. In order to ensure the benefits of stability in the\nwider Black Sea area for all involved, the best way is\nto work towards making the logic of cooperation\nprevail.\nIn November, Romania will take up the\nchairmanship of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation\npact. In this capacity, Romania will try to encourage all\nplayers in the region to think strategically in the\ncommon interest and overcome the burden of these\nprotracted conflicts so as to maximize the region\u2019s\neconomic and social potential. Also, given the world\u2019s\ninterdependence, the States of the region need a United\nNations that has closer links to regional structures and\nthat can enhance, in turn, the effectiveness of joint\naction.\nHowever we characterize the 2005 World Summit\nOutcome \u2014 as a blueprint or a road map \u2014 it is\nbeyond a doubt that United Nations reform is still a\nwork in progress. As far as Romania is concerned, we\nstand ready to join the presidency and all Member\ncountries in endeavours to prepare the United Nations\nto meet the heavy demands placed on multilateral\ncooperation in the twenty-first century."

        "file_text": "First, Sir, I \nshould like to extend my sincere congratulations to you \non the occasion of your election to the presidency of \nthe sixtieth session of the General Assembly and to \nwish you the greatest success in conducting the work \nof the Assembly. I am also pleased to take this \nopportunity to offer my sincere thanks to your \npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping, Minister \nfor Foreign Affairs of the Gabonese Republic, for the \nconsiderable results produced during his term as \nPresident, especially towards the end of the session, \nwhen we reviewed matters related to the \nimplementation of the Millennium Goals and the \nreform of the United Nations. \n I should also like to take this opportunity to \nexpress our appreciation to the Secretary-General, \nMr. Kofi Annan, for his valuable efforts to bolster and \npropel the role of the United Nations in international \npeacekeeping, security and development. The report by \nMr. Kofi Annan (A/59/2005) and the recommendations \nset out in it provide us with important elements capable \nof leading to consensus on strategies that will help us \nto achieve the Millennium Goals and to make progress \non reforming the United Nations. \n I cannot fail to take advantage of this opportunity, \non behalf of the people of Sao Tome and Principe, to \nreiterate to the Government and the people of the \nUnited States of America and to the bereaved families \nour sincere condolences regarding the tragedy caused \nby Hurricane Katrina. These difficult times, being \nexperienced by a large part of the American people, \ncannot leave us indifferent, above all because we are \nfully aware of the role that the American people and its \nGovernment play in international solidarity and \ncooperation, constantly seeking peace and prosperity \nfor peoples in difficulty, and of their support and \nfinancing of this great Organization. \n From the early days of the signing of the Charter \nin 1945 in San Francisco, the United Nations has \nplayed a crucial role in undertaking many matters of a \npolitical, economic, social and humanitarian nature \nthroughout the world. Nevertheless, it seems to us that \nthe world now needs a stronger and more dynamic \nUnited Nations. The present session takes place in a \nvery complex international environment. Indeed, the \nclimate of permanent tension experienced in some \nparts of the world, the unbridled arms race, human \ntrafficking, cross-border organized crime, terrorism, \nsystematic violations of human rights, economic \ndepression and environmental degradation constitute \nimportant matters that are in need of the attention of \nthe United Nations now and in the years to come. In \nthe face of such challenges, Member States must \nmanifest a sense of wisdom and responsibility in order \nfor an international order based on peace, security and \ncooperation to prevail. \n Small island States met this year in Mauritius to \nevaluate the Barbados Programme of Action for the \nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing \nStates. In Mauritius, States reaffirmed their \n  \n \n14 05-51226 \n \ncommitment to support the efforts of small island \ndeveloping States that would lead to sustainable \ndevelopment through a greater and more effective \nimplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action. \nDecisions and recommendations were adopted on \nclimate change, natural and environmental disasters, \nwater resources, waste management, tourism, energy, \ntransportation, biodiversity and marine and coastal \nresources. All the problems that affect small island \nStates, from global warming to ecosystem problems, \ncan be resolved only if the international community \nmakes an effort to effectively increase the resources \nthat will support the sustained development of small \nisland States. In this regard, we would like to take the \nopportunity to express our thanks both to the \ninternational community and to the Government of \nMauritius for the efforts made to organize the special \nconference. \n International security is based on the protection \nof the people and on education for capacity-building, \npromoting a community\u2019s development. Nations that \ndo not pay attention those factors could be in a state of \npermanent tension, which is not conducive to progress. \nFor this reason HIV/AIDS, poverty, political crises, \nongoing violations of human rights, oppression and \noccupation constitute threats to human security.  \n Many of our countries continue to face challenges \nin combating HIV/AIDS and other illnesses. In some \nregions of Africa HIV/AIDS is devastating families, \ncultures and economies \u2014 entire societies. The cost of \ntreatment continues to be extremely high and our \neconomies are beginning to buckle under the effects of \nthe illness. If significant resources and additional \nscientific investment for research to seek a cure for \nHIV/AIDS are not forthcoming the development \nexpectations of Africa will be far from being met. \n Very recently the Republic of Angola was \nattacked by the worst outbreak ever of Marburg fever, \ncaused by a virus related to the Ebola virus. We are \nconcerned because Sao Tome and Principe, being an \nintegral part of the Central African States, cannot \nremove itself from that situation. We appeal to the \nWorld Health Organization (WHO) to strengthen the \ncapabilities of the countries of the subregion by \nholding seminars and providing training. This initiative \nwill help us to deal prophylactically with similar \nsituations that might arise. Likewise, malaria continues \nto be a serious public health problem for my country \ndespite its active involvement with existing \nprogrammes supported by several countries and \norganizations. \n The situation of insecurity primarily affects the \nmost vulnerable populations, especially refugees, \nchildren, women and the elderly. Terrorism is \ndestabilizing Governments, destroying lives and \nclaiming innocent victims. We are faced with a \nchallenge that requires reformulating our strategies to \ncombat it. It seems entirely appropriate to start with an \nunderstanding of the origins of the problem by \nidentifying its causes, and then to forge new \nconsensuses and improve the methods of combating the \nproblem and implementing Security Council resolution \n1373 (2001). However, the United Nations must take \nadditional action to benefit States which, like my own, \nare not in a position to fully comply with all the \nprovisions of that resolution. We need resources that \nwill contribute to the improvement, inter alia, of our \nsecurity, including control of our borders and territorial \nwaters. Here, strengthening our capability to fight the \nphenomenon of terrorism is a priority. \n In my capacity as President of the Community of \nPortuguese-Speaking Countries, I should like to refer \nto Guinea-Bissau, which has just successfully \nconcluded a long and difficult political transition. First, \nlet me congratulate the people and the authorities of \nthat country on their success. I commend the \ninternational community, and in particular the United \nNations and its Secretary-General, for its prompt \ncontribution, which bolstered the people\u2019s action for \npeace, stability and development. Now, Guinea-Bissau \nfaces the giant task of promoting development and \nwell-being for its population. The international \ncommunity must therefore continue to provide its \ntraditional help so that legitimate expectations may not \nbe frustrated. \n The universality of the Organization requires that \nall nations must be represented. However, this \ncontinues not to be so despite several calls for it. As we \nreflect on reforming the United Nations, we must once \nagain take advantage of the opportunity from this \nrostrum to invite the international community to review \nthe problem of the need for the Republic of China on \nTaiwan to be represented in the Organization. In this \nregard, my country signed the letter contained in \ndocument A/60/192 requesting the inclusion of an item \nin the agenda of the present session entitled \u201cQuestion \nof the representation of the 23 million people of \n \n \n05-51226 15 \n \nTaiwan in the United Nations\u201d. Once again, we have \nlost an opportunity to correct this injustice. \n We are further concerned by the recent adoption \nby the People\u2019s Republic of China of the so-called anti-\nsecession law, which, by increasing tension in the \nStrait of Taiwan, may compromise peace in the region. \nAware of the role of the United Nations, specifically \nunder the provisions of Articles 1 and 34 of the \nCharter, Sao Tome and Principe also joined in \nproposing the draft resolution annexed to document \nA/60/193. That document contains a letter requesting \nthe inclusion of a supplementary item in the agenda of \nthe present session entitled, \u201cA proactive role for the \nUnited Nations in maintaining peace in the Taiwan \nStrait\u201d. Neither proposal received the expected support. \n We are faced with an excellent opportunity to \ninfuse our Organization with greater dynamism and \nrationality, more action and less bureaucracy. Reform \nof the system is urgent. It is a high priority. To that \nend, we must all work without hesitation for the good \nof the world to which we belong. "

        "file_text": "Allow me\nfirst of all to pay tribute to Mr. Jean Ping, who guided\nthe work of the fifty-ninth session of the General\nAssembly with great energy. He had the tremendous\nresponsibility of negotiating the United Nations\nreforms adopted by our heads of State or Government\non Friday, 16 September. We commend him on his\ncourage, his faith in the future of the United Nations\nand the wisdom and vision with which he discharged\nhis functions.\nThe tasks facing Mr. Jan Eliasson are inspiring\nand crucially important. His presidency marks the\nbeginning of the implementation phase of the major\ndecisions taken by our heads of State or Government\non reform. We are grateful to him for focusing the\nwork of the sixtieth session on this topic.\nMy delegation has another good reason to be\npleased at seeing Mr. Eliasson presiding over our work:\nthe importance his country attaches to development\nissues and its very sizeable contribution to the efforts\nof the international community to eliminate poverty\nthroughout the world. Our two countries, Benin and\nSweden, successfully co-chaired the General\nAssembly\u2019s Open-ended Working Group on an Agenda\nfor Development. All of this bodes well for this\nsession.\nThe eradication of poverty tops the priority list of\nthe Benin Government. In this context, we negotiated\nand adopted, with the Bretton Woods institutions, a\nPoverty Reduction Strategy Paper. Its effective\nimplementation, jointly with our Government\u2019s plan of\naction and our national studies on long-term prospects,\nentitled \u201cBenin 2005: ALAFIA\u201d, should set into\nmotion progress that will bring about the achievement\nof the Millennium Development Goals. However, it\nwill still be necessary for the efforts carried out with\nour bilateral and multilateral development partners to\nconverge to improve the situation in the seven critical\nareas for making aid to least developed countries\neffective. These are: substantially reducing the external\ndebt burden of least developed countries so they can\ndevote greater domestic resources to eliminating\npoverty; strengthening institutional capacity to attract\nforeign direct investment and develop free enterprise;\ndiversifying the destinations of foreign direct\ninvestment; promoting public sector/private sector\npartnership in least developed countries to promote\nrural development; strengthening the impact of\nremittances from our diaspora; the promotion of South-\nSouth investment to improve the availability of\nproducts on markets; and, strengthening the potential\nof microcredit to eliminate poverty.\nWe are gratified at the decision taken in\nGleneagles, Scotland, by the Group of Eight (G-8) to\ncompletely cancel the debt of 18 highly indebted poor\ncountries, 13 of which are least developed countries.\nWe urgently appeal to donor countries to seriously\nconsider the possibility of extending the benefit of this\nnew positive measure to all least developed countries.\nThe Coordinating Bureau of the Least Developed\nCountries, which my country has had the honour of\nchairing since 2002, will continue consulting with\n12\n\ninternational financial institutions and development\npartners in close cooperation with the High\nRepresentative for the Least Developed Countries,\nLandlocked Developing Countries and Small Island\nDeveloping States, to bring about meaningful progress\nin all these areas. This is the context of the ministerial\nconference of the least developed countries on\nremittances from migrant workers. The conference will\nbe held in Cotonou, Benin, in February 2006, not in\nOctober 2005 as originally planned. In the context of\nthis conference, the 50 least developed countries are\nplanning to set up an international monitoring body for\nfunds transfers by migrant workers; it will be open to\nall States. We urge all United Nations Member States\nto support this initiative, which is intended to\nstrengthen the impact of these transferred resources on\nthe development of recipient countries.\nIn addition to these considerations that directly\naffect the least developed countries, there is an urgent\nneed to promote and give appropriate weight to the\ndevelopment agenda within the context of multilateral\ntrade negotiations in the World Trade Organization and\nto translate into deeds the firm commitments by the\ncountries concerned on the elimination of agricultural\nsubsidies, in particular those for cotton, to which my\ncountry attaches particular importance. Such a measure\nwould remove a considerable handicap on developing\ncountries\u2019 efforts to fully take advantage of their\ncomparative advantages in order to become fully\nintegrated into the world economy. We reaffirm that it\nis indispensable that access to world markets be\ncoupled with measures to strengthen the supply of\nproducts from developing countries through adequate\nsupport for the local processing of commodities.\nNo initiative, no measure, no activity and no\ndecision in the field of development can be successful\nwithout peace. It is of particular concern that, on\nessential matters such as disarmament and non-\nproliferation of nuclear weapons, the United Nations\ncannot forge the required consensus to secure the long-\nterm survival of our planet in view of the potential for\nself-destruction that has built up. These questions\nshould be considered calmly, with the higher interests\nof humankind in mind, setting aside the particular\ninterest of any country in pursuing some hypothetical\npower that would reduce security for each and every\none of us.\nBenin has no objection to the peaceful use of\nnuclear power to serve the energy needs of the planet,\nbut it feels that any effort to divert peaceful\nprogrammes to military programmes runs counter to a\nvision of collective security based on promoting\ndisarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of\nmass destruction.\nOur heads of State or Government decided to\nconfirm the Security Council\u2019s key role as the organ\nwith primary responsibility for the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. We urge all members\nof the Assembly to commit themselves to ensuring that\nthe Security Council is expanded to make it more\nrepresentative and better able to counter old and new\nthreats to international peace and security.\nIn the 60 years of existence of the United\nNations, the Security Council has with varying degrees\nof success, worked to manage and settle armed\nconflicts. It has been able to respond to breaches of\ninternational peace and security, but it has not always\nbeen able to take action to stop or reverse events that\nhave led to an explosion of violence or armed conflict.\nGiven the loss of human life and the massive\ndestruction of property as a result of current threats, it\nis high time for the Security Council to attach higher\npriority to conflict prevention, in the spirit of Article\n34 of the Charter, which states that\n\u201cThe Security Council may investigate any\ndispute, or any situation which might lead to\ninternational friction or give rise to a dispute, in\norder to determine whether the continuance of the\ndispute or situation is likely to endanger the\nmaintenance of international peace and security\u201d.\nIf we look at the spirit and the letter of this\nprovision, the Security Council is definitely competent\nto analyse and monitor situations involving the risk of\nconflict or a breach of the peace anywhere in the world\nand to become actively involved in managing crises\nbefore conflict breaks out or threats materialize. It is in\nthat light that we must view Security Council\nresolution 1625 (2005), adopted at the 14 September\n2005 Council summit at the initiative of the three\nAfrican members of the Security Council, led by my\ncountry, Benin.\nIn the context of Security Council reform, the\nGeneral Assembly should consider the subject of a\nproactive approach and reflect on how to structure\nsupport mechanisms in order to enable the Council to\neffectively play its role in the prevention of conflicts\nand of threats to international peace and security.\n13\n\nPeace remains an invaluable and incalculable\ngood. We share the concerns expressed recently by the\nSecretary-General at the launch of his Alliance of\nCivilizations initiative. That constructive initiative\nshould be made part of the framework of activities to\ncounter threats to our world, including terrorism,\nwhose predominant religious ties lend credence to\ntheories of a clash of civilizations leading to certain\nchaos. Benin supports the Alliance of Civilizations\ninitiative, which aims to restore peace in our hearts and\namong religions so that weapons will fall silent and our\npeoples will be able to express their aspirations for\npeace.\nWe join the quest for peace of those peoples who\nlack peace today. We express our solidarity with\npeoples suffering armed conflicts in Africa, the Middle\nEast, Asia, Latin America and Europe. The\nOrganization must redouble its efforts to help them\nprocure national concord, understanding and cohesion.\nIn that context, we are pursuing a thoroughgoing\ncampaign against the recruitment and the use of\nchildren in armed conflicts. Now that the Security\nCouncil has adopted its resolution 1612 (2005), the\nGeneral Assembly, for its part, should establish an\nopen-ended working group to consider proposals for\nactions to redefine that scourge as a crime against\nhumanity instead of a war crime. We are counting on\neveryone\u2019s support to make that initiative a reality.\nIn the Middle East, the withdrawal of the\noccupying Power from the Gaza Strip and part of the\nWest Bank brings us closer, fortunately, to our common\nvision of an independent State of Palestine living side\nby side with the State of Israel within secure and\ninternationally recognized borders. We believe that the\nQuartet\u2019s road map can lead the Israeli and Palestinian\npeoples to that goal. We call upon their leaders to\nremain committed to the route of peace.\nWe ask the same of Iraqi leaders and urge them to\nspare no effort to ensure that all Iraqi communities\nparticipate in the transition process leading to the\nrestoration of peace and the strengthening of the\ncountry\u2019s unity. We make the same appeal to\nAfghanistan, Liberia and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, among others.\nIn the same spirit of dialogue, we welcome the\nsignificant progress made in resolving the conflicts of\nWest Africa through the cooperation between the\nUnited Nations and the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States aimed at promoting dynamic\npeacebuilding processes for the gradual return of\nnormality in the countries affected by conflict and for\npreventing the spread of conflict, through an\nintegrated, regional approach.\nWe invite all Ivorian parties to overcome their\ndifferences of view and give peace and stability a\nchance in the West African subregion. The holding of\nthe International Conference on the Great Lakes\nRegion and the remarkable success achieved by the\ntransition processes in the Central African Republic\nand Burundi have restored the prospects of the entire\nregion. We encourage the countries concerned to reach\na regional agreement for peace, security, good\ngovernance and development in the framework of the\nsecond regional summit, to be held in Nairobi, and to\nscrupulously implement that agreement in order to\npromote peace, stability and prosperity in the region.\nThose regional initiatives require enhanced\nassistance from the international community if the\ntransition in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is\nto be a success. In that context, Benin intends to pursue\nits policy of active participation in peacekeeping\noperations. Our country stands ready to increase its\ncontribution to the international community\u2019s efforts in\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo in order to\nsupport the democratic transition process under way.\nIn East Africa, the United Nations and the\nAfrican Union have formed an unprecedented\npartnership to restore peace in the Sudan and put an\nend to the humanitarian crisis in Darfur, in the spirit of\nChapter VIII of the Charter. Such a partnership is\nessential also in Somalia. In that context, it is in the\ninterest of the United Nations to assist the African\nUnion in establishing and organizing its peacekeeping\ncapacities, in particular by strengthening the structures\nfor planning and for training national and subregional\ncontingents of the African standby force.\nAnother essential element to which we attach\ngreat importance, and which we hope to see realized\npromptly, relates to the decision taken by our heads of\nState or Government on the establishment of a standing\npolice force. The establishment of such a force should\ntake into consideration the need for linguistic balance\nin accordance with short-term and medium-term\ndeployment needs. The modalities of the force\u2019s\ncomposition should be defined promptly. To that end,\nwe propose carrying out a rapid evaluation of present\nworldwide human resources and of Member States\u2019\n14\n\ncapacity to train police officers. A rational process in\nthat area would consist of taking best advantage of\nthose capacities and giving all Member States an equal\nopportunity for participation in the new force.\nBeyond peacemaking action, the need to help\ncountries emerging from armed conflict remain on the\npath of peace and overcome the risk of relapse\nconstitutes a real challenge to which we have\nadequately responded through our reflections on the\nrole of the United Nations. That is the reason behind\nthe Peacebuilding Commission. The consensus on this\nquestion does honour to the Organization. The\nCommission must become operational as soon as\npossible to strengthen action to assist countries that\nhave undertaken particularly difficult democratic\ntransitions, such as Burundi, the Central African\nRepublic and Guinea-Bissau, if their Governments\nrequest such assistance.\nCountries facing an ongoing state of social\nemergency can improve their chances for lasting\nstability only if the international community mobilizes\nthe necessary resources to help restore a minimum of\nnormality by ensuring that those States can exercise\ntheir sovereign rights in the areas of security and the\nprovision of essential social services such as health\ncare, child education, transport and access to financial\nresources.\nThe success of disarmament, demobilization and\nreintegration programmes in all their aspects is\ndecisive for making a peace process irreversible and\nfor guarding against the risk of the spread of conflict\ncaused by the dispersion of former combatants that\nhave not successfully reintegrated into productive civil\nsociety. The international community must ensure that\nthe reintegration component of those programmes also\nreceives adequate financing.\nIn the same context, the Human Rights Council\nmust take its place in the machinery of the United\nNations. Its mandate, size, structure and operational\nprocedures must take into account the requirements of\nrepresentativity, credibility and effectiveness by\ndrawing all lessons from the experience and the\npractices of the Commission on Human Rights, which\nit is intended to replace. In that regard, the new\nCouncil must become the preferred instrument for\nidentifying cases in which the international community\nshould exercise its responsibility to protect\npopulations. In that regard, the Human Rights Council\nalso has a crucial role to play as an early-warning\nstructure within the United Nations system and as a\nkey element of its conflict-prevention machinery.\nWe cannot conclude without underlining our full\nsupport for the excellent idea of the Government of\nSweden to create a network of heads of State and other\nworld leaders to monitor effective implementation of\nUnited Nations reform."

        "file_text": "Saint Lucia supported\nyour unanimous election, Sir, to be President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its sixtieth session, confident that\nyour diplomatic skills and experience are just what we\nneed to ensure a positive outcome of this historic\nsixtieth anniversary session. I congratulate you and the\nGovernment and people of Sweden on behalf of the\ndelegation of Saint Lucia and on my own behalf and\npledge our cooperation to you in our common\nendeavour.\nMy Government and delegation also extend our\nthanks to your predecessor in office, His Excellency\nMr. Jean Ping, for his stewardship of the fifty-ninth\nsession of the General Assembly, charged as it was\nwith the preparatory work for this sixtieth anniversary.\nIn these times, when the demands on the United\nNations are significant and increasing, resources\nlimited and we, the Member States, are called upon to\nstrengthen our cooperation and keep detractors and\ncynics of the Organization at bay, my Government\nwishes to express its appreciation to the Secretary-\nGeneral for his continuing support for the work of the\nUnited Nations.\nIn this sixtieth year of the United Nations, our\nworld is certainly not the prosperous and peaceful one\nbuilt on the unity and strength of nations that the\nCharter envisaged. Should we conclude, therefore, that\nhad the United Nations exerted more authoritative\ninfluence in global affairs, our twenty-first century\nworld would be a better one? Such an assertion seems\nplausible in today\u2019s world, replete with poverty and\n19\n\nhunger, disease, lack of sustainable development,\nhuman rights violations, terrorism, conflict and war,\nglaring inadequacies and a multitude of other grave\nproblems, including the unfinished agenda on\ndecolonization.\nThe record of the United Nations, however, does\nnot bear out so simplistic an assertion. If we look with\nhistorical retrospection at the Organization\u2019s record, we\nsee that it has wielded enormous influence over the\nyears. The challenge that we Member States must take\nup at this sixtieth anniversary is to ensure that the\nUnited Nations, the key Organization in global affairs,\nhas the authority and prestige to anticipate and meet\nchallenges of the nature and scale we are witnessing in\ntoday\u2019s world.\nDevelopment is foremost among the challenges\nthat Member States have identified for urgent attention\nduring this sixtieth anniversary. There is logic in this\napproach. A significant proportion of the critical\nproblems that the world faces now and in the future is\nintrinsically linked to development. It is for this reason\nthat heads of State or Government, in their Millennium\nDeclaration, defined succinctly what must be done to\nadvance socio-economic development in areas of vital\nconcern.\nAs we know, this comprehensive blueprint\nunderpins the Millennium Development Goals. The\nglobal leadership was sufficiently confident to place\ntheir Goals within specified time frames, understanding\nas they did the desperate need for improvement in the\nsocio-economic conditions in numerous developing\ncountries.\nWhat will we, the Member States of this United\nNations, say to the people of the developing world\ngrappling with poverty, hunger, HIV/AIDS and other\ndeadly diseases, illiteracy, gender discrimination and\nother challenges if, by the date set, we have not met the\ntargets of the Millennium Development Goals? My\nGovernment sees no merit in the discussion as to\nwhether target dates should have been set. Our\norientation should now be towards accelerating the\npace of implementation so that the Goals can be\naccomplished within agreed time frames, or better still\neven earlier than the target dates.\nThe United Nations must also show the people of\nthe developing world that comprehensive measures are\nbeing taken to address the environment and sustainable\ndevelopment. Natural disasters of phenomenal\nproportions \u2014 from Hurricane Ivan in the Caribbean to\nthe tsunami in Asia and now to Hurricane Katrina in\nthe southern United States \u2014 have brought death and\ndestruction to developing and developed countries\nalike. I take this opportunity on behalf of the\nGovernment and people of Saint Lucia to extend our\nsympathy to the Government of the United States for\nthe tragedy still unfolding in the Gulf Coast states.\nResource-rich developed countries are better\npositioned to mitigate the impact of natural disasters,\nalthough they too are not without their challenges. For\ndeveloping countries, however, including Saint Lucia\nand other small island developing States in the\nCaribbean and Pacific, decades of progress can be\nobliterated in the course of a few hours by one\nhurricane or typhoon. Beyond doubt the environment is\na critical element of the United Nations development\nagenda. It is a compelling reason for all to sign on to\nthe Kyoto Protocol.\nIt is also in our common interest to meet all the\ncommitments made in the Monterrey Consensus on\nFinancing for Development. In many instances,\nhowever, expectations are not being realized.\nDeveloping countries still cannot rely on wide-ranging\ndevelopment cooperation and assistance and debt\nreduction responses that are predictable and reliable.\nNeedless to say my Government joins in urging the\ndeveloped countries that have not already done so to\nmeet the 0.7 per cent target. We recognize the G-8\ninitiative to take enhanced measures for Africa\u2019s\ndevelopment and hope that that initiative would be\nspeedily implemented.\nRelated to concern for the development and well-\nbeing of all the world\u2019s people, the Government of\nSaint Lucia commends the establishment of the\n$1 billion emergency fund to be finalized later this\nyear, which will enable the Organization to more\nquickly and effectively respond to humanitarian crises.\nThis sixtieth anniversary provides us with yet\nanother opportunity to give impetus to initiatives to\nspread the benefits of globalization and trade\nliberalization more widely. Priority must be given to\nensuring that all developing countries benefit from\nfreer world trade, that a decline in their trade sector be\nhalted and reversed and that the competition they face\nin the world economy be on a level playing field.\nI am really tired of saying this \u2014 that one size\ncannot fit all, an indisputable fact that the World Trade\n20\n\nOrganization stubbornly refuses to acknowledge with\nrespect, inter alia, to bananas and sugar in Caribbean\nCommunity and small island developing States.\nIndeed, the cause of development would be greatly\nenhanced by a positive outcome from the next round of\nthe Doha trade negotiations scheduled for Hong Kong,\nChina, in December 2005, and an early and successful\nconclusion of the round overall, hopefully in 2006.\nDeveloping countries must be equal partners in\nthis process, and together with the developed countries\ntake the decisive action required at the World Trade\nOrganization.\nWhat my Government seeks to emphasize by\ndrawing attention to the development imperative is that\nthe time has come for a paradigm shift in the United\nNations approach to development. For more than a\ndecade we have, through a series of United Nations\nsummits and conferences in the economic and social\nfields, formulated an agreed framework of a United\nNations development agenda, which includes the\nMillennium Development Goals.\nTo these we have now added the outcome\ndocument of the sixtieth anniversary summit. Are these\ncourses of action that we have agreed upon to be\nregarded as mere platitudes, destined to be relegated to\nthe archives of the United Nations? The developing\ncountries have communicated through the Group of 77\nand China that the partnership and cooperation of the\ncountries of the developed world, and indeed all\nstakeholders, are urgently needed to accelerate action\nand implementation of the United Nations development\nagenda. This sixtieth anniversary, we believe, has a\nresponsibility to launch this process afresh and to carry\nout the commitments that we have made in this\ndevelopment agenda.\nA more influential Economic and Social Council\nand a United Nations development system that is\nstrong and cohesive would ensure that the Organization\nimplements its development mandate effectively.\nMaking the United Nations responses equal to its\nchallenges through reform and revitalization was an\nimportant element of our deliberations in the\npreparatory process for this sixtieth anniversary.\nLet me say that my Government is prepared to\nactively work together with other Member States to set\nprecise and unambiguous mandates for new or\nreconstituted bodies, including a Peacebuilding\nCommission and Human Rights Council, on the basis\nof consensus. It is our considered opinion however that\na credible process of United Nations reform must result\nin a strong General Assembly, the Organization\u2019s sole\nuniversal organ from which no Member State can be or\nis excluded.\nWe can ill afford to further erode the General\nAssembly\u2019s role and authority, since the Charter\nconfirms in a practical sense the importance of the\nAssembly by the expansive mandate that it has been\ngiven in areas that include the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. No other organ has\nbeen given such broad responsibilities nor has the\npotential to deliver over such a wide range of Charter\nideals. We are also convinced that a strong General\nAssembly would enhance the credibility and standing\nof the United Nations as a whole. Therefore, the\nmomentum of General Assembly revitalization must be\nmaintained, and our efforts in this area must be as\ndynamic and flexible as are the forces shaping today\u2019s\nworld.\nReform of the Security Council has also been a\nmajor preoccupation in the lead up to this sixtieth\nanniversary, as it has been for some 12 years. An\nindisputable case has been made for the expansion of\nthe Council to reflect the exponential growth of the\nUnited Nations membership from 51 in 1945 to 191\ntoday. We all know that the obstacle to moving beyond\nthis point is the diverging and strongly held views\nabout whether an expanded membership should include\nnew permanent members. Again this is an issue that\nmy Government would wish to see resolved by\nconsensus.\nPerhaps this matter might be put into better\nperspective if we were to reflect on the role and\nfunction of the United Nations as a whole. Within the\nbroad range of human endeavours entrusted to the\nOrganization, the Charter gives the Security Council\none specific, albeit critical, mandate \u2014 that is, the\nmaintenance of international peace and security. My\nGovernment is of the view that it was not intended for\nthis collective security mandate to be carried out by the\nSecurity Council functioning as an independent and\nseparate entity, but rather to be carried out in\ncooperation with the United Nations as a whole, and\ncertainly in tandem with the General Assembly, where\nall Member States of this Organization have a voice\nand a vote. After all, global peace and security concern\nall citizens of the world, not just the citizens of those\n21\n\ncountries who happen at any given time to hold seats\non the Security Council.\nFor the present, war and conflict loom large, and\nthis must be of concern to the Council. But we must\nhold out hope that we, the Member States of this\nOrganization, can make its constituent parts \u2014 the\nGeneral Assembly, the Economic and Social Council,\nthe development system and other organs and agencies,\nand particularly the Security Council \u2014 work together\nto substantially reduce, if not eliminate, war, conflict\nand crises.\nWe must also ask ourselves, what is the nature of\nthe membership that the Council requires to implement\nits mandate? Far more than any consideration, it is the\ncommitment \u2014 and I underscore the word\n\u201ccommitment\u201d \u2014 of the Council\u2019s membership,\npermanent or non-permanent, to enforcing its\ndecisions \u2014 all of them \u2014 to responding to situations\nthat threaten international peace and security wherever\nthey may arise and to combating the insidious spread\nof international terrorism that determines the success\nof the Council\u2019s work.\nWe can no longer posture and bicker while the\npeople of the world wait, particularly the people of the\ndeveloping world, who so desperately need the United\nNations. We must take the historic opportunity that this\nsixtieth anniversary presents to set our sights on a\ntwenty-first century world framed in the ideals\nenshrined in the Charter, a world of prosperity, peace\nand security, with a strong United Nations at its core.\nWe need the United Nations. It has the unmitigated\nsupport of the Government and people of Saint Lucia."

        "file_text": "I wish at the outset to\ncongratulate you on your election as President of the\nsixtieth session of the United Nations General\nAssembly and also for the excellent manner in which\nyou and your Bureau are steering the work of this\nsession. I would like to assure you of my delegation\u2019s\nfull support. I further commend His Excellency\nMr. Kofi Annan, our Secretary-General, for the\ndynamic and sterling leadership of the United Nations.\nThe theme of this session is germane to the\nproposals for reform of the Organization. There is the\nimperative of taking stock of its strengths and weaknesses\nso that we can create a better future. Within the context of\nthis theme, the Secretary-General, through his report\nentitled \u201cIn larger freedom\u201d, has made important\nproposals that will make the United Nations more\neffective and credible. The proposals aim at enabling the\nUnited Nations to provide the required leadership in the\nimplementation of the global development agenda and\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).\nMy country, Malawi, has followed closely the\ndebate on the report. I feel that, from the diverse\nopinions that have been expressed, a consensus is\nemerging on the need to implement United Nations\nreforms and make the Organization respond more\neffectively to the challenge of change.\nLet me, however, express the view that, in\naddition to the reform of the Security Council, there\nare other equally important reforms of the United\nNations that are critical to the realization of the global\ndevelopment agenda. I will turn to these later. For the\nmoment, it is critical that we remain focused so that all\nelements of the reform receive our undivided attention.\nMr. President, let me assure you that Malawi\nappreciates the role played by the international\ncommunity and the United Nations in the efforts to\neradicate poverty and promote development and\nprosperity for all. The just-ended High-level Plenary\nMeeting is one such initiative that offers great hopes\nfor the way forward. However, previous experience has\ntaught us that a lot is generally said and promised\nwithin the United Nations, but little or nothing is\ndelivered. It is my earnest hope that the outcome of\nthis session will not turn out to be another talk show.\nMalawi faces serious problems in instituting an\neffective system of political and economic governance.\n2\n\nMy country continues to face critical challenges in\ndetermining our political agenda, which in turn affect\nour development efforts. We still face extreme poverty,\nfood shortages, hunger and malnutrition. HIV/AIDS\ncontinues to claim more lives. Malaria is still killing\nmillions each year.\nOver and above these problems, we face\nmounting domestic and external debt, an unfair and\ninequitable global trading system and the prevalence of\nconflicts and political instability. We therefore feel that\nfor any United Nations reforms to be meaningful, we\nneed assistance in the areas of good governance.\nIn Malawi, we are promoting good governance by\npursuing sound macro-economic policies, reduction in\npublic expenditure, bench-marking the activities and\nperformance of the civil service and fighting corruption\nat all levels. We have also instituted effective reforms\nof the private sector, and through dialogue the business\ncommunity is now responding positively to economic\nand social reforms. In many of these reforms, I can say\nthat we have made a good beginning.\nIt is for this reason that my Government\nwelcomed the establishment of the African Peer\nReview Mechanism under the New Partnership for\nAfrica\u2019s Development (NEPAD) of the African Union.\nOur accession to the African Peer Review Mechanism\nis a manifestation of our desire to adopt policies and\npractices that emphasize accountability and\ntransparency in public sector management.\nMalawi has made efforts to implement the\nMillennium Development Goals. Our report, entitled\n\u201cMalawi and the Millennium Development Goals:\nchallenges and achievements\u201d, has been circulated.\nHowever, my country is facing severe constraints in\nimplementing the MDGs because we are allocating a\nsignificant amount of limited resources to servicing\nexternal debt and for managing the HIV/AIDS\npandemic, at the cost of the social and economic\ntransformation necessary to fight poverty.\nMalawi, therefore, supports the proposal to find\ncomprehensive and durable solutions to the external\ndebt problem. In this regard, we welcome the recent\nproposal by the G-8 to cancel 100 per cent of\noutstanding debt owed by 18 countries, including 14\nfrom Africa. I would like to appeal to all creditors to\nfollow this noble example, because debt cancellation\nhas the potential to assist the poor countries in\nachieving the MDGs and, hence, attaining national\neconomic recovery and economic transformation.\nAnother challenge for Malawi is that my country\nfinds it hard to be integrated into the global trading\nsystem, partly due to the lack of products that meet\nhigh quality standards, but also due to an unfair and\ninequitable global trading system. We therefore join the\nappeal for the speedy completion of the World Trade\nOrganization Doha Round of multilateral trade\nnegotiations in order to assist poor countries, such as\nMalawi, to benefit from global trade. Furthermore,\nthere is need to provide immediate duty-free and\nquota-free market access for all exports from the least\ndeveloped countries, including the elimination of all\nnon-tariff barriers, such as trade distorting subsidies\nand domestic support, especially in agriculture, by\ndeveloped countries.\nIn the African perspective, development efforts\nhave also been heavily undermined by the prevalence\nof conflicts and political instability in many parts of\nthe continent. Realizing this, we in Africa have taken\nbold and far-reaching initiatives to promote peace and\nsecurity on the continent. For instance, my own\ncountry, Malawi, has participated in peacekeeping\nactivities in Liberia, the Sudan and the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo.\nI commend the role played by the United Nations\nSecurity Council and the G-8 in supporting the African\nUnion\u2019s initiatives in conflict resolution and\nmanagement. I also wish to draw the attention of this\nAssembly to the fact that peacekeeping in Africa\nconstitutes the bulk of the Security Council\u2019s work. I\ntherefore earnestly believe that the role of the United\nNations in Africa can be enhanced by encouraging\nAfrica\u2019s representation in the Security Council. In that\nregard, Africa\u2019s call for the expansion of the Security\nCouncil should be supported by the international\ncommunity.\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic poses serious social\nand economic challenges to Africa. However, the\nGeneral Assembly may be interested to know that\nMalawi is one of the few success stories in managing\nthe HIV/AIDS pandemic. The people of Malawi have\nwelcomed the provision of voluntary counselling and\nof free anti-retroviral drugs. For instance, since the\nmiddle of last year, we have established more than 30\nanti-retroviral clinics throughout the country and have\ntreated many people. We expect that by this time next\n3\n\nyear, we will have been able to treat more than 80,000\npeople.\nI therefore welcome the call at the High-level\nPlenary Meeting to provide, as a priority, assistance for\nHIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment in African\ncountries on a grant basis. I also welcome the emphasis\nplaced on the need to encourage pharmaceutical\ncompanies to make anti-retroviral drugs affordable and\naccessible in Africa. My Government appeals for more\nfunding to enable us to adopt a holistic approach that\ntakes into account the medical, economic, political and\nsocial impacts of HIV/AIDS on the implementation of\nthe Millennium Development Goals.\nI take this opportunity to commend all countries\nthat continue to make contributions to the Global Fund\nto Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The Fund\nhas enabled Malawi to introduce free anti-retroviral\ntreatment programme for those infected by HIV/AIDS.\nIn terms of agriculture and food security, Malawi\nhas not fared well this year. My country is facing\nsevere food shortages owing to the drought that we\nhave had since January this year. As a result of a very\npoor harvest, we shall require approximately 270,000\nmetric tons to feed some 4.2 million people who will\nbe in need of food until the next harvest season,\nsometime in April or May next year. I therefore appeal\nto the world community to help us to obtain more food\nsources for our people.\nI am grateful for the pledges of relief food\nassistance made by our cooperating partners such as\nthe World Food Programme, the British Government,\nthe European Union, the Japanese Government, the\nUnited States Government, the Belgian Government\nand the Norwegian Government. We are also grateful\nto the Secretary-General for the special appeal he has\nmade for Southern Africa.\nI am pleased to announce that the people of\nMalawi are also doing something to feed themselves.\nWe have made provision in our budget to buy food for\nour people. We have also established a Feed-the-Nation\nFund, through which people in Malawi from all walks\nof life are making voluntary donations to purchase\nfood for the poorest of the poor. The response has been\noverwhelming.\nWith a view to a medium- to long-term solution,\nwe have adopted concrete policies aimed at reducing\nour dependence on rain-fed agriculture. We have\nestablished a full ministry responsible for water\ndevelopment and irrigation. We look forward to\ntechnical assistance from those countries that have\nexpertise in the area of irrigation.\nTurning to the subject of United Nations reform, I\nwish to bring to the attention of the General Assembly\nan important aspect of reform of the Organization,\nconcerning the determination of eligibility for United\nNations membership. As members are aware, the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights guarantees the\nright of all the world\u2019s peoples to belong to the United\nNations and that no country should be denied\nmembership in the Organization. Malawi believes that\nthe United Nations was founded on the principle of\ninclusivity in its membership.\nThat is why we in Malawi call for the admission\nof the Republic of China (Taiwan) as a Member of the\nUnited Nations. That request is made on the premise\nthat, following the collapse of communism in Eastern\nEurope and in the Soviet Union, the new States that\nemerged therefrom expressed their desire to become\nsovereign and independent Members of the United\nNations. They were granted membership. That was a\npolitical decision. In the same way, when the Socialist\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia broke up into the\nseparate States of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia,\nMacedonia, Serbia and Montenegro and Slovenia, each\nState was admitted into the United Nations. That also\nwas a political decision. Czechoslovakia broke up into\nthe Czech Republic and Slovakia, and each of those\nStates was admitted into the United Nations. In South-\nEast Asia, Singapore pulled out of the Federation of\nMalaya and became a Member of the United Nations.\nLater, East Timor broke away from Indonesia and was\nalso admitted as a Member. Those were political\ndecisions.\nThe Government of Malawi is therefore puzzled\nthat the Republic of China (Taiwan), which took a\nsimilar political decision, is denied membership in the\nUnited Nations. How can the United Nations stand for\nequity and justice when it is denying membership to\nmore than 23 million people who contribute\nsignificantly to global trade and development? How\ncan the United Nations justify its denial of membership\nto Taiwan when, in fact, the countries listed above\nwere admitted? Why is Taiwan being discriminated\nagainst in the United Nations?\n4\n\nUnless those questions are honestly answered,\nobservers will conclude that the United Nations is\napplying a double standard. The Government of\nMalawi believes that the United Nations should use the\nsame standard to grant membership to the Republic of\nChina. I therefore appeal to the United Nations,\nthrough you, Mr. President, to extend membership to\nthe Taiwanese people in the same way as it has done\nfor countries of Eastern Europe and South-East Asia.\nThat would enable the dynamic and resourceful people\nof Taiwan to play their rightful role in global affairs,\nindustrialization, trade and development. I believe that\nthe admission of the Republic of China (Taiwan) into\nthe United Nations would also bring credibility to the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights.\nLong live the United Nations!"

        "file_text": "I am indeed greatly\nhonoured to join those who preceded me in\ncongratulating the President on his election to the\npresidency of the sixtieth session of the General\nAssembly. I assure him of Grenada's support as he\nguides the deliberations during this historic year\ntowards the promotion and maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. My delegation would\nalso like to express its appreciation to Mr. Jean Ping,\nwho laboured assiduously during his presidency of the\nfifty-ninth session, for his tireless efforts in guiding the\npreparatory work for the High-level Plenary Meeting.\nIn addition, Grenada commends the Secretary-General\nfor his energetic pursuit of change at the United\nNations. We subscribe to the Secretary-General's view\nthat the world cannot be a safer place without\ndevelopment and poverty eradication.\nPermit me, at this juncture, to extend, on behalf\nof the Government and people of Grenada, empathy\nand profound sympathy to the Government and people\nof the United States of America, particularly those of\nthe Gulf states, for the loss of life and severe\ndestruction of property suffered as a result of\nHurricane Katrina.\nWhen the Millennium Declaration was adopted,\nmany viewed it as a landmark document containing the\nblueprint for the eradication of poverty and as a vehicle\nto transform the condition of humankind in the twenty-\nfirst century. While it did not take on the momentum\nthat we had hoped for, we have now moved to review\nits implementation. This year, the outcome document\nadopted by heads of State and Government at the\nconclusion of the High-level Plenary Meeting gives us\nanother chance to address in earnest the commitments\nthat were made in the Millennium Declaration and at\nmajor United Nations conferences.\nGrenada is heartened by the recent renewal of\ncommitment to development and security, including\npoverty eradication and the endorsement to positively\ntransform the world for the betterment of our peoples.\nWe also welcome the efforts made to address the\nspecial needs of Africa. Those are high ideals, but we\nare convinced that peace, security and prosperity can\nonly be achieved globally with the commitment,\n5\n\nsacrifice and concerted, cooperative efforts of all\nMember States.\nWe welcome the creation of a Peacebuilding\nCommission to ensure post-conflict recovery where it\nis most needed, and especially to focus on issues\nrelating to women and children within that process.\nGrenada also supports the strengthening of the human\nrights machinery through the creation of a Human\nRights Council, and we resolve to participate in the\nnegotiations to establish a working mandate for that\nbody during the sixtieth session of the Assembly.\nGrenada welcomes the outcome document's\nstrong condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and\nmanifestations. We regret, however, that there has been\nno meaningful progress on the issue of disarmament\nand non-proliferation and call for continued\nnegotiations in that regard.\nReform is vital in order for this unique\nOrganization to reflect the aspirations of its 191\nMember States. It is extremely important that the\nUnited Nations address the burning issues and realities\nthat preoccupy the global community. Grenada fully\nsupports the measures called for in the Secretary-\nGeneral's report, \\\"In larger freedom\\\" (A/59/2005), and\nremains convinced of the usefulness of addressing\npeace and security on a broad spectrum.\nGrenada agrees that Security Council reform is\nimperative. The Council must be expanded in a manner\nthat will convince every region of the world that they\nhave an active voice in one of the most important and\npowerful organs of the United Nations.\nGrenada, like the other countries of the English-\nspeaking Caribbean, places a high priority on the\nreorganization of the Economic and Social Council.\nThe Charter clearly designed the Economic and Social\nCouncil to address development. In the twenty-first\ncentury, therefore, the Economic and Social Council\nmust have, as the outcome document states, a more\nfocused agenda built around the major themes\ncontained in the Millennium Declaration.\nThe theme for this year's deliberations is well\nchosen and we accept the challenge to work towards\nthat goal. Grenada hopes that United Nations reform\nand the implementation of the goals set out in the\noutcome document will come to fruition soon, in order\nto ensure a stronger Organization and a more just\nworld.\nMy country, Grenada, knows quite well the\nchallenges faced by developing countries. In less than\none year Grenada experienced two hurricanes, causing\ninfrastructural damage amounting to 250 per cent of\nour gross domestic product (GDP), crippling the\ntourism sector, increasing unemployment to 31 per cent\nand having an immeasurable psychological and social\nimpact on our population.\nPrior to those events, Grenada was well on track\nto achieve the Millennium Development Goals\n(MDGs) of universal primary education, lowering child\nmortality rates, and reducing the poverty rate by half.\nAlso high on our country's agenda was the\nimplementation of policies to combat diseases,\nincluding HIV/AIDS. Today, even with the most\nrigorous national efforts, if Grenada is to achieve the\nMDGs, it can only do so with substantial financial and\ntechnical assistance.\nCurrently, countries of the Caribbean face\ngrowing unemployment and poverty because of the\nrecent World Trade Organization ruling that resulted in\nthe removal of preferential arrangements that once\nfacilitated our trade. As a direct result, two of the\nindustries most vital to the Caribbean \u00f3 bananas and\nsugar \u00f3 are rapidly declining, sending thousands to\nthe bread line and abject poverty. Here, I would refer to\nthe statement made yesterday by the Prime Minister of\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, which confirmed the effects that\nthe demise of the sugar industry is having on his\ncountry.\nCountries of the Caribbean require more than just\naid; for aid alone cannot eradicate poverty. What\nCaribbean countries desire most fervently are trading\nopportunities. We crave opportunities that will\nrecognize the diversities and disparities in the\neconomic world. Given our disadvantageous\neconomies of scale, our limited land mass and our late\nadmission into the international economic order, it is\nimpossible to make progress without special\nconcessions.\nGrenada has no desire to see its future\ngenerations become mendicants, seized by poverty and\na lack of opportunities. The MDGs, as well as United\nNations declarations, constitute a global partnership for\ndevelopment. Both the developed and developing\ncountries are called upon to implement changes and\nadjust their modus operandi to advance a more secure\nand just world.\n6\n\nWe applaud the European Union for its decision\nto increase its overseas development assistance to the\nrecommended 0.7 per cent of their GDP. However, we\nurge them and other developed countries to continue to\nprovide freedom in trade with developing countries, in\norder to facilitate the transfer of technology and to\nassist with our environmental protection.\nThose of us in the developing world have also\ngiven our commitment to devise national policies to\nimprove the standard of living of our people, promote\neducation, practice good governance and strive for\nbetter health care for all. That, however, is virtually\nimpossible in the current international economic\nclimate, as some international regimes seem committed\nto crippling the economies of developing countries, in\nparticular those of the Caribbean.\nHurricanes and other natural disasters add to the\nCaribbean region's challenges and remain a very real\nand formidable enemy. Grenada acknowledges that\nnatural disasters are unavoidable phenomena that\ncannot be stopped. However, we can mitigate their\neffects, ease human suffering with sound measures and\nspeed up recovery by designing mechanisms conducive\nto quick responses, particularly from the international\ncommunity. From hurricanes to tsunamis, from floods\nto droughts, we have come to realize that natural\ndisasters know no boundaries and do not differentiate\nbetween developed and developing countries. In the\nlight of scientific predictions that indicate an increase\nin the frequency and intensity of natural disasters, we\nmust address this matter and give disaster mitigation a\nhigh priority on our agenda.\nI recall that during his address to the Millennium\nSummit five years ago, the Prime Minister of Grenada,\nthe Right Honourable Keith Mitchell, joined his\ncolleagues in making a clarion call for the\nestablishment of a disaster relief fund to facilitate\nquick responses to aid victims of hurricanes,\nearthquakes, volcanoes and other natural disasters that\nstrike us with such frequency and ferocity. I wish to\nreiterate that call today in light of the realities that now\nsurround us.\nSome countries, particularly small island\ndeveloping States, are extremely vulnerable and can\nexperience a complete reversal of economic, social,\ncultural and infrastructural progress with the passage\nof one natural disaster, as was evident when Grenada\nwas struck by Hurricane Ivan in September of 2004.\nFor small islands it is exceedingly difficult to stop the\ndownward spiral that disasters can cause. Generally,\nrecovery is virtually impossible without major\ninternational assistance.\nGrenada welcomes the reference made to the\nvulnerabilities of small island developing States. We\nlook forward to the effective implementation of the\nMauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of\nthe Programme of Action for the Sustainable\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States in the\nvery near future. Grenada implores Member States to\nsupport the call of small island developing States for\nspecial recognition of their vulnerabilities.\nIn the same vein, I turn now to the issue of the\nCaribbean Sea. Our economies derive tremendous\nbenefits from the resources of the Caribbean Sea. In\nfact, the annual estimate of the economic value to\nGrenada of production from the sea is more than 30\nmillion Eastern Caribbean dollars. That is a\ncontribution that we as a people strongly feel must be\nconserved, preserved, maintained and protected, not\nmerely for this generation, but for future generations.\nI would like specifically to refer to the trans-\nshipment of radioactive materials through our waters,\nwhich continues to pose a tremendous threat to the\nhuman health, marine life, ecosystems, tourism and\neconomies of the region. As has been repeatedly\naffirmed by Grenada and other Caribbean Community\nmember States, that practice must stop. Grenada once\nagain calls on those concerned to desist from such\nactivity. We welcome the reference made in the\noutcome document in that regard, and further urge the\ninternational community to be more cognizant of the\nsituation and its impact on our economies and our\npeoples. Since this matter is of grave importance to the\nCaribbean region, we will continue our efforts to have\nthe Caribbean Sea designated as a Special Area in the\ncontext of sustainable development.\nFinally, judging from the commitments made\nover the past few days, it is clearly evident that\nMember States are willing to take up the challenge to\nimplement the necessary reforms to strengthen this\nbody. We too pledge our full support to that process,\ndespite the bleak economic realities we currently face."

        "file_text": "The recently concluded\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting has rekindled the hopes\nand aspirations of humanity for enduring peace,\nsecurity and development. The outcome document\n(resolution 60/1) is a testimony to our shared vision,\ncollective wisdom and renewed commitment to global\npartnership to address the most pressing challenges of\nthe twenty-first century. The commitments to eradicate\npoverty, to resolutely fight against terrorism and to\nbring about the timely reform of the United Nations as\nthe pivot of multilateralism, can be achieved and\ntranslated into action only by our working together.\nThe outcome document has reaffirmed the\nworld\u2019s topmost priority \u2014 combating terrorism \u2014 as\nthe most pressing global issue. Terrorism is not just the\nproblem of a few countries; it is a threat to world peace\nand stability. In today\u2019s interconnected and interlinked\nworld, terrorism does not remained confined within\ngeographical borders. Its reverberations have been felt\nfar and wide. As every act of terrorism defies basic\nhuman values, we must deal it with resolutely, firmly\nand comprehensively, without double standards or\nselective interpretations.\nAs a country that has been suffering from\nsenseless and brutal terrorism for a decade, Nepal\nunequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and\nmanifestations and supports the early conclusion of a\ncomprehensive convention against international\nterrorism.\n14\n\nHis Majesty the King\u2019s commitment to multiparty\ndemocracy is unflinching and total. His Majesty is\ndetermined to re-energize multiparty democratic\ninstitutions by restoring sustainable peace and making\ndemocracy meaningful, mature, cultured and refined.\nTo that end, we will be holding municipal elections by\nApril 2006, to be followed by national parliamentary\nelections within two years. That will be an important\nstep forward in re-energizing our democratic\ninstitutions through free and fair elections. I urge the\ncountries and organizations which support democracy\nto come forward and help us to conduct free and fair\nelections. His Majesty\u2019s Government is ready to\nwelcome international observers for the elections.\nDemocracy has been sustained not only as a system of\ngovernance but also as a way of life in all parts of the\nworld.\nThe beauty of our planet lies in its diversity. We\nreaffirm the acknowledgement in paragraph 135 of the\noutcome document that, while democracies share\ncommon features, there is no single model of\ndemocracy. Sovereign countries and peoples must be\nallowed to have every right to choose the system of\ndemocratic governance that is suitable to their needs\nand aspirations.\nHis Majesty King Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah\nDev recently stated that the use of force alone is not a\nsolution, and that the solution rather lies in talks. We\nare convinced that lasting peace can be achieved only\nthrough dialogue based on trust and confidence. But\nany overture must be credible and sincere enough to\ndispel all doubts and suspicions surrounding it. This is\nour principled position: to work with all constitutional\nforces in efforts towards establishing durable peace and\nstability in our country.\nHis Majesty\u2019s Government has initiated\nprogrammes to alleviate the plight of people suffering\nas a result of conflict. The Government has accorded\ntop priority to implementing programmes for broad-\nbased economic growth, social inclusion, anti-\ncorruption efforts and the speedy delivery of essential\nservices to needy people. Special relief package\nprogrammes are being carried in an integrated manner\nto the areas hit by conflict; these include food, shelter,\nhealth, education and the rehabilitation of persons\ninternally displaced due to terrorist violence.\nInternational peace and security can be\nmaintained only in an atmosphere of mutual\nunderstanding, trust and confidence. Nepal has always\nstressed that the international community must make\ngenuine efforts for the general and complete\ndisarmament of all weapons of mass destruction,\nincluding biological, chemical, nuclear and\nradiological weapons, in a time-bound manner.\nHowever, the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction and slow progress in global disarmament\nnegotiations have weakened hopes for a safer and more\nsecure world.\nWe firmly believe that regional mechanisms,\nincluding the establishment of United Nations regional\ncentres for peace and disarmament in various parts of\nthe world, can make a significant contribution to global\ndisarmament efforts by enhancing confidence-building.\nOur commitment is reflected in Nepal\u2019s ardent desire\nto relocate the United Nations Regional Centre for\nPeace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific to\nKathmandu at the earliest possible date and to\ncontinuously pursue the Kathmandu process as a part\nof the world disarmament campaign.\nThe role of the United Nations in peacekeeping,\npeacemaking and post-conflict peacebuilding has\nassumed great significance over the years. Nepal has\nbeen continuously participating in United Nations\npeacekeeping operations since 1958 and has already\ncontributed more than 50,000 peacekeepers to 29\nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions. With its current\ndeployment of around 3,500 peacekeepers in 13\npeacekeeping missions, Nepal ranks among the top five\ncountries contributing troops to the United Nations\npeacekeeping missions. The sacrifice of the lives of 54\nNepali peacekeepers in the service of humanity in\ndifficult conflict zones around the world stands as\ntestimony to their dedication to the cause of world\npeace.\nNepalese Blue Helmets have earned international\nrepute for their dedication, discipline, impartiality and\nprofessionalism in the discharge of their duties. This is\nreflected in the inclusion of a Nepali peacekeeper in\nthe United Nations team that went to Stockholm to\nreceive the Nobel Peace Prize, and in the several\nexcellent honours and awards that have been accorded\nto them, the most recent being in the Central African\nState of Burundi. Over the years, our peacekeepers\nhave also been involved in peacebuilding,\nreconstruction and rehabilitation exercises in various\nUnited Nations missions.\n15\n\nNepal welcomes the establishment of a\nPeacebuilding Commission as an intergovernmental\nadvisory body. This, we believe, will be instrumental to\nUnited Nations efforts in effecting sustained recovery\nand reconstruction and will provide guidance and\nassistance in laying the foundation for lasting peace in\ncountries emerging from conflict. The Commission\u2019s\nmission, objectives and goals should be clearly\ndefined; there should be equitable representation from\namong the troop-contributing countries; and the\nCommission should be adequately funded.\nNepal is unswervingly committed to the\nprinciples and purposes of the United Nations Charter\nand its contribution to the maintenance of international\npeace and security. After almost two decades, Nepal is\nseeking non-permanent membership of the Security\nCouncil for the period 2007-2008; we have an earnest\ndesire to contribute to the Council in its important role\nin the maintenance of international peace and security.\nI take this opportunity to renew our appeal to Member\nStates for their invaluable support to Nepal in the\nelections slated for next year.\nNepal is fully committed to the protection and\npromotion of human rights. We view all human rights\nas universal, indivisible and interdependent. I wish to\nreiterate His Majesty\u2019s Government\u2019s commitment to\nthe implementation of human rights instruments and\ninternational humanitarian law through the\nstrengthening of national human rights institutions and\nthrough full cooperation with United Nations human\nrights mechanisms. The human rights situation in\nNepal needs to be properly understood in the context of\nthe unabated violence perpetrated by the terrorists. The\ntendency to equate the constitutional duty of the\nGovernment to protect the lives and property of\nordinary citizens with that of the dreadful acts of the\nterrorists needs to be corrected. The terrorists have\nexceeded all norms and values by resorting to the most\nheinous acts of violence, indiscriminate killings, the\nmaiming and abduction of innocent civilians,\nkidnapping and the forceful recruitment of children as\nsoldiers and extortion and intimidation of the civilian\npopulation.\nWe have been providing asylum to more than\n100,000 Bhutanese refugees on humanitarian grounds\nfor a decade and a half. His Majesty\u2019s Government has\nshown its honesty and sincerity and has walked the\nextra mile for the solution of the refugee problem\nthrough a bilateral process. We strongly believe that\nsincere implementation of bilateral agreements will\nlead to a lasting solution of the problem. We believe\nthat a lasting solution to the refugee problem will have\na salutary impact on Nepal-Bhutan relations, which\nemanate from monarchical cultures.\nNepal\u2019s peace and stability have a great bearing\nnot only on its own people but also on its neighbours\nand on South Asia and beyond. A stable, peaceful and\nprosperous Nepal, small in size but strategically\nlocated, can greatly contribute to maintaining\nsustainable peace, stability and prosperity in the region\nand beyond.\nThe world has seen that peace and stability in the\nworld community cannot be guaranteed without the\npeace, stability and prosperity of smaller and\nvulnerable States. Therefore, the international\ncommunity must come forward to help countries with\nspecial needs, such as least developed and landlocked\ndeveloping countries, to help them achieve peace,\nstability and prosperity. The new international financial\nand development architecture should, therefore,\naddress the legitimate interests and aspirations of those\ncountries.\nWe call upon the developed countries to augment\nthe level of official development assistance (ODA) and\nto provide better market access, increased foreign\ndirect investment and substantial debt relief measures\nto alleviate the hardships of developing countries,\nespecially the least developed and the landlocked ones.\nWe urge the international community to come forward\nwith technical assistance to meet the special needs of\nthe small, landlocked and fragile States with special\nchallenges emanating from terrorism and natural\ndisasters.\nNepal\u2019s location between the two fastest-growing\neconomies \u2014 India and China \u2014 provides us with\ntremendous opportunities for economic growth and\ndevelopment. We have proposed Nepal as a transit\npoint between our two neighbours, acting as a bridge\nbetween them to realize their full economic potential.\nNepal firmly believes that only a strengthened\nand revitalized United Nations can address the\nmultitude of challenges of the contemporary world.\nTimely reform and necessary restructuring of the\nUnited Nations, preserving and promoting the\ncentrality and sanctity of the principles and purposes\nenshrined in the Charter, are needed to make the world\nbody more robust and vibrant. Nepal has always looked\n16\n\nto the United Nations as a torchbearer for peace,\nsecurity and the dignity of nations. It is also our firm\nview that United Nations reform should give more\nemphasis to strengthening the Organization\u2019s role in\npromoting international cooperation for the economic\nand social development of Member States, particularly\nthe developing countries.\nNepal has consistently supported the reform of\nthe Security Council, including its method of work, to\nmake it more representative, transparent and\naccountable, in order to reflect present-day realities.\nWe have also maintained that the General Assembly, as\nthe principal deliberative organ of the United Nations,\nneeds to be further strengthened.\nThe six-decade-long journey of the United\nNations has been arduous and at times even\ntumultuous. It has seen high expectations, deep\nfrustration and the harsh realities of realpolitik but has\nnever floundered or wavered from its noble objectives.\nThis year marks the fiftieth year of Nepal\u2019s\nmembership of the United Nations. Since we joined the\nUnited Nations, on 14 December 1955, Nepal has\ncherished its association with the world body and has\nplayed an active role in its activities. The Nepali\npeople are proud of their association with the world\nbody and are celebrating the occasion in a special way\nbefitting its significance. Nepal acknowledges its\nsincere appreciation of the United Nations and its\nvarious specialized agencies for their most valuable\ncontribution to our socio-economic development\nendeavours.\nWe reaffirm our solemn pledge to the Charter of\nthe United Nations and renew our unwavering\ncommitment to make the Organization more equitable,\ncredible and relevant to face effectively the challenges\nof the twenty-first century."

I wish you every success in\ncarrying out your noble mandate and assure you of my\ndelegation\u2019s full cooperation. I pay a warm tribute to\nyour predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping,\nMinister of State and Minister for Foreign Affairs,\nCooperation and Francophonie of the Gabonese\nRepublic. His great talent, consummate negotiating\nskill and competence contributed decisively to the\nsuccess of the work of the fifty-ninth session. To the\nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, I\nonce again express Cameroon\u2019s full appreciation for\nhis tireless efforts and dedication in the service of the\nOrganization and its ideals.\nAt your wise suggestion, Mr. President, the main\ntheme of our debate is the implementation and follow-\nup of the outcome document (resolution 60/1) of the\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly.\nThat reflects the great importance of this debate \u2014\nimportance clearly shown by the strong participation in\nit. My country is pleased to add its voice to those of the\nrepresentatives of 184 other countries, who have\nalready spoken during this exercise.\nCameroon fully supports the outcome document\nadopted at the end of that historic summit. Some would\nhave preferred that it be stronger, others that it be more\nproactive. Cameroon believes it is a balanced and\nrealistic document with regard to all the major global\nconcerns now considered to be priorities. Furthermore,\nit is a document that reflects a new consensus on the\nrole of the United Nations and its place in today\u2019s\ninternational system.\nOur heads of State or Government took stock of\nthe main challenges of our time and of the priority\nactions that we must take together to build a genuine\nglobal partnership for development and to ensure\nlasting collective peace and security. They also set out\nguidelines to be followed over the next decade to\ncomplete the whole United Nations renewal process\nand the effective achievement of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). The time has come to\nmove from words to action. Indeed, it is only by\nimplementing those commitments that we can measure\ntheir value, force and relevance.\nIt is indisputable that the world has made\nconsiderable progress in implementing some of the\nMDGs. But there is another undeniable fact that is far\nless encouraging: the situation in Africa. Africa is the\nworld\u2019s only region that, with 10 years until the\ndeadline, is alarmingly behind in implementing the\nMDGs. If it does not receive substantial external\nassistance very soon, most of the Goals will not be\nattained by 2015. Most of them may remain a mirage\nfor a long time.\nWe are aware that the current economic growth\nrate in our countries averages approximately 3 per cent\n. That is not sufficient to create the macroeconomic\nconditions necessary to achieve the MDGs. Today \u2014\nparticularly in sub-Saharan Africa \u2014 without large-\nscale job creation, revenue creation, a massive inflow\nof private capital or official development assistance, an\neffective global and sustainable solution to the nagging\nissue of debt, and equitable participation in world\ntrade, our efforts will be doomed to failure.\nFor their part, the Governments of African\ncountries, who have the primary responsibility for their\nown development, are implementing national poverty\n34\n\nreduction strategies in keeping with the need to achieve\nthe MDGs. With specific regard to Cameroon, the\nGovernment is tackling that with determination.\nFurthermore, the implementation of its Poverty\nReduction Strategy Paper is supported by the donor\ncommunity.\nMy country has begun to review its strategy to\nensure that it is fully in line with the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals. It is also implementing, with the\nsame determination, its national programme of\ngovernance. Thus, the Government of Cameroon has\nstepped up its efforts to combat corruption and has\ncommitted itself to a more transparent and effective\nmanagement of public finances.\nMy country would have liked to see more\nambitious and courageous commitments adopted\ntogether with a specific timetable for the development\nof Africa. Nevertheless, if the commitments made by\nworld leaders in the outcome document are speedily\nimplemented, Africa would make considerable\nprogress in implementing most of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals and could even \u2014 depending on\nthe adequate mobilization of national and external\nresources and the political will to take action \u2014\nachieve all those goals by the agreed date.\nDuring a recent crisis, the United Nations was\nnearly shaken to its very foundations. During those\nevents, our sometimes differing views about our\nsystem of peace and collective security became openly\napparent. Fortunately, given the need to overcome all\nthe global threats that weigh on our collective security,\nthe summit reached a healthy consensus on the\nessential nature of joint actions that we need to take for\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes, counteracting\nterrorism and the maintenance and consolidation of\npeace.\nNonetheless, the process of revitalizing the\nOrganization will remain incomplete until we are able\nto agree on the enlargement of the Security Council.\nMay I recall that, as the President of Cameroon, His\nExcellence Mr. Paul Biya, declared on 14 September,\nCameroon remains faithful to the African position on\nreform of the Security Council. This reform is\nnecessary and must take place soon, bringing nations\ntogether rather than dividing them. This is the firm\nconviction of Cameroon, and my country will continue,\nhowever long it takes, to work with other States to\novercome our differences and forge a solid consensus\nin order to achieve this very important reform.\nRecourse to law for the peaceful settlement of\ndisputes has, necessarily, as a corollary, the obligation\nto implement fully, willingly and in good faith the\ndecisions of the International Court of Justice. This is\nhow we understand the reference made in the outcome\ndocument concerning \u201cthe obligation of States to settle\ntheir disputes by peaceful means in accordance with\nChapter VI of the Charter, including, when appropriate,\nby the use of the International Court of Justice\u201d\n(resolution 60/1, para. 73).\nImplementation of a decision of a court through\npositive negotiations is based first and foremost on a\npeaceful course of action, specifically on the basis of a\ndeep commitment to the values and principles\nenshrined in the Charter. In no case may that be\ninterpreted as an open possibility to renounce even\npartially the fundamental elements of that decision.\nVery much to the contrary.\nThe outcome document of the High-level Plenary\nMeeting allows for coordinating the activities of the\nprincipal bodies of the Organization within the\nframework of their mandate under the Charter for the\nprevention of armed conflicts and settlement of\ndisputes. Cameroon therefore believes it desirable that\nwe should find ways to ensure that Member States,\nthrough the Security Council and in the General\nAssembly, are informed formally of the status of\nimplementation of judgements handed down by the\nInternational Court of Justice, as they are of the\nCourt\u2019s annual activities.\nThe Secretary-General could thus inform the\nSecurity Council regularly and in detail and report to\nMember States as is done in his report to the General\nAssembly on the activities of the Organization.\nGood practices in this area would take root and\ninspire us all. In that way, we would be able to identify\npotential sources of conflict at a very early stage\nthrough difficulties identified and to make timely\nrecommendations to prevent them.\nCameroon, which looks forward to the rapid\ncreation of the Peacebuilding Commission and the\nHuman Rights Council, counts on your wisdom to\nensure that the negotiating process that will lead to\ntheir creation will be open, transparent and inclusive.\n35\n\nDuring the present session, which coincides with\nthe Organization\u2019s sixtieth anniversary, we should be\ninspired by the visionary dynamism provided by the\nheads of State and Government. This is a new\nopportunity, perhaps one of the best opportunities,\nalong with the Millennium Summit, to make a decisive\ncontribution to improving the human condition and\nachieving an ideal world where all women, men and\nchildren live free from fear, hunger and disease.\nIt is our responsibility here and now to fulfil the\ngenerous promises made by our leaders to humanity a\nweek ago. Let us do so without making excuses,\nwithout seeking loopholes. Let us do it now."

The Holy See, having\nfollowed the outcome document's development closely,\nwelcomes much of what is proposed. However, the\nlack of consensus on arms control and non-\nproliferation issues is regrettable.\nI should also like to add at the outset that the\nHoly See understands the references to both the Cairo\nInternational Conference on Population and\nDevelopment and the outcome of the Fourth World\nConference on Women, held in Beijing, and to\nreproductive health found in paragraphs 57 (g), 58 and\n58 (c) in the sense that it set out in its reservations and\nstatements of interpretation at those Conferences, that\nis, as applying to a holistic concept of health that does\nnot consider abortion or access to abortion as a\ndimension of those terms. These caveats aside, the\ndocument is a basis for implementation and ongoing\ndiscussions on United Nations reform.\nDue to the human tragedies of genocide, war\ncrimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity,\nthe \\\"responsibility to protect\\\", as reflected in the\noutcome document, has, for humanitarian reasons,\ngained more acceptance. Its definitive legal\nformulation could greatly contribute to the enrichment\nnot only of international law but also of sincere\nsolidarity among nations. To identify carefully and\nhonestly the causes of such man-made disasters is\nindispensable to creating more timely prevention\nmeasures. Protection of those in distress and assistance\nto them go hand in hand with lucid analysis and public\nawareness of the causes of humanitarian crises.\nThe silence of the outcome document regarding\ndisarmament and non-proliferation is worrying.\nNuclear armament is simply devastating for people and\nfor the environment; it destroys people's lives and the\nsubstratum of every decent economy. We therefore\nmust insist upon nuclear non-proliferation. Likewise,\nwe must insist on complete nuclear disarmament and a\nstrengthened International Atomic Energy Agency\nverification and safeguards system. No effort should be\nspared to discourage not only the production of nuclear\nweapons but also any trade or exchange in such\nmaterials.\nOf course, a secure world will not just be free of\nthe menace of war: it will be one where sustainable\nhuman development is also assured, through sound\nglobal governance. But, while global governance has a\nlogic of its own, it lacks its own ethics, something\nwhich the world's nations must supply. We live in an\ninterdependent but fragile society and, in many places,\npeople's best interests are not served well. I should like\nto mention here but three specific areas of ethical\nchallenge in this regard: solidarity with the poor, the\npromotion of the common good, and a sustainable\nenvironment.\nSmall gains made in this last area remain under\nrisk from, among other things, climate change, new\ndiseases, the irresponsible destruction of forests, water\npollution, depletion of fish stocks, the destruction of\nglobal commons such as the oceans, and so on. It is\nestimated that 15 out of 24 essential services provided\nby ecosystems are being used unsustainably. The\nenormity of today's environmental challenge obliges us\nto rethink our notions of interdependence, global\ncooperation and our common responsibility for the\nstewardship of the planet. Differences on how to\naddress challenges should not stop agreement on the\nidentification of specific environmental threats and\ncommon measures to tackle them.\nAnother core principle needs to be set out in the\nform of the proper devolution of power to local levels\nto ensure greater effectiveness and accountability,\nknown also as subsidiarity. The application of this\nprinciple would foster a genuine respect for the rights\nof nations and for the significance of culture, balancing\nparticularism and universalism. Global governance also\nhas to address the democracy deficit in order to assure\nglobalization without marginalization.\nIn this context, the United Nations becomes the\nprojection of the hope for peace and well-being in the\nworld. To fulfil this high calling, which is proper to the\nOrganization's nature and function, will require clear\ncharacteristics of leadership, the courage of the\nOrganization and those who are part of it and a\ncommon vision for its leaders, collaborators and\ninterlocutors at every level, so that they may succeed in\nfinding the right road to achieve the goals in view.\n30\n\nOn the subject of the Human Rights Council, a\nreform that improves upon the present arrangements is\nto be welcomed. International law and its institutions\nare vital for the application and enforcement of human\nrights. Likewise, we should not lose sight of the\nimportance that the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights attaches to the incorporation of its principles\ninto national law and to education in fostering a rights-\nrespecting culture. Promotion and enforcement of\nhuman rights at the national level and constant\nattention to education will continue to be indispensable\nto allow those rights to flourish in the new system.\nThe international community, the happy\npossessor of the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights since 1948, appears, however, in the meantime\nto have forgotten that not only essential human rights\nbut also human duties underpin the Declaration. These\nduties establish the framework in which our rights are\ncontained, so that the latter are not simply exercised\nupon a whim. The reference to duties in the Universal\nDeclaration reminds us that rights usually entail\nresponsibilities; and that if we expect our own rights to\nbe respected, we must respect the rights of others.\nIndeed, the Declaration's recognition of the\ninterdependence of rights and duties was one of the key\nfeatures that enabled it to win consensus from nations\nEast and West, North and South. Today, when\nglobalization has rendered us more interdependent than\never, a greater sense of universal human duties would\nbenefit the cause of peace, because awareness of our\nmutual responsibility acknowledges duties as being\nessential to a social order which does not depend upon\nthe will or the power of any individual or group.\nThe question has resurfaced of how there can be\nuniversal rights in view of the diversity among\ncultures. Some maintain that all rights are culturally\nrelative; others claim that universal rights are just\ninstruments of a given cultural imperialism; and some\nbelieve the gulf between those two positions cannot be\nbridged. My delegation, however, shares the faith of\nthe principal framers of the Universal Declaration, that\ncertain values are so fundamental that they can find\nsupport in the moral and philosophical traditions of\ncultures. For that reason, such universal principles or\nbasic human rights are undeniable. In their essential\ncore they have to be universally recognized and must\nbe operative erga omnes. To reject the idea that basic\nrights are relative, however, does not require one to\nreject a legitimate pluralism in their implementation.\nQuite the contrary, for pluralism is the only way to\nmove beyond the sterile relativism-imperialism debate.\nThe Holy See, on the basis of its own long\nexperience in seeing how a common core of principles\ncan take root and flourish in vastly different cultures,\naffirms the wisdom of the drafters of the Universal\nDeclaration in this respect. The framework they\nfashioned is flexible enough to allow for differences in\nemphasis and implementation, but not so malleable as\nto permit any basic human right to be completely\neclipsed or unnecessarily subordinated for the sake of\nother rights. Regrettably, the legitimately pluralist\napproach to basic rights is sometimes forgotten, but it\nmust be retrieved if we are to avoid a top-down,\nhomogenizing vision of human rights.\nIn the wake of recent acts of terrible violence,\ncalls have come from various quarters to promote\ngreater understanding among religions, cultures and\ncivilizations. The Holy See supports the initiatives in\nthe field of interfaith cooperation and dialogue among\ncivilizations, especially where, in the spirit of their\nreference to and reliance on God, they form\nconsciences, foster common moral values and promote\nintercultural understanding and proactive\ncommitments. Those tasks require continued\nevaluation with regard to motivation, policies, laws and\ninstitutions. It is the mission of civil and religious\nleaders to be a source of inspiration, support and\nguidance for all people of good will who strive towards\nsustainable peace.\nThe Holy See also understands that there is a\nparticular type of interreligious dialogue in which\nreligious representatives and their constituents engage\nin discussion on the theological and spiritual tenets of\ntheir respective religions and exchange positive\nexperiences with a view to promoting mutual\nunderstanding and respect among all. That type of\ndialogue does not appear to be part of the United\nNations Charter and is therefore better left to religious\nexperts and appropriate representatives of religions.\nNevertheless, the United Nations can make a valid and\nimportant contribution to interfaith cooperation for\npeace and development.\nIn concluding, I should like to add a word of\nacknowledgement of the important contribution that\nthe United Nations staff makes to the Organization in\nits efforts to promote harmony and solidarity among\npeoples. Likewise, I should like to express once again\nto you, Sir, the best wishes and support of my\ndelegation as you look ahead to an important and\nfruitful presidency of the General Assembly."

        "file_text": "At the outset I wish to \nexpress my congratulations to you, Sir, on your \nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \nits sixtieth session. Rest assured that you have the full \nsupport and cooperation of the Ukrainian delegation. \nLet me also pay tribute to your predecessor, His \nExcellency Mr. Jean Ping, for his tireless efforts in the \npreparation of the world summit. \n The world summit of 2005 has just come to its \nconclusion. Its outcome document (resolution 60/1) \nprovides us with clear guidelines. It is our common \ntask to implement ambitious goals for building a safer \nand more prosperous world.  \n In talking about implementation I wish to \nemphasize two key elements indispensable for the \nfollow-up activities of the United Nations and, indeed, \nfor the success of the global peace endeavour. They are \ncredibility and democracy \u2014 or rather, credibility \nbased on democracy. We know that the way ahead is \nbeset with serious threats and challenges. We have to \nmake sure that a lack of unity is not among those \nchallenges. Every nation likes to sing its own song. It \ntakes our fundamental values and a great deal of \nhuman wisdom to perform the role of a tuning fork in \nthe global chorus of so many different voices. The \ncredibility of the United Nations is indispensable if we \nare to accomplish our missions in the new millennium. \nEffectiveness, capacity, rapid response, financing for \ndevelopment and all the rest of it will come along with \ncredibility. \n Security Council reform is a vivid example of \nhow difficult it is to accommodate the interests of 191 \nnations. That reminds me of a joke about the \ndistribution of committee posts in the Ukrainian \nParliament. They say that we should have 450 \ncommittees \u2014 that is the number of members of \nParliament \u2014 in order to make everyone feel happy \nand important. Unfortunately, we cannot afford to \napply a similar approach in the case of the Security \nCouncil, since its powers exceed by far those of any \nother United Nations body. The official position of \nUkraine on the matter is clearly reflected in the \nstatement made by President Yushchenko during the \nsummit (see A/60/PV.6). Ukraine highly appreciates \nthe job done by the experts who have explored the \nvarious options for Security Council reform. We must \nnot abandon hope and should continue to seek \nconsensus. \n Ukraine has fully supported the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s bold initiative to reform the Organization \nand has actively participated in that process. We \nreiterate our support for strengthening the position of \nthe Secretary-General. In view of the forthcoming \nelection for Secretary-General in 2006 we would like \nto remind representatives that throughout the 60-year \nhistory of the United Nations it is only representatives \nof our Eastern European regional group that have never \noccupied that highest of posts. Therefore, we believe \nthat the Eastern European Group has priority in \nnominating a candidate. \n In building this statement around the words \n\u201ccredibility\u201d and \u201cdemocracy\u201d, I cannot but stress the \nkey function of the Organization, which is to maintain \ninternational peace and security. The memory of \nRwanda, Srebrenica or, quite recently, Darfur should \nlead us to look for urgent remedies. One of these could \nlie in the \u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d concept, which \nUkraine fully endorses. We must not remain passive \nobservers of genocide, crimes against humanity or \ngross and flagrant violations of human rights, as \nhappened in 1932-1933 when Ukrainians experienced \nthe great famine with devastating effects. The horrible \nmemory of that man-made calamity lives on today in \nevery Ukrainian family, including my own. Twenty \nthousand innocent souls a day, half a million a month, \n10 million altogether were taken as part of the death \ntoll of Stalin\u2019s favoured ethnic policy. The Ukrainian \nGovernment will never tire until it makes the \ninternational community abandon hypocrisy and finally \nrecognize that act of genocide against the Ukrainian \nnation. It was therefore in earnest and with much hope \nthat Ukraine followed the deliberations on the new \nconcept.  \n Early warning, prevention and rapid response are \nkey to ensuring the success and durability of our \nconcerted action. An expert combination of diplomatic, \npolitical and assistance tools should suffice to avert \nfuture humanitarian disasters. But should such \nmeasures fail to stop atrocities, the Security Council \nmust be ready to act swiftly and resolutely, including \nwith the use of force, as a final resort. I should like to \nreiterate the position of Ukraine that, apart from self-\n \n \n05-51226 19 \n \ndefence as provided for in Article 51 of the Charter, \nonly the Security Council may legitimately take \ndecisions on the use of force.  \n Peace and stability go hand in hand with human \nrights, the rule of law and freedom of the media. The \ncredibility of Governments rests on those fundamental \nvalues. We were all aware of malfunctions in the \nCommission on Human Rights. Poor mechanisms led \nto poor results. The credibility of the entire \nOrganization was at stake. Therefore, Ukraine \nwelcomes the establishment of the Human Rights \nCouncil. We firmly believe that this important \nachievement of the Organization will be reflected in \nthe new Council\u2019s future activities, not only in the \nchange of name. Likewise, Ukraine supports the \nestablishment of the United Nations Democracy Fund. \n Another matter of significance that should \nenhance the credibility of the United Nations is the \ncreation of the Peacebuilding Commission. It is evident \nthat conflict resolution always requires a complex \napproach. The institutional gap between prevention, \nsettlement and post-conflict rehabilitation has finally to \nbe eliminated. \n To save time at this late hour, I shall not mention \nmany areas of cooperation and many regions of the \nworld that genuinely require our undiminished \nattention and action. Non-proliferation; hot and frozen \nconflicts; AIDS; the fight against poverty; the Middle \nEast; and Iraq: most often these are issues of the \ndemocracy of governance or the credibility of policies, \nor both.  \n To conclude, let me recall the phenomenon of the \nOrange Revolution in my country, for it was the \nquintessence of what our Organization stands for. It \nwas not a one-time act. It is a process. It is not country-\nspecific, but is part of the global heritage of \ndemocracy, an unselfish gift to all nations striving for \nfreedom around the globe. "

        "file_text": "At the outset I would like to congratulate\nyou upon your unanimous election as President of the\nsixtieth session of the General Assembly. I am confident\nthat with your experience and diplomatic skills you will\nguide our deliberations to a successful outcome. I\nwould also like to convey our great appreciation to His\nExcellency Mr. Jean Ping, President of the fifty-ninth\nsession of the Assembly, for the efficient manner in\nwhich he presided over our work as well as for the fine\naccomplishments recorded during the session.\nSixty years after its creation, the United Nations,\nour only multilateral Organization, is at a crossroads.\nWhen the Organization was established, the promotion\nof peace and security, as well as that of economic and\nsocial development, were its main objectives. It was\nthen conceived to save succeeding generations from\nthe scourge of war and insecurity, to reduce and\neradicate poverty and to move towards economic\nprosperity for all.\nToday, the world is still filled with conflicts,\nviolence, insecurity, hunger, poverty and despair. We\nhave therefore every reason to act collectively to\nreform and strengthen this multilateral institution to\nenable it to effectively address the many complex\nchallenges the world is now facing.\nIn this reform process, revitalizing the General\nAssembly has now become one of the crucial issues for\nconsideration by Member States. In our opinion, the\nAssembly, which comprises all the Members of the\nUnited Nations, should continue to play a central role\nas the chief deliberative, policy-making and\nrepresentative organ. It should serve as a forum for\nhigh-level policy statements, as well as for the\nconsideration, of, inter alia, agenda items of special\npolitical importance or urgency. In order to strengthen\nthe role and authority of the General Assembly,\nMember States should stress the need to fully respect\nand restore the balance between the principal organs of\nthe United Nations, within their respective purviews\nand mandates, in accordance with the Charter.\nAt the Millennium Summit in 2000, the leaders of\nthe States Members of the United Nations resolved to\nstrive for the elimination of weapons of mass\ndestruction, particularly nuclear weapons. In this\nregard, we regret that the seventh Review Conference\nof the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons (NPT), held in New York from 2 to\n27 May 2005, was unable to reach consensus on the\nsubstantive questions relating to the three pillars of the\nTreaty. The Lao People's Democratic Republic is of the\nview that all States parties should remain committed to\nthe NPT and believes that it should continue to have\ncornerstone status in the context of global disarmament\nand the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\nThe world economy continues to be characterized\nby slow and uneven growth and instability.\nGlobalization may offer a great many opportunities to a\nnumber of countries. However, it also presents\nnumerous challenges and risks for the developing\nworld, particularly the most vulnerable groups, namely,\nthe least developed countries and the landlocked\ndeveloping countries. In reality, the process of\nglobalization among and within countries has not\nproduced equal benefits. The gap between the\ndeveloped and developing world is widening, and we\nare all greatly concerned about increased poverty in\nmany developing countries.\nIn order for developing countries to reap the\nbenefits of globalization, an enabling external\neconomic environment for development is required. To\nthat end, we should all strive to achieve greater\ncoherence among the international trading, monetary\nand financial systems.\nAmong the most vulnerable groups, the\nlandlocked developing countries deserve special\nattention. The Almaty Programme of Action, which\nwas adopted in 2003, was a landmark document that\nset out five priority areas. The Sao Paulo Consensus,\nwhich was adopted in 2004 by the eleventh United\nNations Conference on Trade and Development,\nrecognized, among other things, that the landlocked\ndeveloping countries were small and vulnerable\neconomies. Those documents, together with the\nrelevant General Assembly resolutions, constitute a\nsignificant achievement on which the Group of\nLandlocked Developing Countries is building in order\nto move forward in promoting its legitimate cause. In\nmy capacity as Chairman of that Group, I appeal to the\ninternational community for sympathy and support for\nour endeavours.\nIn order to strengthen unity and solidarity among\nthe countries of the South, and as a follow-up to the\n6\n\nimplementation of the Havana Programme of Action,\nadopted by the first South Summit in 2000, the second\nSouth Summit of the Group of 77 and China was held\nin Doha, Qatar, from 12 to 16 June 2005. The Doha\nDeclaration and Plan of Action, which were adopted at\nthe second South Summit, called for a more energetic\neffort to deepen and revitalize South-South\ncooperation, with a view to enhancing sustained\neconomic growth and the sustainable development of\nthe countries of the South.\nLast April in Jakarta, Indonesia, the Asian-African\nSummit was held with the objective of reinvigorating the\nspirit of the 1955 Bandung Conference and of charting\nfuture cooperation between the two continents towards\na new Asian-African strategic partnership. That\npartnership, which was inaugurated at the Summit,\nconstitutes an important building block for the further\nstrengthening of South-South cooperation.\nI would like commend Mr. Kofi Annan, the\nSecretary-General, for his tireless efforts to ensure the\nsuccess of the High-level Plenary Meeting of the\nGeneral Assembly. The Lao People's Democratic\nRepublic highly values the outcome document adopted\nby our heads of State or Government, in which they\nreaffirmed the Millennium Declaration and their\ncommitment to implementing effectively and fully the\nBrussels Programme of Action for the Least Developed\nCountries and the Almaty Programme of Action:\nAddressing the Special Needs of Landlocked\nDeveloping Countries within a New Global Framework\nfor Transit Transport Cooperation for Landlocked and\nTransit Developing Countries.\nGiven the aspirations of the overwhelming\nmajority of Member States, the second South Summit,\nheld in Doha, called upon the Government of the\nUnited States to put an end to the economic,\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba,\nwhich, in addition to being unilateral and contrary to\nthe Charter, international law and the principle of good\nneighbourliness, is the cause of enormous material loss\nand economic damage to the people of Cuba.\nOn the Korean Peninsula, we welcome the recent\nresumption of the six-party talks, which have yielded\nimportant progress. The Lao People's Democratic\nRepublic expresses the hope that the concerned parties\nwill further deploy joint efforts and undertake concrete\nactions based on the principles and commitments\ncontained in the Joint Declaration of 19 September\n2005 on the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free\nKorean Peninsula, thus contributing to the promotion\nof peace, security, stability and development\ncooperation in the wider Asia-Pacific region.\nIn the Middle East, although the situation remains\ndifficult and complex, a degree of progress has been\nmade that ought to be further promoted. In order to\nachieve a comprehensive and lasting peace in the\nregion, the question of Palestine in all its aspects\nshould be resolved in accordance with international law\nand relevant United Nations resolutions. In this regard,\nthe Lao People's Democratic Republic reaffirms its\nunwavering support for the legitimate struggle of the\nPalestinian people, under the leadership of the\nPalestine Liberation Organization, to exercise their\nright to self-determination, including their right to\nestablish an independent State of Palestine living side\nby side with Israel.\nThe situation in Iraq continues to be a matter of\nconcern to the international community. It is our\nsincere hope that durable peace, security and stability\ncan soon be secured in that country, paving the way for\nthe Iraqi people to be truly the masters of their own\nfuture and destiny.\nThe year 2005 marks the thirtieth anniversary of\nthe proclamation of the Lao People's Democratic\nRepublic, a historic event of great significance in the\npolitical life of the nation. In general, the national\neconomy is continuing to grow at a sustained pace. The\nrate of growth reached 7.2 per cent in the period 2004-\n2005. Foreign investment is on the increase, political\nstability, social tranquillity and security are assured\nand the living conditions of the people are continuing\nto improve. The multi-ethnic Lao people, while\nenjoying fundamental rights, including the right to\nbelieve or not to believe in any religion, stand firmly\nunited in nation-building. Furthermore, the Lao People's\nDemocratic Republic remains committed to implementing\na policy aimed at establishing a State based on the rule\nof law so as to ensure freedom, democracy and the\nlegitimate interests of its citizens, as well as of foreign\nresidents and other foreigners living and working in the\nLao People's Democratic Republic.\nExternally, the Lao People's Democratic Republic\nhas vigorously participated in multifaceted regional\nand international activities aimed at fostering peace,\nstability, friendship and the promotion of development\ncooperation. One of the greatest events for the Lao\n7\n\nPeople's Democratic Republic was the historic hosting\nof the tenth Summit of the Association of Southeast\nAsian Nations (ASEAN) in November 2004, which\nwas followed by the successful holding, from 24 to 29\nJuly 2005, of the thirty-eighth ASEAN Ministerial\nMeeting, the post-ministerial conferences and the\ntwelfth ASEAN Regional Forum. Those events reflect\nthe great sense of responsibility of the multi-ethnic Lao\npeople as a whole in the discharge of the country's\nchairmanship of ASEAN during the past 12 months.\nFurthermore, those accomplishments have\nsignificantly contributed to narrowing the development\ngaps within ASEAN member countries and fostering\nthe realization of an ASEAN community. That\ncommunity has three pillars: the ASEAN Security\nCommunity, the ASEAN Economic Community and\nthe ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community, all of which\nare closely intertwined and mutually reinforcing for the\npurpose of ensuring durable peace, stability and shared\nprosperity in the region.\nASEAN hopes that friendly countries and the\nUnited Nations will become more involved in the\nimplementation of the Vientiane Action Programme and\nthe ASEAN Development Fund for regional economic\nintegration, particularly in the areas of human resource\ndevelopment, infrastructure, information technology\nand energy development.\nPeace cannot be achieved without development,\nand development in turn cannot be realized without\ncooperation among nations, with the United Nations\nplaying an important catalytic role.\nThe United Nations - the sole multilateral,\nuniversal Organization - cannot be strengthened,\nhowever, if it does not embrace, in equal measure, the\nconcerns of all, including the small, vulnerable, and\nweak States, which make up the majority of its\nMembers. In that respect, we should all remind\nourselves that not only will our words and the\nprinciples we espouse be judged by future generations,\nbut so, too, will the actions that we undertake to bring\nabout development for the whole of humanity."

        "file_text": "As a founding Member of the United\nNations, Guatemala would like to reaffirm, before the\nGeneral Assembly, its faith in and commitment to\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, the sovereign\nequality of States and participatory, transparent and\ndemocratic multilateralism. The United Nations\ncontinues to be the best tool available to humanity in\nits endeavour to accomplish that goal.\nThe goals that the Charter signatories set for\nthemselves six decades ago have lost none of their\nvalidity. Indeed, the attainment of those goals remains\na major challenge for humanity. The goal of\nmaintaining international peace and security presents\nnew challenges. Its relationship with sustainable\ndevelopment and the fight against poverty serves as a\nparadigm in that regard. We are confronting new\nthreats that make it harder to ensure good governance\nand undermine democracy, such as trafficking in\npersons, weapons and drugs, as well as terrorism.\nSmall and vulnerable countries, such as mine, are\nparticularly affected by those problems.\nWe have been trying together to cope with such\nnew challenges for some time, but only recently have\nwe been able to reflect on them and reach a number of\nagreements that we trust will enable us to reform the\nOrganization with a view to address these challenges,\nas a whole, more efficiently and with renewed\nambition.\nWe support the appeal made by Secretary-General\nat the beginning of the general debate for an\n\u201caccountability pact\u201d to ensure that the Secretariat and\nGovernments are effectively held to account and\nmonitored.\nGuatemala will continue to participate actively in\nefforts to set up the Peacebuilding Commission. Our\nown national experience will enable us to contribute\nactively to those efforts.\nWe will also contribute to the effort to achieve\nthe speedy conclusion of a comprehensive convention\nagainst international terrorism and to the\nimplementation of an integral strategy aimed at the\nsuppression of that scourge.\nWe attach equal importance to the creation of a\nstanding Human Rights Council, the composition of\nwhich is to be agreed upon during this session, with a\nview to properly focusing, depoliticizing and making\n26\n\nmore effective the discharge of our responsibility to\nensure the full observance of human rights. We\nresolutely support the strengthening of the Office of\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Human\nRights, which should be provided with the resources\nnecessary for it to carry out its work effectively.\nSimilarly, we have no hesitation in supporting the\nresponsibility to protect.\nWe consider it essential to make decisive\nprogress in the areas of disarmament and nuclear non-\nproliferation by means of initiatives such as that put\nforward by Norway, Australia, Chile, Indonesia, the\nUnited Kingdom, Romania and South Africa, which\nGuatemala supports.\nAs regards the principal organs, we support the\nstrengthening and revitalization of the General\nAssembly, whose task is to provide political guidance\nin connection with the work of the Organization. We\nmust restore to the Economic and Social Council its\nleading role in the area of sustainable development,\nand continue to enhance its cooperation with the\nSecurity Council.\nWe urge the broadest support by Member States\nfor the reform of the Security Council. It is essential\nthat that reform effort be comprehensive and that it\ninclude a review of the Council's methods of work and\nof the procedures by which decisions are taken, the\npurpose being to strengthen the Council and to make it\nmore legitimate, ensuring that it reflects present-day\nrealities and represents developing countries. We are\nsympathetic to the aspirations of Brazil, Germany,\nIndia and Japan to become permanent members of the\nCouncil, as well as to the call for additional\nrepresentation for Africa.\nWhen addressing the Assembly one year ago,\nOscar Berger Perdomo, the President of Guatemala,\nsought to express the feelings of our country at that\ncrucial time in its history. I am pleased on this occasion\nto share with the Assembly some of the advances we\nhave made since then.\nNot only were the Peace Agreements integrated\ninto the Government plan, but the framework law on\nthose Agreements was enacted. Social dialogue has\nbeen pursued in all areas of Government action. A 43\nper cent reduction in the strength of the army was\nachieved, and there was progress in modernizing and\nprofessionalizing it. In line with this, the Guatemalan\narmy has increased its participation in United Nations\npeacekeeping operations and is now in Haiti and the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.\nPublic expenditure is concentrated in the social\narea and in infrastructure, for which 60 per cent of the\n2006 national budget is earmarked. A secretariat for\nfood and nutritional security has been created, while a\nState policy in those matters has been drawn up, with a\nparticipatory and sustainable focus. Significant\nactivities are being carried out at the national level and\njointly with other Central American countries to\ncombat common crime and transnational organized crime.\nA programme for economic and social reactivation\ncontinues to be implemented with enthusiasm, a\ncadastral law was recently enacted and a competition\npolicy, adopted by consensus with the participation of\ncivil society, will be presented next week.\nThe fight against poverty and social exclusion\ncontinues to occupy a central position in all the\nactivities of the Government and is carried out in a\nmanner that fully respects the ethnic, cultural and\nlinguistic diversity of the country. Recently, we\nestablished a national policy for indigenous peoples,\nwhich was presented by the Nobel Peace Prize laureate\nand Ambassador for the Guatemalan Peace\nAgreements, Rigoberta Menchu.\nAppropriate legal proceedings continue to be\ntaken against persons guilty of acts of corruption. Full\ntransparency continues to be ensured in the area of\nGovernment procurement.\nOur commitment to the full observance of human\nrights is being maintained at the national level. Inter-\nagency activities are being carried out under the\nrecently adopted national human rights programme.\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Human\nRights has established an office in Guatemala, the\nfunctions of which are to provide advice to the\nGovernment, State entities and civil society in order to\nstrengthen the promotion and protection of human\nrights in our nation.\nNevertheless, the advances made are increasingly\nbeing compromised by an inordinate increase in the\nprice of fossil fuels, which has an extremely negative\neffect on countries whose open economies, like that of\nGuatemala, are net importers of oil. Our oil bill is\nabsorbing an increasing percentage of the foreign\nexchange generated by exports of goods and services.\nAt the same time, we have had to cope with\nconsiderable increases in the cost of transportation and\n27\n\nof electricity, with their multiplier effect on productive\nsectors and the price of basic consumer goods. The\neffects of all this at the level of the economy as a\nwhole and at the macroeconomic level threaten to slow\ndown the expansion of our economy. For our part, we\nare doing all we can to conserve energy and develop\nalternatives to hydrocarbons. We appeal to the\ninternational community to cooperate with us in\nmitigating the impact of this situation.\nGuatemala is taking actions to strengthen\ndemocracy at the national level by consolidating a\nregime that is democratic, participatory and inclusive.\nOur commitment to democracy in the world is\nunshakeable. That is why we are participating actively\nin forums that seek to promote and defend those rights,\nand we also support the Democracy Fund.\nMy country\u2019s foreign policy has as its main\nobjectives achieving better inclusion of Guatemala in\nthe world, strengthening multilateralism and regional\nintegration. We have strengthened our ties with\ncountries and groups of countries with which we have\nrelations and are united by institutionalized\nmechanisms of cooperation; moreover, we have\nestablished new strategic associations with countries\nand groups of countries in South America, the\nCaribbean, Asia and Africa.\nConsiderable advances have been made this year\nin regional integration. Progress has been made in the\njoint assessment carried out with the European Union\nto launch negotiations in 2006 for an association and\nfree trade agreement between both regions.\nThe Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) with\nthe United States, which includes the Central American\ncountries and the Dominican Republic, offers great\nopportunities to our country for the generation of\nemployment, increased investment and legal certainty.\nHowever, as we enter CAFTA-DR, the credit rating and\nexport promotion agencies of the developed countries\nhave assigned us a risk rating less favourable than what\nwe consider it should be. Along with other\nconsequences, that situation unfairly increases the cost\nof credit for us. Guatemala has one of the best debt-\nservicing records in Latin America, one of the world\u2019s\nbest external debt indicators, well-established working\nrelations with all multilateral agencies, sustained\neconomic growth for more than 15 years, a stable\ncurrency, a single-digit rate of inflation and a high\nlevel of monetary reserves.\nStrategically, Guatemala has advanced in the\nnegotiation of trade agreements with Colombia, the\nRepublic of China in Taiwan, the Russian Federation,\nBelize, MERCOSUR, CARICOM, the Andean Group,\nChile, Canada, Egypt and Israel.\nAnother fundamental pillar of Guatemala's\nforeign policy is caring for the needs of Guatemalan\nmigrants. The Government endeavours to solve their\nproblems and to ensure that their human rights are\nrespected, taking actions for that purpose at the\nnational and international levels. We appeal to\nrecipient nations, particularly the United States, to\nfacilitate the regulation of the status of Guatemalan\nmigrants in their countries. For those reasons, we\ncontinue to cooperate at the international level with all\nefforts aimed at resolving the problems that migrants\nface. We welcome the recognition contained in the\n2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1) on the\nlink between international migration and development.\nGuatemala will continue to take the necessary\nsteps to put an end to poverty in the country and to\nattain sustainable development. Prioritization of public\nexpenditure at the national level is not sufficient for the\nmagnitude of the actions we are setting out to\naccomplish. We consider it imperative to ensure the\nsuccess of the Sixth Ministerial Conference of the\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO). By definition, the\nDoha Round should place development at the heart of\nits negotiations, and we trust that, when we meet in\nHong Kong in December, we shall take decisions that\nby and large are consistent with the aspirations of\ndeveloping countries. We need to have a level playing\nfield in trade and agricultural commodities, and we\nneed wider access to the markets of the most dynamic\neconomies in the world for our goods and services, as\nwell as to expand and diversify our product base.\nWe welcome the offer made by President Bush in\nthis Hall to speed up the elimination of all tariffs and\nsubsidies that distort free trade in the world. We urge\ndonor countries, development agencies and the\ninternational financial system to increase their\nfinancial and technical cooperation with medium and\nlow-income countries, with a moderate debt level, one\nof which is my country, Guatemala.\nI wish to stress in particular our concern for the\nsituation of the 23 million inhabitants of the Republic\nof China in Taiwan, whose aspirations for\nrepresentation in international organizations remain\n28\n\nunfulfilled. Guatemala, which is committed to the\nmaintenance of international peace and security as well\nas to the peaceful settlement of disputes, appeals to the\ncountries bordering the Taiwan Strait to refrain from\nany threat or use of force and urges them to resolve\ntheir differences through dialogue.\nWe also express our hope that the difficult\nsituation in the Middle East will have a satisfactory\noutcome, in conformity with Security Council resolutions\n242 (1967), 338 (1973), 1397 (2002) and 1402 (2002).\nWe are heartened in that regard by the efforts and\nprogress made in the Middle East peace process, and\nparticularly by the dialogue begun between the parties,\nthe implementation of the road map, and the\nimplementation of the disengagement plan.\nOne cannot avoid recalling here, during this\nanniversary of our Organization, the millions of\npersons who perished during the Second World War\nand the Holocaust as a result of the power of\ntotalitarianism. Our presence here also recalls us to the\nstruggle to recover democracy, freedom and the dignity\nof the human being.\nHope was born from the liberation of men,\nwomen, boys and girls from the concentration camps,\nthe end of the war and the adoption of the Charter in\nSan Francisco. We cannot disappoint those hopes or\nreturn to the past. The United Nations must deliver on\nits promises and continue to offer humanity an\nopportunity."

        "file_text": "Allow me to\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of\nthe General Assembly at the sixtieth session. We are\ndelighted to see a distinguished son of Sweden and a\nfriend of Mozambique in the stewardship of this body\nand wish to express our confidence that, under your\nable leadership, our deliberations will produce\nsuccessful results. I would like to take this opportunity\nto pay a well-deserved tribute to your predecessor, His\nExcellency Mr. Jean Ping, for the remarkable manner\nin which he spearheaded the deliberations of the fifty-\nninth session of General Assembly. May I also\ncommend the Secretary-General for his continued\nvision and leadership in our collective efforts to pursue\nthe fundamental ideals of the United Nations, in\nparticular the implementation of the international\nagenda for peace and development highlighted in his\nreport (A/59/2005). We encourage him to continue his\noutstanding work.\nWe gather here today inspired by the spirit of\ntogetherness and collective vision on the path that we\nshould strive to continue to travel in order to achieve\nour common aspirations, as underscored throughout the\ndeliberations of the High-level Plenary Meeting. We\nmust seize this momentum to reinforce multilateralism\nas a guiding principle upon which the international\ncommunity should rely to adequately face today's\nchallenges. We believe that the emphasis of the World\nSummit Outcome (resolution 60/1) on the vital\nimportance of an effective multilateral system and our\ndetermination to fulfil the commitments we set for\nourselves will generate and galvanize good momentum\nfor action aimed at tangible results.\nAs we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations, we should reflect on what we want the\nOrganization to be and on what role each country and\nregion should play in these collective endeavours. In\nrecognizing inclusiveness and the equal rights of men\nand women and of all nations, the Charter of the\nUnited Nations builds on our diverse cultural and\ntraditional values to unite us around our common\nhumanity. Our failure to overcome the poverty trap in\nwhich developing countries are caught, as well as the\nconstant threat posed by terrorism, indicates the need\nfor an international system that is more inclusive and\ndemocratic and that conforms to the Charter of the\nUnited Nations and the relevant provisions of\ninternational law. It is our firm belief that the United\nNations continues to be an indispensable instrument for\nachieving those objectives. Thus, the strength of the\nOrganization must be high on our agenda. We ought to\nimprove its performance by reforming its organs and\nstructures.\nTherefore, it is our sincere hope that United\nNations reform will help to foster strong relationships\nand cooperative links of coordination among all its\nprincipal organs, in particular the General Assembly,\nthe Security Council and the Economic and Social\nCouncil.\nSecurity Council reform should be aimed at\nbuilding transparency, democracy, openness and\nconsistency with regard to all regions represented in\nthe Organization. In that regard, the growing political\ncommitment and involvement of Africa in the\ninternational agenda for peace and stability calls for\nenhanced representation on the Security Council.\nWe hope that the recently proposed Peacebuilding\nCommission will help to keep sustained international\nattention on countries in transition from post-conflict\nsituations to recovery and long-term development and\nensure continued support for them. Indeed, the\nexperience of Mozambique's transition from a post-\nconflict situation to reconstruction and development\ntestifies to the valuable contribution and impact of the\nconcerted support provided by the United Nations and\n25\n\nthe international community for peace and\ndevelopment efforts.\nThe adoption of the Millennium Declaration and\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) gave new\nmomentum to our quest to fight poverty, accelerate\nhuman development and facilitate the gradual and\neffective integration of the developing world into the\nglobal economy. Despite the less ambitious outcome of\nthe recently concluded summit, the time has come to\nbuild a genuine international partnership and to\nreaffirm our political will to fully implement\ninternationally agreed commitments.\nWe need to work diligently to implement the\ncommitments made in Monterrey. In that regard, the\nestablishment of a detailed calendar for the\nimplementation of the goals set on financing for\ndevelopment is vital to generate access to additional\nfinancial support for developing countries. To that end,\nwe welcome the decision by the European Union to set\ncollective and specific targets with a view to reaching\nthe internationally agreed target of devoting 0.7 per\ncent of gross domestic product (GDP) to official\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) by 2015.\nThe sustainable development of low-income\ncountries, particularly in Africa, depends upon a more\nopen, equitable and rules-based multilateral trading\nsystem, as trade constitutes an engine for growth and\ndevelopment. In that regard, we view partnership\nagreements such as the Cotonou Agreement and the\nAfrican Growth and Opportunity Act as important\nsteps towards fulfilling some of the development\nobjectives. We strongly believe that the completion of\nthe Doha round by 2006 will help to establish an\ninternational trading system consistent with\ndevelopment goals and policies.\nWhile developing countries are striving to\nfinance the MDGs, debt servicing has been diverting\nsignificant amounts of their limited resources, at the\ncost of social and economic development. In that\ncontext, we reiterate the calls for more radical action\nby the international community, in line with\nrecommendations that debt relief should cover\nmultilateral and bilateral debt and reduce debt stock\nand debt servicing by up to 100 per cent. To that end,\nwe support the continuation of the Heavily Indebted\nPoor Countries Debt Initiative and other relief\nmeasures, particularly those addressing the special\nneeds of African countries.\nIn that regard, we commend the debt-cancellation\ndecision made by the ministers for finance of the\nGroup of Eight (G-8) in favour of 18 developing\ncountries, including Mozambique. We encourage the\nG-8 and other development partners to continue with\nsuch important initiatives and to address the\nunsustainable debt burden of many developing\ncountries, so that new resources can be invested in\npursuit of poverty reduction.\nThe Government of the Republic of Mozambique\nis now fully engaged in the implementation of its\nprogramme for 2005-2009 that incorporates our vision\nof development based on continuity and renewal. That\napproach is founded on past experiences and\nprogrammes pursued in the quest for development and\nthe well-being of all Mozambicans. The eradication of\npoverty requires new dynamism and vigour, as clearly\npointed out in the New Partnership for Africa's\nDevelopment (NEPAD), the Brussels Programme of\nAction for the Least Developed Countries and the\nMillennium Development Goals. In that context, our\nfive-year programme focuses on integrated rural\ndevelopment and the expansion of basic economic and\nsocial infrastructure, with the aim of reducing absolute\npoverty through the promotion of rapid, comprehensive\nand sustained economic growth and job creation. In\naddressing social and economic development, the\nprogramme seeks mainly to reduce regional imbalances\nand to expand the supply of basic services such as\nhealth, education and access to electricity and safe\ndrinking water. The programme also gives due\nattention to the fight against HIV/AIDS, malaria and\nother infectious diseases, as well as to the special\nneeds of young people in terms of training,\nemployment and housing.\nThrough the implementation of sound political\nand macroeconomic policies and strategies for\ndevelopment, we have registered economic growth\nrates that have averaged 7.5 per cent annually from\n2000 to 2005. Poverty levels have declined\nsignificantly, from 69.5 per cent in 1997 to 54 per cent\nin 2003. That has been possible due to our focus on our\nnationally owned poverty eradication strategy. That\nstrategy has not only mainstreamed the MDGs and\nadapted them to our own realities; it also embodies a\nclear pro-poor and people-centred development\nstrategy.\nThe consolidation of peace, democracy and\nnational unity continue to be high on our national\n26\n\nagenda, as we recognize that peace and stability are\nsine qua nons for securing sustainable development in\nour country.\nWe continue to build self-confidence around\nAfrica. The continent counts on NEPAD to raise the\nspirit of ownership of African leaders, and thus bring\nabout significant changes in our development. The\nadherence to date of 28 countries to the African Peer\nReview Mechanism has bolstered the credibility of\nparticipating States, as it ensures that their policies and\npractices comply with agreed political, economic and\ncorporate-governance values, codes and standards.\nWe are seeing good examples of conflict\nresolution in Africa. However, conflicts continue to\ncause unbearable human suffering, which deprives a\nlarge number of our fellow Africans of their\ninalienable right to live in dignity. We commend the\nefforts of the Secretary-General and the international\ncommunity at large to address both humanitarian crises\nand the root causes of conflict in Africa.\nWith regard to Western Sahara, we urge the\nparties concerned to work together with the Secretary-\nGeneral with a view to finding a political solution to\nthe long-standing conflict in that country.\nWe are following with keen interest the latest\ndevelopments in the Middle East. We continue to\nbelieve that a lasting solution to the question of\nPalestine \u00f3 the core of the conflict in the region \u00f3\nmust be in accordance with international law and\nrelevant United Nations resolutions and must fully\nrecognize the right of the Palestinian people to self-\ndetermination.\nWe welcome the decision to conclude a\ncomprehensive convention on terrorism not later than\nJune 2006, for that will constitute a further effort to\nstrengthen the international community's resolve to\nface the challenge of eliminating the scourge of\nterrorism. Similarly, we would like to stress the\nimportance of regional agreements and declarations to\ncombat and eliminate terrorism in all its forms as a tool\nto strengthen cooperation among Member States and\nprovide a platform for the effective implementation of\ninternational legal instruments to suppress terrorism.\nWe support the calls for a transparent verification\nmechanism that can help to prevent the use of nuclear\nweapons against non-nuclear States. In that regard, we\nalso share the view that all States parties to the Treaty\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, without\ndiscrimination and while undertaking their\nresponsibilities for nuclear disarmament and non-\nproliferation, should have the right to use nuclear\nenergy for peaceful purposes, as well as to engage in\nresearch on nuclear technology in conformity with the\nprovisions of the Treaty.\nWe would like to conclude by reaffirming the\ncommitment of Mozambique to the principles and\npurposes enshrined in the Charter of the United\nNations, as well as our belief that the United Nations\nreform process will strengthen the Organization with a\nview to providing more and better assistance to all\nMember States, in particular with respect to addressing\nthe special needs of Africa."

        "file_text": "I should\nlike to begin my statement with a quotation from the\nKoran:\n\\\"Invite all to the way of thy Lord with wisdom\nand beautiful preaching; and argue with them in\nways that are best and most gracious: for thy\nLord knoweth best\\\" (The Holy Koran,\nXVI:125).\nLast year, I declared from this rostrum that\npeace - the continuing strategic objective of the\nGovernment of Sudan - was at hand. Today, from the\nsame rostrum, I would like to note that peace has\nbecome a reality with the signing of the\nComprehensive Peace Agreement and the adoption of\nthe new Constitution. We have started to implement the\nAgreement in accordance with a fixed timetable.\nUnfortunately, as soon as we started to implement\nthe Agreement with our partners in the Sudan People\u00eds\nLiberation Movement (SPLM), we were faced with a\ngreat tragedy: the death of John Garang, the first Vice\nPresident of the Republic. With his passing, the\ncountry has lost an invaluable partner and participant\nin the peace process. It was not just a loss for the\nSudan, but a great loss for Africa and all peace-loving\npeople. Such tragedies are the true tests of our will,\nand our brethren in the SPLM have responsibly come\nthrough that crisis and difficult test, putting aside their\nbitter shock and continuing to build a durable peace.\nThe Comprehensive Peace Agreement was not\nlimited solely to issues between the north and the\nsouth. It set up a comprehensive framework for\nresolving justly all the problems of our country. It has\nestablished rules for a political regime that considers\ncitizenship to involve rights, duties and obligations -\na regime that is based on democracy, the rule of law,\ngood governance, respect for human rights and the\nequitable division of wealth and power based on fair\nstandards that will ensure comprehensive peace.\nWe are fully committed to the letter and the spirit\nof the Peace Agreement, and we accept and understand\nthe magnitude of our responsibility to fulfil it. We are\nfully confident that bringing peace to the Sudan will\nhave a positive impact on regional stability and allow\nthe Sudan to continue to play its proper role within the\ninternational community.\nAs we have begun to implement the Peace\nAgreement, we call upon the international community\nimmediately to lift all commercial and economic\nsanctions and restrictions, to cancel all of the Sudan\u00eds\nexternal debt and to fulfil the pledges it made at the\nOslo conference. Such actions will provide support for\nthe Agreement and promote reconstruction and\ndevelopment in the Sudan. In that context, we express\nappreciation and gratitude to the United Nations for the\nimportant role it has played in the implementation of\nthe Agreement, particularly the work of the Special\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Jan\nPronk.\nThe people of Darfur are still not able to live in\nconditions of peace. We will make every effort to\nimplement the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and\nthe Declaration of Principles adopted at Abuja, with a\nview to bringing about that objective. We will continue\nto cooperate with the international community in\nimproving the humanitarian and security situation,\nwhich has already improved greatly. But that is not\nenough. We hope to ensure complete stability in\nDarfur. The Government\u00eds commitment to agreements\nand arrangements entered into relating to the\nachievement of a ceasefire and the improvement of the\nsecurity situation should be matched by a similar\ncommitment from the armed movements, which should\nend their violations and agree to an immediate\nceasefire. The international community should\ncontinue to put pressure on them to negotiate seriously\nin order to achieve a peaceful solution to the problem.\nMy Government underlines the importance of\nachieving definitive peace in Darfur as quickly as\npossible. We have a three-track plan aimed at returning\nDarfur to its proper situation. The first is the political\ntrack, which is designed to resolve the root causes of\nthe dispute and to reach an agreement. The second\nrelates to the implementation of the voluntary\nrepatriation programmes. The third relates to the\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration\nprogrammes. In the framework of those commitments,\nthe Government has encouraged reconciliation among\ntribe and community leaders, which would help to\nprovide a solution to the root causes of the conflict.\nIn order to improve the security situation and\nachieve a peaceful resolution of the conflict, the\nGovernment is making every effort, with the\nparticipation of the international community, to deal\nwith the urgent humanitarian problem and the problem\nof internally displaced persons and refugees. We have\nundertaken a number of development plans to deal with\n22\n\nthe dispute about resources, which represents one of\nthe main problems. In that context, the Government is\nlooking forward to entering into an effective\ninternational partnership with a view to bringing about\nthose ambitious plans and establishing a special fund\nfor development and rehabilitation in Darfur similar to\nthat agreed to at the Oslo conference for the south.\nIn expressing its appreciation for the efforts of\nthe international community, the Sudan would like to\npay tribute to the active role of the African Union. We\ncall on the international community to continue to\nassist and support that role.\nThe Sudan adopted a transitional Constitution in\nJuly 2005, and the President and Vice-President will\nexercise their mandate in conformity with its\nprovisions. We have established a Government of\nNational Unity, which will continue the transitional\nprocess. We have begun this phase by conducting a\nresponsible dialogue with all members of the political\nopposition, who continue to operate freely. The\ntransitional Constitution includes human rights\nprovisions ensuring respect for the rights, obligations\nand fundamental freedoms of all Sudanese citizens. We\nwill continue to work with international organizations\nin order to develop and promote human rights in the\ncountry.\nThis is the last occasion on which I will speak to\nthe Assembly as Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\nSudan, because yesterday a new Minister for Foreign\nAffairs, my brother Mr. Lam Akol, was appointed by\nthe Popular Movement. I extend to the General\nAssembly my gratitude and appreciation for its\ncooperation during my work as Foreign Minister of the\nSudan in the past several years.\nTragically, the Palestinian people are still under\nIsraeli occupation. The international community is\ncalled upon to force Israel to halt its illegal practices in\nthe occupied Palestinian territories, to dismantle the\nseparation wall, to withdraw from all the Arab\nterritories that it occupied in 1967 and to allow the\nPalestinian people to realize their legitimate rights,\nincluding their right to an independent State, with\nAl-Quds as its capital. The international community\nshould take action to bring about a comprehensive,\npeaceful settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict, in\naccordance with the resolutions of international\nlegitimacy, the road map, the principle of land for\npeace and the Madrid terms of reference.\nThe Sudan has participated in agreements aimed\nat putting an end to nuclear proliferation. The conflict-\nridden Middle East should be a zone free from nuclear\nweapons and other weapons of mass destruction.\nInternational justice and laws should apply in that\nregion, with no exceptions for any State, with a view to\nensuring stability and peace, emphasizing the rights of\npeoples to use nuclear power for peaceful purposes,\nparticularly in scientific research. The Sudan supports\nthe right of all countries, including Iran, to use nuclear\npower for peaceful purposes, in accordance with\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency regulations.\nThe situation in Iraq is very unstable. The Iraqi\npeople, who are suffering greatly, need the\ninternational community to help them to overcome the\ncrisis there. In this respect, we would like to\nunderscore once again our principled position that we\nmust preserve the sovereignty, unity and territorial\nintegrity of Iraq and ensure non-interference in its\ninternal affairs, with a view to bringing about stability\nand peace and restoring normal living conditions there.\nWe call upon the international community to\ncontribute, as soon as possible, to the rebuilding of Iraq\nand to support the transitional Government so as to\nallow the Iraqi people to live in dignity on their land.\nThe African Union has set up policies and\nmechanisms aimed at dealing effectively with the\ndispute resolution and the establishment of stability on\nthat continent, which is rich in resources, including\nhuman resources. Africa is continuing to use those\nresources for development purposes, within the\nframework of the New Partnership for Africa\u00eds\nDevelopment.\nThe first meeting of the International Conference\non the Great Lakes Region restored hope that peace,\nstability and development can return to the region. We\nhope that the second such summit will be held within\nthe next few months, and that it will result in a united\nstance that will lead to peace, security and\ndevelopment in the region. We were encouraged by the\nmeeting that was held on the sidelines of the High-\nlevel Plenary Meeting with a view to preparing for a\nsecond International Conference on the Great Lakes\nRegion.\nIn this context, I would like to refer to\nSomalia - a very important African country, which is\ntrying to move beyond the bitterness of war and\nconflict and to re-establish itself as a State. Somalia\n23\n\nshould receive the cooperation and support that it\nneeds from the international community, and from the\nUnited Nations in particular.\nSince the Millennium Summit in 2000, some\nachievements have been made with a view to meeting\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). But the\nGoals have not been adequately achieved in Africa,\nwhich still has to deal with poverty, disease,\nunderdevelopment and debt. As we meet here five\nyears after the first summit, we must pause and\nconsider what we have achieved and what we aspire to\nachieve. We live in a world in which people have\nvaried standards of living and wealth. The rich have\nbecome richer, and the poor have become poorer. The\ngap between them is great, and there are enormous\nparadoxes. There are very rich countries whose citizens\nspend millions of dollars on weight loss, and there are\nother poor countries that seek just a small fraction of\nthat amount to keep barely alive.\nWe take this opportunity to reaffirm, as agreed in\nthe framework of the Millennium Declaration, that we\nmust achieve the Millennium Development Goals in\norder to create a better life for all humanity. Here, we\nmust point out that the Sudan has worked hard to attain\nthe goals and has made significant progress in reducing\npoverty and increasing basic education levels, despite\nthe unjust siege and the long conflict in the southern\npart of the country. All those efforts are reflected in\nSudan\u00eds 2004 MDG report.\nIn that context, we should stress the importance\nof the total cancellation of debt. Debt is a great\nhindrance to achieving the Development Goals in\nAfrica and in the least developed countries. Attaching\nconditions to debt cancellation will only impede\ndevelopment. Here, we must remind developed\ncountries of their commitments to financing for\ndevelopment, in accordance with the Monterrey\nConsensus.\nAn international partnership to achieve the MDGs\nas envisaged in Goal 8, is essential. Unfortunately, the\nmain difficulty in achieving the Goals is the\nestablishment of such a partnership, which will not be\npossible without allowing developing, and least\ndeveloped countries in particular, to integrate fully into\nthe international economy. Imposing unilateral\neconomic sanctions against developing countries\nhinders free trade and investment. Financing and the\ntransfer of technology are among the other issues\nencountered in efforts to achieve sustainable\ndevelopment.\nWe live in a world of many challenges and\nthreats. The international community has recognized\nthat development, peace and security are closely\ninterconnected. The main challenges faced by the\ninternational community today are maintaining\ninternational peace and security and achieving\neconomic growth and development. Meeting those\nchallenges will be possible only in a collective world\nled by an effective and capable United Nations.\nThe Sudan has actively participated in the\nconsultations on creating a framework for collective\naction and on United Nations reform. We support\nreform that is in accordance with the purposes and\nprinciples of the Charter and the relevant provisions of\ninternational law. We have emphasized the\nestablishment of a new human rights mechanism to\naddress the shortcomings - including politicization,\nselectivity and double standards - that have prevented\nthe Commission on Human Rights from carrying out\nits responsibilities. The Sudan believes that we should\nconsider establishing a new mechanism that deals with\nthe negative policies of the past and is committed to\nthe principles of equality among States and respect for\nequitable geographical representation, in accordance\nwith the relevant provisions of the Charter. On the\nbasis of what the United Nations has successfully\nachieved in the security, economic and social areas, we\nshould aspire to achieve the objectives of the High-\nlevel Plenary Meeting and thus to create a peaceful and\nsafe world in which all of us will shoulder our\nresponsibilities.\nClearly, we all reject terrorism in all its forms and\nmanifestations and we stand together with others to\neliminate it; indeed, a counter-terrorism conference is\nnow being held in Khartoum to combat terrorism in\nEast Africa. What we reject are attempts to confuse\nterrorism with the struggle of peoples for liberation and\nindependence and attempts to link terrorism to a\nspecific religion or culture. Terrorism is an\ninternational scourge that is not limited to a specific\nreligion or culture, and we believe that any attempt to\nconfuse the issue could cause problems and weaken\nour collective resolve to develop a comprehensive\nstrategy to combat it.\nThe Sudan will continue to be a messenger to\nStates, calling for a dialogue among cultures and\n24\n\ncivilizations aimed at attaining humanity\u00eds objectives.\nThe international fight against terrorism must be based\non the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant\nprovisions of international law. In that context, the\nSudan calls for the holding of an international\nconference to arrive at an agreed definition of terrorism\nand stresses that the rejection of terrorism does not\nmean that we should ignore the reasons behind it. We\nmust deal with the root causes of the problem if we are\nto be successful in eradicating it.\nIn conclusion, the Sudan reaffirms its belief in\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter. We stress\nour resolve to continue to work with the international\ncommunity to strengthen the Organization so that it can\nefficiently carry out its role and mandate."

        "file_text": "It\ngives me great pleasure at the outset to extend to you,\nMr. President, our congratulations upon your election\nto the presidency of this sixtieth session of the General\nAssembly. We wish you every success in discharging\nyour functions. I would also like to extend thanks and\nappreciation to your predecessor, His Excellency\nMr. Jean Ping, for his valuable efforts in conducting\nthe work of the Assembly\u2019s fifty-ninth session,\nespecially his efforts to reach a consensus on the final\ndocument of the world summit of 2005.\nI would also like to thank His Excellency\nMr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the United\nNations, for his tireless efforts to strengthen the role of\nour international Organization.\nWorld leaders who met at United Nations\nHeadquarters to follow up on the outcome of the\nMillennium Summit and the coordinated and integrated\nimplementation and follow-up of the outcomes of the\nmajor United Nations conferences and summits in the\nsocial, economic and related fields have managed to\nadopt a document that calls for implementing reforms\nin the United Nations and for taking bolder collective\nsteps to combat poverty, achieve development,\nestablish international security and uphold human\nrights.\nThe world today is experiencing extremely\ndifficult economic conditions which pose a real threat\nto the process of social and economic development in\nthe developing countries, especially the least developed\ncountries, and pose a major threat to the development\nof their peoples. That situation is the result of such\nfactors as a decline in official development assistance;\nunfair international terms of trade; the imposition of\nrestrictions on the access of their exports to world\nmarkets; unfair prices for their commodity exports; a\nheavy external debt burden; and the adverse effects of\nglobalization.\nDespite the progress made in many fields of\ninternational cooperation, the problems of hunger,\npoverty and such diseases as AIDS, malaria and\ntuberculosis have taken on horrific dimensions and\ncontinue to pose major challenges to the international\ncommunity. Unless the latter makes concerted efforts\nto accelerate equitable development in the developing\ncountries, especially the least developed countries, the\nMillennium Goal of halving poverty by 2015 will\nremain elusive.\nThe international community, by resolving, at the\nMillennium Summit, to declare war on poverty by\nlaunching an ongoing campaign to make the right to\ndevelopment a reality for all peoples, has made an\nimplicit commitment to creating a social, economic and\npolitical environment in the developing countries,\nespecially the least developed countries, that would be\nmore favourable to the translation into concrete reality\nof the right to development for all of their peoples.\nThat would provide cohesion and equitable social\nintegration for their societies as well as a real\nopportunity to eradicate poverty, enabling them to\nenjoy full, productive and gainful employment. The\ninternational community also resolved at the\nMillennium Summit to seek to achieve a fair and just\nglobalization that embraces everyone, in order to spare\nthe developing countries, especially the least developed\ncountries, the danger of being marginalized within the\ninternational economy.\nAt the Millennium Summit, world leaders\naffirmed that international cooperation was the most\nimportant factor in making the world a better place to\nlive in. They also affirmed that free trade,\nliberalization of the economy and interdependence are\nthe best means to accelerate equitable economic\ndevelopment in the developing countries.\nThe international community is at a critical stage\nof the negotiations related to the Doha Development\nAgenda. Those negotiations made concrete progress\nlast year in some difficult and controversial areas.\nAgreement was reached on the launching of\nnegotiations regarding the question of trade\nconcessions, one of the four questions which were left,\n38\n\nby agreement, outside the scope of the Doha\nProgramme of Action: investment, competition, trade\nand environment and trade concessions. However, that\nagreement by the developed countries was, regrettably,\nconditional on the non-holding of negotiations on the\nother three questions.\nWe are looking forward to the achievement of\nsolid, ambitious progress at the sixth World Trade\nOrganization Conference in Hong Kong, and we hope\nthat we will be able to conclude negotiations in 2006.\nThe developing countries have fulfilled their\npledges, and we hope that the upcoming negotiations\nregarding the implementation of the outcome of this\nsummit will translate into reality the global partnership\nfor the achievement of the internationally agreed\ndevelopment goals. We hope that the right to\ndevelopment will become a living reality and that the\ndeveloped countries will honour their pledges,\nincluding increasing official development assistance to\n0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product, and will\naccelerate the process of forgiving the external debt of\nall poor countries.\nWe have often stated that peace in the Middle\nEast can be achieved only through the implementation\nof the resolutions of the Security Council and of the\nGeneral Assembly. All of those resolutions recognize\nthe legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, foremost\namong which is the right to self-determination and to\nthe establishment of their independent State on their\nnational soil, with Al-Quds as its capital; withdrawal\nfrom the occupied Golan Heights up to the border of\n4 June 1967; and full withdrawal from the rest of the\nLebanese territories still under occupation.\nOn that basis, the international mediation process\nproduced the road map, which affirms the principle of\nland for peace and calls for the withdrawal of Israel\nfrom the occupied territories and the establishment of\nthe State of Palestine.\nThe Arab summit, meeting in Beirut in March\n2002, endorsed an international initiative calling for\nthe normalization of relations between the Arab States\nand Israel in return for Israel\u2019s withdrawal to the 1967\nborder.\nThe Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip is an\nimportant and positive first step, which, we hope, will\nbe followed by similar steps in all the Palestinian\nterritories and the other occupied Arab territories, in\naccordance with internationally binding resolutions and\nthe relevant initiatives and agreements, in order to\nbring about stability, security and a comprehensive and\njust peace for all States and peoples of the region.\nI cannot fail to mention the difficult conditions\nexperienced by the fraternal Iraqi people. We hope that\nthe new constitution will embody the hopes and\naspirations of the Iraqi people and contribute to the\nestablishment of security and stability in the country.\nWe hope also that it will take into consideration the\ninterests of all segments of the Iraqi population, that all\nthe people will feel that they all are part of the\nestablished system, and that the unity and the national\nidentity of Iraq will be preserved.\nBelieving as it does in the great importance of the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n(NPT) to international peace and security, the State of\nQatar has acceded to the Treaty and calls from this\nrostrum on all States to do so. It also seeks to transform\nthe Middle East region into a zone that is totally free\nfrom all kinds of weapons of mass destruction.\nMy country has unambiguously condemned\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. It has also\nsupported all Security Council resolutions related to\nthe question of terrorism, and it has cooperated with\nthe international community in implementing those\nagreements. However, we feel that success in\neradicating that phenomenon requires that we deal with\nits underlying causes, including the social, economic\nand political aspects that provide a fertile breeding\nground for terrorism.\nWe also support the idea of convening an\ninternational conference on terrorism and of drawing\nup an international strategy to combat it. In that\ncontext, we feel that defining terrorism and clearly\ndistinguishing it from the struggle waged by peoples in\nexercise of their legitimate right to defend their\nfreedom and enjoy self-determination must be the most\nimportant norm and enjoy international consensus.\nThis is a right that is enshrined in all international\nnorms and practices.\nOur world today more than ever needs a\ncomprehensive authority and frame of reference that is\nqualified to perform its role as an international\ninstrument; one that seeks to achieve international\ncooperation in resolving international problems of a\nsocial and economic nature, as well as consolidating\nsecurity and stability, maintaining international peace,\n39\n\nand enhancing respect for human rights and\nfundamental freedoms for all. Moreover, we must\nearnestly seek to respect this global diversity, protect it\nand allow it to prosper.\nHence, we feel that the proposal to establish a\nstanding Human Rights Council, with a smaller\nmembership, to be elected by a two-thirds majority\nonly, merits further study in serious intergovernmental\nnegotiations, with a view to achieving consensus on the\nestablishment of the proposed Council, its membership,\nits mandate, and the organ destined to be its parent\nbody, which we hope will be the General Assembly.\nWe must commit ourselves to human rights, as\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter, and we must\nfully comply with internationally recognized human\nrights standards.\nThe question of expanding the Security Council\nand the concept of collective security require further\nstudy and intergovernmental negotiations so as to\narrive at a consensus on these important questions.\nIn this context, we support the Secretary-General\non the question of reforming the United Nations\nSecretariat for the reasons indicated in his report\nentitled \u201cIn Larger Freedom\u201d. However, we feel that\nany proposals to reform the Secretariat are extremely\nimportant and must be the subject of careful study,\ndiscussion and negotiation by the General Assembly."

        "file_text": " On behalf\nof President Bush and all of the American people,\nwelcome to New York City.\nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, my fellow\ncitizens have experienced the compassion of the United\nNations. I want to thank Secretary-General Annan for\nmobilizing the support of this institution. I also want to\nthank the representatives of the 126 countries that have\noffered assistance in our relief efforts. The United\nStates will never forget their generosity in our time of\nneed.\nIn moments of tumultuous historical change,\nleaders must become architects of a better world. We\nmust survey the new international landscape, lay firm\nfoundations of moral principle and build institutions\n8\n\nthat reflect our unique moment in history. It is those\ninstitutions that enable citizens of conviction to lead us\never closer to the ideals of justice that stir every soul:\nthe universal desire for security, prosperity, liberty and\ndignity.\nSixty years ago was just such a time of\ntransformation. After one of the greatest cataclysms in\nworld history, the United States joined with visionary\nbuilders from over 50 countries to create the United\nNations. We placed the enduring principles of human\nrights and fundamental freedoms at the foundation of\nthe United Nations Charter. We built an institution that\nhas helped to support a peaceful world order for six\ndecades. Today, however, with the end of the cold war\nand the rise of globalization and the emergence of new\nthreats, the very terrain of international politics has\nshifted beneath our feet. In this new world we must\nagain embrace the challenge of building for the future.\nThe time to reform the United Nations is now. We\nmust seize this opportunity together. Chapter I, Article\n1, of the Charter of the United Nations proclaims the\nfour purposes of the United Nations, great aspirations\nthat have stood the test of time. But consider what\ndifferent forms they take today, in 2005, as opposed to\n1945, when they were first declared.\nThe first purpose of the United Nations is to help\nmaintain international peace and security. In 1945 the\nmost serious threats to peace and security emerged\nbetween States, and were largely defined by their\nborders. Today, however, the greatest threats we face\nemerge within States, and melt through their borders:\ntransnational threats like terrorism and the proliferation\nof weapons, pandemic disease and trafficking in human\nbeings.\nThe second purpose of this institution, as written\nin the United Nations Charter, is to develop friendly\nrelations among nations, based on equal rights and the\nself-determination of all peoples. In 1945, a life of\nliberty and dignity was more an aspiration than a\nreality for a majority of the world\u2019s people. Today,\nhowever, more nations than ever have enshrined the\nprinciples of democracy and human rights \u2014 a true\nmoral triumph that will be complete only when all\nindividuals are secure in their basic freedoms.\nThe third purpose of the United Nations is to\nachieve international cooperation in solving\ninternational problems. In 1945, the fear was that\nstrong, aggressive States, eager and able to expand\ntheir frontiers with force, would be the primary cause\nof international problems. Today, however, it is clear\nthat weak and poorly governed States, unwilling or\nincapable of ruling their countries with justice, are the\nprincipal source of global crises, from civil war and\ngenocide to extreme poverty and humanitarian disaster.\nThe final purpose of the United Nations, as the\nCharter states, is to be a centre for harmonizing the\nactions of nations in the attainment of common ends.\nIn 1945, the world\u2019s leaders joined together to build an\ninstitutional partnership that could address the shared\nchallenges of their time. Today, faced with the realities\nof a new world, we must transform the United Nations\nto meet the shared challenges of our time.\nThe Members of this body must work together to\nstrengthen security in a world threatened by stateless\nextremists. Today, I call on the nations of the world to\nratify the comprehensive convention on terrorism. No\ncause, no movement and no grievance can justify the\nintentional killing of innocent civilians and non-\ncombatants. That is unacceptable by any moral\nstandard. It is time for every Member of the United\nNations to outlaw acts of international terrorism.\nWe must also work together to promote\nprosperity and development in a world of great\npotential. The United States is committed to the\nMillennium Development Goals. And at the Monterrey\nConference three years ago all nations agreed that\ndevelopment must be a two-way street. Donor\ncountries have a responsibility to increase their\nassistance to developing nations. And developing\nnations have a responsibility to govern justly, advance\neconomic liberty and invest in their people. The\nMonterrey Consensus is working.\nNow is not the time to revert to old, failed\nthinking about development. Countries representing\nthree quarters of the developing world\u2019s population are\non a pace to meet the targets of the Millennium\nDeclaration by 2015.\nAnd, as President Bush said on Wednesday, the\nUnited States is prepared to take new action to\naccelerate this progress: we will eliminate all tariffs\nand subsidies that distort free trade \u2014 as other nations\ndo the same.\nMembers of the United Nations must work\ntogether as well to support democracy in a world of\nexpanding liberty. To advance this common purpose, in\n9\n\n2004 President Bush proposed the creation of a\ndemocracy fund. With the broad support of this body,\nwe have made it a reality. The Fund is now receiving\ndonations in cash and in kind from countries large and\nsmall that wish to help other nations lay the\nfoundations of democracy. Showing its leadership as\nthe world\u2019s largest democracy, India made the generous\nopening pledge of $10 million.\nNow, to be sure, when speaking about democracy,\nthe United States has every reason for humility. After\nall, it was only in my lifetime that America guaranteed\nthe right to vote for all its citizens. Obviously, the path\nto democracy is long and imperfect and different for\nevery nation. But the principles of democracy are\nuniversal, as is the desire for them. And the United\nNations must support every country that embraces the\nchallenge of self-government. In Afghanistan, Iraq,\nLebanon, the Palestinian territories and throughout the\nworld, peoples who want to build democracy deserve\nour help.\nThe many goals we share are great indeed. And\nthe United Nations has a major role to play in their\nachievement. But for this institution to become an\nengine of change in the twenty-first century, it must\nnow change itself. The United Nations must launch a\nlasting revolution of reform.\nThe United Nations summit declaration\n(resolution 60/1), which every head of State endorsed\nthis week, expresses a global consensus on the fact that\nreform is imperative. I want to thank former General\nAssembly President Ping for his tireless hard work.\nOur challenge now, under President Eliasson\u2019s\nleadership, is to enact the vital reforms that will make\nthe United Nations more accountable to its Members,\nmore suited to new challenges and more faithful to its\nfounding purposes.\nThe United States welcomes the commitment of\nall leaders to establish a new Peacebuilding\nCommission. Now, we must embrace the difficult task\nof implementing that vision. A Peacebuilding\nCommission should plan for post-conflict missions\nbefore crises erupt. And it must help to coordinate\nreconstruction efforts after the fighting stops. In a\nworld threatened by civil strife, the United Nations\nneeds to be better prepared to help countries rebuild in\nthe aftermath of conflict.\nWe are also pleased that the world\u2019s leaders have\nrecognized the importance of establishing a new\nHuman Rights Council. But it will take a lot of hard\nwork in the coming months to realize that goal. The\nHuman Rights Council must have fewer members, less\npolitics and more credibility. And it should never,\nnever, empower brutal dictatorships to sit in judgement\nof responsible democracies. The Human Rights\nCouncil must have the moral authority to condemn all\nviolators of human rights, even those that sit among us\nin this Hall.\nFinally, we welcome the promise of the world\u2019s\nleaders to make the United Nations a more effective\nand a more principled institution. As President Bush\nsaid on Wednesday (see A/60/PV.2), the United\nNations must stand for integrity and live by the high\nstandards it sets for others. For the United Nations to\nchampion democracy more legitimately, we must\nincrease the transparency and the accountability of this\ninstitution. For the United Nations to promote\nprosperity more credibly, tougher ethics rules and\ngreater internal oversight are needed to ensure the\nhighest professional standards. And to make the United\nNations relevant to the challenges of today, the purpose\nand the performance of all United Nations programmes\nmust be reviewed thoroughly, consistently and\ncomprehensively.\nOur fellow citizens deserve a United Nations that\ncommands their respect and is worthy of their hard-\nearned tax dollars. In a democracy, leaders must be\nable to justify that their people\u2019s money is indeed being\nwell spent.\nReal progress on those fundamental reforms will\nprove that the United Nations can address greater\nissues of change, in particular the reform of the\nSecurity Council. We want that important body to\nreflect the world as it is in 2005, not as it was in 1945.\nThe United States is open to expanding the Security\nCouncil. We have long supported a permanent seat for\nJapan. And we believe that developing countries\ndeserve greater representation on that body. All this\nwould make for a more effective Security Council.\nAnd the Security Council must be effective. It\nmust be able to deal with great challenges such as\nterrorism and nuclear proliferation, especially when it\nfaces real threats and when countries such as Iran\nthreaten the effectiveness of the global non-\nproliferation regime. When diplomacy has been\n10\n\nexhausted, the Security Council must become involved.\nQuestions about Iran\u2019s nuclear activities remain\nunanswered, despite repeated efforts by the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. And after\nagreeing to negotiate with Europe, Iran unilaterally\nwalked away from the talks and restarted its nuclear\nprogrammes. Iran should return to the negotiations\nwith the European Union three and abandon forever its\nplans for a nuclear-weapons capability.\nThe experience of recent years has reinforced the\nuniversal truth that international institutions are only as\nstrong and effective and relevant as their members\nchoose to make them. The United Nations is no\ndifferent.\nThe United States believes in a United Nations\nthat is strong and effective. And we have ambitious\nhopes for its future.\nSo in this year, as the United Nations marks its\nsixtieth anniversary, let us recommit ourselves to\nprincipled action. Let us embrace the same spirit of\ncreation that moved the builders and leaders of 1945.\nAnd let us reform this great institution to meet the\nchallenges of a new era."

        "file_text": "First, I would like to salute\nMr. Jean Ping, the outgoing President of the General\nAssembly, for the work he did to guide the General\nAssembly as the nations of the world considered the\nimmensely important matters that led to the elaboration\nof the outcome document that was adopted last night.\nI would also like to congratulate you, Sir, on your\nelection to preside over the sixtieth session of the\nGeneral Assembly. We are confident that you will lead\nthe Assembly well as it confronts the challenge of\nimplementing the decisions taken during the\nmillennium review summit and remains seized of other\nimportant matters that were not adequately addressed\nin the outcome document.\nShortly before we convened here for the\nmillennium review summit, an important meeting of\nChristian leaders took place in Washington, D.C. Those\nleaders issued a communique entitled \u00ecA Call to\nPartnership\u00ee, directed at our summit meeting. In part\nthe call says,\n\\\"At the urgent call of church leaders in the\nsouthern hemisphere, we came together at the\nWashington National Cathedral as Christian\nleaders from diverse traditions and places, both\nrich and poor, in the South and the North, united\nin a common concern for those of us living in\npoverty. We see their faces; we hear their voices;\nthey are a part of us, and we are a part of them.\\\"\nAs the United Nations reaches its sixtieth\nanniversary, we give thanks for its work in\npeacemaking and global reconciliation,\nparticularly the historic commitment to eradicate\npoverty in the Millennium Declaration of 2000.\n10\n\nFive years have passed, and, despite the triumph\nof principle, there has been a failure in practice.\nIn this communique, we offer our partnership to\nthe leaders gathered at the World Summit at the\nUnited Nations in building a global movement to\nmake real the promises of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals as a crucial step towards a\nmore just world for all God's children.\nWe believe that God calls us to place\npeople struggling with poverty at the centre of\nour concern. Globalization has brought\nunprecedented economic growth. At the same\ntime, one sixth of the world's people still fight\ndaily for survival under the crushing burden of\nextreme poverty. The increasing concentration of\nwealth in our world, while so many suffer, is a\nscandal that impoverishes us all.\n\\\"We believe that the spirit of partnership\nbetween rich and poor, exemplified in the MDGs,\nis a way the world can address poverty in all its\ndimensions. In particular, we support the goal of\na global partnership for development, and believe\nthat the Churches can make a unique contribution\nto that partnership.\\\"\nIf nothing else, the fact that the religious leaders\nwho issued that call gathered from many parts of the\nworld to agree on a message to our summit Meeting\nmust remind us that the masses - the people who\nelected us - entertain high expectations about the\nUnited Nations. They see this Organization as their\npre-eminent partner in the continuing struggle to build\na better and humane world.\nThey challenge those of us who have the\nprivilege to represent our States in the United Nations\nto build, strengthen and direct this world Organization\nso that it can, indeed, play its role as a pre-eminent\npartner of the peoples of the world in constructing a\nbetter and more humane world.\nAccordingly, I believe that we must view with the\ngreatest seriousness their conclusion that five years\nhave passed since we adopted the Millennium\nDeclaration and that, 'despite this triumph of principle,\nthere has been a failure in practice'.\nSixty years ago, in the aftermath of the\ndestructive fury of the Second World War and the\nvillainous genocide committed during that war, the\nUnited Nations was formed, in the words of the\nCharter, \\\"to save succeeding generations from the\nscourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought\nuntold sorrow to mankind\\\".\nResponding to the universal demand for human\nand peoples' rights, the founders declared that they\nwere forming the United Nations \\\"to reaffirm faith in\nthe fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth\nof the human person, in the equal rights of men and\nwomen and of nations large and small\\\" and to\n\\\"promote social progress and better standards of life in\nlarger freedom\\\".\nAs we gather here, in part to celebrate the sixtieth\nanniversary of an international Organization\nestablished to bring hope to the peoples of the world,\nwe cannot avoid asking some hard questions. That is\nnecessary if we are to live up to our obligation to\nensure that the United Nations discharges its\nresponsibilities, described by the religious leaders who\nmet at the Washington National Cathedral as\npeacemaking, global reconciliation and the eradication\nof poverty.\nWe must ask ourselves how well prepared the\nUnited Nations is today, 60 years after it was\nestablished, to save succeeding generations from the\nscourge of war; to protect and advance the fundamental\nhuman rights of all; to protect and advance the dignity\nand worth of each human person; to ensure equal rights\nbetween men and women; to ensure equal rights\nbetween nations large and small; and to promote social\nprogress and better standards of life in larger freedom.\nWe must ask - and answer honestly - whether\nwhat we do as the United Nations is properly described\nas a triumph of principle but a failure in practice, as the\nreligious leaders put it.\nThe reality is that, 60 years after the United\nNations was formed as a response to the appalling and\nghastly results of the crime of racism, we are still\nconfronted by the cancer of racism. Although the\nUnited Nations has adopted important decisions on that\nmatter, and convened the necessary conferences to\nunite the peoples of the world against racism, those\nwho continue to fall victim to that crime against\nhumanity would find it difficult to cite the instances\nwhen the United Nations came to their aid.\nSixty years after the United Nations was formed,\nthe indecencies of war and violent conflict continue to\nafflict innocent people, evidently because we, the\n11\n\nUnited Nations, lack the will to live up to the\ncommitment that was made when this Organization\nwas established.\nAfricans, who have been exposed to many violent\nconflicts since the United Nations was formed, are\nparticularly keen for this Organization to live up to its\nobligation to save succeeding African generations from\nthe scourge of war. Even as we speak, the United\nNations is faced with the urgent task of taking the\nnecessary action in C\u00d9te d\u00edIvoire to help to bring a\nlasting peace to that important African country,\nopening the way to its reunification, the holding of\ndemocratic elections and the promotion of social\nprogress and better standards of life in larger freedom,\nto use the words of the Charter.\nA similar challenge faces this Organization with\nregard to the restoration of lasting peace in Darfur in\nthe Sudan, building on the historic conclusion and\nimplementation of the Sudanese Comprehensive Peace\nAgreement, signed in Nairobi, Kenya, earlier this year.\nOnly 11 years ago, we experienced a terrible\ngenocide in Rwanda, and thousands were killed in the\ninternecine conflict that took place in the Balkans.\nThose who were exposed to the savagery would be\nfully justified in concluding that the United Nations\nhad betrayed its commitment to the peoples of the\nworld.\nI am certain that all of us are impatient to see an\nend to the conflicts in the Middle East, including Iraq,\nand in particular the restoration of the rights of the\npeople of Palestine, in the context of the successful\nimplementation of the road map.\nWhile we welcome recent positive developments\nin this regard, we must accept the reality that every day\nthat passes without the full implementation of the road\nmap only serves to point an accusing finger at us, the\nUnited Nations, accusing us of not having done\neverything we could to help secure the just and lasting\npeace that is the right of the Palestinian, the Israeli and\nthe Arab peoples.\nWe have all recognized the serious and urgent\nthreat posed by international terrorism to all our\nnations. We have all accepted the reality that we need a\nmultilateral response to that common threat. Yet we\nhave still not succeeded in arriving at a common\ndefinition of that threat or identified its fundamental\ncauses.\nThe issues of non-proliferation and the\ndisarmament of weapons of mass destruction are\nmatters of critical concern to all nations, both large and\nsmall. Yet we failed to address those matters in the\noutcome document adopted at the review summit last\nnight, even as the issue of nuclear weapons and their\nnon-proliferation is among the most prominent items in\nworld news and on the international agenda. None of\nus could justly claim that our failure as the United\nNations to take specific decisions on these matters\nserved to enhance global security in the face of the\nthreat of weapons of mass destruction.\nWith regard to the issue of Iran, we firmly believe\nthat negotiations should resume and that the matter be\nsettled within the framework of the provisions of the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\nand with the full participation of the International\nAtomic Energy Agency.\nThe gap between the rich and the poor is\nbecoming worse within and between countries, as\nobserved by the United Nations Development\nProgramme\u00eds 2005 Human Development Report, which\nstates that the gap between the average citizen in the\nrichest and in the poorest countries is wide and is\ngetting wider. It states that in 1990 the average\nAmerican was 38 times richer than the average\nTanzanian, while today the average American is 61\ntimes richer.\nThe same report states, on page 3,\n\\\"In 2003, 18 countries with a combined\npopulation of 460 million people registered lower\nscores on the human development index (HDI)\nthan in 1990 - an unprecedented reversal. In the\nmidst of an increasingly prosperous global\neconomy, 10.7 million children every year do not\nlive to see their fifth birthday, and more than 1\nbillion people survive in abject poverty on less\nthan a $1 a day.\\\"\nAccordingly, if we pause and scan the road\ntravelled to judge whether we have succeeded in saving\nthe world from the scourge of war; whether we have\nbuilt a world that has reaffirmed faith in fundamental\nhuman rights; whether we have created a world that\nhas restored the dignity and worth of the human\nperson - a world that has entrenched equal rights for\nmen and women and for nations, large and small - the\nanswer from the majority of the people of the world\nmay very well be a resounding \\\"No\\\".\n12\n\nThe United Nations has adopted many decisions\nintended to help address the various global challenges\nthat have persisted over the 60 years of its existence.\nAccordingly, we have the necessary policies to address\nthe social, economic, political and other problems\nfacing humanity. We have also adopted comprehensive\nand clear programmes to give effect to those policies\nand have identified the resources required for their\nimplementation.\nThe questions we must answer are: why have we\nnot implemented these programmes, and what must be\ndone to correct the situation?\nThe process of globalization means that our\ncommon world is more integrated today than it was\nwhen the United Nations was formed 60 years ago.\nSimilarly, the interconnectedness of the issues of\npeace, security, development and human rights has\nnever been more pronounced than it is today. All this\nmeans that the imperatives that made it necessary and\ncorrect to establish the United Nations as part of a\ndesirable system of global governance are that much\nmore compelling today, and that the necessary reform\nof the Organization must take place to ensure that it\nreflects the new global realities since it was formed\nand that it is empowered to respond effectively to the\nurgent challenges that face all humanity.\nAnd yet, the painful paradox we face is that it\nseems obvious that, over the years, there has been a\ncontinuous erosion of the authority and prestige of the\nUnited Nations and a sustained drift towards its\nmarginalization in terms of playing its rightful role, as\nso clearly defined in the United Nations Charter. At its\nsixtieth session, the General Assembly has the heavy\nresponsibility to reassert the critical need for the\nUnited Nations to discharge its responsibilities as\nspelled out in that Charter. Experience over the last 60\nyears has shown that, to address the criticism levelled\nagainst the Organization by religious leaders \u00f3 that\nthere has been a triumph of principle and a failure in\npractice \u00f3 we must be ready to engage in a sustained\nstruggle to ensure that the vision contained in the\nUnited Nations Charter is actually translated into\nreality.\nAs we engage in this struggle, we should say, as\ndid the religious leaders who met at the Washington\nNational Cathedral, that we are united in a common\nconcern for those of us living in poverty: \\\"We see their\nfaces; we hear their voices; they are a part of us, and\nwe are a part of them.\\\"\nLet me close by reiterating our deepest\nsympathies and condolences to the Government and the\npeople of the United States in the wake of the death\nand destruction wreaked by Hurricane Katrina."

Let me also pay tribute to his predecessor,\nHis Excellency Mr. Jean Ping, for his extraordinary\ndedication and leadership during the fifty-ninth\nsession. I also wish to express my Government\u00eds\nsincere appreciation to the Secretary-General, His\nExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan, for his tireless efforts\naimed at strengthening multilateralism and upholding\nthe purposes and principles of the United Nations.\nFive years ago, at the Millennium Summit, world\nleaders reaffirmed their faith in the United Nations and\nits Charter as indispensable foundations of a more\npeaceful, prosperous and just world. While there has\nbeen progress in some areas, much remains to be done\nto bring about the full realization of the ambitious\nGoals set forth in the Millennium Declaration.\nThe promise of a global partnership to realize the\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) remains\nunfulfilled for the vast majority of the peoples of\nAfrica, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, where\na total of more than one billion people still live below\nthe poverty line. For the Caribbean region in particular\nchallenges remain in the area of trade, where the\nerosion of tariff preferences for primary commodities\nsuch as bananas and sugar have been extremely\nprejudicial to the socio-economic development of\nmany countries of the Caribbean Community\n(CARICOM).\nThe Caribbean region has also been affected by\nthe HIV/AIDS pandemic, which has killed over 20\nmillion men, women and children worldwide. The\nimplicit threat to economic and social stability, human\ndevelopment and security cannot be underestimated or\ndenied.\nThe target of devoting 0.7 per cent of gross\nnational income to official development assistance\n(ODA) also remains an elusive goal, although there\nhave been encouraging signs recently, such as the\ncommitment made by the Group of Eight (G-8) at the\nGleneagles summit and the commitments of other\ndeveloped countries to meet that target by the year\n2015. Those commitments were reiterated in the 2005\noutcome document (resolution 60/1) of the High-level\nPlenary Meeting.\nAt the same time, we have been increasingly\nconfronted by humanitarian emergencies caused by\ndevastating natural disasters, with the resultant internal\ndisplacement of people. Once again, we wish to\nexpress our sympathy to the Government and the\npeople of the United States of America in the wake of\nHurricane Katrina. In our own CARICOM subregion,\nwe remain particularly vulnerable to the devastating\neffects of hurricanes. In the light of the extensive\ndamage inflicted on the sister island of Grenada last\nyear, we urge the United Nations, the international\ncommunity and donor agencies to give priority\nattention to the CARICOM subregion in the areas of\ndisaster preparedness and post-recovery assistance.\nThe rise of global terrorism, the threat of the\nproliferation of nuclear, biological and chemical\nweapons and the concomitant prospect of them falling\ninto the hands of non-State actors have emerged as\nissues of extreme urgency. The spread of small arms\nand light weapons - the weapons of choice in many\nintra-State conflicts - also poses a threat to the\nsecurity of many countries. In that regard, CARICOM\nis particularly concerned about the increasing\nincidence of violent crime caused by the presence of\nillegal firearms and their association with the illicit\ndrug trade.\nThe confluence of all those interconnected threats\nand challenges, as daunting as this may seem, can and\nmust be countered and effectively addressed. We must\ntherefore demonstrate the political will and the\ncommitment to act collectively to develop national and\nregional strategies with renewed resolve at the global\nlevel to support robust multilateralism, with a strong\nand effective United Nations at its centre. No one\nState, no matter how powerful, can act wholly by itself\nto resolve those common problems. There is also\nsimply no legitimate alternative to the United\nNations \u00f3 no comparable multilateral institution\nwhere all member States meet, deliberate, advance and\nharmonize their views and interests and negotiate and\nadopt instruments for collective action to the benefit of\nall.\nLast week, in adopting the outcome document,\nwe agreed to a road map, as it were, of measures\nrequired to reorient the United Nations to meet today\u00eds\nchallenges. Even as we reaffirm our faith in the United\nNations and our commitment to more robust\nmultilateralism, and even as we work towards a more\neffective United Nations through the implementation of\n8\n\nthe outcome document, we must recall that the main\npurpose of last week\u00eds Meeting was to review the\nprogress made since the Millennium Summit adopted\nthe MDGs, five years ago. Indeed, it is the overall\nimprovement in the lives of all our peoples, in whose\nname we are gathered here, by which history will\nultimately judge or condemn us. Permit me, therefore,\nto offer some views on issues that Trinidad and Tobago\nconsiders paramount, and on the principles that should\nserve as a guide for our future deliberations.\nThose must of necessity include the following:\nthe imperative of recommitting ourselves, as a matter\nof priority, to the full realization of the development\ngoals and objectives that have emerged from major\nUnited Nations conferences and summits, including the\nMDGs; greater democratization of all United Nations\norgans and related bodies, in terms of both their\ncomposition and their mode of operations; strict\nobservance of the rule of international law and justice;\nand respect for the commonly shared values on which\nthe United Nations is founded.\nDevelopment must remain central to the agenda\nof the United Nations.\nTrinidad and Tobago supports the increased\nattention of the international community towards\nAfrica in overcoming its developmental challenges and\nin providing that continent with the increased resources\nneeded to enable it to fully implement the New\nPartnership for Africa\u00eds Development (NEPAD).\nWe welcome in particular the commitment\ncontained in the outcome document to the\nimplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action\nfor the Sustainable Development of Small Island\nDeveloping States. We call for the full and effective\nimplementation of the commitments, programmes and\ntargets contained in the Mauritius Strategy, adopted at\nthe International Meeting to Review the\nImplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action\nfor the Sustainable Development of Small Island\nStates.\nTrinidad and Tobago has demonstrated\nremarkable strength and resilience in the face of a\nglobal environment characterized by rapid economic,\nsocial and other changes. We have embarked on the\nroad to developed-nation status and hope to reach our\ngoal by the year 2020 or earlier.\nOur Vision 20/20 includes the evolution of a\ntechnologically driven, knowledge-based society, a\nhighly productive and globally competitive economy,\nand the provision of a standard of living comparable to\nthat of the developed world. To achieve that vision, the\nGovernment of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago is\ndeveloping its human capital by creating a virtually\nseamless educational system from the primary to the\ntertiary level, with increasing emphasis on information\ntechnology and other related subjects. In this way we\nwill ensure that our young people can become an\nintegral part of the global labour force, with the\nnecessary skills to compete locally, regionally and\ninternationally.\nOur development agenda is not centred solely on\nthe Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. It is, as my\nPrime Minister stated from this very rostrum one year\nago, \\\"part and parcel of a pan-Caribbean agenda to\nwhich we are irrevocably and solidly committed -\n[and in which the] development of Trinidad and\nTobago and CARICOM are intertwined\\\". (A/59/PV.10,\np. 8)\nWe therefore remain committed to the integration\nof the Caribbean region through the instrumentality of\nCARICOM. To that end, Trinidad and Tobago has\nprovided substantial financial and economic assistance\nto our CARICOM neighbours through a variety of\nmechanisms, including capital market activities, direct\nforeign investment, debt relief and direct bilateral\nassistance. We have also provided extensive hurricane\nrelief as well as assistance to the private sector in\nCARICOM to strengthen their export capability.\nAs an energy surplus country, Trinidad and\nTobago has, through its own Petroleum Stabilization\nFund, made financial assistance available to\nCARICOM countries to the tune of some $48 million\nper annum \u00f3 and this without any conditionalities.\nNo development or security assessment in our\nsubregion would be complete without consideration of\nthe grave political, economic, social and security crisis\nthat confronts the Haitian people. We look forward to\nthe holding of free, fair, democratic and inclusive\nelections in Haiti and to the installation of a truly\ndemocratically elected Government in that nation, so\nthat Haiti can once again sit in the Council of\nCARICOM.\nTrinidad and Tobago and other CARICOM States\nremain committed over the long term to securing the\n9\n\nprogress and future of the Haitian people. We therefore\nurge the United Nations system and the international\ndonor community to provide the necessary support to\nHaiti in the post-election period. Effective assistance,\nthe disbursement of funds pledged and the release of\nother resources will ensure the progress of a nation\ncurrently overwhelmed by daunting challenges.\nIn the area of disarmament, we share the\ndisappointment of many Member States at our failure\nto demonstrate the necessary political will to ensure the\nconsensus adoption of agreements leading to tangible\nand substantive results at the Review Conference of the\nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) and in the outcome document.\nTrinidad and Tobago reiterates its condemnation\nof terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and it\nis committed to doing its part to eradicate that scourge\nfrom our world. In that vein, we look forward to the\nearly conclusion of a draft comprehensive convention\non international terrorism.\nIn addition, we welcome the action taken by\nmembers of the international community to combat\nterrorism, but we would wish to reiterate that the\nhuman rights and the civil and political rights of\nindividuals must be respected in the course of any\ncounter-terrorism actions taken by Member States of\nthe international community.\nAs a small island developing State, we face\ndifficulties associated with the evils of the drug trade\nand the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons.\nAs a result, it is becoming increasingly difficult to stem\nthe tide of criminal activity within our society.\nTrinidad and Tobago believes that an\ninternational order based on the rule of law must be\nobserved in relations between and among States. This\nfundamental pillar is indispensable for the proper\nfunctioning of the international system. In their\nrelations, States must have regard, at all times, for the\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and of\ninternational law.\nWe reaffirm in particular those principles relating\nto the sovereign equality of all States Members of the\nUnited Nations, non-interference in the internal affairs\nof Members, respect for their political and territorial\nintegrity, the right of peoples to self-determination, and\nrecourse to peaceful means for the settlement of\ndisputes.\nWe also reaffirm the important role of the\nGeneral Assembly in the development of international\ntreaties.\nTrinidad and Tobago expresses its deep regret at\nthe failure of the outcome document to include any\nreference to the International Criminal Court or the\nquestion of impunity. In that regard, we call on all\nStates Members of the United Nations to become\nparties to the Rome Statute of the International\nCriminal Court in order to ensure that it becomes a\ntruly global instrument for the trial of those accused of\ncommitting crimes that affront the conscience of all\nhumanity.\nMy country welcomes the cooperation between\nthe International Criminal Court and the United\nNations, which was highlighted earlier this year when\nthe Security Council decided to refer the situation in\nDarfur to the Court. We look forward to increased\nopportunities for collaboration and cooperation\nbetween these two important global institutions in\nputting an end to such crimes and to the culture of\nimpunity that has for so long accompanied them.\nTrinidad and Tobago reaffirms its commitment to\nthe reform and strengthening of the United Nations. We\nshare the view that the reform of the United Nations\nmust seek to reinforce and consolidate the democratic\nfoundation upon which this Organization was built.\nWe are of the view that cardinal to the reform\nagenda must be the revitalization and restoration of the\nrole and authority of the General Assembly, as the\nchief deliberative, policymaking and representative\norgan of the United Nations.\nTrinidad and Tobago supports the comprehensive\nreform of the Security Council. In that regard, we wish\nto underline the importance of the adoption by the\ninternational community of a comprehensive set of\nreform measures. It is imperative that expansion should\nproceed on the basis of making the Council more\nrepresentative of the general membership of the United\nNations. It should contribute to a greater\ndemocratization of its functioning. It should impart\ngreater legitimacy and transparency to its decisions,\nand it should be achieved through the broadest possible\nconsultation.\nTrinidad and Tobago also looks forward to\nparticipating in discussions on reform of the United\n10\n\nNations human rights machinery and on the pending\nissues relating to the Peacebuilding Commission.\nTrinidad and Tobago commends the Secretary-\nGeneral for his ongoing efforts to enhance the effective\nmanagement of the United Nations. An efficient,\neffective, well-resourced Secretariat which is\naccountable to the General Assembly is indispensable\nto achieving the objectives of a strengthened\nOrganization.\nTrinidad and Tobago welcomes the Secretariat\nand management reform proposals contained in the\noutcome document as a first step towards a necessary\nthorough debate and discussion, and we look forward\nto participating actively in these negotiations.\nIt is imperative, however, that these proposals\nmeet the test of viability, that they have the sanction of\nthe established intergovernmental process and that they\ndo not individually or collectively seek to derogate,\ndiminish or further marginalize the role of the General\nAssembly.\nAs we embark on the path of implementation of\nthe outcome document, we must spare no effort to\nensure that the future of the United Nations is not\ncompromised by the exigencies of the moment.\nInstitutional renewal, a strengthened United Nations\nand a robust multilateralism must allow us to forge a\ntruly effective global response and commitment to the\ncommon threats and challenges that confront us.\nTrinidad and Tobago pledges to do its part to\nmake the United Nations a more effective instrument in\nthe common service of all our peoples."

        "file_text": "On\nbehalf of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, I am\npleased to extend to Mr. Eliasson my wholehearted\ncongratulations on his election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its sixtieth session. We are\nconvinced that his wealth of experience and immense\ntalent will allow him to address the international and\nregional issues on our agenda with confidence and\nensure the success of this session, which coincides with\nthe sixtieth anniversary of our Organization.\nI cannot fail to seize this opportunity to pay\ntribute to his predecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, Minister for\nForeign Affairs of Gabon, for his gifted and patient\nperformance at the helm of the General Assembly at\nthe fifty-ninth session and for his tireless efforts to\nestablish the appropriate conditions for the holding of\nthe session and the High-level Plenary Meeting that\npreceded it.\nI should also like warmly to congratulate\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan and his colleagues on\ntheir intense and consistent mediation and efforts to\nensure the convening of this session and the\nachievement of the Organization\u2019s lofty objectives.\nI also hail the major efforts made during the\nintersessional period at the high-level dialogue begun\nin New York in late June on financing for development\nand at the Economic and Social Council session on\nnational achievements and steps towards the attainment\nof the Millennium Development Goals and to\nimplement the outcomes of the international\nconferences held from 1992 to 2002.\nAttaining the objectives of development, security\nand stability hinges on how effectively we deal with\nthe issues of violence and terrorism. The global nature\nof the phenomenon of terrorism requires that the\nquestion be dealt with in a global manner, through the\ncomplementarity of the cultures of nations and a\nrejection of confrontation and conflict. It is also\nimportant not to forget the considerable growth gap\nthat exists between poor and rich countries, particularly\nsince the social, scientific and technical lag is one of\nthe major causes of tension and one that nurtures\nterrorism and violence in the world. In Mauritania, we\ncondemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,\nand we view it as a phenomenon that is alien to our\nsociety and our Islamic values of tolerance. We reject\nviolence and extremism and call for mutual\nunderstanding, dialogue and tolerance.\nIt is clear that we must quickly begin a political\ndialogue, which is the only means to end the conflict in\nthe Middle East and to restore calm there. In this\ncontext, my country believes that the Israeli\nwithdrawal from Gaza and a few cities of the West\nBank constitutes an important step towards the\nimplementation of the road map and the Arab peace\ninitiatives. Through those initiatives Arab States have\nproposed to Israel a comprehensive peace and normal\nrelations in exchange for total withdrawal from all\nPalestinian territories and from Syrian and Lebanese\nterritories, a return to the 4 June 1967 borders, the\nestablishment of a Palestinian State with East\nJerusalem as its capital, and a negotiated, just\nsettlement of the problem of Palestinian refugees.\nWe are following with interest the developments\nof the situation in Iraq and are anxious to preserve\nIraq\u2019s territorial unity, the unity of its people, its\nsovereignty, independence and non-interference in its\ninternal problems, in order to overcome the problems\nand ensure security, stability and the re-construction of\nthe State, while supporting the transitional\nGovernment.\nWe are following with equal interest the\ndevelopment of the situation in the Sudan, and we give\nour blessing to the Agreement between the\nGovernment of Sudan and the Sudanese People\u2019s\nLiberation Army. We support the commendable efforts\nof the Sudanese Government, in coordination with the\nAfrican Union, the Arab League and the United\nNations, to tackle humanitarian, security and political\nquestions related to the Darfur crisis.\nRegarding Western Sahara, Mauritania supports\nthe efforts of the United Nations and its Secretary-\nGeneral to find a definitive solution to assure stability\nin the region, a solution that has the support of all\nparties.\nMauritania today is on the eve of an era that\nbegan with an initiative taken by the Military Council\nfor Justice and Democracy on 3 August 2005, which\nwas hailed by the entire Mauritanian people. It put an\nend to totalitarian practices that caused suffering and\nled to dangerous derailments that threatened the future\nof the country over the last two decades. This initiative\nrests on the commitment of the Council to the\nMauritanian people to create the right conditions for\nthe emergence of an honest and transparent democracy\nand to allow civil society and all legal political actors\n10\n\nto participate in this endeavour with full freedom. The\nMilitary Council will not exercise its powers beyond\nthe period necessary to prepare for and set up genuine\ndemocratic institutions, and that period will not extend\nbeyond two years. The Military Council for Justice and\nDemocracy solemnly reaffirms respect for all of\nMauritania\u2019s international commitments and instruments.\nIn crystallizing this initiative, the Military\nCouncil for Justice and Democracy has defined the\npriorities of the transitional Government. It has\nestablished three ministerial committees entrusted with\nthe task of defining the modalities to guarantee proper\nelections, working together with political parties and\ncivil society organizations to establish an equitable\nlegal system, in consultation with the national bar\nassociation. The aim of these efforts is to propose all\nmeasures necessary for the emergence of a genuine\nsystem of good governance, in which the private sector\nand civil society participate.\nIn order to ensure justice and national\nreconciliation and to enable all people to participate\nfreely and actively in political life, a comprehensive\nand absolute amnesty was proclaimed on 2 September\n2005 for all Mauritanians condemned for political\ncrimes and misdemeanours. At this point in time, no\nMauritanian is being prosecuted for any political crime\ndomestically or abroad.\nFor the first time, the mass media are open to all\npolitical parties and civil society institutions. A\nconstitutional law was enacted prohibiting the\nPresident and members of the Military Council for\nJustice and Democracy, the Prime Minister and\nmembers of the Transitional Government from\nstanding in the forthcoming elections or supporting any\npolitical candidate or party. An independent elections\ncommittee was formed to supervise elections, seeking\nhelp from any nation willing to help. It is in this\ncontext that Mauritania presented a memorandum to\nthe United Nations regarding provision of assistance to\ninternational observers invited by the Mauritanian\nGovernment to provide technical and logistical\nassistance for the elections. This is with a view to\nconducting a constitutional referendum, which will be\norganized by July 2006 at the latest, as well as\nlegislative and presidential elections to be held before\n6 August 2007. The referendums and elections would\nbe held in accordance with the commitment made by\nthe Military Council for Justice and Democracy with\nthe Transitional Government, in order to provide the\nappropriate conditions for a transparent and open\ndemocracy and to facilitate the establishment of\ninstitutions that will be truly representative and\ndiverse.\nMauritania is eager to contribute to the\ndevelopment of cooperation and solidarity in the\nregional context. It is in that context that we would like\nto reaffirm our total support for the Arab Maghreb,\nwhich remains an incontrovertible strategic choice and\nan ambitious project for the people of the region in\ntheir aspirations to greater complementarity and\nsolidarity.\nWith regard to the African continent, we would\nlike to reiterate the importance we attach to our\nfriendship and brotherly relations with all countries of\nthe continent. We would like to further strengthen\ncultural dialogue, communications and relations, which\nwe have pledged to do within the Five-plus-Five\nframework and the Barcelona process, the tenth\nanniversary of which we shall celebrate this year.\nGiven ongoing world changes, we would like to\nsee the role and functions of the General Assembly\nenhanced and to see its decisions implemented. That\nholds true for other organs of the United Nations, in\nparticular the Economic and Social Council.\nThe Security Council needs to be strengthened,\nand to be made more representative by including\nmembers from Africa, Latin America and other regional\ngroups, such as the Arab Group, as well as other\nindustrialized States such as Germany and Japan. Finally,\nthe working methods of the Council and its performance\nneed to be improved so that it can achieve its mandate\nof maintaining international peace and security."

        "file_text": "Sixty years ago at San Francisco, the United\nNations Charter was adopted. It was an event that set\nthe path for the future of nations and peoples. It was an\nevent at which intelligence was resolutely dedicated to\npeace and justice, and willpower was used for the\ncommon interest.\nWith the adoption of the outcome document by\nthe High-level Plenary Meeting, a process of\n15\n\nparamount importance has been set in motion, one in\nwhich you, Sir, can count on the full support of the\ndelegation of Spain. I wish to pay tribute to the\nsustained effort of your predecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, and\nto reiterate to our Secretary-General my admiration for\nhis personal and diplomatic skills.\nThere can be no doubt that the United Nations\nhas taken a step forward as a result of the High-level\nPlenary Meeting. We have achieved progress in\nessential areas. Spain is satisfied with the outcome\nbecause we have stressed the importance of assisting\nvictims of terrorism. The Alliance of Civilizations\ninitiative has been well received. The summit recalled\nthe need to continue assisting middle-income countries\nand supported the search for new sources of financing\nfor implementation of the Action against Hunger and\nPoverty initiative.\nI would like to mention here that an initiative on\nUnited Nations reform was unanimously adopted by\nthe Spanish Parliament on 13 September 2005, urging\nthe Government to achieve a number of objectives that\nare now reflected in the outcome document of the\nrecent High-level Meeting. We recognized in that\ndocument that development, peace and security and\nhuman rights constitute the three basic interdependent\nand interrelated pillars of the United Nations system\nand are the foundation for our collective security and\nwell-being. In our globalized world, we can solve\ninternational problems, and deal with new challenges\nand risks only through concerted action based on\nsolidarity.\nAmong those collective actions, the fight against\nterrorism is an absolute priority for Spain. The General\nAssembly should adopt a global strategy that includes\nthe goal of creating an international fund for victims.\nSpain has just signed the International Convention for\nthe Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, and in\nthe Sixth Committee Spain is determined to promote\nthe adoption of a comprehensive convention on\ninternational terrorism before the end of this sixtieth\nGeneral Assembly.\nThe summit concluded that tolerance, respect,\ndialogue and cooperation amongst different cultures,\ncivilizations and peoples are essential elements for the\npromotion of international peace and security. This is\nprecisely the conviction that inspired the President of\nthe Government of Spain to propose the Alliance of\nCivilizations initiative at the previous General\nAssembly. The Secretary-General's High-level Group\nto guide the initiative will hold its first meeting in my\ncountry this autumn. This initiative, co-sponsored by\nthe President of the Government of Spain and the\nPrime Minister of Turkey, is more necessary today than\never. It is imperative to put an end to the negative drift\nin mutual perceptions that is being fomented and used\nby extremist groups.\nIt is also urgent to find innovative and additional\nsources of financing for development. For that reason,\nSpain, along with five other countries, is promoting the\nAction against Hunger and Poverty initiative with the\naim of identifying innovative and additional sources of\nfinancing for development. In this regard, Spain\nactively participates in the cancellation of debt to\nbenefit the heavily indebted poor countries and is\npreparing a plan to swap debt for public investment in\nkey human development areas in Latin America.\nLet me reiterate Spain's firm commitment to\npeacekeeping operations, which translates into\nsubstantial contributions of our armed and security\nforces wherever needed, especially in the Balkans,\nHaiti and Afghanistan. I would like to underline the\nhigh degree of commitment and professionalism shown\nby Spanish peacekeeping forces and recall with pride\nthose who have sacrificed their lives for international\npeace and security. The creation of a Peacebuilding\nCommission is another outstanding achievement of this\nsummit. Spain, as an important contributor to the\nUnited Nations budget and to its peacekeeping\noperations, is ready to participate actively in the work\nof this commission.\nSince its inception this Organization has been\ndetermined to provide the international community\nwith a binding legal framework for the protection and\npromotion of human rights. Spain shares this goal. We\nhave strengthened our cooperation with the Office of\nthe High Commissioner for Human Rights, and we\nhave increased our contribution to its budget. We are\nalso pleased with the establishment of a Human Rights\nCouncil and are fully prepared to contribute actively to\nthe work of this new council. Over the past year,\nimportant legislative developments have occurred in\nmy country, and we have taken significant steps to\npromote real equality among citizens in areas such as\ngender violence and discrimination on grounds of\nsexual orientation. The Government has also tackled\nthe situation of immigrant workers through the\n16\n\nimplementation of a broad-ranging legalization\nprocess.\nWe firmly support the reform process aimed at\nstrengthening the effectiveness of the United Nations,\nwhich will ensure the concrete implementation of its\nresolutions. It is of little use to improve existing\nstructures, if there is no enforcement of compliance\nwith decisions. The United Nations must regain its\ncredibility. We believe that the reform, especially that\nof the Security Council, must be the result of a broad\nagreement among all of us.\nI agree with the Secretary-General that our\ngreatest failure has to do with non-proliferation and\ndisarmament. For Spain, nuclear proliferation\nrepresents a serious risk for international peace and\nsecurity. We are concerned about the illicit trade in\nsmall arms and light weapons, and we support the\npreparation of an international arms trade treaty.\nI cannot but mention here, once again this year,\nthe question of Gibraltar and the need to put an end to\nthis dispute through the implementation of the repeated\nmandates of the General Assembly that have urged\nSpain and the United Kingdom to continue their\nbilateral negotiations, with a view to reaching a\ndefinitive solution to the decolonization process, in\naccordance with the relevant United Nations\nresolutions. Spain is willing to work in a constructive\nspirit; this spirit is reflected in the creation of a\ntrilateral dialogue forum, the aim of which is to\nproduce an atmosphere of mutual trust and cooperation\nfor the benefit and prosperity of Gibraltar and the\nregion as a whole.\nNext month, Spain will host the fifteenth Ibero-\nAmerican Summit in Salamanca. It will be a meeting\nthat will constitute a turning point in the creation of a\ntrue Ibero-American forum, with the\ninstitutionalization of its secretariat and the\nmanifestation of a stronger will to contribute to\neffective multilateralism.\nSpain pays particular attention to its relations\nwith its neighbours in the Maghreb region. Through an\nactive and comprehensive policy, Spain wishes to\nreinforce its cooperation with those countries, firmly\nsupporting political stability, respect for human rights\nand those reforms that are put in place to consolidate\nthe rule of law and economic and social development.\nIn this regard, Spain firmly believes that the\nWestern Sahara conflict, which has lasted for almost 30\nyears, requires priority attention. The international\ncommunity must contribute to overcome the stalemate\nand offer, within the framework of the United Nations,\na just and definitive political solution, in accordance\nwith international law. To that end, Spain is developing\nan active diplomacy and believes that steps taken, such\nas the recent appointments by the Secretary-General of\nhis Personal Envoy and of the Special Representative\nfor the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in\nWestern Sahara, will provide the opportunity to\nrelaunch the process.\nIn the Middle East, the disengagement from\nGaza, carried out with great skill and with great\neffectiveness by the Israeli Government, may\nconstitute a powerful driving force in the peace\nprocess. It is only right to congratulate the Government\nof Israel for its decision. I also extend my\ncongratulations to the Palestinian National Authority\nfor having significantly contributed to the entire\noperation, so that it was completed in a peaceful\nmanner. Now that the disengagement has been\nsatisfactorily completed, the road map must again\nbecome the central framework for the peace process.\nMoreover, the time has come to increase our aid\nto Africa and to support African countries in their\nefforts aimed at integration, peace and progress.\nThe summit outcome document is a good starting\npoint to continue working towards achieving the\nagreements that still elude us. We cannot allow\ninaction, lack of ambition or shortsightedness to\nprevent the successful conclusion of the task ahead.\nSixty years ago the signatories of the United Nations\nCharter translated into an agreement a thought that was\nas solid as it was simple: we can either walk together\ntowards peace, or we will never find it. A year ago,\nbefore this Assembly, the President of the Spanish\nGovernment recalled that the history of humanity does\nnot give us many reasons to be optimistic. Let us work\nwith imagination and commitment to turn this\nOrganization into an expression of common will, an\nOrganization legitimized by its effectiveness and its\nuniversal character. Let us work so that some day we\nwill feel proud as human beings. We are the United\nNations, and the people of the world expect us to act as\nsuch in the face of the challenges and opportunities\nafforded to us in these times of change."

Your wealth of\nexperience in matters of security, human rights and\ndevelopment augur well for the success of our\ndiscussions.\nI would also like to pay tribute to Jean Ping,\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Gabon, whose\nmoderation, sense of compromise and restraint won\nhim universal respect and esteem during the previous\nsession.\nMay I also express my sincere gratitude to the\nSecretary-General for his tireless efforts in the cause of\npeace, democracy and development. That triad \u2014\npeace, democracy and development \u2014 is now the new\nname for progress made by peoples and for stability in\nthe world.\nIt is in that context that, for more than a year\nnow, the Organization has deployed the United Nations\nStabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), which is\nhelping to improve the security climate in the country.\nWe requested the Mission because of our firm belief in\ninternational solidarity. We would like to take this\nopportunity to thank all those countries that have\ndisplayed their friendship to Haiti by contributing in\none way or another to the deployment of MINUSTAH.\nFrom this rostrum, I would like to express my\nsincerest sympathy for the afflicted populations of the\nsouthern part of the United States of America that have\nbeen so tragically affected by the passage of Hurricane\nKatrina in August, one of the most devastating\nhurricanes ever to strike our continent. We would like\nonce again to express to the Government and people of\nthe United States our deepest compassion and our\nprofound solidarity in these trying times.\nOur Organization is now 60 years old. The\ncelebration of that anniversary will be a splendid\nextension of the High-level Plenary Meeting of heads\nof State or Government, which was intended as an\ninitial stocktaking of the implementation of the\ncommitments undertaken in the Millennium\nDeclaration.\nThe Government of Haiti supports the spirit of\nthe text adopted on 16 September, which broadly\nreviews the minimum objectives that the international\ncommunity intends to achieve by 2015. Likewise, the\nRepublic of Haiti supports all steps taken to increase\ndevelopment assistance through the use of funds of\nsolidarity at the international level.\nThe Government of Haiti attaches the greatest\nimportance to the proposal of the French Republic to\ncreate stable and lasting financing through innovative\nmechanisms in order to prevent and cure the major\npandemics of our time. I am pleased to note that many\nof the world\u2019s leaders have received that proposal with\nthe greatest interest.\nWe also welcome various other initiatives,\nincluding the United Kingdom proposal for an\nInternational Financial Facility, which arranges for\nborrowing on the financial markets to increase\nassistance to the poorest countries, in particular for the\nfight against HIV/AIDS. It deserves our consideration.\nHowever, those efforts may not achieve their\nobjectives if a comprehensive solution to the debt\nproblem of the countries of the South is not found. It\nwould be a positive contribution to international\nsecurity to solve the debt problem by cancelling the\n8\n\ndebts of the least developed countries and helping\nthose countries overcome their financial difficulties by\nassisting their development. The Republic of Haiti\nunreservedly supports all negotiated, effective,\ncomprehensive and lasting initiatives of the United\nNations aimed at solving the distressing debt problem\nof the peoples of the poor countries.\nOn the sixtieth anniversary of our Organization,\nwe should heed the many calls for the reform of the\nUnited Nations. Certainly, significant progress is being\nmade, in particular the proposal to transform the\nCommission on Human Rights into a Human Rights\nCouncil. Chapter XIII of the Charter should be\nremoved, along with the references to trusteeship\ncontained in Chapter XII.\nWith respect to the Security Council, the\nRepublic of Haiti supports paragraph 153 of the\noutcome document, which proposes the early reform of\nthe Security Council in order to make it more broadly\nrepresentative, efficient and transparent and thus to\nfurther enhance the Council\u2019s effectiveness and the\nlegitimacy degree of implementation of its decisions.\nIn that regard, I reaffirm the position of Haiti, as\nexpressed by Prime Minister G\u00e9rard Latortue, in favour\nof correcting the historical error of not having a\nrepresentative of the Latin American and Caribbean\nregion among the permanent members of the Security\nCouncil.\nThe Republic of Haiti is at the crossroads. In a\nfew weeks, general elections will be held throughout\nthe country to select the nation\u2019s elected\nrepresentatives at all levels. The elections are\nthoroughly inclusive. All sectors and all political\nparties without exception are participating. Admittedly,\nthe road to completing the process has been difficult,\nmarked by the outbreak of violence and feverish\nmoments. Rediscovering freedom is not easy. During\nlong months, the country has lived in a situation\nbordering on chaos, in which armed bands have held\nmany of the capital\u2019s neighbourhoods hostage and\ncommitted the worst atrocities. Fortunately, they have\nbeen, for the most part, held in check by the combined\nefforts of the Haitian National Police and the United\nNations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH).\nCalm is gradually returning. I am convinced that\nthe electoral campaign will take place in a peaceful\nclimate, in spite of the large number of presidential\ncandidates. At present, the horizon is brightening\nperceptibly, despite the desperate acts of ruthless\ngangs. Also, a national dialogue has been launched\ninvolving all relevant sectors of the country. The\npreparatory committee established for the purpose will\nshortly issue its report.\nIn that context, the Government and the people of\nHaiti are grateful to the United Nations and friendly\ncountries of all continents for their solidarity with Haiti\nand for their interest in the successful outcome of the\npresent elections. Nothing can now stop the march\ntowards pluralist and democratic elections, to be held\nin a climate of security ensured by the Haitian National\nPolice, with the support of MINUSTAH.\nHaiti\u2019s chronic political instability and serious\nsocio-economic problems have compelled a great\nnumber of our fellow citizens to migrate to\nneighbouring shores considered to be more hospitable.\nHowever, tensions are now arising among a certain\nfringe sector of the local population of the host\ncountries. We request the leaders of those countries to\ndeal with that issue urgently in order to stop radicals\nfrom taking advantage of the situation and committing\nabuses against expatriate Haitians. For our part, we are\nopen to all negotiations aimed at restoring calm and\nfinding solutions in accordance with international\ntreaties and rights related to immigration.\nAt this decisive moment of the transition, we\nrenew our appeal to the international community to\nvisit us to observe the holding of the elections. We\nwant transparent elections in which the candidates\nelected will not be challenged. We are grateful to the\nUnited Nations for the support that it is providing to\nHaiti during this critical period.\nI reiterate the solemn appeal that I made from this\nrostrum one year ago to the international community\nnot to leave Haiti isolated, so that, on 7 February 2006,\nI can hand over power to a new, freely elected\nPresident, thereby placing Haiti once and for all in the\ncommunity and comity of democratic nations; so that\nthe Government which emerges from the elections can\nget down to the challenging task of economic\nreconstruction and social progress \u2014 with, of course,\nthe resolute support and unflagging solidarity of the\ninternational community; so that Haiti can emerge from\nunderdevelopment and extreme poverty, which provide\nfertile ground for all dictatorships; and so that the\ncountry can finally recover its unity and its soul.\n9\n\nIn that spirit of solidarity and authentic\ncooperation \u2014 which is, after all, the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of\nthe United Nations \u2014 the Republic of Haiti will work\nto achieve, between now and 2015, the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals, to which all countries aspire."

        "file_text": "Let me begin by\ncongratulating Mr. Eliasson on his election to the\n21\n\npresidency. He is at the steering wheel of one of the\nmost challenging sessions of the General Assembly in\nhistory \u2014 not only because it is the sixtieth\nanniversary of our Organization but mainly because of\nour agenda and the gravity of problems awaiting\nresolution. While thanking his able and devoted\npredecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, I would like to wish the\nPresident every success in the coming months of hard\nand hopefully rewarding work.\nThe European Union invested a huge effort in the\npreparations for both the High-level Plenary Meeting\nand our current session, and the Czech Republic was an\nintegral and active part of this process. We heard the\nstatement of the European Union presidency a few\ndays ago, and I have no intention of repeating it.\nRather, let me present here several ideas and comments\nof a more general nature.\nMillions of our fellow human beings in Africa\nand elsewhere are trapped in absolute poverty, with\nlittle or no access to education, medical and other\nservices, and are deprived of a dignified existence. In\ntheir regions or in other parts of the world, fascinating\ntechnical achievements and thriving economies enable\nlarge numbers of people to enjoy an unprecedentedly\nhigh quality of life. Some may simply conclude that\nthere are several distinct worlds on our planet. But\nwhile the gaps may still be widening, let us be sure that\nwe all live in only one increasingly interconnected\nworld. There is no way to separate the rich from the\npoor or to separate different ethnic groups. And the\nresponsibility for our future is equally indivisible.\nMoreover, we are repeatedly reminded that\ndespite many advancements this world is still very\nfragile and vulnerable. What is the common feature of\nthe 9/11, Bali, Madrid, Beslan, Baghdad or London\nterrorist attacks; floods in China or in Central Europe\nin 2002 and again in 2005; drought in parts of Africa;\nthe Indian Ocean tsunami; and devastating hurricanes\nin the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico? They all\nexpose in their own way the vulnerability and fragility\nof our civilization.\nDeveloped or developing, big or small, we\ncontinue to be vulnerable to the forces of nature as well\nas the forces of evil. Fortunately, the worst of\nsituations tends to awaken the best in human character:\nafter any such disaster or terrorist attack we have seen\nraising waves of solidarity on a global scale, we have\nseen renewed determination to fight the evil.\nIt is our duty to tap this positive energy. Although\nno one will ever achieve 100 per cent security, much\ncan be done by deepening our cooperation,\nstrengthening preventive measures, stepping up our\nefforts in combating terrorism, enhancing the\nmechanisms of development and humanitarian aid and,\nin the long run, simply fulfilling the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals. If reformed and mandated, the\nUnited Nations can play a central role in this process.\nLast year, many of us spoke of reform, and\nreform has indeed been one of the most frequently used\nwords since then. There was much expectation in the\nair, much sincere effort to bring about change, as well\nas many brilliant contributions to the debate: the report\nof the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges, and\nChange, the final report of the United Nations\nMillennium Project \u201cInvesting in Development\u201d (the\nSachs report) and the Secretary-General\u2019s report \u201cIn\nLarger Freedom\u201d.\nAfter several rounds of discussion, we could say\nwe knew the diagnosis and could prescribe the\nnecessary medication, hoping that the summit would\nadd the most needed ingredients: the political will and\nthe means of delivery.\nSo, was the summit a success or a failure? I tend\nto view its results, the outcome document, with sober\noptimism. The challenge was enormous: to bring\ntogether development, security and human rights and to\ncraft a new delicate balance among the elements that\nconstitute our global agenda. In my view, the summit\nmanaged \u2014 and this could be its major achievement \u2014\nto set the tone, to set at least rough parameters of a new\nequation, the fine-tuning of the details being left for\nthe coming months. We have guidance for further talks\non assistance and relief for developing countries. We\nhave a prospect of increasing development aid,\nincluding from the Czech Republic.\nAt the summit, we agreed that the human rights\nmachinery needed strengthening and redesigning.\nIndeed, it was probably the first time at such a major\nevent that human rights was placed on an equal footing\nwith issues such as development and security. But\nmany pieces of the puzzle have yet to be put in place.\nIn shaping the future Human Rights Council, we\nhave to make sure that the progressive features and\nexperience of the Human Rights Commission are not\nlost, while avoiding its weaknesses and what\nspecifically did not work, securing cooperation from\n22\n\ncountries such as Belarus, Cuba, Myanmar, Zimbabwe\nand others which repeatedly failed to respond\nadequately to the international community\u2019s concerns\nabout human rights.\nMoreover, the summit reinforced our\ncommitment to join forces in fighting terrorism, made\nthe groundbreaking decision to create the\nPeacebuilding Commission and endorsed the twin\nconcepts of responsibility to protect and human\nsecurity \u2014 all of which bring new hope to those facing\nlawlessness and oppression and which extend existing\nstandards of peace and security.\nBut there are also areas where the summit failed:\namong others, disarmament and non-proliferation and,\nmost notably, the expansion of the Security Council.\nOur reform mission remains unfinished, but must\ncontinue.\nIf it is to face up to new challenges and tasks, the\nSecretariat must be strong and healthy. It has to\nundergo profound reform. The need for such a reform\nis further underlined by the recent findings of the\nVolcker report. I welcome the emphasis that the\nsummit put on United Nations management and its call\nfor efficiency, effectiveness and accountability.\nAll in all, the summit took many steps in the right\ndirection, shaping our vision and sharpening our tools.\nBut there is another, hidden part of the story. Do all of\nus really want the United Nations to grow stronger and\nmore efficient? Will a better, reformed \u2014 and truly\nuniversal \u2014 United Nations be able to spare the world\nall of its troubles? Will it be able to find solutions to\nevery conflict and bring lasting peace to every\nnotorious hot spot, including the Balkans, the Middle\nEast, Iraq, Afghanistan and a number of places in\nAfrica? Will it be able to prevent millions of people\nfrom dying from hunger and diseases such as\nHIV/AIDS? Will it be strong enough to guarantee and\npromote democracy and human rights?\nThere is hope, and there is a chance \u2014 but the\nanswer depends on us. I can assure the Assembly that\nthe Czech Republic is ready to carry out its part of the\nassignment, including in the Security Council if elected\nfor the period 2008-2009."

        "file_text": "The\nsixtieth anniversary of the United Nations is cause for\ninspiration, concern and action. It is a source of\ninspiration because 60 years of collective action for\npeace and development is an anniversary to celebrate.\nAnd what better time to do so than on the International\nDay of Peace? It is a cause for concern because the\nchallenges, far from diminishing, have continued to\ngrow, and we have not reached a consensus on a whole\nrange of essential reforms. Some important\ncomponents are missing. It is a call for action because\nall of us here have recognized that the United Nations\nremains an indispensable instrument and because\nchange is still needed. We have no choice: we must\nmove forward.\nBut we have come a long way. Two years ago, the\nUnited Nations was in a sorry state indeed; the\nsituation in Iraq not only had divided the membership\nbut had left deep scars within our institution. That is\nwhy I pay tribute to the Secretary-General for having\nestablished the High-level Panel on Threats,\nChallenges and Change, whose report (A/59/565) has\ntruly revolutionized how all of us think about the\nOrganization\u2019s future.\nJeffrey Sachs and his colleagues also delivered to\nus a remarkable document on \u201cInvesting in\nDevelopment\u201d \u2014 development that Canada has done\nso much to promote ever since the era of Lester\nPearson. In \u201cIn larger freedom\u201d (A/59/2005), the\nSecretary-General summarized that work with clarity\nand discernment and set out an ambitious plan for us.\nWe have not adopted all of his recommendations \u2014 far\nfrom it. We could have, and should have, done better.\nThe summit is by no means the end of the debate. To\nthe contrary, we have a mandate to continue our efforts\nand to make this sixtieth-anniversary year a year of\nreform.\nWe are all aware of the risks of unilateralism or\npiecemeal multilateralism. But we are not sufficiently\naware that humanity\u2019s future lies in accepting the\ninextricable links among security, development and\nhuman rights.\nTo predict the future is to understand the past, so\nit behoves us all to look back over the 60 years of our\nOrganization. The contribution of the United Nations\nto the progress of humanity is indisputable. The\nOrganization\u2019s successes, more than its failures, show\nus the path to take so that we can meet current and\nfuture challenges.\nLet us not forget that in 1945 the whole world\nwas rising from ruins and States were determined that\nthat would never happen again. So it is not surprising\nthat the first objective expressed in the Charter of the\nUnited Nations centred on security so as to \u201csave\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war, which\ntwice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to\nmankind\u201d.\nWe have known the horrors of war over the past\n60 years, but we have avoided descending into the hell\nof a third world war. How did we do that? At the\nUnited Nations, the super-Powers had no choice. Under\nthe aegis of the Organization, they concluded major\ndisarmament and arms control agreements. In sum, the\nrole played by the United Nations in ending the stand\noff between East and West is one of the greatest\nsuccesses of the past century.\n(spoke in English)\nSixty years ago, the nations meeting in San\nFrancisco set the second objective: to reaffirm faith in\nfundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of\nthe human person, in the equal rights of men and\nwomen and of nations large and small. The founders of\nthe United Nations foresaw that if we were to avoid the\nconflicts of the past, the world of tomorrow needed to\nbe more human. With that in mind, Canada\u2019s John\nHumphrey worked hard to help draft the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights.\n14\n\nWe have become ever more demanding about the\nprotection of human rights \u2014 including women\u2019s\nrights \u2014 as well we should be. We are duty-bound to\nprevent or combat flagrant violations, which still\nplague the world. The Commission on Human Rights\nhas played a key role in that respect, but its serious\nshortcomings unfortunately eclipse its valuable\ncontributions, necessitating its replacement.\nMr. Mwakwere (Kenya), Vice-President, took the\nChair.\nHistory shows that democracy and human rights\ngo hand in hand. The United Nations has entrenched\nhuman rights through a series of legal instruments that\nGovernments concluded under the Organization\u2019s aegis\nand has extended a range of protections, such as\nconventions on eliminating discrimination against\nwomen, on children\u2019s rights and against torture.\nThe United Nations remains a key forum for\ndebating human rights failures around the world. And\nit is in that area that the Organization has played a\nleading role in changing global culture, fostering the\nacceptance of new standards and setting criteria for\njudging Governments\u2019 actions. That is another\nremarkable success for the United Nations.\nThe third objective of the Charter called on\nMembers to establish conditions under which justice\nand respect for the obligations arising from treaties and\nother sources of international law can be maintained.\nFor 60 years, the United Nations has been at the heart\nof a vast network of bilateral and regional treaties\ncovering nearly the gamut of international relations. In\nso doing, the Organization has helped to bring about an\ninfinitely more integrated world where interactions\namong peoples take place in a predictable fashion and\nwithin a defined regulatory framework. This global\nlegal framework is the foundation of peace. Where the\nframework has not yet taken shape, conflicts multiply.\nThe world needs the United Nations to perfect this\ntremendous asset.\nThe fourth objective of the Charter touched at the\nheart of our debate today on the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals, calling on members to promote\nsocial progress and better standards of life in larger\nfreedom. That message was prophetic at the time. The\nfounders of the United Nations already foresaw that\nbeyond the massive destruction of 1939 to 1945, a\nfundamental poverty afflicted almost every country and\nregion in the world \u2014 a poverty that had to be fought\nunwaveringly.\nToday, we salute their hope and their desire to\ncreate a better, safer and more prosperous world.\nAmong the surest ways in which to create that type of\nworld are the growing participation of women in\neconomic, civil and political life and the emergence of\na middle class, both of which justify hope for real\nprogress on the road to growth. Those promising trends\nneed to be accelerated.\nThe United Nations has played a fundamental\nrole on that front. Its specialized agencies and affiliates\nhave helped set development objectives and have\ndelivered the bulk of international aid. Thanks to those\nefforts, the world is a better place to live in today. And\ntoday, five years after the Millennium Development\nGoals were adopted, the United Nations is where the\nworld\u2019s nations recall their common commitment to\ndevelopment, with a keener understanding, since the\nMonterrey summit, of the obligations that we all must\nbear.\nWith respect to the four major objectives of the\nCharter, comparing ideals against reality inevitably\nbrings disappointment. For each major step forward,\nthere have been many failures, in particular the absence\nof a collective will to adapt our institution to current\nneeds.\nWhere are we now, and what do we need to do to\nbetter respond to our hopes? The starting point is\nclearly the document (resolution 60/1) approved by\nheads of State or Government last week. That\ndocument is a foundation on which, with a great deal\nof political will on the part of all Members, we can\nthink of renewing the United Nations. In any case, we\nhave a working framework for the years to come.\nI am especially pleased that the document\nincludes strong references to development and to the\nvalues and principles that inspire us. The declaration\nalso provides clear, important directions on United\nNations management, transparency and accountability.\nBut we need to go much further in that direction.\nI would now like to address some of the points\nraised in the declaration. First is the \u201cresponsibility to\nprotect\u201d. In recognizing that responsibility, this body\nhas taken a step that goes beyond utterances of \u201cNever\nagain\u201d \u2014 a step that brings us closer to making\n15\n\ngenocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity\nthings of the past. We now need to implement it.\nSecondly, with respect to the Human Rights\nCouncil, Canada is disappointed that members did not\nshow greater courage. We have not established the\nCouncil; we have only the mandate to work on that\nissue this year. We need such a Council because it will\nhelp us take an in-depth look at situations of concern to\nus, such as that in Iran. Canada\u2019s position is clear: the\nCouncil must be a permanent body, with members\nelected by a two-thirds majority, on the basis of\nspecific criteria, and it must provide for a system of\npeer review, starting with the countries that will sit on\nthe Council. I am pleased, however, that the High\nCommissioner for Human Rights will have a bigger\nbudget.\n(spoke in French)\nThirdly, let me turn to the Peacebuilding\nCommission. Here again, our work is unfinished. A\nreference to a sequential relationship between the\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Council\ncould have been a solution to the question of relations\nbetween the Commission and existing bodies.\nThe fourth point is global health. The United\nNations must make every effort to protect threatened\npopulations. HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria still\nplague the world, to our collective shame. We have a\nshared responsibility to eliminate those diseases; we\ncan and must do better. We need to prepare for\npandemics, including avian flu, on which Canada\nrecently hosted an international meeting of health\nministers.\nFifthly, with respect to terrorism, the attacks that\ntook place this past summer in London, in Egypt and\nelsewhere make it more necessary than ever that there\nbe a global convention in the war on terror.\nBut we must also bear in mind that the overall\nglobal security architecture must be strengthened, from\nlight weapons to weapons of mass destruction,\nincluding the whole range of disarmament and arms\ncontrol measures. We can certainly be heartened by the\nprogress that is being made in the Middle East, Haiti,\nthe Sudan and Afghanistan, high-priority regions for\nCanada and where United Nations action is often\nexemplary. But that success remains fragile, and the\ncommitment of the United Nations must continue.\nSixthly, concerning the environment, if we want\nto leave future generations a planet that is a healthy\nplace to live, we need jointly to manage its\nenvironment. In less than two months, Montreal will\nplay host to a climate-change conference that should\nrepresent a milestone in terms of our common thinking\nand action in the face of that phenomenon. We will be\ndiscussing the progress made in implementing the\nKyoto Protocol and new possibilities for action in the\ndecades to come.\nLet me conclude with a few thoughts on what the\nfinal document does not say, or at least does not say\nwell.\nFirst, on disarmament, it is deplorable that a\nUnited Nations outcome document could contain not\none paragraph on disarmament and non-proliferation at\na time when we are debating Iran\u2019s and North Korea\u2019s\nnuclear programmes.\nSecondly, on women\u2019s rights, it is deeply\nregrettable that the document could not even reiterate\nas forcefully the commitments made 10 years ago in\nBeijing or Cairo on women\u2019s rights and gender\nequality, despite the fact that they lie at the very heart\nof the Millennium Development Goals. All Member\nStates need to implement their provisions and move\nfrom promises to action.\nThirdly, on the International Criminal Court,\nCanada regrets the absence of any reference in the\ndocument to the International Criminal Court, as well\nas its silence on commitments to end impunity. It is\nimperative that the United Nations address the issue of\nimpunity. Two years ago, when the Rome Statute came\ninto force, the Secretary- General clearly stated that\n\u201cthe time is at last coming when humanity no longer\nhas to bear impotent witness to the worst atrocities,\nbecause those tempted to commit such crimes will\nknow that justice awaits them\u201d.\nWe urge all States to sign and ratify the Rome\nStatute. Together, we will break the cycle of impunity,\nand justice will be done for the victims of such crimes.\nWe are meeting in New York today to help solve\nhumanity\u2019s problems. But while this Hall has witnessed\ntoo many unresolved debates and far too much costly\ninaction, the challenges and problems we discuss lie far\nafield. Over the years we have confronted grave\nchallenges in the Sudan, Haiti, Kosovo and Rwanda,\nand in many other places. In some cases, we can hold\n16\n\nour heads high; in others, we need to recognize, and\nlearn from, our mistakes and failures. I think we have\ncharted the course, but we still have far to travel."

I am honoured to speak on behalf of\nPresident Kessai H. Note, who had to leave New York\nahead of schedule due to an urgent matter at home.\nSixty years have passed since a visionary course\nof action was charted recognizing that freedom, justice\nand peace in the world are based on the inherent\ndignity, equality and inalienable rights of all. The\nworld has felt the direct impact of the United Nations,\nand we have good reason to be grateful. Critics\nnotwithstanding, our Organization has served the\nglobal community and has touched every aspect of our\nlives.\nThe Marshall Islands is grateful for the United\nNations, for without it, how could a small remote\nisland nation express its concerns, be heard, and be on\ncommon ground with the rich and powerful?\nFive years after we made a unanimous\ncommitment to peace, liberty and sustainable\ndevelopment, we have gathered here again to take\nconcrete measures. We approved last Friday an\ninstrument that the Secretariat and the General\nAssembly can build upon in streamlining the United\nNations and in meeting the many new challenges of the\ntwenty-first century.\nAll aspects of life in the Marshall Islands have\nbeen profoundly affected by its extraordinary history,\nwhich encompasses a Pacific war and the legacy of\nnuclear testing. Its remoteness, size and vulnerability\ncontinue to limit opportunities for the economic growth\nof the Marshall Islands. In finding ways to work\ntogether for the betterment of the population,\ntraditional leaders and representatives of our national\nand local governments, non-governmental\norganizations, and private and public sectors convened\nlast month in a special retreat - an opportunity for\neveryone involved to build trust and to think and work\ntogether in crafting a shared vision that can and will\nensure the prosperity of the people. We continue to\nmove beyond words to action.\nWe continue also to engage actively in regional\nactivities in the Pacific, including through our regional\norganizations, such as the Pacific Islands Forum. A\ngreat deal of work has been done in the development of\nthe Pacific Plan, a strategy for broader regional\ncooperation based on the key goals of economic\ngrowth, sustainable development, good governance and\nsecurity. The Plan will be presented to Forum leaders\nwhen they meet next month. It will also be discussed at\nour small island States meeting, which the Marshall\nIslands chairs.\nIn the international arena, we continue to reaffirm\nour solidarity with the Alliance of Small Island States.\nWe are grateful for the support of the General\nAssembly in its endorsement of the Declaration and\nStrategy for the Further Implementation of the\nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development\nof Small Island Developing States, adopted at the\nMauritius International Meeting last January. The\nStrategy requires quick and practical action to address\nthe unique challenges facing the sustainable\ndevelopment of small island developing States.\nThe Marshall Islands\u00ed small resource base,\nlimited market access, fragile environment,\nvulnerability to climate change and variability, as well\n25\n\nas the high costs of energy, along with issues related to\ninfrastructure, transportation and communications, are\namong the many constraints we face within the existing\ninternational economic environment. Our vulnerability\nto environmental and economic events continues to\nimpede our opportunities for development.\nOur development efforts will be in vain if the\nresults are reversed by continued degradation of the\nenvironment and depletion of natural resources.\nWe are pleased that the Kyoto Protocol has now\nentered into force. However, some major emitters\nremain outside of it. A more inclusive international\nframework needs to be developed for stabilizing\ngreenhouse-gas emissions beyond 2012, with broader\nparticipation by all major emitters - developed and\ndeveloping countries.\nClimate change is a serious and long-term\nchallenge that has the potential to affect every part of\nthe world. It is time to undertake concrete actions and\nmeasures at all levels. In that context, we welcome the\nprogress made in terms of the establishment and\ndevelopment of an all-hazard early warning system.\nUnited Nations international efforts were very\nswift and effective in the wake of the devastating\ntsunami in the Indian Ocean and, more recently,\nfollowing Hurricane Katrina in the southern United\nStates. We hope that the international community will\nnot act so humanely only in the aftermath of natural\ndisasters but also in the context of the far less dramatic,\nbut no less crucial global actions needed to mitigate\nclimate change and arrest sea-level rise before it is too\nlate to act and the people of the Marshall Islands and\nothers become environmental refugees.\nOn health issues, the Marshall Islands continues\nto face the challenges associated in dealing with major\ndiseases such as diabetes, influenza, bird flu, SARS\nand the risk of the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS and other\nsexually transmitted diseases. Despite the difficulties\nwe face in addressing these challenges, we are proud\nof, and grateful for, the involvement of the traditional\nleadership, which has contributed to the substantial\nprogress made at the local and national levels.\nWe are in the final stages of completing the\nHIV/AIDS National Strategic Plan. Our ambition to\ncarry out this task is strong, but we cannot do it alone.\nThe support of the international community is\nextremely important to help build our capacity; to\nstrengthen our human resources; to help us implement\neffective public education programmes that will\nencourage behavioural change among the high-risk\ngroups in our population; and to provide technical\nassistance to facilitate prompt access to the Global\nFund and other financial sources to combat HIV/AIDS,\ntuberculosis, diabetes and malaria.\nWe have integrated family planning and maternal\nand child health programmes into reproductive health\nservices, and we fully support the initiatives on\naccessibility to reproductive health services under the\nMillennium Development Goals.\nOn sustainable development, the Marshall Islands\nhas established a task force to ensure that the\nMillennium Development Goals are fully integrated\ninto our national strategy. One challenge we continue\nto face is the need for human and technical resources,\nbut, despite that and other challenges, we are\ndetermined to work towards achieving the Goals.\nDuring this, the first policy year of its first\nimplementation cycle, we recognize the important\nprecedent set by the thirteenth session of the\nCommission on Sustainable Development as to how\nfuture cycles could be conducted and what type of\noutcomes could be expected. The Marshall Islands is\nworking hard to improve access to freshwater, develop\nenvironmentally responsible waste management\nsystems and provide affordable and renewable energy\nsources. Our programme would be impossible without\nthe continued support of the international community\nand development partners, for which we are always\ngrateful.\nOne issue that continues to haunt the people of\nthe Marshall Islands is the effects of nuclear weapons\ntesting. When people in most parts of the world talk\nabout nuclear devastation, they tend to think of\nHiroshima and Nagasaki. However, few are aware that\nthe Marshall Islands experienced the equivalent of 1.6\nHiroshima-sized bombs every day during the 12 years\nthat numerous nuclear weapons were detonated and\ntested in our country. Interestingly, this took place\nwhile the Marshall Islands was part of the United\nNations Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.\nWe would like to emphasize the need for full\nresolution of this issue based on the changed\ncircumstances that have come to light and the new\ninformation gathered from recent scientific and\nmedical studies on radiological safety, clean-up and the\n26\n\nmalignant effects of radiation on health. I call on the\ninternational community to support the Marshall\nIslands in this endeavour.\nThe Marshall Islands has experienced the far-\nreaching and invasive effects of a nuclear testing\nprogramme on the most intimate and personal levels:\nfrom home islands no longer inhabitable to the illness\nand death of many of our friends and families. We can\nprepare our health system to deal with this burden, but\nwe can never remedy the human and emotional toll that\nthis has had and continues to have on us as individuals,\nfamilies, communities and as a nation.\nConcerning disarmament and non-proliferation,\nwe believe that sustainable peace and development will\nnot be achieved without major steps towards\ndisarmament. Reiterating our firm commitment to the\nTreaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,\nwe look forward to strengthening its implementation,\nincluding through future review conferences.\nAs a nation whose single most important\nproductive sector and key export are its fisheries, the\nstate of the world\u00eds oceans and fish stocks and how\nthese vital resources are being exploited remain our\nutmost concern. We recognize the importance of the\nConvention on the Conservation and Management of\nHighly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and\nCentral Pacific Ocean. We remain seriously concerned\nabout instances of illegal, unreported and unregulated\nfishing within our exclusive economic zone. The\ncontinued assistance of the international community is\nneeded in building capacity for monitoring and\nsurveillance in this regard.\nThe global threat the world faces today is a\nchallenge of a different nature from anything we have\nhad to deal with before. We recognize how poverty,\nenvironmental degradation and the abuse of human\nrights undermine human security. We welcome the\nrecent adoption of the International Convention for the\nSuppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. We continue\nto cooperate closely within the Pacific region to ensure\nthat effective regional action is taken to combat threats\nto our peace and security. We have taken steps to\ncombat money-laundering and the financing of\nterrorism and to implement the twelve core anti-\nterrorism conventions and relevant Security Council\nresolutions. In our global effort to counter terrorism,\nagreeing on the definition of terrorism is one of the\nmany issues that requires serious consideration and\nresolution.\nConcerning the Middle East peace process, we\ncommend the determination and strong resolve of\nPrime Minister Ariel Sharon in his effort to\nreinvigorate the Middle East peace process by fulfilling\nIsrael\u00eds pledge to withdraw from the Gaza Strip.\nConcerning the International Criminal Court, we\nwelcome its progress in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo, Uganda and Darfur situations. We are also\npleased with the entry into force of the agreement\nbetween the International Criminal Court and the\nUnited Nations. We continue to call on all States to\nstrengthen the rule of law around the world by ratifying\nthe Rome Statute governing that Court.\nBearing in mind the phrase \\\"we the peoples\\\" in\nthe Preamble to the Charter, Marshall Islands believes\nthat if the United Nations adheres to the principles of\nuniversality and self-determination, it must not exclude\nthe 23 million people of the free, democratic and\nindependent nation of Taiwan. As a free and\nprosperous country, Taiwan has much to contribute to\nthe peace and security of the Western Pacific, and we\nreiterate our full support for the ongoing quest of the\npeople of Taiwan to be granted membership in this\nfamily of nations. Denying membership to a free and\ndemocratic nation and condoning the presence of\nrepressive States is a flagrant violation of basic\ndemocratic principles.\nIn a world divided by chasms between the rich\nand the poor, between the powerful and the powerless,\ndifferences of interest are certain to shape all our\nreform efforts and perpetuate a contradictory and\ndivided Organization. We share the aspirations of a\nUnited Nations guided by the following values and\nprinciples: belief in multilateral cooperation, the\nimperative of prevention, respect for the rule of law\nand human rights, solidarity with the poor and\nsuffering, concern for the rights of women and the\nchildren of the world and their future, and for the\nhealth of Planet Earth.\nWe reiterate our support for reform and expansion\nof the Security Council, using a criteria-based\napproach based on factors such as economic size,\npopulation, commitment to democracy and human\nrights, financial contribution to the United Nations,\ncontributions to peacekeeping and record on counter-\nterrorism and non-proliferation.\n27\n\nThe Marshall Islands will continue to participate\nin this session\u00eds important debates on how to reform\nand strengthen the United Nations as an institution and\nhow to ensure that it effectively addresses the threats\nand challenges of the twenty-first century. We assure\nyou of our full cooperation towards the goal of a\nstrong, effective and accountable Organization."

        "file_text": "I\nshould like to begin by congratulating Ambassador Jan\nEliasson, on behalf of the delegation of Morocco, on\nhis election to the presidency of the General Assembly\nat this historic session and by wishing him success in\nhis noble task. I should also like to express to his\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping, Foreign\nMinister of the brotherly State of Gabon, our sincere\nthanks and profound appreciation for his efforts as\nPresident of the General Assembly during the fifty-\nninth session and for the patience and dedication that\nhe showed in his excellent conduct of the preparatory\nwork for the High-level Plenary Meeting, thereby\nensuring the success of the summit, which marked the\nsixtieth anniversary of our Organization.\nI should also like to pay tribute to the\nSecretary-General, Kofi Annan, for his commendable\nefforts to improve the structure of the Organization and\nenhance its working methods and effectiveness.\nLast week\u2019s summit meeting was a key event in\nthe history of the United Nations and marked a turning\npoint in the Organization\u2019s activities, not just because\nof the impressive number of very distinguished\nparticipants, but also because of the importance of the\noutcome document (resolution 60/1), which was\nadopted as a result of the contribution of all members.\nIn this regard, the Kingdom of Morocco supports\nthe proposals submitted by the Secretary-General with\na view to ensuring follow-up of the outcomes of the\nvarious international conferences on development\nissues. Although it failed to meet our expectations, the\nsummit outcome document nevertheless reiterated our\ninternational commitments; it paves the way for\nstrengthening the role and effectiveness of the\nOrganization and adapting it to meet the new\nchallenges posed by global developments.\nThe Kingdom of Morocco would like to reaffirm\nits readiness to contribute to the implementation of the\nrecommendations of the summit and to participate in\nthe international effort to achieve the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). My country has\nundertaken a number of proactive national initiatives\nrelating to ensuring respect for human rights and the\nestablishment of an integrated and modern society in\nwhich women play an active role in development.\nMany of these are set out in the National Initiative for\nHuman Development, announced by His Majesty King\nMohammed VI on 18 May. That initiative reflects\nMorocco\u2019s willingness to create a development model\nbased on a successful association of modernity,\ndemocratization and economic openness. That model is\nalso aimed at achieving a sustained improvement in our\nhuman development index, within a spirit of collective\nparticipation, solidarity, equal opportunity, the\ndissemination of knowledge and the provision of basic\nsocial services.\nThe end of the era of ideological division and the\nrise of a new world order has called the attention of the\ninternational community to new challenges posed by\nthe scourges of terrorism, hunger, poverty,\nbackwardness, illiteracy and pandemic disease, as well\nas the increasing number of refugees fleeing from the\ndisasters of war and destruction and the growing\nnumber of ethnic, tribal and religious conflicts and\nseparatist trends.\nSince the events of 11 September 2001, the\ninternational community has grown increasingly aware\nof the threat of terrorism and of the need to combat it\nby all available means and to address its root causes\nand underlying motives.\nThe Kingdom of Morocco, which has itself been\nsubjected to the scourge of terrorism, has participated\n4\n\nin efforts to combat it through the elaboration of legal\ninstruments and practical arrangements at the national,\nregional and international levels. During this session,\nthe Kingdom of Morocco will continue to contribute to\nefforts to adopt a comprehensive convention against\nterrorism, thereby complementing its participation in\nthe elaboration of the International Convention for the\nSuppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.\nAs for development challenges, our African\ncontinent is the only region that will not be able to\nachieve the MDGs within the specified time frame\nunless the international community provides full\nsupport. In this regard, African countries acknowledge\nthat they must rely, first and foremost, on their own\nhuman and material resources. However, Africa\u2019s\neconomic take-off can be achieved only through an\nefficient and realistic partnership involving all the\nparties concerned, including donor countries and\ninternational and regional organizations. That\npartnership must be founded on an integrated and\nsustained process that benefits the existing North-\nSouth and South-South cooperation mechanisms.\nConvinced of the necessity to collectively combat\nthe ills that are besetting our African continent,\nMorocco has always taken the lead in supporting and\nencouraging any initiative aimed at freeing the African\npeoples from their stark predicament. Thus, on more\nthan one occasion, the Kingdom of Morocco has\nvoiced full support for the New Partnership for\nAfrica\u2019s Development as an integrated and\ncomprehensive action plan designed to solve the\npersistent economic and social problems that have\nplagued our continent since the era of independence.\nOn the other hand, Morocco has always shown its\nreadiness to contribute to conflict resolution in Africa\nby bringing together belligerent parties and by\nstrengthening the ties of brotherhood and good\nneighbourliness among the States of western Africa, as\nwell as through the participation of the Royal Armed\nForces of Morocco in peacekeeping operations\nconducted under the auspices of the United Nations in\nAfrica.\nThe Kingdom of Morocco welcomes the decision\nby the Group of Eight to cancel the debt of least\ndeveloped African countries. I would also like to recall\nthat His Majesty King Mohammed VI was among the\nfirst to initiate such a move. During the first European\nUnion-Africa Summit, which was held in Cairo, His\nMajesty announced the cancellation of the debt of least\ndeveloped African countries, opened Morocco\u2019s market\nto their products and granted them customs\nexemptions.\nThe success of Africa\u2019s economic take-off\nremains contingent upon the success of regional\nintegration throughout the continent. The Kingdom of\nMorocco therefore believes that the reactivation of the\nMaghreb Arab Union is a political imperative, an\neconomic necessity and a historical reality that\nresponds to the aspirations of the peoples of the region\nand reflects the expectations of our partners, especially\nthose in the Mediterranean region, with whom we are\nstriving to reinforce our partnership as we prepare to\ncelebrate the tenth anniversary of the Barcelona\nprocess.\nFor those reasons, Morocco is working to\nreactivate the Union\u2019s machinery and to remove any\nobstacles that might hinder its relaunching on a sound,\nconstructive and meaningful basis. In this context,\nMorocco would like to reaffirm its steadfast\ncommitment to working closely with the Secretary-\nGeneral and his Personal Envoy and Special\nRepresentative, as well as with all parties concerned, in\norder to break the current stalemate and reach a\nnegotiated political solution to the artificial conflict\nwith respect to the Moroccan Sahara. Because of its\ngeostrategic nature, that conflict between two brotherly\nneighbouring countries, Morocco and Algeria, requires\nthe involvement of our brethren in Algeria in a serious\nand constructive dialogue with a view to putting an end\nto it once and for all.\nHis Majesty King Mohammed VI, in his most\nrecent Throne Day speech, affirmed Morocco\u2019s\nwillingness \u201cto engage in serious negotiations with a\nview to reaching a final solution that would win United\nNations support and grant the inhabitants of the\nsouthern provinces autonomy within the sovereignty of\nthe Kingdom and its territorial and national integrity\u201d.\nPending the involvement of all parties in that\nnegotiation process, it remains urgent to follow up on\nthe humanitarian aspect of the problem by disclosing\nthe fate of all Moroccan missing persons and prisoners.\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross was\nunable to establish contacts with those persons or to\ndiscover their place of detention. In addition, the\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees should be allowed to undertake a fair and\n5\n\nfree census of Moroccan citizens being held in the\nTindouf camps in Algeria, who should be freed and\nallowed to exercise their right to return to their\nhomeland.\nThe Arab region, which continues to experience\nrecurrent crises as well as new ones equally violent and\nfierce, looks to the Organization and to other\ninternational and regional actors for their assistance in\nsolving them. In that regard, we hope that the ray of\noptimism that shone recently in the Middle East,\nprompting us to engage in cautious optimism, will be\nsupported by serious and brave measures that will\nrevive the peace process and put it back on track. The\nKingdom of Morocco welcomed the withdrawal from\nthe Gaza Strip and considers it an important and\npositive decision on the path towards full\nimplementation of the road map.\nMorocco, which has always striven tirelessly and\neffectively to keep open the channels of\ncommunication and dialogue among the peoples of the\nMiddle East, reaffirms its active commitment to\npromoting a peaceful solution to the Arab-Israeli\nconflict that will lead to the establishment of a final,\nlasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East\nthrough the reactivation of the road map, the\nguaranteed establishment of a free Palestinian State\nwith Al-Quds as its capital, and the withdrawal of\nIsrael from the occupied Syrian and Lebanese\nterritories.\nHis Majesty King Mohammed VI, Chairman of\nthe Al-Quds Committee, has reaffirmed his resolve to\ncontinue to actively pursue and support all peace\nefforts and to work to preserve the Arab and Islamic\nidentity of Al-Quds Al-Sharif and its status as a place\nof coexistence and tolerance among the three revealed\nreligions.\nWith regard to the situation in the brotherly State\nof Iraq, the Kingdom of Morocco, although\nappreciating highly the continuous and intensive\nefforts to re-establish stability, peace and\nreconstruction in Iraq, and although following the\nrecent political progress with great interest, affirms\nthat the participation of all constituents of Iraqi society\nis needed to build the democratic institutions of the\nnew Iraqi State and to preserve its national unity.\nMoreover, the international community must help the\nIraqi people to overcome the ongoing crisis by creating\nthe conditions necessary for peace and stability.\nReforming the United Nations to enable it to meet\nthe challenges of the twenty-first century, restructuring\nits organs and bodies and updating their mandates will\nrequire not only that its working methods be improved,\nbut also that the Organization regain its natural and\nleading role as a framework for constructive dialogue\nand as a forum for creative interaction among the\nvarious intellectual currents and religious and cultural\ntrends.\nIn that context, Morocco commends the\nSecretary-General for his decision to appoint a High-\nlevel Group for the Alliance of Civilizations and to\nestablish a new cultural world order based on tolerance\nand coexistence. We support diversity and unity of\nvisions and goals as contributions to meeting the\nchallenges of the new millennium."

        "file_text": "We can safely claim \nthat the United Nations summit that has just been \nconcluded will have far-reaching implications for our \nOrganization. Its outcome has prepared the ground for \nthe most radical reform in the entire history of the \nUnited Nations. An effective response by the family of \nnations to global challenges and threats is the ultimate \ngoal of these reforms. Kazakhstan expresses its \nconfidence that the United Nations, as a universal \nOrganization to which there is no alternative, is in a \nposition to achieve that goal. \n As a matter of principle, Kazakhstan supports \ncloser interdependence among the three main pillars of \nthe contemporary world: development, freedom and \npeace. Yet the issues of development should continue \nto be the focus of attention of the world community. \nThe Millennium Development Goals can be achieved \nonly through the active engagement of the entire \ninternational community on the basis of partnership \nand cooperation. Kazakhstan is committed to its \nundertakings with regard to the timely and effective \nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals. The \nrecently published report on Kazakhstan\u2019s progress in \nimplementing the Millennium Development Goals \nreport in Kazakhstan reveals that as a result of \nsuccessful reforms my country is close to reaching \nimportant targets in this area.  \n Today Kazakhstan is confidently leading other \npost-Soviet States in all macroeconomic indicators. \nThe Government of Kazakhstan is implementing a \nlarge-scale programme to ensure further development \nin the social field. Human development is the focus of \nall these efforts. Kazakhstan is reaching a new level in \nthe area of sustainable development. The national \nGovernment is paying priority attention to poverty, \nwomen\u2019s issues, employment, financial aid from the \nState to poor families, the development of small and \nmedium-sized businesses, and large-scale educational, \nhealth and environmental programmes.  \n We commend the United Nations and its \nspecialized agencies for their efforts to assist our \ncountry in addressing the effects of environmental \ndisasters in the area of the Aral Sea and in the \nSemipalatinsk region. The problems facing those \nregions are global in their scope as the environmental \nsituation there has negative effects on the habitat and \nlivelihood of people all over the world. We urge the \ninternational community to be involved actively. In \nparticular we ask it at this session of the General \nAssembly to support a draft resolution to be sponsored \nby Kazakhstan on the problems of the Semipalatinsk \nregion.  \n International trade is an important factor for \ndevelopment. Accession to the World Trade \nOrganization (WTO) is a priority for Kazakhstan. We \nconsider further liberalization of trade and WTO \nmembership as key elements of our country\u2019s general \ndevelopment strategy. In 2003 Kazakhstan hosted the \nInternational Ministerial Conference on Transit \nTransport Cooperation. We attach great importance to \n  \n \n16 05-51226 \n \nthat forum and believe that the special needs of \nlandlocked developing countries should be fully taken \ninto account in accordance with the decisions and \nrecommendations emanating from the Almaty \nProgramme of Action. The integration of Kazakhstan \nand other Central Asian States into the world economy \nis of exceptional importance both for the social and \neconomic development of our region and for the world \neconomy in general. Our country is committed to \ncomprehensive cooperation with the other States of \nCentral Asia. That is our consistent policy, unswayed \nby political exigencies. \n Since the early years of its independence, \nKazakhstan has been pursuing a principled policy of \ndemilitarization and nuclear disarmament. We call for \nthe universalization of international instruments in that \narea. This year we marked the tenth anniversary of the \nremoval from the territory of Kazakhstan of all nuclear \ndevices left over from the former Soviet Union. \nKazakhstan has set a commendable example by \nvoluntarily eliminating its nuclear arsenal, the fourth \nlargest in the world, and shutting down the \nSemipalatinsk nuclear testing ground, the site of nearly \n500 nuclear explosions.  \n The global security system is in serious crisis \ntoday. The 2005 Review Conference of the Parties to \nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons (NPT) failed to set up a balanced and \ncomprehensive mechanism that would facilitate the \nstrengthening of the international non-proliferation \nregime and the complete elimination of nuclear \nweapons.  \n Even more disturbing is the lack of clear \nrecommendations on non-proliferation and disarmament \nin the outcome document of the summit (resolution 60/1). \nWe believe that it is necessary to put in place a \nmechanism for international sanctions against States that \nviolate both the NPT Treaty and the non-proliferation \nregime in general. Otherwise we will not be able to \nprevent the continuous spread of nuclear weapons around \nthe world. Our country calls for the establishment and \nenhancement of controls over nuclear, chemical and \nbiological materials and their production technologies in \norder to prevent terrorists from getting hold of deadly \nweapons. \n Kazakhstan recognizes the special role of the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). All of \nour country\u2019s nuclear activities are being carried out in \naccordance with its standards and under its control. It \nis time to establish similar effective bodies within the \nframework of the international Conventions on \nchemical and biological weapons.  \n The international community should not relax \nefforts to combat illegal trafficking in conventional \narms. According to the United Nations, some 500 \nmillion small arms and light weapons are in circulation \nall over the world. We share the view of the Secretary-\nGeneral, who has compared small arms to weapons of \nmass destruction, because, year after year, they kill \nhundreds of thousands of people all over the world, \nthus fostering a culture of violence and terror and \ntrampling on human rights. \n Kazakhstan categorically condemns terrorism in \nall its forms and manifestations and considers it to be \nthe most dangerous threat in today\u2019s world. We are \nconvinced that economic and social underdevelopment, \npoverty and misery breed international terrorism. That \nis why speedy economic advancement of poor \ncountries is a priority task.  \n Yet the ideology of terrorism is a factor of no \nlesser importance. It is extremely dangerous that young \npeople are increasingly being sucked into the \nideological orbit of international terrorism. Fighting \nterrorism is a mission of paramount importance. For \nthat reason, close attention should be paid to the efforts \nto prevent recruitment for terrorist operations.  \n In that context, the international community must \nurgently take practical steps to curb the ongoing drug \ntrafficking across Central Asia. We cannot but be \nseriously concerned by the situation in Afghanistan. \nKazakhstan appreciates cooperation with the United \nNations Office on Drugs and Crime.  \n Enhanced regional cooperation in the struggle \nagainst international terrorism is also important. The \nShanghai Cooperation Organization sets a positive \nexample in that regard.  \n Kazakhstan believes that international \ncooperation in fighting terrorism should be pursued in \nstrict compliance with the norms of international law. \nWe support further universalization and enhancement \nof anti-terrorist treaty mechanisms. The signing by \nKazakhstan of the International Convention for the \nSuppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism is a practical \nreaffirmation of that position. We are looking forward \nto the early completion of a comprehensive convention \n \n \n05-51226 17 \n \nagainst international terrorism. At the same time, joint \npractical actions to curb that evil represent a key \nelement of the international community\u2019s counter-\nterrorism activities. \n International peacekeeping operations conducted \nunder the umbrella of the United Nations remain an \neffective tool to prevent and settle crises and to ensure \nglobal and regional stability. The lack of an effective \nand comprehensive mechanism to address the root \ncauses of destructive conflicts is a serious problem of \npeacekeeping. Preventive action and post-conflict \npeacebuilding constitute important elements of a \ncomprehensive response by the United Nations to \nemerging crisis situations.  \n For Kazakhstan, the proposed Peacebuilding \nCommission is a step in the right direction. As its main \nmission it should strive to avert the recurrence of \nsituations in which the lack of a peacebuilding strategy \nresults in the escalation of internal conflicts and \nultimately in States further losing their capacity to \nperform their sovereign functions in an effective and \nresponsible way.  \n Our country is actively working on issues related \nto the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-\nbuilding Measures in Asia (CICA), which we treat as \nan important and useful forum for the exchange of \nviews on security issues in the Asian region. It is \nencouraging to see that the CICA process is gaining \nmomentum and has already become an important factor \nin today\u2019s international relations. \n Kazakhstan believes that the rule of law should \nplay a leading role in international affairs today. \nIgnoring this principle is one of the main threats to \npeace and security. Continuing its consistent efforts to \naccede to international treaties concluded within the \nframework of the United Nations and to implement \ntheir provisions, Kazakhstan intends to ensure strict \ncompliance with the rule of law at both national and \ninternational levels.  \n We closely link our country\u2019s development to \nbuilding a democratic society based on respect for the \nrights and freedoms of every individual. Kazakhstan \nsupports the strengthening of democratic institutions \nand the human rights mechanisms of the United \nNations designed to promote the rights and freedoms of \ncitizens and to ensure compliance with the principles \nof non-interference and the sovereign equality of \nStates.  \n Kazakhstan supports efforts to carry out a \ncomprehensive reform of the United Nations \nencompassing all its principal organs. We strongly \nbelieve that priority attention should be paid to the \nGeneral Assembly as the main deliberative, decision-\nmaking and representative body of the Organization. \nThe sensitive issue of reform of the Security Council \nshould be resolved on the basis of broad international \nagreement. We are convinced that the enlargement of \nthe Security Council in accordance with the principle \nof equitable geographical representation and taking \ninto account the contribution of States concerned \ntowards the development of the world economy and \nglobal security would serve the interests of many \nStates and would facilitate comprehensive reform of \nthe United Nations. \n The United Nations needs to improve \ncollaboration with regional organizations that make an \nimportant contribution to the collective security \nsystem. Kazakhstan has repeatedly proposed the \ncreation of a standing body under the Secretary-\nGeneral that would coordinate cooperation between \nregional arrangements. In this context we would \nwelcome the establishment of a standing committee on \nregional organizations.  \n We in Kazakhstan are convinced that in the \ntwenty-first century the consolidation of peace and \nsecurity is increasingly dependent on the development \nof dialogue and interaction between peoples of \ndiffering faces, cultures and civilizations. An interfaith \ndialogue is an integral part of the effort to promote the \nculture of peace and dialogue between civilizations and \nto advance the common values reflected in the \nMillennium Declaration. In this context, Kazakhstan is \ngrateful to the international community for its support \nof our country\u2019s actions to promote an interfaith \ndialogue. The General Assembly has recognized \nKazakhstan\u2019s positive role in this area through the \nadoption of a resolution. \n As demonstrated over the past 60 years, the \nUnited Nations was, still is, and I am sure will continue \nto be a link between our countries and peoples. The \nUnited Nations will not allow our planet to slide into \nchaos and unrest. It is within our power to strengthen \nthis link. Kazakhstan expresses confidence that the \nagreements reflected in the outcome document of the \nhistoric summit will serve the cause of bringing nations \ntogether in the face of existing challenges and threats, \nensuring the security, welfare and dignity of our \n  \n \n18 05-51226 \n \npeoples, and strengthening the Organization itself for \nthe sake of its noble goals.

The\nOrganization\u2019s noble values and principles have indeed\nensured that even small and isolated nations such as\nTuvalu can enjoy the goals of self-determination and\nstatehood with dignity and hope. We are proud to be a\nmember of this great family of Nations.\nWe also wish to join others in congratulating you,\nSir, on your election to the presidency, and to assure\nyou of our full support and cooperation.\nLast week the world \u2014 our families and our\nchildren \u2014 heard from us that the time for stating\nprinciples and defining problems and actions on the\ncomplex challenges of development, security and\nhuman rights has long passed. It is now time to take\naction. But how the rhetoric gets translated into actions\nto improve standards of living for each nation, and for\nour families, for women and children in our\ncommunities and villages, in an equitable and fair\nmanner, is now the main challenge. The United Nations\nmust play the central role in managing that process.\nTuvalu is greatly encouraged by the prevailing\ngoodwill to fulfil the many international development\ntargets. The commitments made, by the European\nUnion and others, to meet the United Nations target of\n0.7 per cent of gross national product for official\ndevelopment assistance is very welcome. We also\nwelcome new and innovative initiatives on financing\nand good governance, including the global Democracy\nFund, the French initiative and others. The\ncommitment of the United States of America to its\nMillennium Challenge Account initiative is also very\nwelcome.\nAs a small island developing State and a least\ndeveloped country which has consistently taken a\nprudent and responsible approach to its own national\ndevelopment, Tuvalu is very encouraged, in particular,\nby the renewed recognition by the international\ncommunity of the special vulnerabilities of small island\ndeveloping States, of the needs of least developed\ncountries and of the imperative to address them.\nIncreased international cooperation to ensure the\nfull and effective implementation of the Mauritius\nStrategy for small island developing States and the\nBrussels Programme of Action, particularly with\nregard to the provision of adequate financing, capacity-\nbuilding and technology development and transfer, is\ncritical to supporting the poverty reduction and\nsustainable development efforts of the least developed\ncountries and small island developing States like\nTuvalu. There is now a clear need to establish clear\nvessels of connectivity from international\ncommitments to national strategies, plans and actions\non the ground.\nIn this regard, I am pleased to announce the\nlaunch, last Friday here in New York, of Te Kakeega II \u2014\nTuvalu\u2019s national sustainable development strategies\nfor 2005-2015 \u2014 a commitment to action by the\n10\n\nGovernment and all stakeholders, including non-\ngovernmental organizations and island communities.\nWe sincerely appreciate the support of our friends\nin New York, bilateral partners and United Nations\nagencies, and we look forward to working closely with\nthe international community in advancing appropriate\npartnerships as a result of those strategies. In the same\nvein, the important role played by regional bodies,\nespecially those in the Pacific region, such as the\nCouncil of Regional Organizations for the Pacific, in\nsupporting national efforts ought to be given\nrecognition and support. We therefore strongly support\nthe remarks by Samoa and Papua New Guinea on the\nimportance of regional arrangements, such as the\nPacific Plan.\nSecurity challenges continue to create worldwide\nhavoc, fear and uncertainty. Terrorist acts the world\nover, including the recent bombings in London and\nelsewhere have proven the continued existence of\nforces bent on undermining the United Nations\nfounding goals of freedom, peace and security. They\nhave also underscored the urgency with which we, the\nUnited Nations, must collectively combat these forces.\nTuvalu is fully committed to joining the fight\nagainst international terrorism, as required by Security\nCouncil resolutions. But we would need to seek the\nassistance of the United Nations and the international\ncommunity to help us fulfil the requirements,\nparticularly on reporting, of these resolutions and of\nthe international anti-terrorism conventions.\nThe threat of the impact of climate change, sea\nlevel rise and variability on the entire global\nenvironment continues to be a matter of serious\nsecurity concern to all. For small island and low-lying\ncoastal countries like Tuvalu the situation is\ndevastating, threatening lives, human rights and our\nlong-term survival. The impacts are real and already\nhappening. They demand urgent actions by the\ninternational community. As correctly underscored by\nthe Secretary-General in his report, \u201cIn larger\nfreedom\u201d, \u201cWithout action, [small island developing\nStates] will pay a bitter price for the actions of others\u201d\n(A/59/2005, para. 60). There cannot be a more true\nassertion.\nWhile we are all deeply touched by the human\nloss and destruction suffered from Hurricane Katrina\non the Gulf Coast of the United States of America three\nweeks ago, the world will be better advised to take\nsuch timely warnings seriously. Tuvalu strongly\nbelieves we must urgently address adaptation and\nmitigation actions against climate change in line with\nthe objectives of the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol\ntargets to reduce greenhouse gases and advance the\ndevelopment and use of renewable sources of energy.\nOn the latter subject, it would be remiss of\nTuvalu not to again sincerely acknowledge the coming\ninto force of the Kyoto Protocol early this year and to\nurge all industrialized countries who have not done so\nto ratify it as soon as possible. Not to do so will be to\nsign on Tuvalu\u2019s death warrant.\nThe time is also ripe to initiate dialogue on a\nmore comprehensive approach for future actions\nagainst climate change where all major emitters of\ngreenhouse gases will need to participate. The eleventh\nsession of the Conference of Parties to the United\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to\nbe held at Montreal in November, must advance\ndecisions on critical issues on future actions against\nclimate change.\nUnless actions are taken seriously, all efforts for\ndevelopment, security and human rights for those most\nvulnerable to the impacts of climate change will be\nseverely compromised. We appeal to those with the\ncapacity to do so to have a heart for islands like\nTuvalu, as well as for the rest of mankind.\nOn enhancing the relevancy and the role of the\nUnited Nations, we would like to reiterate our strong\nsupport for the reforms for the United Nations, in\nparticular the expansion of the permanent membership\nand working methods of the Security Council. In this\nvein we also reiterate our support for the consideration\nof Japan, Germany, India and Brazil for permanent\nseats on an expanded Council. We strongly feel that the\nmomentum so far achieved on the issue must be taken\nadvantage of to finally resolve the proposed reforms by\nthe end of December 2005, at the latest. We also\nbelieve more equitable representation of the\ndeveloping countries for the non-permanent seats of\nthe Council is vital and long overdue.\nTuvalu recognizes the seriousness of the\nHIV/AIDS epidemic on the social and economic\ndevelopment and security of Tuvalu and other Pacific\nisland countries. Given our exposure and the level of\nmobility of our communities, particularly our seafarers\nwho serve on merchant ships worldwide, there is an\n11\n\nurgent need for assistance from the international\ncommunity, such as that provided under the Global\nFund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, to\nhelp us raise awareness in Tuvalu to combat the threats\nof the epidemic. We need technical and financial\nassistance for these efforts.\nIn terms of natural resources, Tuvalu is really a\nbig ocean, small island country. The Pacific Ocean that\nsurrounds our islands provides the vital source of our\nlivelihoods and economic and social development.\nIncreasingly, however, we are becoming concerned\nwith the real threats of illegal, unreported and\nunregulated fishing and of pollution to the oceans from\nwaste, particularly from the trans-shipment of highly\nradioactive and toxic materials in our region. We\nwould need to seek the understanding of the\ninternational community to help us save our oceans and\nsupport fully the Pacific Islands Regional Ocean Policy\nadopted in 2002.\nAn important source of financial flows to\ndeveloping countries, particularly also to small island\ndeveloping nations such as Tuvalu, is migrant workers\u2019\nremittances from developed countries. Indeed remittances\nfrom our overseas workers, and particularly Tuvaluan\nseafarers serving abroad, provide a substantive source\nof income so vital for social and economic\ndevelopment in Tuvalu.\nTuvalu fully supports the affording of urgent\nattention to the issue of migrant workers\u2019 rights,\nincluding the maintenance of competency on\ninternational standards and migrant workers\u2019 safety and\nsecurity, in the international agenda, in order to ensure\nsustaining this vital source of capital for small island\ndeveloping States.\nAn issue of continuing concerns to Tuvalu is the\nquestion of the representation in the United Nations.\nRegrettably, this august body cannot be said to be\nuniversal without the rightful representation of the 23\nmillion people of the Republic of China on Taiwan.\nTuvalu feels that recognizing the political and\ndemocratic developments in Taiwan, the active and\nresponsible participation of Taiwan in world affairs,\nespecially in trade, commerce, health, and international\ndevelopment, without representation in the United\nNations is unjust and morally wrong. This state of\naffairs needs to be corrected. We seek a proper review\nby the United Nations of this important issue, as well\nas the escalation of tension in the Taiwan Strait\nfollowing the enactment by the People\u2019s Republic of\nChina of its \u201canti-secession law\u201d.\nIn conclusion, we want to reiterate that efforts\naimed at the sustainable development of small island\ndeveloping States like Tuvalu, will be of no meaning\nunless the issue of climate change and sea level is\naddressed decisively, and with urgency. Tuvalu\u2019s\ninterest is not self serving. The more serious\nconsequences of not acting now on climate change, as\nwe are already witnessing the world over, will be felt\neverywhere.\nIt is our fervent hope that out of this common\nhouse of our United Nations family, there will emerge\nbetter understanding and goodwill for the long lasting\nsecurity and survival of Tuvalu and the whole world."

        "file_text": "Let me begin by noting\nthat Finland is pleased to see you, Sir, preside over this\nmost crucial of General Assembly sessions. We also\nsalute your predecessor, Jean Ping of Gabon, who\nworked tirelessly and successfully to strengthen the\nUnited Nations and make it more relevant.\nAt the Millennium Summit five years ago, we set\na forward-looking and ambitious agenda for the United\nNations in the new millennium. Our success there was\nthe result of a unique common political will and an\noptimistic, can-do spirit. Through the endeavours at the\nSummit, that spirit was strengthened and deepened\namong world leaders. We built on that success in\nMonterrey and Johannesburg. There was hope that the\nworld was moving towards a positive cycle, that all our\nboats would be lifted and that both new and old threats\nwould be met with a common resolve.\nThe outcome document adopted at the world\nsummit held last week was, in many respects, a step\nforward. In others, we failed to match the expectations\nof our peoples. That, however, does not necessarily\nsignal a permanent erosion of our common political\nwill and our common agenda. Rather, I am confident\nthat it was primarily a result of the enormity of the task\nat hand: to reaffirm the goals agreed upon five years\nago, to assess and expedite the progress made since\nthen and to fundamentally reform the United Nations\nOrganization \u00f3 all at the same time. We are confident\nthat under your leadership, Mr. President, the General\nAssembly will be able to make further significant\nprogress at the current session. Let me pledge Finland's\nfull support to you, Sir, as we prepare to assume the\npresidency of the European Union during the second\nhalf of next year.\nFinland aligns itself with the statement made\nearlier by the United Kingdom on behalf of the\nEuropean Union. Let me make just a few additional\ncomments of substance.\nFirst, if one were to try to identify the single\nbiggest positive outcome of the momentous process\nunder way at the United Nations since the Secretary-\nGeneral's \\\"fork in the road\\\" speech two years ago (see\nA/58/PV.7), it would probably be the near-universal\nacceptance of the close linkage between development,\nsecurity and human rights. Compared with five years\nago, we now view all issues in a truly integrated\nfashion. Above all, it is the broad realization of the\n23\n\npivotal role of the rule of law for both security and\ndevelopment that strikes us as almost revolutionary.\nI would particularly stress the centrality of the\nrule of law in promoting sustainable development and\nsustained economic growth. The solid foundation of\nthe rule of law is needed more than ever if we are to\nsupport developing countries in building their national\ncapacity to create wealth and to take off economically.\nFinland is happy to note the increased attention\nand resources being devoted within the whole United\nNations system to supporting the rule of law and\nrelated activities. Much more, however, needs to be\ndone. We must remember that accountability and good\ngovernance at the global level start at the national\nlevel, by strengthening domestic democratic\ninstitutions, internal democratic processes, the rule of\nlaw, independent judiciaries and the role of\nparliaments. It is in those areas that the United Nations\ncan and must assist needy Member States in building\ntheir national capacities.\nSecondly, an area that we would like to see\ndiscussed and further elaborated here at the United\nNations is the interrelationship between development\nand social justice. As the United Nations Development\nProgramme's Human Development Report 2005 put it,\ndeep disparities based on wealth, region, gender and\nethnicity are bad for growth. The report goes on to add\nwhat we already knew, namely, that such disparities are\nbad for democracy, as well as bad for social cohesion.\nThirdly, I would target corruption as a scourge\nthat undermines both the rule of law and social justice.\nCorruption - the exploitation of a position of\ninfluence for private benefit - is a serious obstacle to\ndevelopment. It erodes the foundations of democracy\nand of viable economic structures. Our own experience\nshows that a value base that promotes moderation,\npersonal restraint and the common good tends to check\ncorruption. The same goes for legislative, judicial and\nadministrative structures that closely monitor and\nguard against abuses of power. Other factors\ncontributing to a low level of corruption include the\nprominence of women in political decision-making and\nlow income disparities within the population. Low\ncorruption often correlates with high economic\ncompetitiveness and increased efficiency in\ngovernance. I would strongly urge the United Nations\nand the United Nations system as a whole to redouble\ntheir efforts to help Member States fight corruption. It\nis of the essence if we are to achieve the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs).\nFourthly, on the subject of the environment, I\nwould stress the complementarity of the Johannesburg\nPlan of Implementation and the MDGs. Goal 7, to\nensure environmental sustainability, is essential for\nachieving other MDGs on poverty, health, education\nand gender equality. The protection and sustainable\nmanagement of the natural resource base is necessary\nfor development and poverty eradication. All\ndeveloped countries need to make substantive efforts to\nprevent the destruction of ecosystems, inter alia,\nthrough the promotion of sustainable production and\nconsumption.\nThose challenges cannot be successfully met\nwithout effectively tackling the challenges of climate\nchange and biodiversity loss. To that end, we need to\npromote energy efficiency, the conservation and wider\nuse of alternative energy sources and technological\ninnovation. We wish to see a rapid initiation of\nnegotiations to develop a more inclusive - and in the\nlonger term more effective - international framework\nfor climate change beyond 2012.\nWe also need a more coherent institutional\nframework for international environmental governance.\nAs the European Union has previously stated, Finland\nbelieves that the creation of a new United Nations\nspecialized agency for the environment - based on the\nUnited Nations Environment Programme, but with a\nrevised and strengthened mandate - would best serve\nthat end.\nThe fifth issue I would like to highlight is that of\nsmall arms and light weapons, which - like\ncorruption - was identified as one of the priority areas\nof the Helsinki Process on Globalization and\nDemocracy. That Process, which culminated two weeks\nago in the Helsinki Conference, was tasked with\ncoming up with concrete proposals on how to enhance\nhuman security across the globe. Reckless trade and\nbadly guarded stockpiles have led to a world awash in\nsmall arms and light weapons, where human rights are\nviolated, humanitarian aid looted and economic\ndevelopment halted - at gunpoint.\nFinland has also called for an end to irresponsible\narms trading through better international regulation.\nThe main ideas are to make all arms transfers fully\ntransparent and to establish universally accepted\ncriteria for them. We are of the opinion that those\n24\n\ncriteria should be strictly enforced, legally binding and\nfirmly founded on human rights considerations. That is\nwhy we have supported the initiative to negotiate an\narms trade treaty. It is high time to bring the rule of law\nto the international arms trade.\nLast but not least, I would join those who have\nstressed the need for the United Nations to take prompt\naction towards further management reform. This is an\nissue which cannot wait, as the very credibility of the\nOrganization is at stake. In the light of recent events\nrelated to the Organization, if there is a perception\namong the public that it is business as usual at the\nUnited Nations, we risk undermining the support that\nthe Organization enjoys. It is therefore obvious that an\nunreformed Organization would be less, not more,\nrelevant, and less, not more, effective. We must stress\nthe rule of law and good governance internally within\nthe United Nations, just as we stress it externally.\nReaching common positions and devising joint\naction at the international level requires patience and\npersistence, and a willingness to take practical and\npragmatic steps. If such an approach is taken, we are\nconfident that the sixtieth session of the General\nAssembly will be a success."

        "file_text": "I should first like to congratulate Mr. Jan Eliasson on\nhis election as President at the sixtieth session of the\nGeneral Assembly. I assure him of my delegation\u2019s full\nsupport for the important work to be accomplished at\nthis session. I would also like to extend my gratitude to\nHis Excellency Mr. Jean Ping for his tireless efforts\nand vision for change he has demonstrated so amply\nduring his presidency.\n(spoke in English)\nOur Organization is now at a turning point in its\nhistory. Sixty years after its founding, having confronted\nmany challenges, faced many threats, been defied by so\nmany conflicts, the United Nations is now entering the\ntwenty-first century with the obligation to reform itself.\nThe bipolar world has come to an end, and new\nthreats of a global nature have emerged: international\nterrorism, conflicts of a different breed, development\nand global environmental challenges. I want here to\nrenew to the delegation of the United States of\nAmerica a message of solidarity from the Georgian\npeople in the face of the New Orleans tragedy. Our\nOrganization has no other choice but to adapt, to find\nnew instruments and to establish a renewed credibility,\nwhich can only be based on a proven efficiency, results\nand visible effects. Words do not suffice; deeds are\nexpected from us all.\n31\n\nWe consider the outcome document adopted by\nthe 2005 High-level Plenary Meeting as a substantial\nstep in the right direction. This document deals with all\nthe real issues that, as we all know, are going to define\ntomorrow\u2019s world and affect our Organization\u2019s fate.\nWhether we are talking about eradication of\npoverty, consolidation of peace and security, protection\nof human rights, protection of displaced persons, need\nfor an effective system of peacekeeping and for a\ncoherent approach to peacebuilding, negative effects of\ntransnational crime, responsibility to protect\npopulations from ethnic cleansing or whether we\nreaffirm the absolute necessity of a dialogue among\ncultures and civilizations, all these challenges are of\ndirect relevance for my country.\nFor Georgia, these threats are not words, these\nills are not theory, they are daily realities and directly\nexperienced tragedies. Our support for an effective\nreform is not a rhetorical stand. Our vital interests are\nat stake; the future of my country is at stake. Georgia is\ndirectly experimenting on its soil the consequences of\nso-called frozen conflicts. Frozen conflicts lead to the\nfreezing of the economic development of these\nseparatist regions. They freeze the democratic\ndevelopment of the society in those regions. They\nisolate them and close them, transforming them into\noutlaws, \u201cblack holes\u201d where all kinds of trafficking\nand criminal activities, possibly including terrorist\nactivities, could develop outside our control or any\nform of control, outside any law.\nFrozen conflicts, as well as active conflicts, call\nfor the development of a real capacity of the United\nNations for effective involvement through instruments\nof peacebuilding. For many years the United Nations\nhas been dealing with the Abkhazian conflict, but\nunfortunately it has not managed to obtain effective\nresults. It has proved unable to this day to deploy the\nsmall police component that was decided upon, unable\nto implement fully its own resolutions, unable to\ndeploy an effective peacekeeping capability, unable to\nmonitor the human rights violations that are occurring\ndaily and frequently.\nGradually, despite the United Nations, despite\nregular meetings of the Security Council, and despite\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s Group of Friends of Georgia, a\nregime of apartheid prevails under which Georgians are\nexcluded and forbidden to go back to their land and\ntheir homes, and a process of covert annexation is\ntaking place. Thus, Abkhazia will be a litmus test of\nthe renewed efficiency of our Organization, of its\ncapacity to monitor effectively, to manage\npeacekeeping operations without having to delegate its\nresponsibilities to third parties and to enact finally\nstrategies of effective peacebuilding.\nIn the case of the South Ossetian conflict in\nGeorgia, we have a similar situation. The President of\nGeorgia has presented two mutually reinforcing peace\nproposals within a year. One proposal introduced last\nyear before this Assembly set out the three phases for\nending the conflict: demilitarization, economic\nrehabilitation and political dialogue. In December\n2004, it was complemented by a full-fledged proposal\non a status of broad autonomy, prepared together with\nthe Council of Europe\u2019s Commission for Democracy\nthrough Law (the Venice Commission) and presented\nto the Council of Europe. But peace plans are not\nenough. We now need a mechanism through which the\ninternational community will effectively support\ninitiatives and policies that are directed towards\npeaceful resolution of conflicts.\nFor all these reasons, we are taking the outlines\nof the new document very seriously and want to see it\nfully developed and implemented. We welcome and\nsupport the creation of an initial operating capability\nfor a standing police capacity. This is a very right step\nin the very right direction. We welcome the creation of\na Human Rights Council. This new body should be\nmore representative, should comply with the highest\nstandards of objectivity and should avoid double\nstandards as well as omissions or silences. An effective\nmonitoring system should be put into place. The\nstrengthening of the Office of the Commissioner for\nHuman Rights is also a step in the right direction.\nWe welcome the creation of a Peacebuilding\nCommission that will develop integrated strategies for\npost-conflict rehabilitation and recovery. We also need\na more effective framework for moving smoothly from\npeacemaking to peacebuilding, while developing an\nall-inclusive and coherent strategy within which the\nUnited Nations will fully assume its responsibilities.\nThe new Peacebuilding Commission should be fully\nrepresentative of the countries that have been or are the\nmost directly affected by conflicts. Also, given the\nspecial fate of women and children in conflict and\npost-conflict situations, gender representation should\nbe given additional attention. \u201cRepresentation is\nessential\u201d, \u201cKnowledge is key\u201d \u2014 as we, female foreign\n32\n\nministers, have mentioned in our letter to the Secretary-\nGeneral and the President of the General Assembly.\nFinally, Georgia supports the reform and\nrevitalization of the Security Council \u2014 a more\neffective and efficient, more democratic, more\ntransparent body is called for. Georgia supports the\nenlargement proposals in order to give non-permanent\nmembers a better chance to contribute to major\ndecisions. Transparency and improved decision-making\nprocedures are a must. Georgia is convinced that if\nthere is an adequate political will, the relevant\nagreement on a reformed Security Council can be\nreached at the present session of the General Assembly.\nThis is our wish. Moreover, this is a necessity. Our\ncredibility is at stake.\nToday not only the United Nations but all the\nmajor international organizations are going through a\ndifficult process of adjustment, of renewal and\nreappraisal. That is the case of the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, the European\nUnion, the Council of Europe and the Commonwealth\nof Independent States. Some will survive and grow\nstronger. Some will have to yield ground to other\nforums that are more flexible, less bureaucratic and\nmore in line with today\u2019s realities.\nThe United Nations has today started an\ninvaluable process of readjustment and rejuvenation. If\nour work is successful, this process will go to its term.\nThe United Nations will cease to be a mere forum\nfor calling for peaceful solutions; it will become the\ninstrument the world needs, the instrument for\nresolving the conflicts that tarnish the image of today\u2019s\nglobal world, the instrument for effectively responding\nto the newer global threats that endanger our\ndevelopment and our stability."

        "file_text": "Let me begin by\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixtieth\nsession. I have no doubt that, with your skills and vast\nexperience, you will guide our deliberations to a\nsuccessful conclusion. Let me also commend my dear\nfriend His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping, the outgoing\nPresident of the General Assembly, for the excellent\nmanner in which he directed the affairs of the fifty-\nninth session. In addition, I commend the Secretary-\nGeneral for his leadership, especially in advancing the\nUnited Nations reform and revitalization agenda. My\ncountry has full confidence in his integrity and\ncompetence, which he has demonstrated over the years,\nboth as a staff member and at the helm of the\nOrganization.\nAs we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the\nOrganization, we must pause and take stock of the\nrecord of our collective response to the many different\nglobal challenges that mankind has had to face. From a\nmembership of only 50 States at its inception, the\nOrganization has grown to 191 Members today. That\nrapid expansion, together with the sophistication that\nthe United Nations has acquired over the years, calls\nfor an assessment of its strengths and weaknesses with\na view to making it more effective. It is no secret that\nthe voice of the General Assembly has grown weaker\nover the years, that the credibility of our human rights\nprocedures and mechanisms has been reduced, that\ndemocracy, accountability and transparency in the\nSecurity Council have become blurred and that the\nEconomic and Social Council needs to be more\nrelevant and effective.\nOn several occasions since 1945, we have\nwitnessed instances of genocide, war crimes and\ncrimes against humanity, as well as the proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction. Civil strife and terrorism\nare undermining human and State security. Poverty,\nhunger and diseases still decimate countless\ncommunities, while our capacity to respond to\nhumanitarian crises needs to be reassessed and\nrevitalized.\nThis is the backdrop of the challenges we as an\norganization face. They do not represent failure; they\nsimply underscore that more needs to be done to make\nthe world a safer and better place for all of mankind.\nTherefore, as we celebrate our achievements, let\nus rededicate ourselves to remaining true to our\nmission and also fashion a new vision that captures the\nrealities of our world in the twenty-first century. In this\nconnection, my delegation would like to express its\ngratitude to the Secretary-General for the\ncomprehensive reform agenda he has laid out in his\nreport \u201cIn larger freedom: towards development,\nsecurity and human rights for all\u201d (A/59/2005). We\nagree that the world needs to be steered towards a\ngreater focus on those larger freedoms.\nThe majority of the world\u2019s people today are in\nchains \u2014 the chains of poverty and underdevelopment.\n5\n\nFor them, development means freedom from want,\nfreedom from fear and hunger and, above all, freedom\nto live in dignity. Reforming the United Nations so that\nit is better poised to more effectively address\nhumankind\u2019s quest for these larger freedoms, is a real\nnecessity for the greater relevance and impact of our\nOrganization.\nIndeed, the following objectives should be our\ncollective focus for the next decade: absolute poverty\nand its attendant woes such as diseases, hunger and\nilliteracy must be eliminated from the face of the earth;\nthe proliferation of nuclear and other weapons of mass\ndestruction must be halted and a total ban on nuclear\nweapons should be imposed on all States; peace must\nbe allowed to reign throughout the world; there must\nbe greater tolerance and mutual respect in dealing with\neach other\u2019s differences; the world\u2019s ecosystems and\nnatural resources must be judiciously conserved and\nutilized; political systems must work to achieve greater\ncooperation; multilateralism should replace unilateralism\nin dealing with conflicts, disputes or disagreements\nbetween Member States, and reconciliation should\nreplace confrontation and conflict.\nIf, in the next decade, we succeed in achieving\nthose objectives, we will have provided for ourselves\nthose larger freedoms that we crave today.\nWhile we must focus on those long-term\nobjectives, we must also not lose sight of the\nimperatives of our time. We must continue working in\nconcert towards the realization of global peace,\nassigning highest priority to those conflict situations\nthat pose the greatest threat to the peace of the whole\nworld. In this, we must begin with the Middle East.\nWithout a just solution to the Palestinian-Israeli\nconflict peace will continue to elude the Middle East\nwith consequences that will affect the whole world. My\ndelegation supports the vision of a two-State solution,\nwith Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace\nand security. We also welcome Israel\u2019s withdrawal\nfrom Gaza and the West Bank as a step towards a\ncomplete withdrawal from the rest of the occupied\nPalestinian territory.\nThe unstable situation in Iraq is causing\nundesirable ripples all over the world. The situation is,\nby no means, unconnected with the soaring price of oil,\nwhich is causing serious problems in the global\neconomy and threatening the economic gains made by\nmany developing countries. The sooner stability is\nbrought to the region, the better it will be for that\ncountry and the rest of the world.\nWe are encouraged by the positive contributions\nof the United Nations and the African Union towards\nthe peaceful resolution of conflicts in Africa.\nIn Guinea-Bissau, another milestone has been\nreached with the election of President Nino Vieira.\nAfter many years of trials and tribulation, the people of\nGuinea-Bissau have finally placed the country on a\nsolid path to recovery, peace and development. As\nChair of the Friends of Guinea-Bissau at the United\nNations, as well as a member of the Ad hoc Advisory\nGroup on Guinea-Bissau, my delegation calls for an\nearly convening of a donors conference to show\nsolidarity with the people of Guinea-Bissau and a\ncommitment to lasting peace in that country.\nEqually in Burundi, the democratic transition has\nbeen completed with the recent election of President\nPierre Nkurunziza. We extend to him and the people of\nBurundi, our heartiest congratulations and best wishes\nfor a new era of peace, stability and development.\nThis year has witnessed major strides towards\nsustainable peace in the Sudan. My delegation\ncommends the Government of the Sudan and the\nSudanese People\u2019s Liberation Movement for their\ncommitment to that historic accord meant to bring\nlasting peace to the country. We are encouraged by the\nsteps they have taken so far to implement the accord,\nand it is my fervent hope that their collective\nleadership will continue tirelessly to pursue the Sudan\nof their dreams. We sympathize with all the Sudanese\npeople on the tragic death of their leader and Vice-\nPresident, Mr. John Garang, who did so much to\nadvance the peace process. We are confident that his\nsuccessor will continue in his footsteps until all the\npending issues are peacefully resolved.\nAn underlying factor in all of these conflicts is\nthe proliferation of small arms and light weapons. We\nmust commit ourselves to denying non-State actors,\nterrorists and organized criminal networks the\nacquisition of these weapons of mass terror. We shall\nhave an opportunity to further refine our response to\nthis scourge during the 2006 review of the United\nNations Programme of Action on Small Arms.\nOur Organization must be the ultimate defender\nof the rule of international law, to which all States in\nthe comity of nations must adhere. Any attempt to\n6\n\nweaken or undermine our rules-based international\nsystem should be rejected without compromise. An\ninstitution like the International Criminal Court, with a\nmandate to end impunity, deserves all the support it\ncan garner from the international community. The\nRome Statute is a beacon of hope to all of humanity,\nand my delegation appeals to those States that have not\nyet done so, to consider speedily becoming party to it.\nMy delegation strongly condemns the application\nof unilateral coercive measures as a means of settling\ndisputes. These measures have an adverse impact on\nthe lives of innocent people, who lack any means of\nrecourse or redress. We therefore call for the complete\nand immediate lifting of the sanctions imposed on Cuba.\nAs we clamour for reform and renewal of our\nOrganization, we should widen our horizons and\nundertake a sober and dispassionate reassessment of\nour policy towards the Republic of Taiwan. The\nconcerns of the 23 million hard-working and peace-\nloving people of that great country continue to be\nignored. The Republic of Taiwan is a democratic,\nsovereign State. Its democratically elected Government\ndefends the interests of the people of Taiwan in the\nworld. The Taiwanese people display the same concern\nwe all do about global problems such as international\npeace and security, HIV/AIDS, the spread of disease,\nenvironmental pollution, and all the other issues that\nengage us at the United Nations. Yet, they are not here\nat the table with us, contributing their share in the\nsearch for solutions to the problems that confront\nhumankind today. We therefore call on all the peace-\nloving nations of the world to support the participation\nof the Republic of Taiwan in all the affairs of the\nUnited Nations as a full Member without delay. The\ntwenty-first-century United Nations should include all\npeople the world over without political discrimination.\nThe United Nations should also be committed to that\ngoal: a twenty-first-century, reformed United Nations\nthat includes the people of the Republic of Taiwan.\nTheir plight is more sharply amplified by our present\npreoccupation with the conflicts raging today that pose\na serious threat to international peace and security.\nThe reform agenda has been with us for decades\nnow. Finally, this year, a number of reports, including\none by the Secretary-General himself, seem to have\nspurred all of us to action.\nMy delegation fully supports the proposed reform\nof the Economic and Social Council and endorses the\nestablishment of the Peacebuilding Commission. In\nthat regard, we hope that the wealth of experience\nwhich the United Nations has gathered over the years,\nespecially in dealing with countries emerging from\nconflict, will be brought to bear in elaborating the\nstructure, functions and mandate of the Commission.\nWe equally support the proposed reform of the\nCommission on Human Rights. However, we should\nremember that human rights are everyone\u2019s concern\nand their enforcement is not the prerogative of a select\nfew. A smaller human rights body would reinforce that\nnotion and entrench the credibility crisis that the\ncurrent Commission suffers from. While the\nCommission may have structural deficiencies, it is its\nworking methods that we must focus on in order to\neliminate bias, subjectivity and selectivity.\nRevitalizing the General Assembly is equally\nlong overdue. It is time for the Assembly to be more\nassertive within the mandate accorded it by the Charter.\nThe reform of our Organization would be\nincomplete without Security Council reform. The\ncurrent size and composition of the Council makes a\nmockery of the larger membership of the United\nNations and the realities of the world today. No amount\nof politics or procrastination can silence Africa\u2019s\nlegitimate quest for full representation on the Security\nCouncil. International peace and security are\neveryone\u2019s business. Without reform and a thorough\nreview of the Council\u2019s working methods, the\nlegitimacy of the decisions it takes will be increasingly\nquestionable.\nWe shall also have to look into the issue of the\nveto once again. The purpose for which the veto was\ninstituted and the grounds on which it was assigned 60\nyears ago are no longer valid in today\u2019s world. In fact,\nAfrica\u2019s position on the veto, which my delegation\nwholeheartedly supports, is that it should be abolished.\nIn fact, veto power should be given only to the General\nAssembly, to be exercised by a majority vote. If that is\ndone, the United Nations and the world will be able to\nboast of a universal democratic system that will usher\nin a new and more peaceful world order.\nThe Security Council as presently constituted is\nnot conducive to the maintenance of world peace and\nsecurity. If it cannot be reformed, it should be\nabolished and its mandate assigned to the General\nAssembly with decisions taken by a majority vote. In\nthat event, any action taken by the United Nations in a\n7\n\ngiven situation would be taken on behalf of all of us.\nThat would put a definitive end to unilateralism in\nresolving international disputes and issues."

        "file_text": " I\nwish to begin, Mr. President, by congratulating you on\nyour election to lead our work during this session. We\nwish you full success during your presidency.\nLikewise, our gratitude goes to His Excellency Mr Jean\nPing for his work during his mandate. We also extend\nour heartfelt thanks to Secretary-General Kofi Annan\nfor his devotion as head of the Organization.\nThe anniversary we are now celebrating should\ninspire an appreciation of the importance of dialogue\namong all the nations represented here in achieving\ncollective well-being. Above all, we must recognize\nthe challenges ahead. We all know that our\nOrganization is passing through a crucial moment in its\nexistence. We can either strengthen it or weaken it. I\nreaffirm the commitment of my Government to\nparticipate significantly in pursuing the reform process,\nin particular in substantive areas in which we have yet\nto achieve agreement and which are essential for\nsuccessful reform of our Organization.\nThe historic process in El Salvador has shown\nthat lasting peace and democracy cannot exist without\ndevelopment and respect for human rights. My\nadministration is doing everything possible to maintain\na humanistic form of government focusing on people\nand their expectations and placing economic and social\ndevelopment at the heart of our programmes.\nAs a developing country, however, we are\nconstrained by limited natural, technical and financial\nresources. Sometimes, these limitations are increased\nas the result of natural events and other external factors\nsuch as the increase in oil prices which is truly\ndevastating to our economies.\n2\n\nAt last year\u2019s General Assembly session, we\nexpressed the need to find solutions to the impact of oil\nprices on economies. Since then, we have witnessed\nwith great concern that the prices of hydrocarbon\nproducts, far from dropping or stabilizing, have\nspiralled excessively as never before. This situation not\nonly seriously affects our development efforts because\nof the high oil bills, which lead us to divert funds that\ncould be used for social programmes, but also has\nbecome a serious threat to social and political stability\nand human security, primarily in the least developed\nand other developing countries.\nIn addition to those conditions and other factors\nrelated to instability and price speculation, there is a\ngrowing trend to exclude middle-low-income countries\nfrom assistance and international cooperation, further\nlimiting the ability of those States to meet the\nchallenge of development and in particular of\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals. We\nfirmly believe that the United Nations must discuss this\nissue with due seriousness and responsibility in order\nto find joint and supportive solutions that will help\nmitigate the crisis we are facing.\nI propose that the Department of Economic and\nSocial Affairs or the Economic Commission for Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean carry out a study on the\nimpact of increased oil prices on achievement of the\nMillennium Development Goals and on national\ndevelopment efforts worldwide.\nAlthough South-South cooperation has become a\nvaluable instrument that contributes to development, it\nis also important to recognize that further use should\nbe made of North-South cooperation, in particular\nthrough creation of the Global Development Alliance,\nwhich will make it possible, through a mutually\nbeneficial approach, to achieve economic growth and\nsustainable social well-being.\nWe feel that it is essential that as part of the\ncomprehensive reform of our Organization we promote\nthe strengthening and greater efficiency of funds and\nprogrammes in the operational activities of the United\nNations system. Similarly, I would like to highlight the\nimportance of setting up a just and equitable\ninternational trade system, based on predictable and\nnon-discriminatory regulations consistent with the\nprinciples of free trade.\nEl Salvador is committed to achieving the\nMillennium Development Goals that have been set for\n2015, despite external factors that affect us and limit\nour capacity to invest in development. With that vision\nin mind, El Salvador has launched its Opportunities\nprogramme aimed at improving the living conditions of\nthousands of Salvadorian families. It contains five\nbasic components. The first is the Solidarity Network\nprogramme to combat poverty and extreme poverty\nhead on, with a special role for Salvadorian women.\nThrough the Chair of the Commission on Women, we\nare doing everything we can to ensure that protecting\nthe rights of women is on the agenda. We can confirm\nthat the participation of women in peace and\ndevelopment has been essential for successfully\nachieving our goals.\nSecondly, the programme covers microcredit for\ndeveloping micro and small businesses; this will\npromote the development of new sources of income\nthrough self-employment.\nThirdly, the Health Solidarity Fund (FOSALUD)\nprovides for the establishment of a tax on tobacco,\nalcohol and firearms. Those resources will be used to\nexpand medical services in public health units to 24\nhours a day; here, we have seen excellent results.\nFourthly, the Presidential Youth Programme has\nbegun to include young people in the development\nprocess.\nFinally, our Get Connected programme is aimed\nat creating a model for public education that makes\ntechnology and information available to students.\nIt is with great hope that El Salvador is gradually\nmoving towards achieving most of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals. For example, we reduced the\nnumber of individuals living in extreme poverty by\n18 percentage points between 1991 and 2004. The\npercentages have gone from 33 per cent to 15 per cent,\nwhich means we have reduced the figure by half. The\ninfant mortality rate for children under the age of one\nhas decreased significantly, from 45 per 1,000 live\nbirths in 1991 to 25 per 1,000 in 2004: a reduction of\n20 points. We need to strive for a further 10-point\nreduction.\nParticipation of young people in economic and\nsocial development is a priority. It is a source of energy\nand creativity that can improve our society and put us\non the path to the future.\nWe also welcome the holding of the second phase\nof the World Summit on the Information Society, to be\n3\n\nheld in Tunis in November 2005. We urge participants\nto be active in agreeing on commitments, with specific\nobjectives that will help reduce the digital divide\nseparating countries. Like that of the first phase, held\nin Geneva in 2003, the outcome of the 2005 Tunis\nSummit on the Information Society should reflect deep\nrespect for freedom of expression as a pillar of\ndemocracy in order to ensure that a free and\nindependent press continues to work unhindered\nthroughout the world, as expressed in article 19 of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights.\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic has become a serious\nproblem that crosses borders and does not respect\nnationalities. The magnitude of the spread of this\nepidemic has meant that we must concentrate on\nprevention without forgetting treatment and support for\nindividuals living with this illness.\nIn El Salvador, we shall shortly host the third\nForum on HIV/AIDS and Sexually Transmitted\nDiseases in Latin America and the Caribbean, the\nfourth Central American Congress on Sexually\nTransmitted Infections and HIV/AIDS and the fourth\nCentral American Meeting of People Living with\nHIV/AIDS in order to unite our efforts and exchange\nexperiences. We are hoping to have support from the\nUnited Nations. We urge the entire international\ncommunity, in particular the donor countries, to\ncontinue to provide their support to national efforts to\ncombat HIV/AIDS and to reduce the costs of the\nmedications that are available.\nOne of the matters that require greater interest\nand attention is that of migration because of its\neconomic, social and cultural impact in countries of\norigin, transit and destination.\nThis matter should be dealt with from a\nmultidimensional approach, one that would establish\nguidelines for international, regional and subregional\ncooperation, adopt and coordinate joint policies based\non the contribution of migrants to development, as well\nas prevention efforts and action against illegal\nimmigration and the trade in human beings.\nOne matter of particular interest to El Salvador is\nthe scourge of national and transnational organized\ncrime. The phenomenon of gangs is closely connected\nto a series of serious offences that gravely threaten the\nsecurity of individuals and their assets. It also has a\nbearing on corruption; it reduces our people\u2019s morale\nand it has a negative impact on our development\nefforts. We believe that one of the measures that ought\nto be taken collectively to most effectively and\nefficiently combat this scourge would be to strengthen\nthe capacity of the United Nations Office on Drugs and\nCrime, and to enhance international cooperation.\nWe agree that the system to protect human rights\nneeds to be strengthened but it is necessary to establish\nan objective mechanism that is transparent,\nde-politicized and non-discriminatory.\nEl Salvador fully supports the strengthening of\nthe collective security system, with full respect for the\nprinciples of the Charter and universally recognized\nhuman rights. We recognize and appreciate the role\nplayed by peacekeeping operations. We feel it is\nimportant to continue considering the proposal of\nestablishing a strategic military and police reserve that\nwould allow for rapid deployment to deal with\nhostilities stemming from conflicts, as well as to\nmaintain post-conflict peace and security.\nWe are satisfied with our contribution to\ncollective peace with our growing participation in\npeacekeeping operations. In particular, we provide\ntroops from our national civil police as a result of\npeace agreements worked out and signed with the\nUnited Nations.\nWith regard to disarmament and nuclear\nnon-proliferation, El Salvador supports the efforts\naimed at reaching a global commitment to eliminate\nweapons of mass destruction. In this regard, we\nsupport Norway\u2019s initiative to adopt a declaration on\ndisarmament and security.\nAs to the situation in the Middle East, we wish to\nexpress our gratitude to the Government of Israel for\ncarrying out its disengagement plan, a unilateral\nmeasure that will conclude with the total withdrawal of\nthe Israeli presence from the Gaza Strip. This is a show\nof political will and the desire to put a lasting end to\nthe Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We believe that\ncontinuing to adopt measures to generate mutual trust\nwill enable both parties to resume the peace process, as\nset out in the road map. Similarly, we reiterate our\nsupport for the right of the Palestinian people to\nestablish an independent State, as well as the right of\nthe Israeli people to live in peace and security, free\nfrom any terrorist threat from radical groups outside\nthe law.\n4\n\nWith respect to the situation in Iraq, we trust that\nall political forces will participate in setting up new\ninstitutions for Iraq and that there will be an\nunderstanding which will lead to the establishment of a\nstate of law based on representative democracy.\nOne of the pending items on the international\nagenda that we must not disregard is the situation\nrelated to Taiwan and its inclusion in the concert of\nnations. We believe that the United Nations must look\ninto the question of Taiwan, because it is a reality that\nwe cannot ignore, since the representation of the\nTaiwanese people internationally is a responsibility of\nthis Organization, in accordance with its universal\nprinciples and purposes. Similarly, we hope that there\nwill be peaceful coexistence on both sides of the\nTaiwan Strait.\nI now wish to refer to the question of natural\ndisasters and the high level of vulnerability to which\nall of our nations are exposed, as seen by the tragic\nevents that took place recently in various parts of the\nworld, and most recently in the United States. This\nshould lead us to rethink and reassess our commitments\nand our decisions with respect to the environmental\nsituation in which we find ourselves. On behalf of the\nGovernment and people of El Salvador, I wish to\nexpress our most sincere condolences and our show of\nsolidarity to all families who lost loved ones and\nvaluables as a result of these phenomena, and we urge\nthe community of nations to pay greater attention to the\nenvironment.\nFinally, I simply wish to point out that our people\nfirmly believe and hope that the United Nations is and\nwill be an Organization that has legitimacy and the\ncapacity to contribute to the attainment of peace,\nsecurity, freedom, sustainable development and the\npromotion of human rights. Our role as heads of State\nand Government is to strengthen this belief and this\nhope, showing that we can work together in a united\nfashion to achieve concrete results for the well being of\nour people throughout the world."

        "file_text": "Because of the\nconstraints on our time, I shall omit several paragraphs\nof my statement, the full text of which has been\ndistributed to delegations.\nThe President, the Prime Minister and the people\nof Timor-Leste have conveyed to the people and the\nGovernment of the United States our profound\nsympathy for the people of the Gulf states, in particular\nthe people of the city of New Orleans, who were the\nvictims of Hurricane Katrina. President George W.\nBush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice have\nspoken touching words of gratitude in recognition of\nthe outpouring of sympathy from so many nations. We\nmust remember that the United States Administration\nand the American people were among the first and\nmost generous to respond to the tsunami tragedy that\nbefell the peoples living on the borders of the Indian\nOcean on 26 December last year.\nOnly a little more than three years ago, the\nSecretary-General, Kofi Annan, handed over power to\nour elected President. Since then, we have made real\nprogress in nation-building, peacebuilding, economic\ndevelopment, national reconciliation and enhancing\nrelations with our neighbours. Timor-Leste has acceded\nto the seven main international human rights\ninstruments, and my Government is committed to\nfulfilling its obligations. We were among the first in\nthe world to pioneer a streamlined treaty reporting\nprocedure. We are currently drafting our first reports,\nand all Government agencies are participating in that\nexercise. The internal political and security situation,\nincluding our porous common land borders, is peaceful\nand stable. A recent report of the World Bank,\ncommenting on the general situation of peace and\nstability in my country, stated,\n\u201cMost countries emerging from conflict ... relapse\ninto violence within five years. Timor-Leste has\navoided that fate, maintained peace and political\nstability, and established security\u201d.\nAs a result of the unexpectedly high prices of oil\nand gas, Timor-Leste today enjoys a surplus, which has\nenabled our Government to increase our public\nexpenditure by 30 per cent during the current fiscal\nyear. That increase will benefit mostly the rural\npopulation and the poorest. In addition, we are proud to\nreport that 36 per cent of our national budget is\nallocated to education and health.\nWe have fostered the best possible relationships\nwith our neighbours. At of the end of July, we became\nthe twenty-fifth member of the Regional Forum of the\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN); our\nnext goal is ASEAN membership. We enjoy special\nobserver status in the Pacific Islands Forum. Without\nthe active involvement of our regional and\ninternational friends, the leadership and coordinating\nrole of the United Nations and the engagement of its\nmany agencies, of the Bretton Woods institutions and\nof the Asian Development Bank, we would not have\nbeen able to achieve the impressive progress we have\nmade thus far.\nWith regard to truth and reconciliation, I shall\nnow address the issue of justice. In an effort to uncover\nthe truth about the events of 1999, the Governments of\nTimor-Leste and Indonesia have established a joint\ncommission on truth and friendship. The commission is\nmandated to examine serious acts of violence that\noccurred in the period before, during and after the 30\nAugust 1999 popular consultations sponsored by the\nUnited Nations.\nWe are accused in some quarters of being too\npreoccupied with forging close relations with\nIndonesia, to the detriment of justice for past abuses,\nand in doing so of encouraging impunity. To our\naccusers, we say the following. We are mindful of the\nneed to accord dignity and respect to the victims of\npast abuses, and we believe that in the pursuit of\njustice we must be sensitive to the need to establish a\nbalance between comprehensive justice and national\nreconciliation in order to avoid perpetuating the\ndivisions of the past and risking the exacerbation of\nexisting cleavages in our society. We believe that our\nfirst obligation, as a responsible member of the\ninternational community, is to build a peaceful, stable,\ndemocratic and prosperous country. By consolidating\nnation-building, internal peace and stability and\n26\n\nunshackling our people from poverty, we can\ncontribute to wider peace and stability.\nIf one were to read the aforementioned World\nBank report on the developments in my country, one\nwould reach the same upbeat conclusion about the\nimpressive gains that we have attained in only three\nyears. Let me share with members some additional\nfindings:\n\u201cTimor-Leste, the world\u2019s newest nation,\nwas created out of ashes ... Given that the country\nstarted from scratch both physically and\ninstitutionally, Timor-Leste has done remarkably\nwell\u201d.\nWe have developed a model Petroleum Fund legal\nand policy regime, which we took directly to the\npeople and to the National Parliament for approval. We\ndo not want Timor-Leste to fall prey to the developing\nnations\u2019 so-called resource curse, whereby God-given\nresources are squandered. The key principle is that\nonly the sustainable income from our petroleum wealth\nwill be available for current expenditure. Commenting\non our Petroleum Fund, the World Bank said that\nTimor-Leste\n\u201chas adopted a state-of-the-art legal framework\nfor on- and off-shore petroleum production and\ntaxation and a draft savings policy and associated\nPetroleum Fund Act consistent with the\nExtractive Industries Transparency Initiative\n(EITI) ... having embraced transparency\nprinciples even before EITI existed ... True to\nstated principles, the Government has adhered to\na provisional savings policy for petroleum\nrevenues ahead of the adoption of the permanent\nsavings policy\u201d.\nI should now like to touch upon the theme of\nUnited Nations reform. As we observe the current news\ncoverage surrounding the oil-for-food scandal, with the\nUnited Nations painted as the villain, we are certainly\ndisappointed that the Organization we idealize is\ntainted by allegations of corruption.\nIn peacekeeping and conflict prevention, we must\nremember that while the Secretary-General has the\nresponsibility to alert the Security Council to ongoing\nor potential conflicts that may threaten international\npeace and security, the ultimate decision to act rests\nwith the Security Council, in particular the five\npermanent members. The role of the United Nations in\nthe world has not, however, been limited to\npeacekeeping; it has provided facilities and an\nenvironment for informal meetings between parties in\nconflict, it has mediated hostage situations or border\ndisputes, and it has mobilized resources and\ncoordinated assistance to war-torn countries or to\ncommunities affected by natural disasters.\nWhile we all agree that our collective\nOrganization has failed at times, those shortcomings\nand failures should not obscure its virtues and\nsuccesses. The United Nations can become more\neffective if regional bodies do their share in addressing\nthe challenges in their respective regions.\nMuch has been said and written about the need\nfor a thorough review of the United Nations system,\nand much of the debate has been focused on the\nSecurity Council, overshadowing all other issues,\nincluding the much-needed reform of the General\nAssembly itself. Reform is also urgent in regard to the\nexisting human rights system. The proliferation of\ntreaty bodies and agenda items results in a morass of\nduplication, waste, inefficiency and loss of focus.\nThe General Assembly remains the prime organ\nof the United Nations that brings together all nations,\nrich and poor, large and small. The endless and\nrepetitive yearly general debate and agenda must be\nreviewed in order to shorten it and make it more\nfocused.\nI now turn to the Commission on Human Rights.\nNo country or group has a monopoly on selectivity. We\nare all good practitioners, focusing our attention on\nissues that are often remote from our shores or that do\nnot collide with friendships, alliances or interests.\nTimor-Leste fully endorses the establishment of a\nHuman Rights Council and is prepared to serve in such\na body if we are asked to do so.\nTimor-Leste strongly supports the creation of a\nPeacebuilding Commission, which will play a critical\nrole in post-conflict situations. The merits are sui\ngeneris. In view of our unique and rich experience,\nTimor-Leste would be pleased to serve on that new\nbody if our friends believe we can be useful there.\nThere is agreement that the Economic and Social\nCouncil must be reformed. It seems to duplicate or add\nlittle value to its subsidiary bodies. We do not support\nexpanding the Council\u2019s mandate to include managing\nUnited Nations post-conflict activities.\n27\n\nA permanent member of the Security Council\nshould not limit its peacekeeping contributions to\neloquent rhetoric while refraining from providing the\ntroops necessary to back up its words. We are all\ncapable of delivering eloquent speeches with apparent\nmoral force, but we do not all have the same political\nwill, courage or raw power to match our words.\nAspiring Security Council members, permanent and\nnon-permanent alike, should be countries with stable and\nopen political systems and with effective credible national\nleaderships that inspire trust and respect in their\nrespective regions and throughout the world as a whole.\nMy Government holds the view that regional\nbalance remains a sine-qua-non principle as should\nrepresentation of civilizations. Asia, which contains\nhalf of the world\u2019s population, is grossly\nunderrepresented in the United Nations system and will\nremain so, even with the possible addition of India and\nJapan. Timor-Leste supports the G-4 initiative, because\nwe believe that the four countries concerned fulfil\nevery reasonable qualifying criterion for permanent\nmembership in the Security Council.\nTimor-Leste, which has an overwhelmingly\nCatholic majority population, is proud to have been the\nfirst country to draw the attention of this body to the\nneed to insure that the Muslim world be adequately\nrepresented in an expanded Security Council. We\ncontinue to believe that Indonesia, the world\u2019s largest\nMuslim country, with the third largest population in\nour region and the third largest Asian democracy, is\nuniquely suited for permanent member status.\nI wish now to touch on an issue that has been\nvery much in the news in the last few months: Japan\nand its neighbours. Timor-Leste understands the\nreservations of certain countries that do not wish to see\ntoo large a Security Council; we understand the\nreluctance of some of the current permanent five to\nabandon or share privileges with new ones. We\nunderstand that countries that were invaded and\ncolonized by Japan during the Second World War are\nnot receptive to their former aggressor. Timor-Leste,\ntoo, was occupied by Japan during the Second World\nWar. But we also remember how the proud Japanese\npeople were made to pay an extraordinary price for\ntheir Second World War sins. Hiroshima stands as the\nliving reminder of that horrible price.\nJapanese leaders were brought to trial at the\nInternational Military Tribunal for the Far East and\npaid for their crimes. A defeated Japan was effectively\noccupied and administered by the victorious American\nPower. This benign occupier charted the course of the\nnew Japan, which today is a world economic Power, a\npeaceful and vibrant democracy that has made\nenormous contributions to the well-being of developing\ncountries and the United Nations system.\nAllow me now to share with the Assembly my\nGovernment\u2019s concern on some key international\nissues \u2014 the Middle East, Afghanistan and Iraq.\nFirst, we commend Israeli Prime Minister Ariel\nSharon for his courage in disengaging from Gaza. We\nhope that this is only a first step towards the full\nimplementation of the road map leading to the\nestablishment of a democratic Palestinian State. The\nnew Palestinian leaders and people deserve equal\npraise for their moderation and statesmanship, patience\nand tolerance.\nIn Iraq and Afghanistan, local extremist elements\nand foreign mercenaries continue their campaign of\nterror to reverse the democratic gains made by the\npeople of the two countries. The international\ncommunity and, in particular, the neighbouring\ncountries, have a special duty to provide all necessary\nsupport to the brave peoples of Afghanistan and Iraq in\ntheir struggle to consolidate their hard-won freedoms;\nthe neighbouring countries must do more to prevent\ntheir territories from being used as springboards for the\ninfiltration of mercenaries and weapons into\nAfghanistan and Iraq."

        "file_text": "We\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election and wish you\nevery possible success in the ongoing reform process.\nThe celebration of the sixtieth anniversary is an\nideal moment to reiterate my country\u2019s commitment to\nthe goals and principles of the United Nations. We\nexpress our support for the task of reforming the\nOrganization.\nColombia\u2019s adherence to multilateralism is based\non its active participation throughout the United\nNations process, from the signing of the Charter in San\nFrancisco on the June 26 1945 to today, with many of\nits agencies present in my country supporting our\nnational policies to solve the problems we face.\nIt is a source of pride that many Colombians have\nleft their mark on the Organization. It is worth\nmentioning, among others, former President Alberto\nLleras Camargo, one of the first and most fierce and\nefficient defenders of the principle of legal equality\nbetween States. He was also a champion of common\ndefence, which compels democratic States to come to\none another\u2019s defence should one of them be the victim\nof aggression.\nColombia had the privilege of presiding, through\nEduardo Zuleta, over the opening of the first session of\nthe General Assembly. His vision of the Organization\nis as valid today as it was 60 years ago, as you, Sir,\nrecently acknowledged in your speech to the Assembly.\nThe diversity and evolution of thought are human\ngifts. To exercise those faculties, it is necessary for\nStates to guarantee democratic opportunities that allow\neach individual to contribute to and compete in the\nquest for the collective good. There can be no room for\nany form of ideological stasis, which would discourage\nemulation, fail to recognize intelligence, and paralyse\ncreativity in the search for solutions to people\u2019s\nproblems.\nRecognizing diversity and the evolution of\nthought is the source of our vocation for pluralism. It\nguides the struggle against terrorism that we have\ncarried out with democratic conviction for three long\nyears. Now that dictatorships are expressions of the\npast and democracy is an indestructible paradigm, it is\ntime to review certain concepts that are becoming\nobsolete and must be replaced with more useful and\ncontemporary ones.\nThe mindset that characterizes Governments as\nbeing of the left or of the right is a simplistic view that\nproduces a polarized political atmosphere. It has\ntriggered irreconcilable emotions and sensitivities that\nare inconsistent with the actions of our Governments\nand threaten the unity of our countries.\nI dare suggest that, in their place, we use five\nparameters to qualify our democracies. They are\nsecurity with a democratic scope; the effective\nprotection of public freedoms; transparency as a factor\nof confidence; social cohesion as a principle of\ndemocratic sustainability; and the independence of\ninstitutions. With these parameters, we can define a\ndemocracy as institutional or only skin-deep; as\ngoverned by judicial order or by personal whim; as\nprogressive or backward, inclusive or exclusive.\nColombia is working on a concept of democratic\nsecurity, enshrined in global security. We call it\ndemocratic because it differs from the doctrine of\nnational security that was applied in the continent and\nused to suppress freedoms, punish democracy,\nstigmatize the opposition and frustrate dissent. Our\nsecurity is aimed at deepening democracy. We have\ngone to great lengths to ensure that this process of re-\nestablishing security is recognized as a democratic\nvalue by all schools of thought. We are determined that\nsecurity shall be provided on equal terms, efficiently\nand transparently, to those closest to the Government,\nas well as to its most hardened opponents.\nIn Colombia, the security problem has been the\nproduct of the weakness of the State in facing\ncriminals. We wish to reconfigure the equation and to\nfinally have a State that is strong enough to guarantee\nColombians the effectiveness of their freedoms and\nprotect them from all threats. Given a democracy that\nis deep-rooted and without ambiguities, no violent\naction can enjoy a veneer of legitimacy; on the\ncontrary, it must be disqualified and branded as\nterrorist. We therefore express our solidarity with those\nwho have suffered from the actions of terror.\nFor three consecutive years, the number of\nhomicides, kidnappings and other terrorist crimes has\nfallen in Colombia. We have not yet won the struggle\nagainst terrorism, but we are winning it. That victory\n22\n\nwill bring peace and progress to our country and, with\nillicit drugs uprooted from our soil, the world will feel\ngreat relief. To that end, we need the participation and\nsupport of the international community.\nThe opposition in Colombia has always had\nsafeguards, but today those guarantees are truly\neffective thanks to democratic security. Colombia has\nalways embraced the cause of human rights, but those\nare now enjoying more tangible respect thanks to\ndemocratic security.\nWhile strengthening citizen\u2019s confidence in their\ninstitutions, the concept of security that we profess and\npractice requires those who opt for violence to cease\nhostilities and prepare to negotiate a lasting peace. The\ndecisive and firm action to thwart those who practice\nterror, along with a generous policy for those who\nchoose to abandon armed intimidation, have allowed\nthe demobilization and reintegration of 20,000 out of\nsome 50,000 terrorists. The Government\u2019s door\nremains open to negotiation so long as the agreement\non cessation of hostilities remains accepted.\nWe need the world to support our plans for\nreintegration. I ask members to imagine the magnitude\nof the challenge. We have 20,000 former\ncombatants \u2014 a number that could double in coming\nyears \u2014 individuals who have hitherto lived by the gun\nand are accustomed to killing. What better contribution\ncould there be to peace than the definitive rejection of\nillegality? To that end, we need the world\u2019s help in\nproviding new opportunities for rehabilitation and\nsocial integration.\nWe are implementing a law on justice and peace,\nwhich is applicable to all terrorist groups. By\ncomparison with earlier Colombian laws and those of\nother countries, our law raises the bar in terms of\njustice and reparations for victims.\nWe have increased fumigation to rid our country\nof the illicit drugs that finance terrorism, and we are\noptimistic with regard to manual eradication. By the\nend of 2005, some 30,000 hectares of illegal crops\nshould be destroyed. We require greater support from\nthe international community in order to provide our\npeasants with alternative opportunities.\nDemocratic security has allowed investors to\nregain their confidence, and we have begun to see early\nsigns of declining unemployment. In that way, we will\nfind the resources to face yet another challenge \u2014 that\nof overcoming poverty and building a nation based on\ntotal social cohesion. Our social policy is framed by a\nlong-term vision and short-term goals under constant\nreview, in keeping with the Millennium Development\nGoals, the fulfilment of which we reaffirmed yesterday\nin this Hall.\nI wish to cite three of the seven chapters of our\nsocial policy. The educational revolution is an axis of\nsocial cohesion and the road towards equality, the\nredistribution of income, and the opening of new\nchannels for social mobility, without which democracy\nwill remain incomplete.\nPromoting a country of owners emphasizes the\nfinancing of medium, small and micro enterprises in\norder to overcome the barrier of access to credit, a\nhateful form of discrimination that hinders democracy.\nComprehensive social protection, which in three\nyears\u2019 time will provide health insurance to all people\nliving in poverty, has allowed us to register progress in\nthe provision of child nutrition, to ensure access to\neducation and to improve the well-being of the elderly.\nThis year, 500,000 families will be involved in\nColombia\u2019s programme \u2014 poor families that receive a\nState subsidy to feed and educate their children. In the\nnear future, that number will rise to 1 million, in\naddition to the increase budgetary efforts undertaken\nunder the aegis of the educational revolution. In 2006,\n10 million children will benefit from our nutrition\nprogrammes, and 570,000 elderly citizens will receive\nstipends to cover their most pressing needs.\nOur social policy also comprises ongoing efforts\nto strengthen alternative development programmes in\norder to allow us definitively to overcome the problem\nof illicit drugs. Through such programmes, the\ninternational community has a unique opportunity to\ncontribute to and implement the principle of shared\nresponsibility.\nThe \u201cforest-keeper families\u201d programme,\ninvolving some 33,000 families committed to\nmaintaining their areas free from drugs and to\nsupervising the recovery of the tropical forest, as well\nas a programme to provide care to the displaced and\nreintegrated, will cost Colombia some $300 million\ndollars next year.\nWe stand firm in the fight against terrorism and in\nour conviction that a sustained and permanent victory\ndepends upon the success of each individual country in\n23\n\nthe struggle for social cohesion. In projecting our\nsecurity policy as a mainstay of the State, we believe it\nto be intrinsically linked to the ongoing improvement\nof the social conditions of our people. The distinction\nbetween authority and social policy is erroneous. Peace\nstems from authority, but lasting peace will require us\nto weave a social fabric of equity.\nLet this be an opportunity to draw attention to the\nthreat of rising oil prices and the lack of energy\nalternatives for poor countries that are net importers.\nThere are already signs of disturbance that could lead\nto grave disruptions of institutional stability. Ignoring\nthat problem could raise greater obstacles in our fight\nagainst poverty and prevent us from achieving the\nMillennium Development Goals. Many countries,\nincluding brotherly countries in Central America and\nthe Caribbean, require immediate action to help\nfinance the supply of fuel and the development of new\nfuel sources.\nI would like to reiterate the gratitude of the\nColombian people for the effective presence and\nsolidarity of the United Nations in our country.\nWe hope that the debate on the issue of reform\nwill further strengthen multilateralism. We also hope\nthat the Organization will emerge strengthened from\nthat debate, in order that it may effectively promote\ninstitutional democracy governed by progressive and\ninclusive legal processes in every country comprising\nthe community of nations.\nLed by the United Nations, contemporary\ndiplomacy must become more austere in its spending\nand rely more upon the Internet and modern\ncommunications than on travel, in order to avoid\nbecoming a heavy and debilitating burden upon\ncountries and to ensure that the resources saved on\norganizations, expenditures and contractors can truly\nreach communities in need. I wish to reiterate that the\nissue of austerity vis-\u00e0-vis world diplomacy is absent\nin our approach to United Nations reform, and we\nshould include it.\nEvery country, as well as the United Nations, as\nour universal Organization, can contribute to making\nthese hopes a reality and to bringing peace, security\nand comprehensive development to our peoples,\nthereby reaching the goals we set for ourselves for the\nearly years of this century.\nOur warm regards go out to the people of the\nUnited States, which has been battered by Hurricane\nKatrina. We wish to express our resolute solidarity\nwith those who have been its victims. It is our hope\nthat, in a few days, relief and rescue experts from\nColombia will be on the ground in affected\ncommunities in the United States.\nWe are all committed to one task, namely,\nmeeting the social goals of the millennium."

        "file_text": "Please accept\nmy congratulations, Sir, on your election to the\npresidency of this historic sixtieth session of the\nGeneral Assembly. I wish you every success. I would\nalso like to express my sincere thanks to the outgoing\nPresident for his dedicated work at the fifty-ninth\nsession. I endorse the statement of the European Union\n(EU) presidency.\nThe debate at last week\u2019s summit highlighted one\nimportant point, namely, that peace, development,\nsecurity and human rights are inseparably linked. One\ncannot address human rights and security without also\naddressing development. All of those issues are at the\nvery heart of our policies.\nPeople are waiting for our solutions to the\npressing problems of development. We must achieve\nthe Millennium Development Goals. Of that we are\nacutely aware, both in Germany and in Europe. The EU\nplan to reach the 0.7 per cent official development\nassistance goal by 2015, and the Group of Eight (G-8)\ncommitments made at Gleneagles, substantially\nstrengthen the financial basis of our work.\nWe are also willing to forge new paths by making\nuse of innovative financing mechanisms.\nAt the same time, frameworks establishing fair\nconditions for international trade are a prerequisite if\npoorer States are to share the benefits of globalization.\nThe EU is leading the way with its \u201cEverything But\nArms\u201d initiative, which grants the least developed\ncountries duty-free and quota-free market access. In\nthat context, we must do all we can to make the\nMinisterial Conference of the World Trade\nOrganization, to be held in Hong Kong in December, a\nsuccess. Only in that way can we bring the Doha round\nnegotiations to a successful conclusion.\nWe also know that excessive indebtedness curbs\ngrowth and development. The realignment of the\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt\nInitiative after 1999 has considerably reduced the\nindebtedness of some 27 States. Germany has to date\nforgiven \u20ac6.5 billion of debt and has earmarked a\nfurther \u20ac4 billion for the continuation of the HIPC\ninitiative.\nDebt relief is, however, dependent on all creditors\nspreading the burden fairly among themselves. We are\nalarmed by the fact that commercial and State creditors\noutside the Paris Club are doing less and less to live up\nto their responsibilities. I would like to seize this\nopportunity to call for your support at the forthcoming\nannual meeting of the Bretton Woods institutions, for\nthe G-8 proposal and for an extensive cancellation of\ndebts \u2014 including multilateral debts \u2014 for the\ncountries concerned.\nAll of the foregoing emphasizes the great\nimportance we attach to the global partnership for\n33\n\ndevelopment. That partnership is not, however, a one-\nway street. It also requires a commitment by partner\nStates to put in place the conditions for\ndevelopment \u2014 that is, democracy, good governance,\nrespect for human rights and anti-corruption measures.\nClimate protection and development are also\nclosely intertwined. Of course, everyone must have\naccess to energy. Nevertheless, all States must do their\npart to prevent the ominous advance of climate change.\nIn late November the parties to the United Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change and the\nKyoto Protocol will meet in Montreal. There, we will\nhave the opportunity to adopt effective mechanisms to\nreduce emissions of greenhouse gases beyond 2012.\nThat is precisely the policy pursued by the Kyoto\nProtocol, and it is a policy we will adhere to.\nThis year two natural catastrophes \u2014 the tsunami\nin the Indian Ocean and Hurricane Katrina in the\nUnited States of America \u2014 have clearly demonstrated\njust how vulnerable our societies are to natural\ndisasters. We have all learned just how important\ndisaster prevention is. As host to the Third\nInternational Conference on Early Warning, which will\nbe held in Bonn in March 2006, Germany hopes to\ncontribute to making better use of and improving early\nwarning mechanisms and thereby limiting the scale of\nthe damage caused by such disasters. Here I would like\nto take this opportunity to reiterate our invitation to all\nMember States to join us in making the Bonn\nConference a success.\nFor years, United Nations engagement has been\nhailed all over the world as a welcome sign of\nprotection and assistance, of peace and reconstruction.\nLast Sunday saw the first free parliamentary elections\nin Afghanistan under the new Constitution. The\nGovernment of Afghanistan, with a full complement of\ndemocratically legitimated institutions, is now\nprepared to assume responsibility for the further\nreconstruction of the country. By going to the polls,\nmillions of women and men in Afghanistan have\nproved that they have opted for democracy. Our thanks\ngo to the United Nations, which worked hard to make\nthose elections possible.\nIn his latest report on Afghanistan (A/60/224) the\nSecretary-General announced that the United Nations\nwill remain committed to assisting the country after the\nelections. I heartily endorse that commitment; such\nhelp is indispensable. For even if the Bonn process,\nlaunched four years ago, has now been brought to a\nsuccessful conclusion, the international community\nwill still need to stand by Afghanistan. Germany, too,\nwill continue to do its utmost to support the country.\nThe President returned to the Chair.\nTen years after the conclusion of the Dayton\nAgreement, and six years after the end of the Kosovo\nconflict, the situation in the Western Balkans has\nimproved tangibly. Nonetheless, major progress is still\nrequired in the political, legal and economic fields. The\npeople of that region must genuinely come to terms\nwith their past, and the parties to the conflict must be\nreconciled. In that connection, we call for full\ncooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal\nfor the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague.\nThe Middle East still faces great challenges. As\nits neighbours, we in Europe have a strategic interest in\npeace and stability in the region. We are convinced that\nonly through reform, the strengthening of democracy\nand the rule of law can lasting stability be guaranteed.\nThe free and fair parliamentary elections in Palestine\nand Lebanon are encouraging signs of change.\nThe Middle East peace process has also gained\nnew momentum over past months. We emphatically\nwelcome the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip\nand the northern part of the West Bank. Now it is vital\nthat Israelis, Palestinians and the international\ncommunity do all they can to lay the foundations for\npolitical and economic stability in the Gaza Strip.\nEfforts should be focused on a two-State solution based\non the road map. The objective remains a viable\nPalestinian State, living side by side with Israel within\nsecure and recognized borders.\nThe international community is united in its\ndetermination to help Iraq establish democracy and the\nrule of law. We want all Iraqis to be able to live free\nfrom fear and material hardship. The forces of terror\nand violence must not and shall not be permitted to win\nthe upper hand. The Middle East needs a stable,\nprosperous Iraq.\nHere, too, the United Nations is making its\ncontribution towards the process of political transition\nand reconstruction. That is why we have provided\nconsiderable financial assistance for the protection\nforce whose presence allows the United Nations to\nwork in Iraq. It is also why Germany has, at Iraq\u2019s\nrequest, advised that country on constitutional issues.\n34\n\nThe Iranian nuclear programme continues to be a\nmajor cause of concern. Past violations of international\nobligations, a lack of transparency in its actions, and\ninsufficient cooperation with subsequent investigations\nhave destroyed any confidence that the programme is\nfor exclusively peaceful purposes. With support from\nthe EU High Representative, Germany, France and the\nUnited Kingdom have worked with Iran on finding a\nway to restore confidence. Those efforts have received\nbroad support from the international community.\nTehran\u2019s continued disregard of International Atomic\nEnergy Agency decisions, however, is further\nweakening that confidence and the gains made to date\nare being put at risk for no good reason. We should\nemphasize that our concerns do not relate to Iran\u2019s\nright to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.\nThis has never been and will not be put in\nquestion. Our concerns do not relate to Iran\u2019s right to\nuse nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. That has\nnever been and will not be called into question.\nWe remain prepared to work on solutions which\ninclude objective guarantees that the Iranian nuclear\nprogramme can serve only peaceful ends. I appeal to\nIran to refrain from taking unilateral measures and to\nreturn to the negotiating table.\nThere is general agreement that the proliferation\nof weapons of mass destruction is now more than ever\na life-threatening risk to us all. It is thus all the more\nregrettable that no consensus could be reached on the\ninclusion in the outcome document of a chapter on\nnon-proliferation and disarmament. If we want to\nprevent the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction, in particular of nuclear weapons, all States\nmust fulfil their obligations. At the same time, new\nmomentum must be brought to the process of nuclear\ndisarmament.\nIn that context, I welcome the latest progress made\nby the six-party talks towards resolving the nuclear\ncrisis on the Korean peninsula. It is a vital first step.\nAfrica is in many ways a touchstone for and an\nexample of an effective multilateral system. The close\ncooperation of the United Nations with the African\nUnion, as well as with the Economic Community of\nWest African States (ECOWAS), has had a beneficial\nimpact in Sierra Leone, Liberia, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and,\nrecently, in Burundi. The United Nations is also\nplaying an equally important role in efforts to stabilize\nthe Great Lakes region.\nFollowing the death of John Garang, the peace\nprocess in the Sudan requires an even greater\ncommitment by all parties to implement the historic\nNairobi peace agreement. The United Nations Mission\nin the Sudan (UNMIS), to which Germany has\ncontributed personnel, is making a major contribution.\nHowever, we must not neglect other crisis areas, in\nparticular Darfur. The African Union mission in Darfur\nhas helped to stabilize the security situation in the area\nwhere it is stationed.\nThe variety of problems facing us \u2014 poverty, social\npolarization, global population growth, inadequate water\nsupplies and global climate change, to name only the\nmost pressing \u2014 serves to highlight the need for\nconcerted action. We must prepare the United Nations\nfor the challenges of the twenty-first century.\nOver the past 12 months, reform of the United\nNations has been intensively debated. Member States,\nthe High-level Panel and the Secretary-General himself\nhave provided valuable input. Some of their proposals\nare contained in the outcome document adopted at last\nweek\u2019s world summit.\nHowever, only when we have managed to\nimplement those proposals will we be able to speak of\ntrue achievement. To be a success, the process requires\nthe active participation of all Member States.\nThe tasks that the summit has set the General\nAssembly must be tackled with speed and focus. At\nthis session, the General Assembly must make a\nbreakthrough towards the adoption of the\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism.\nIt must also work on the creation of a Peacebuilding\nCommission.\nSustainable peace requires more than merely\nrestoring security. The post-conflict peacebuilding\nphase is particularly crucial. The sooner reconstruction\ncan begin, and the better coordinated the peacemaking\nand post-conflict recovery efforts are, the better the\nchances of lasting stabilization. The summit took a\nvital step in that direction by deciding to establish the\nPeacebuilding Commission by the end of the year.\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, in his report\nentitled \u201cIn larger freedom\u201d, states that:\n\u201cNo security agenda and no drive for\ndevelopment will be successful unless they are\nbased on \u2026 respect for human dignity\u201d.\n(A/59/2005, para. 128)\n35\n\nIf we wish to lend greater weight to the\nprotection and promotion of human rights, we must\nalso strengthen the relevant United Nations bodies and\nmechanisms.\nGermany therefore welcomes the decision taken\nby the summit to create a Human Rights Council which\nwill replace the Commission on Human Rights. The\nGeneral Assembly must now move fast to define the\nmandate and structures of the Human Rights Council.\nIt must ensure that the new body enjoys greater\nlegitimacy than its predecessor and that its working\nmethods are more effective, especially when it comes\nto responding to acute crises.\nAllow me a last word. A glance at the trouble\nspots around the world makes it clear that we, the\ninternational community, face far more conflicts in the\nSouth than we do in the North. Key decisions on\nsettling those conflicts are taken in the Security\nCouncil which, under the Charter of the United\nNations, has primary responsibility for the maintenance\nof peace. Its composition, however, still reflects the\nworld of 1945 and not that of the twenty-first century.\nAdjusting and expanding the membership of the\nSecurity Council by adding both permanent and non-\npermanent members thus remains essential. Any reform\nof the United Nations that does not include reform of the\nSecurity Council is not worthy of the name.\nThe Security Council is in danger of losing its\nauthority and legitimacy as long as entire continents\nand major contributors are not adequately represented.\nGermany and its partners Brazil, India and Japan\ntherefore have submitted a proposal on reform of the\nCouncil. It is the only proposal that includes a\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council and its\nworking methods. We are convinced that it is the only\nproposal capable of obtaining the necessary two-thirds\nmajority in the General Assembly.\nReform of the Security Council is an\nindispensable part of the overhaul of the United\nNations. In last week\u2019s summit document, we all\npledged to swiftly advance those reforms. We do not\nneed only progress; we need results. The time is ripe\nfor radical reform. Let us use this session of the\nGeneral Assembly to finally resolve this issue, which is\nso vital to the future of the United Nations."

        "file_text": "I am\npleased to commend the President, and the other\n29\n\nmembers of the Bureau on their election. We assure\nthem of our full willingness to cooperate in the tasks\nfacing us.\nWe arrived at this session of the General\nAssembly with the same conviction and resolve that we\nhad 60 years ago. We still believe that this is the place\nwhere we can collectively promote human rights,\ndevelopment, solidarity and peace. The political\nagreement reached last week, although it did not meet\nall our expectations, enables us to embark on the path\ntowards comprehensive and balanced renewal of the\nUnited Nations system. We have the necessary\nmandates to begin renewal during this session. That\nmust be possible, because our interest is the interest of\nhumanity.\nWe have here an exceptional opportunity to\nstrengthen multilateralism and to build it within the\ngenuine framework of international coexistence.\nMultilateralism is the very cornerstone of our foreign\npolicy. In the multilateral system, negotiation and\nconsensus are the tools to create international regimes\nthat promote globalization in a legitimate and effective\nmanner. The United Nations is a unique forum in that\nprocess, and we must strengthen it in order to achieve\nthose goals. Hence, the urgent need to implement\nUnited Nations reform.\nWe believe that multilateralism can furnish us\nboth with more and better instruments to allow every\ncountry, large or small, to participate in the elaboration\nof rules and in the allocation of the benefits of\nglobalization. We are convinced that globalization is\nmore of an opportunity than a threat. For that reason\nwe must assure the management of globalization,\nwhich can be achieved only through institutions that\nconform to clear, stable and equitable rules of the game\nwithin the context of international law. Economic\nforces do not act in a political vacuum, which is why\nwe need both a new architecture and new working\nmethods in the United Nations system.\nIt is in that spirit that Chile has taken an active\npart in various meetings concerned with the\nrevitalization of the United Nations, promoting\ncomprehensive reform in the major areas of\ndevelopment, security, democracy and human rights. I\nwould like to touch briefly on each of those areas.\nProtection of human rights is, in our opinion, the\ncentral issue of globalization and a continuing\npreoccupation in the recent history of Chile and Latin\nAmerica. That history has been written by the citizens\nand their struggles to restore respect for the dignity and\nrights of the individual.\nIndeed, human rights are a legitimate concern of\nthe international community. Examination of human\nrights issues by the United Nations does not constitute\nundue interference. On the contrary, it is the exercise\nof a shared responsibility, from a standpoint of\ncooperation and not of confrontation. When States are\nunable or unwilling to act, the Organization cannot\nremain indifferent in the face of genocide, ethnic\ncleansing, war crimes and crimes against humanity.\nThe responsibility to protect is an international moral\nobligation that we cannot shirk.\nFor Chile, the decision to establish the Human\nRights Council is a significant step towards universal\nprotection of human rights. We hope that before the\nend of the session, its characteristics, including its\nstatus as a permanent organ, will have been defined.\nThe election of its members by a two-thirds majority of\nthe Assembly, as we propose, will strengthen that\norgan\u2019s legitimacy.\nComprehensive reporting by the Office of the\nUnited Nations High Commissioner would also\nenhance the credibility of the multilateral human rights\nsystem. In order to avoid the politicization and\nselectivity that are harming United Nations human\nrights work, a peer review system would promote\ngreater cooperation, with all countries subject to\nobjective evaluations \u2014 particularly for those that\naspire to seats on the Human Rights Council.\nDemocratic values are cross-cutting: they apply\nto the citizens who participate in the life of a\ncommunity, they underlie the organization of\ngovernment and public institutions, and they are also\nthe linchpin of international coexistence. Democratic\nvalues are a priority on the multilateral agenda and\nshould be reflected in the active commitment of\nMember States to promote and defend democracy. It\nwas that interest that has motivated Chile\u2019s efforts\nwithin the Community of Democracies.\nWhile some peoples and regions are part of\nglobal society and participate in decision-making and\nin the distribution of global output, others are\nmarginalized and lack access to those benefits. That\nsituation raises important questions about democratic\nparticipation. It is therefore essential, if we wish to\nconsolidate democracy in the world, to move\n30\n\ndecisively to eliminate inequality and to abolish\nexclusion. A better quality of democracy is linked to\nsocial integration and poverty relief.\nIn that connection, the Millennium Development\nGoals represent a global commitment to fundamental\nrights, with social underpinnings, that must be\nachieved in order to effectively consolidate democracy\nand uproot moral indifference towards the unprotected\nof the world.\nThe deepening of democracy must aim at\ninstitutional capacity-building in order to meet the\ndemands of society in an effective and transparent\nmanner. We have been working along those lines in the\nOrganization of American States, in particular through\nthe Inter-American Democratic Charter, seeking\nformulas and instruments to improve democratic\ngovernance. Chile believes that that is an area in which\nthere should be close cooperation between the United\nNations and regional organizations.\nThe reaffirmation of democracy as a universal\nvalue by heads of State and Government in the\noutcome document represents concrete progress in the\nconsolidation of a new international regime for the\npromotion and protection of democracy and the rule of\nlaw.\nThe creation of the United Nations Democracy\nFund gives us a new forum for cooperation to help\nstrengthen and consolidate democracy around the\nworld. In April, 108 countries from all continents\nagreed on the \u201cSantiago commitment: Cooperating for\nDemocracy\u201d, which contains guidelines for action.\nWe have fully endorsed the concept of\nmultidimensional security in order to meet old and new\nthreats. Indeed, the incorporation of the concept of\nhuman security at the United Nations is an important\ncontribution to the process of renewal. The definition\nto be formulated by the General Assembly should\nincorporate the progress achieved by the Human\nSecurity Network, in which Chile has actively\nparticipated from the outset.\nWe were greatly discouraged that no agreement\nwas reached to include the topic of disarmament and\nnon-proliferation in the reform process. That is a topic\nthat must not be dropped from the United Nations\nagenda. We therefore supported the Norwegian\ninitiative, which succeeded in bridging the gap\nbetween opposing positions. Unfortunately, despite\nreceiving the support of nearly 80 countries, the\ninitiative did not find a place in the outcome document.\nWe will continue to work for its adoption.\nIn addition, we are convinced that terrorism must\nbe tackled through a global and sustained strategy, with\nthe cooperation of all States and international and\nregional organizations, in accordance with the Charter\nof the United Nations and international law and with\nfull respect for human rights. We must therefore\nchannel our strong condemnation of terrorism in all its\nforms and manifestations into the political will to\nconclude an international convention against terrorism\nbefore the end of the session.\nThe decision to establish a Peacebuilding\nCommission is one of the major successes of the\nreform agenda, as it will enable the Organization to\nprovide an institutional and integrated response in\npost-conflict situations. United Nations activities\nshould not cease as soon as a crisis ends but \u2014 to build\na durable peace \u2014 should continue until institutions\nare rebuilt and peaceful coexistence is restored.\nAs Latin Americans, and aware of our global\nresponsibilities, we are actively participating in the\nUnited Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti. We are\nconvinced that that joint commitment, which is\nstrongly regional in nature in Latin America and the\nCaribbean, has been helpful in enabling Haiti to\nrecover its ability to control its own destiny. This will\nundoubtedly require the continuing presence of the\ninternational community. The elections are an\nimportant step, which Haiti should take on schedule.\nVoting, however, is only the basis for self-\ndetermination: we must continue helping to create the\nprerequisites for a worthier future for the Haitian\npeople. Moreover, Haiti could be the first trial run for\nthe Peacebuilding Commission.\nOvercoming poverty, hunger and social inequality\nis the great challenge facing our peoples today.\nEconomic development with equity is essential in order\nto achieve a world truly at peace and to guarantee\nindividual rights and stable democracies.\nA few days ago, heads of State or Government\nreviewed the implementation of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), adopted in 2000. Our\ncountry met over one third of the Goals and hope to\nachieve them all by 2015.\n31\n\nIn order to achieve economic development with\nequity, each country has a responsibility to be assumed\ndomestically and tasks to be performed internationally.\nIn this connection, it is essential to work to implement\nthe Monterrey Consensus on financing for\ndevelopment, so that in its domestic efforts each\ncountry can enjoy the benefits of an international\neconomic environment facilitating poverty relief and\npermitting sustained development.\nWe were among the sponsors of the Action\nagainst Hunger and Poverty, which seeks to devise\ninnovative financing arrangements to combat this\nproblem within the framework of the international\ncommunity\u2019s endeavours to attain the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals. We need responses now, and the\nAction is a definite option recognized in the Summit\nOutcome.\nChile considers it essential to bolster overall\nefforts to liberalize international trade for the exports\nof developing countries and to achieve stable financial\nflows to their economies. We urge the speedy\nconclusion of the Doha round, to which we are\ncommitted, and a remodelling of the international\nfinancial architecture to promote international\nconditions favourable to the sustained growth of the\ndeveloping countries and to the elimination of poverty.\nDevelopment, security and human rights for all are\nthree interdependent concepts that dominate our\nexistence as societies and that must be adequately\nreflected in a comprehensive reform process. We have\nembarked on the decisive stage of the road to renewal;\nwe are all responsible for reaching the end.\nWe must make progress towards consensus on\nSecurity Council reform so that that organ can more\ndemocratically represent the new realities of the\ntwenty-first century.\nIt is also essential to renew the Secretariat\u2019s\nmanagerial capacity to administer effective and\nresponsibly the resources that we all contribute in order\nto achieve the purposes of the United Nations. Over\nand above the legitimate differences that are part of the\nrichness of our diversity, we must build universal\nagreements reflecting common concerns to ensure the\ndignity of peoples and the right to live in a more secure\nworld.\nLet me conclude by saying that this session of the\nGeneral Assembly is a historic opportunity to promote\nchange. If we do not implement the agreements\nachieved, hiding behind national interests or narrow\ncultural visions, we shall be failing to respond to the\nfeelings and expectations of millions of human beings\nwho aspire to understanding among civilizations, a\nglobal alliance for development and a reaffirmation of\nthe underlying values of the United Nations. Let us not\nmiss this opportunity. If we do not act collectively\ntoday, tomorrow may be too late."

        "file_text": "May I first take this\nopportunity to congratulate the President on his\nelection to lead the work of the General Assembly. Let\nme also reassure him of Tonga\u2019s support and full\nconfidence that the sixtieth session of the General\nAssembly will be fruitful and successful under his very\nable leadership.\nI would also like to give due recognition to the\nsterling work of his predecessor, Mr. Jean Ping,\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of\nGabon, during the fifty-ninth session of the General\nAssembly.\nI also join others in commending Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Anan for his leadership of our\nOrganization.\nAs we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of our\nOrganization, we can pause and reflect on where we\nare, and on the basis of our experience in the past and\nthe opportunities available for us in the future. We can\nchart a roadmap that will ensure that we, the Member\nStates, deliver on our commitments to the purposes and\nprinciples of the Charter and international law, which\nare indispensable foundations of a more peaceful,\nprosperous and just world. Tonga shares the concerns\nvoiced by several other delegations that business\ncannot proceed as usual, as this will continue to affect\nthe role and relevancy of our Organization and the\nimportant place of multilateralism in accomplishing its\naims.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s High-level Panel on\nThreats, Challenges and Change delivered the\nlandmark report expected of it. The Panel\u2019s far-\nreaching findings and recommendations laid a firm\nfoundation for what our Foreign Minister described last\nyear as \u201cconstructive engagement\u201d. Tonga remains\noptimistic that the level and intensity of engagement\namong Member States can still produce a lasting\nlegacy of improvement and the necessary changes for\nour Organization and its important work.\nLast Friday, at the conclusion of the historic\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting, heads of State and\nGovernment adopted the outcome document, which\nprovides multilateral solutions to the problems in\ndevelopment, peace and collective security, human\nrights, the rule of law and the strengthening of the\nUnited Nations. The baton has now been passed on to\nus to begin the implementation phase of the summit\u2019s\noutcome, and we need to rise to the challenge to make\ngood on our promises.\nThe development agenda remains the first priority\nfor small island developing countries, including Tonga.\nOver three decades, we have accumulated experience\nin national and integrated regional development\nplanning and have, therefore, fully embraced our\nprimary responsibility for our own development. The\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals\nhas been incorporated into our wider development\nefforts.\nThe financing of these development programmes,\nhowever, continues to depend on bilateral and\nmultilateral official development assistance (ODA), as\nwell as on concessionary loans from regional and\nglobal financial institutions.\nIn this regard, we welcome the proposed\nincreased resources that will become available as a\nresult of the establishment of timetables by many\ndeveloped countries to achieve the target of 0.7 per\ncent of gross national product (GNP) for ODA by\n2015. We congratulate those countries that have\nalready fulfilled their commitment in meeting the\nrequired target. The recent efforts and initiatives to\nenhance the quality of aid and to increase its impact,\nincluding the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness,\nare also welcome steps.\nODA, while necessary, will be insufficient on its\nown and would have to be complemented by active\npromotion of foreign direct investment, improving\ntrade access and effective development partnerships.\nThe outcome document emphasizes that one of\nthe critical challenges to economic growth is to ensure\nthat the necessary internal conditions are put in place\nfor mobilizing domestic savings. Tonga embarked on a\npublic sector and economic reform programme in 2002.\nTo date, several important pieces of legislation have\nbeen enacted through the Legislative Assembly,\nincluding the Public Finance Act of 2002, to modernize\nthe way the Government manages its finances and to\nprovide for more transparency; the Public Service Act\nof 2002, to modernize employment and remuneration\nmethods; and the Public Enterprise Act of 2002 to\nprovide for increased accountability by public\nenterprises. A programme of reform of Tonga\u2019s system\n29\n\nof taxation is also under way to bring it into conformity\nwith international norms and bilateral and multilateral\nobligations.\nTonga welcomes the recognition in the outcome\ndocument of the special needs and vulnerabilities of\nsmall island developing States and the commitment to\naddress those needs and vulnerabilities through full and\neffective implementation of the Mauritius Strategy\nadopted by the International Meeting to Review the\nImplementation of the Programme of Action for the\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates and the Barbados Programme of Action for the\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates.\nEnergy continues to play a crucial role in Tonga\u2019s\nsustainable development strategies, and maintaining a\nfine balance between energy, the environment and the\neconomy is a national priority. Tonga\u2019s increasing\nreliance on imported petroleum products to satisfy its\nenergy needs means that it is particularly vulnerable to\nexternal events that affect the price and availability of\npetroleum products. In this regard, Tonga reiterates its\nconcern over the continuing escalation of the price of\noil and its negative impact on its economy. Concerted\nefforts will have to focus on research and development\nfor alternative sources of energy.\nTonga recognizes the need to promote gender\nequality with the implementation of its National Policy\non Gender and Development, which was approved in\n2001.\nRemittances are a welcome source of foreign\nexchange, and Tonga is recorded as one the countries\nmost dependent on them as they amount to 39 per cent\nof gross domestic product. We therefore acknowledge\nthe important nexus between international migration\nand development and the need to deal with the\nchallenges and opportunities that migration presents to\ncountries of origin, destination and transit. We also\nlook forward to the General Assembly\u2019s high-level\ndialogue on international migration and development,\nto be held in 2006.\nWe join with others who have voiced their regret\nat the failure of the 2005 Nuclear Non-Proliferation\nTreaty Review Conference and reiterate the importance\nof implementing the three pillars of the Treaty.\nTonga supports the call to establish the mandate,\nmodalities, functions, size, composition membership,\nworking methods and procedures of the new Human\nRights Council as soon as possible during the current\nsession of the General Assembly.\nWe fully recognize that post-conflict peacebuilding\nis vital to achieving sustainable peace and support the\nestablishment of a Peacebuilding Commission by the\nend of 2005.\nWe strongly condemn terrorism in all its forms\nand manifestations, committed by whomever, wherever\nand for whatever purpose, as it constitutes one of the\nmost serious threats to international peace and security.\nWe also look forward to the successful conclusion of\nthe comprehensive convention on international\nterrorism during the present session of the Assembly.\nTonga continues to support the work of the Counter-\nTerrorism Committee and has progressed well in\ndrafting domestic legislation to put into effect all of the\n12 counter-terrorism conventions to which we have\nacceded.\nWe applaud the efforts and proposals for a\ncomprehensive package of reforms to revitalize the\nGeneral Assembly and to strengthen the Economic and\nSocial Council, to enable them to fulfil their mandates\nas envisaged in the Charter. We also support the\nongoing work of the Secretary-General to improve the\nefficiency and effectiveness of the Secretariat.\nPerhaps one of the more intense engagements\namong our membership involves the reform of the\nSecurity Council. Tonga maintains its support for\nJapan\u2019s proper and permanent place on any enhanced\nCouncil. The emergence, in particular, of prospective\npermanent members and novel ideas on criteria has\nmade this issue more deserving of further patience,\npoise and pragmatism. However, momentum and\nadvances on readily agreeable aspects of our reform\nagenda should proceed to fruition.\nThe ever-changing landscape of the Middle East\ncontinues to present hopeful signs suggesting that an\nenduring peace is possible. Genuine gestures, like that\ninvolving Gaza, by Israel and the Palestinian Authority,\noffer a platform upon which mutual borders might be\nsecured and upon which statehood might flourish.\nRegional organizations play an important role in\nsupporting and complementing the interests of member\ncountries in various fields, and Tonga acknowledges\nthe role of the Pacific Island Forum in that regard. At a\nregional level, Tonga is fully committed to its\n30\n\nobligations in ensuring peace in the region and\ncontinues to support the Regional Assistance Mission\nto the Solomon Islands with the third deployment by\nthe Tonga Defence Services currently in operation in\nthe Solomon Islands. The Pacific Plan, which was\narticulated by our Pacific Forum leaders for the\nrealization of their vision through deeper and stronger\nregional cooperation and integration in the areas of\neconomic growth, social development, security and\nenvironmental protection, will be tabled for\nconsideration by the leaders in October of this year.\nTonga, therefore, welcomes the call for support of a\nstronger relationship between the United Nations and\nregional organizations.\nThe Kingdom continues to observe a \u201cone-China\u201d\npolicy that recognizes Taiwan as an integral and\ninalienable part of China. An essential component of\nthat policy properly acknowledges that common and\nmutual issues are ideally left to an across-the-Strait\nframework dialogue, as opposed to any multilateral\nformula, however well conceived.\nTonga continues to develop and strengthen its\n\u201cLook East\u201d policy, in particular with China. Earlier\nthis year, the Kingdom established a diplomatic\npresence in Beijing to give strong voice to its interests\nand impetus to its exploration and pursuit of mutually\nrelevant and beneficial ventures, including tourism,\ntrade, aviation and security.\nThe world is watching us. Let us not renege on\nour commitments but push forward on the reforms that\nare essential to ensuring that multilateralism remains\nthe most efficient and effective way to address global\nproblems and issues."

        "file_text": "Allow me at\nthe outset to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixtieth\nsession. I would like to express to you the full support\nof the Republic of Slovenia as you carry out that\nextremely important and responsible task. May you\nhave much vision, courage and resolve as you preside\nover the General Assembly during this anniversary year.\nMr. Sardenberg (Brazil), Vice-President, took the\nChair.\nAt the same time, Sir, I would like to express our\nsincere recognition and gratitude for the efforts of your\npredecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, President at the fifty-ninth\nsession of the General Assembly. His determined\nleadership, his insight into the current issues of the\nmodern world and his enduring courage enabled him to\nguide the General Assembly in its sixtieth year, which\npromises to be a year of the greatest significance for\nthe future of the Organization.\nWe have assembled here to consider together in\ngood faith how we should respond to the challenges of\nmodern times and how our Organization should be\nadapted to the needs of the twenty-first century. We are\nhere to act on the basis of our best understanding and\nour belief in the achievements of creative development\nfor the well-being of the people of the modern world,\nto quote, Sir, your illustrious compatriot, Dag\nHammarskj\u00f6ld.\nThe outcome document contains numerous\nmeaningful and useful ideas. That document\u2019s purpose\nis to enhance the effectiveness of the United Nations\nand consolidate its mission in the modern world. The\nreform of the Organization is of the utmost importance\nand was initiated at the right moment. This is a time of\nchange for several international organizations and\ninstitutions. All are certainly aware of the current\ntransformation of the European Union and the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.\nSuch changes are difficult. We encounter obstacles\nsuch as the rejection of the European Constitutional\nTreaty in two referendums.\nThe effectiveness of the machinery and the\nmission of the United Nations should also be improved\nthrough the creation of the Human Rights Council and\nthe fight against terrorism. There were many\ndiscussions and diverging views on those two questions\nin relation to the outcome document. However, we\ncannot be successful if we have difficulty even\ndefining terrorism or establishing the Human Rights\nCouncil. There is some indecisiveness in the outcome\ndocument in that respect. With respect to terrorism, the\ndocument speaks of dialogue and understanding among\ncivilizations. With respect to the Human Rights\nCouncil, the outcome document proposes holding\nfurther negotiations to establish, among other things,\nits mandate and working methods.\nIn today\u2019s world, change and certainty are closely\nconnected and interdependent. Attaining a balance\nbetween them involves values, rules, laws and the\ninstitutions of human dignity, equality and democracy \u2014\nin short, human rights.\nThe fact is, we live in a globalized and\ninterdependent world in which we all are responsible\nfor our security. It is significant that the outcome\ndocument warns that there can be no development\nwithout security and no security without development,\nand that both development and security depend to a\n32\n\ngreat degree on respect for human rights, the rule of\nlaw and democracy.\nMany efforts have been made to address the\nsources of suffering in the world. United Nations\nMember States must continue to support efforts to\nattain the Millennium Development Goals. Twenty-five\nEuropean Union (EU) member States committed\nthemselves to the target of allocating 0.7 per cent of\ntheir gross domestic product (GDP) to official\ndevelopment assistance by 2015. In that context,\nSlovenia, one of the 10 new EU members and a new\ndonor, committed itself to attaining the target of 0.33\nper cent of GDP for development aid. We underline the\nneed for the long-term commitment and responsibility\nof all countries in order to attain the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals.\nWe are continuously surprised at the changing\nnature of the threats facing each and every country.\nThe concept of security includes both State security\nand the security of the individual. Thus, it is important\nto effectively address various issues, in particular\ndisarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of\nmass destruction, as well as the problem of the\nproliferation of illegal small arms and light weapons,\nwhich affects numerous countries. We are rather\ndisappointed that the outcome document does not\ninclude provisions on non-proliferation and\ndisarmament, and we hope that work on those issues\nwill continue after the summit.\nTerrorist attacks on innocent people\nfundamentally contradict the value systems of modern\ncountries, in particular human rights, as formulated and\nstated in international conventions and declarations.\nTerrorist attacks are a violation of human rights, which\nare the foundation of modern societies; they represent\nan assault on the very essence of those societies and\nthus negate their very modernity. This negation is\nconnected with the complex and paradoxical nature of\nthe concept of modernity. It seems that the fundamental\nfrustration caused by this complex and paradoxical\nnature drives terrorists to commit radical actions.\nTerrorism cannot tolerate the complex and paradoxical\ncharacter of modern societies.\nMeasures in the fight against terrorism are aimed\nat those whose actions deny and reject human rights as\na fundamental value of modern societies. By\nexamining terrorists\u2019 attitudes and the meaning of\nterrorism, we should be able to define terrorism. An\nagreed definition of terrorism would provide clarity\nand help better ensure human rights. The more fully\nhuman rights are protected, the more successful we\nwill be in our fight against terrorism. Human rights\nwill be more fully protected when terrorism is without\nprotection. Tolerating or justifying terrorism\nundermines human rights.\nThat does not mean, however, that we can fail to\nrespect human rights in waging our fight against\nterrorism. It is precisely universal respect for human\nrights and fundamental freedoms, including in the fight\nagainst terrorism, that will ensure the success of that\nfight and preserve the democratic and free principles of\nthose societies which are being targeted by terrorists.\nSlovenia welcomes the affirmation of the\nprinciple of the responsibility to protect. By endorsing\nthat principle, world leaders have made a conceptual\nbreakthrough in the prevention of future tragedies like\nthose of Srebrenica, Rwanda and Darfur. For the first\ntime, we have recognized our national and collective\nresponsibility to act in cases of genocide and ethnic\ncleansing, war crimes and crimes against humanity.\nSlovenia considers the responsibility to protect to be an\nintegral part of national responsibility to protect a\ncountry\u2019s people against atrocities. It is our\nunderstanding that the Security Council shares the\nresponsibility to protect and that the use of the veto in\nthe Council is fundamentally incompatible with that\nresponsibility.\nWe welcome the establishment of a Democracy\nFund and intend to contribute to it. We strongly support\na strengthened role for the Office of the High\nCommissioner for Human Rights. The strengthened\nrole of the Office, to be financed from the United\nNations regular budget, is good news for the realization\nof human rights on the ground.\nThe level of agreement on the Human Rights\nCouncil is a disappointment. Numerous countries\nwanted and expected more. Unfortunately, for the\nmoment, we are left without the necessary vision of a\nnew Council, even though, in the preparations for the\nsummit, we formulated good proposals for the\nCouncil\u2019s structure and mandate.\nSlovenia wants a standing Council that is a\nprincipal organ of the United Nations, able to deal with\nall human rights concerns in all countries at all times.\nWe want a Council that better addresses rights and\nfreedoms, without double standards. We want a\n33\n\nCouncil that could convene and act in every instance of\nmassive violation of human rights. We want a Council\nable to make recommendations to other organs and\nagencies of the United Nations system so that human\nrights are truly integrated in all areas of the\nOrganization. Finally, we want a Council that reflects\nthe diversity of the modern world and that gives a\nproper voice to civil society through non-governmental\norganizations. In the course of the sixtieth session of\nthe General Assembly, Slovenia will continue to\nactively support the establishment of a strong and\nefficient new Human Rights Council.\nI have already mentioned the dialogue of\ncivilizations. That dialogue should be based on\nuniversal, fundamental values. No differentiation\nbetween \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d should be tolerated. Human\nrights and fundamental freedoms are the manifestation\nof our common fundamental values. They are the best\nanswer for ensuring a dignified life in our globalized,\nfast-paced and increasingly unsafe world. On the basis\nof our wealth of traditions and history and creative\ndiversity, all individuals should be informed of and be\nable to realize their rights and freedoms, as this is the\nbest long-term foundation for peace and development.\nEducating people about human rights and dignity is a\nprerequisite for this goal, and we are thrilled to see that\nthe need for such education is properly reflected in the\noutcome document. As a member State of the Human\nSecurity Network we are pleased that the issue of\nhuman security has been included in the outcome\ndocument of the High-level Plenary Meeting and will\ncontinue to be discussed in the General Assembly.\nCooperation between the United Nations and\nregional organizations deserves our priority attention in\nfuture. As experiences from a variety of geographic\nenvironments and conditions have shown \u2014 in\nparticular in South-Eastern Europe and Africa \u2014\nsynergetic cooperation between the United Nations and\nregional organizations can be very effective.\nAs Chairman-in-Office of the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), I call for\nthe elaboration of a binding framework for permanent\ncooperation between the United Nations and that\nimportant regional organization as soon as possible.\nFor 30 years now, OSCE has proved effective in very\nsensitive regions of the world. This year marks the\nthirtieth anniversary of the Helsinki Final Act, which\nestablished OSCE. Thirty years ago, the integration of\nEast and West began. Today, our main duty is to\nintegrate civilizations. One of the areas that should be\nfurther developed is strengthening dialogue among\ncivilizations. It may be that the supreme importance of\nour outcome document rests on that dialogue."

        "file_text": "Lithuania welcomes this\neffort \u2014 the most extensive and ambitious ever made \u2014\nto renew the United Nations. We must ensure that the\nsummit commitments we all have undertaken are\nimplemented and that they produce real and tangible\nresults, in order to improve the Organization\u2019s capacity\nto act adequately, effectively, expeditiously and in the\nbest interests of us all. Their implementation should\nalso enable us to give hope to the vulnerable and the\ndestitute and to make the world a better place for all.\nWe welcome the affirmation by the outcome\ndocument of the inextricable link between\ndevelopment, security and human rights. That, in our\nview, is a sine qua non for all our future actions. We\nwelcome the reaffirmation of the commitments regarding\nthe implementation of the Millennium Development\nGoals. As a member State of the European Union, we\nare proud of the Union\u2019s commitment to double its\noverall aid level by the year 2010, including a\nconsiderable increase in aid to Africa.\nWe support the establishment of a Democracy\nFund for countries seeking to establish or strengthen\ntheir democratic practices. In our view, that Fund will\ncontribute to maximizing the impact of development\nassistance by focusing on the improvement of\ngovernance standards. Transparent and democratic\ngovernance practices can make quite a difference in the\nperformance of countries that are otherwise quite\nsimilar in terms of their natural resources and social\nstructure.\nWe emphasize the role of international trade in\npromoting economic growth and development and thus\nin fighting poverty. We therefore add our voice to calls\nfor a rapid, ambitious and development-oriented\ncompletion of the Doha trade round.\nFurthermore, Lithuania is convinced that all\ndevelopment and all relevant related strategies should\nhave a built-in element of environmental sustainability.\nWe welcome the language of the outcome document to\nthat effect but believe that we should go further.\nIn particular, we underline the importance of\ngoing beyond Kyoto by initiating negotiations on the\ndevelopment of a more inclusive and equitable\ninternational framework for climate change beyond the\nyear 2012.\nLithuania welcomes the strong and unconditional\ncondemnation of terrorism in the outcome document.\n36\n\nWe call on the General Assembly to complete, at its\nsixtieth session, work on a comprehensive convention\non terrorism and on a global counter-terrorism strategy,\nas proposed by the Secretary-General earlier this year.\nWe strongly welcome the endorsement of\n\u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d populations from genocide,\nwar crimes and ethnic cleansing. This is of\nfundamental importance; it is an important step that\ngives us hope that we shall no longer look away nor\nstand idly by as entire populations are being killed.\nLithuania fully supports the proposals regarding\nUnited Nations management reform. We hope the\nblueprint to be submitted by the Secretary-General will\nnot fall victim to endless debates by Member States\nbut, rather, lead to tangible changes, improving the\nOrganization\u2019s accountability, transparency, efficiency\nand professionalism, while assuring the highest ethical\nstandards.\nToo often in the past, we have seen nations\nemerging from conflict lapse into disruption and chaos,\nthus destabilizing entire regions. We therefore call for\nrapid progress in making the Peacebuilding\nCommission fully operational before the end of this\nyear.\nWhile expressing our satisfaction with the\nagreement to double resources for the Office of the\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights, we urge all\nnations to take conclusive decisions in the coming\nmonths on the basis of the wording agreed to by the\nvast majority of countries in establishing a robust and\neffective Human Rights Council.\nAt the same time, we have to admit that the\noutcome document is lacking considerably in some\nareas. We are well aware that the reform process is not\na one-time event. As we proceed along the path of\nUnited Nations reform, we must make sure these areas\nare not left out.\nFirst, there is the issue of impunity. The fight\nagainst impunity and the rendering of justice must be\npart and parcel of our common efforts to improve the\nhuman rights situation worldwide. We stress our\nsupport for the International Criminal Court, as well as\nthe existing ad hoc and mixed criminal tribunals and\nother mechanisms for international justice.\nSecondly, there is the question of Security\nCouncil reform which cannot be delayed further,\nespecially if we really care about restoring the\nauthority and credibility of the United Nations. The\nCouncil\u2019s working methods must be improved to\nprovide greater input from non-member States. Its\nmembership must be expanded in both the permanent\nand non-permanent categories, with due consideration\nbeing paid to equitable geographical representation and\nthe recent emergence of new international actors and\ncontributors. Lithuania has long supported the\ncandidacies of Germany and Japan as permanent\nmembers of the Security Council. We appreciate the\naspirations of India and Brazil to undertake the\nhonourable responsibility of permanent membership,\nand we agree that Africa\u2019s representation in both\ncategories of membership is long overdue.\nAfter 11 years of debate on the issue of Security\nCouncil reform, it is time to admit that we are unlikely\nto produce new arguments without repeating ourselves\nindefinitely. Lithuania, therefore, calls on all Member\nStates to assume their responsibilities and to take\naction.\nFinally, let me touch upon the failure to agree, in\nthe outcome document, on the issues of non-\nproliferation and disarmament. This is the major failure\nof our summit, especially in the light of the unfortunate\nconclusion of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty\nReview Conference earlier this year. We must honour\nour earlier agreements and obligations, restore\nconsensus and invest all our efforts in search of\nagreement on this crucial issue. We therefore call on all\nnations to rally around the initiative put forward by\nNorway and a group of like-minded countries; we\nbelieve this initiative could become a basis of viable\nconsensus and future cooperative action.\nLast December, we witnessed an unprecedented\noutburst of solidarity with the Asian tsunami victims.\nThese past few weeks, our hearts were with the people\nof the United States, whose citizens saw their lives\nshattered and whole communities destroyed by\nHurricane Katrina. We offered whatever assistance we\ncould to those affected and we extend our condolences\nto all those who have suffered from this enormous\ndevastation.\nIn moments of grief and sorrow, we are one. Pain\nhas no nationality, no religion, no race. Similarly, we\nshould all be one in our solidarity. We should not have\nto wait for new cataclysms and large-scale tragedies in\norder to agree on the need to build a renewed United\nNations for the new century. As Secretary-General\n37\n\nKofi Annan has repeatedly noted, in this globalized,\ninterrelated world, it is the collective interest that is\noften in our best national interest."

        "file_text": "Allow \nme first, Sir, to congratulate you on your election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixtieth \nsession. \n I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to \nexpress from the very bottom of the Peruvian heart our \nsincere feeling of solidarity with the women and men \nof the United States who have suffered as a result of \nthe natural disasters in Mississippi, Alabama and other \nsouthern states. Their suffering is shared by us, just as \nwe would share suffering anywhere in the world. I am \nsure that the faith and hope of the people of the United \nStates will enable them to overcome this tragedy. \n A year ago in this forum (see A/59/PV.5) I spoke \nof the need to face, with vision and realism, the new \nchallenges now facing us, the developing countries in \nparticular. On the one hand, our countries are \nbecoming part of the globalization of production, trade, \nfinancial flows, the digital telecommunications \nrevolution, and the spread of values such as democracy \nand human rights. At the same time, however, the \nworld is fragmented by an increase in social inequities, \nthe proliferation of civil wars, the collapse of States, \ngenocide, terrorism, transnational crime and \nenvironmental degradation. These contradictory trends \nof globalization on the one hand and fragmentation on \nthe other, call into question the governance within \nStates and within the international system, and \nultimately call into question international collective \nsecurity itself. \n Peace and security and the stability of the global \nsystem are not related only to political, military and \nstrategic issues. Peace and security also have social \nand economic components. Poverty and exclusion \nconspire against peace, security and democracy. Social \nexclusion triggers violence and instability, renders \ndemocracy fragile and leads to national and \ninternational fragmentation.  \n That is why we must agree on action to confront \nthese contradictions. That is the main commitment that \nwe as States undertook at the recent High-level Plenary \nMeeting on the Millennium Goals, and that is what the \nUnited Nations and the multilateral system as a whole \nmust tackle next. That is why I am highlighting the two \nmain axes along which these commitments must \ndevelop. I refer to security on the one hand and \ndevelopment on the other. \n While each country is responsible for its own \ndevelopment, it must be recognized that development \nencounters obstacles at the international level that call \nfor new partnerships and new forms of association. \nThese must go beyond the assistance-based paradigm \ncharacterizing much so-called development assistance. \nAnd, more important, they must overcome the \nasymmetry that currently prevails in relations between \ndeveloped and developing countries. \n On the one hand, developing countries are being \nasked to commit to open their markets, to foreign \ninvestment regimes and to reforming their public \nadministrations. We agree with all of that. But there is \nno matching solid commitment that developed \ncountries will, as promised, allocate 0.7 per cent of \ntheir gross national product (GNP) for cooperation. \nNor \u2014 even less \u2014 do we see obstacles to foreign \ntrade being dismantled.  \n The new partnership for development has to \novercome adverse factors for developing countries and \neliminate obstacles such as rigid intellectual property \nstandards, the speculative volatility of global capital, \nthe lack of foreign investment, subsidies, the debt \nburden, and, above all, the absence of genuine special \nand differential treatment in trade negotiations for \ndeveloping countries.  \n This is not only about receiving assistance to \nreduce poverty; it is also about a new association for \ndevelopment that will make it possible to generate \nemployment and create wealth. Implementing this new \npartnership would fulfil Millennium Development Goal \n8 and the commitments made in the Monterrey \nConsensus. That is why it is necessary for the Doha \nround to be completed next year. That is tremendously \nimportant.  \n As the Millennium Declaration recognizes, a very \nimportant cross-cutting element in the partnership for \ndevelopment is assuring the sustainability of the \nenvironment. As proof of our commitment, I was proud \n  \n \n8 05-51226 \n \nsome days ago to deposit the instruments of ratification \nof the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic \nPollutants and the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior \nInformed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous \nChemicals and Pesticides in International Trade, both \nof which are intended to reduce the negative impact of \npollution. \n As it carries out its development agenda, the \ninternational system must strengthen collective security \nto confront threats such as terrorism, nuclear \nproliferation, and organized transnational crime. This \nyear again, we have been shaken by acts of terrorism \nperpetuated all over the world. Peru suffered from, and \ncombated, terror for many long years, and expresses its \nsolidarity with the victims of these criminal acts. We \nreiterate our firm condemnation of all acts of terrorism \nand restate our commitment, through mutual \ncooperation, to prevent, combat, punish and eradicate \nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Peru \nappeals to the Assembly not to continue to delay the \nadoption of a comprehensive counter-terrorism \nconvention.  \n For my Government, international peace and \nsecurity is a prime objective, and we have adopted the \nfollowing measures in that context. First, Peru is \npromoting the limitation of defence spending at the \nregional level in order to release resources for social \ninvestment. The first decision I adopted on my \nGovernment\u2019s first day in office was to cut back \nmilitary expenditure in my country by 23 per cent in \norder to allocate it to food, health, education and social \ninvestments. Progress in this field has been significant; \nthere are agreements with Chile, Colombia and \nEcuador to craft and implement standardized \nmethodologies to reduce our military spending. \n Secondly, Peru was an advocate of the creation of \nthe South American Zone of Peace and Cooperation \nand the Andean Zone of Peace, which have been \nrecognized in Assembly resolutions 57/13 and 59/54, \nrespectively. \n Thirdly, Peru participated actively in formulating \nthe Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and \nEradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light \nWeapons in All Its Aspects.  \n Fourthly, Peru is participating in peacekeeping \noperations by providing troops, staff officers, military \nobservers and equipment. To increase our contribution \nin this area, Peru has signed a memorandum of \nunderstanding under the United Nations Stand-by \nArrangements System, which includes army, air force \nand navy units. Currently, Peruvian Blue Helmets are \nparticipating in peacekeeping operations in Eritrea-\nEthiopia, Liberia, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Burundi, the Sudan \nand the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as \nin Cyprus and Haiti. We cherish peace. \n For all these reasons, Peru is a candidate for a \nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council for the \nterm 2006-2007 in the elections to be held during this \nsession of the General Assembly of the United Nations. \nI should like here to express Peru\u2019s deep gratitude for \nthe majority support for our candidacy; we now enjoy \nthe widest possible support from Latin American and \nCaribbean countries as well as from our brother \ncountries in Africa and Asia, the Arab League States \nand countries of Europe and of Oceania. This generous \nsupport encourages us and strengthens our commitment \nto work with dedication and responsibility in the \nSecurity Council. We are grateful for this opportunity \nand the support offered by countries worldwide for our \ncandidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security \nCouncil for 2006-2007. "

        "file_text": "Unlike the Israeli Prime Minister, who a few days ago\ntold the Assembly that he had come to the United\nNations from Jerusalem, I - a native son of the\nland - was not able to come here from Jerusalem,\nbecause East Jerusalem, the capital of Palestine, still\nremains under Israeli occupation, despite the numerous\nUnited Nations resolutions in that regard. The\nabnormal situation of the city, which is sacred to the\nthree monotheistic religions, is a clear indicator that we\nin the Middle East are, regrettably, still far from peace.\nOnly when East Jerusalem is returned to its people,\nwhen United Nations resolutions are completely\ncomplied with and implemented and when the leaders\nof both countries are able to come freely from\nJerusalem, will we have truly achieved the peace that\nwe have so long awaited.\nWe are now at an important juncture that could\nconstitute the beginning of the road to peace. Israel, the\noccupying Power, has completed its disengagement\nfrom the Gaza Strip with its withdrawal of the settlers,\nits dismantlement of the settlements there and the\ndeparture of the Israeli forces from that territory. In the\nnorthern West Bank, some settlers were also\nwithdrawn, and four settlements were dismantled.\nThe end of the colonial settlement of one part of\nour land - regardless of how small it may be - is an\nimportant development, as is the withdrawal of the\noccupying forces from within that part. It is an\nimportant development that resulted from the\nsteadfastness of our people and the growing\nrealization, locally and internationally, of the\nimpossibility of the continuation of the status quo. We\nrecognize that the disengagement required political\nboldness. But, more important than the disengagement\nitself, are the way in which it occurred and the context,\nas well as the steps that will follow. That will\ndetermine whether the disengagement will take us\nfurther towards a comprehensive settlement and peace,\nor whether it is actually a step imposed by the realities\non the ground and intended to facilitate the\ncontinuation of the occupation, the colonization of the\nWest Bank and the obstruction of a final settlement.\nFor our part, we dealt positively with those\nmatters and exerted strenuous efforts to prepare\nourselves for assuming our responsibilities, to\ncoordinate the steps to be taken with the Israeli side\nand to ensure a peaceful and safe atmosphere during\nthe implementation phase. Indeed, we achieved\nreasonable results in that respect. Despite that fact,\nhowever, the basic nature of the plan remains: it was\nunilateral and did not take into consideration\nPalestinian interests and positions.\nIsrael, the occupying Power, has left the Gaza\nStrip completely devastated. Over the years, Israel\ndestroyed Gaza's infrastructure, economic capabilities\nand social fabric, as well as the Palestinian Authority's\nsecurity apparatus. Even the areas that had been under\nthe control of its settlements were almost totally\ndestroyed by Israel when it withdrew and left behind\npiles of rubble, which in itself constitutes a\nserious problem economically, environmentally and\npsychologically. Another problem was that Israel left\nbehind, and did not dismantle, what it called houses of\nworship - which were not supposed to be there to\nbegin with - in total disregard of its legal obligation\nto return the land to its original condition prior to the\noccupation.\nFurthermore, since the disengagement, the Gaza\nStrip has remained under the control of Israel, which\neffectively continues to control the airspace, the\nterritorial waters and the borders, thus continuing its\ncontrol of the movement of persons and goods into and\nout of Gaza. For that reason, and in the light of the\nprinciple of the unity and territorial integrity of the\noccupied Palestinian territory, the Israeli occupation of\nthe Gaza Strip has not ended and the legal status of\nGaza has not changed: it remains part of the Palestinian\nterritory occupied since 1967, including East\nJerusalem.\nOverall, Israel's occupation and colonization of\nthe Gaza Strip constitutes one of the worst injustices in\nrecent history. In addition, it must be clear that the\nGaza Strip - which comprises only 6 per cent of the\narea of the occupied Palestinian territory and which is\n30\n\nthe most densely populated area in the world - cannot\nattain economic or political sustainability in isolation\nfrom the West Bank: without a permanent link to the\nWest Bank, without freedom of movement and without\ntangible political progress and similar steps taken\nthere.\nWhat Israel is doing in the West Bank,\nparticularly in East Jerusalem, is cause for us to be\neven more pessimistic. Israel has continued its\nconstruction of the wall in disregard of the\nunprecedented 9 July 2004 advisory opinion of the\nInternational Court of Justice and resolution ES-10/15\nof the tenth emergency special session of the General\nAssembly in that regard. As everyone can see, Israel\nhas persisted in committing this grave crime,\ncontinuing to seize Palestinian land and attempting to\nannex it de facto, thereby destroying the livelihoods of\ntens of thousands of Palestinians, isolating them and\nimposing on them a totally different way of life and an\nunacceptable political situation.\nIsrael, the occupying Power, has also continued\nto establish and expand settlements. It has even devised\nthe so-called E-1 plan to seize the whole of East\nJerusalem and connect it to the Maale Adumim\nsettlement, thereby severing the West Bank into two\nseparate parts. All of the foregoing not only is unlawful\nand inhuman, but will also destroy any hope for a\nsettlement and peace based on the two-State solution.\nThe central mission for the international\ncommunity now, if we wish to safeguard the future of\nthe Middle East and maintain the prospects for peace,\nis to bring about a real and complete cessation of all\nsettlement activities and of the construction of the wall\nand to enforce the rule of law, the advisory opinion of\nthe International Court of Justice and relevant United\nNations resolutions. That must be our central mission,\nand whether there is political progress or not, we must\naccomplish it.\nBut then, how are we to deal with the situation\nand move forward? First, we need to find rapid\nsolutions for the outstanding issues regarding the Gaza\nStrip, including the Rafah crossing, the airport, the\nseaport, the removal of rubble from the Gaza Strip, and\nlinking Gaza to the West Bank. If we resolve those\nissues we may be able to change the living conditions\nof the Palestinians there.\nSecondly, the Sharm el-Sheikh understandings\nshould be implemented, particularly the Israeli\nwithdrawal from cities to pre-September 2000\npositions and the release of prisoners and detainees.\nThis could bring about a new reality and begin the\nprocess of rebuilding confidence between the two\nsides.\nThirdly, and in parallel with the aforementioned,\nit is necessary to return to negotiations and begin\nurgently the implementation of the road map, which\nlies at the heart of making political progress and is the\npath to a resolution of the conflict. For our part, we are\nready to do this, and to begin final status negotiations\nimmediately, as called for by President Abbas in his\nspeech a few days ago. We hope that the Quartet will\nuse its influence to make that happen, and we also hope\nthat the international community as a whole,\nrepresented by the United Nations, will provide the\nneeded support in that regard.\nHere we must stress the importance of the\ninternational assistance being extended to the\nPalestinian people and the Palestinian Authority. We\nwould like to express our gratitude to all donor\ncountries for their important and considerable\ncontributions. In that regard, I would like to express\nour appreciation as well for the role being played by\nMr. Wolfensohn and his team, in particular for rapidly\nputting together an assistance programme for the Gaza\nStrip and for promoting economic development in the\nentire occupied Palestinian territory. In that regard, the\nimportance of the Group of Eight (G-8) initiative must\nbe emphasized, and we express our hope that all donor\ncountries will support it.\nWe look forward to enjoying a dignified life like\nall other peoples of the world; we look forward to\nexercising our right to self-determination and national\nindependence; we look forward to building our\ninstitutions and to enjoying a democratic way of life\nand democratic governance; we look forward to a\npeace based on two States, Palestine and Israel, in\nconformity with the 1949 Armistice Line; and we look\nforward to a just, agreed solution for the Palestine\nrefugees in accordance with resolution 194 (III).\nWe have worked seriously to put an end to the\ncycle of military attacks and counter-attacks. We\nundertook a national dialogue that led to a unilateral\ndeclaration of ceasefire, and that ceasefire has been\nrespected despite Israel's obstructions and\nprovocations. That effort has led to an improvement in\nthe general atmosphere; it is incumbent upon both\n31\n\nparties to strengthen it. For our part, we will continue\nour national dialogue with a view to establishing a\npermanent and mutual ceasefire in the occupied\nPalestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, while\nreaffirming the right in principle of the Palestinian\npeople to resist occupation and to self-defence. We\nmust also reach a commitment by all Palestinian\ngroups for a complete cessation of the targeting of\ncivilians in Israel, which we have repeatedly\ncondemned and which we view as harmful to our\nnational interest.\nMoreover, we will continue to exert efforts to\nimpose law and order and to enhance our political\nsystem on the basis of real democracy, encompassing\npolitical pluralism and elections at all levels, including\nmunicipal and legislative elections. Israel must stop its\nattempts to interfere in and sabotage those elections.\nWe will also continue to advance the development of\nour national institutions in various fields and will\ncontinue to try to rebuild the Palestinian economy and\nto improve living conditions. We must do that\ncomprehensively throughout the occupied Palestinian\nterritory, including, of course, in the Gaza Strip, which\nhas suffered the most extensive destruction. We shall\nexert our utmost efforts to achieve those goals, even\nthough we realize that they are really the tasks of post-\nconflict reconstruction and that no other people has\nrealized such goals while still under occupation.\nOur achievements will inevitably be limited,\nsince Israel, the occupying Power, still controls most\naspects of everyday life in the territories. Any progress\nin that regard will remain directly and organically\nlinked to the achievement of real progress in the\nresolution of the conflict and the achievement of a\ncomprehensive settlement between the two parties.\nIt seems that Israel and some of its friends now\nfeel that they have succeeded in imposing many illegal\nconditions on the ground and in creating a degree of\nvagueness regarding some aspects of the conflict. In\nthat way, they feel that they have an opportunity to\nundermine the legal foundations of the question of\nPalestine, to undermine international legitimacy and to\nerode the neutrality of the United Nations. We, in\ncontrast, believe that situations created illegally will\nnot stand. We affirm that the facts are clear and\nindisputable, that justice and the rule of law will\neventually prevail over force and that the United\nNations - the embodiment of the international\ncommunity - will not forsake its responsibilities and\nwill not relent in the face of continuous violations of\nits resolutions.\nWe hope that the Israeli authorities will begin to\nseriously rethink their policies and positions instead of\ntrying to market them in the United Nations and in\nother international forums. We hope that they will\ndeclare their respect for United Nations resolutions and\ntheir readiness to implement them, rather than blaming\nthe United Nations for adopting those resolutions. That\nwill be the start of the solution and the start of a final\npeaceful and permanent settlement, which must be\nbased on law, international legitimacy and United\nNations resolutions."

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure to\naddress the General Assembly on the occasion of my\nfirst visit to the United Nations as head of State. First, I\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to preside over\nthe sixtieth session of the General Assembly.\nI would also like to pay tribute to the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his able stewardship of\nour Organization and the reform proposals he has put\nforward for our consideration. Since his appointment,\nthe Secretary-General has steered the United Nations\nwith tact and patience. His skill as a builder of\nconsensus has indeed been exemplary. We share his\nvision for the United Nations in the twenty-first\ncentury as outlined in his epic report entitled \u00ecIn larger\nfreedom\u00ee (A/59/2005). I am confident that Member\nStates will seize this historic opportunity and deliver\non the promise of a better world for posterity.\nThe shift in the global distribution of power,\naccompanied by the emergence of new threats and\nchallenges, has dramatically changed the context\nwithin which the United Nations operates. The United\nNations of the future must still, however, remain true\nto the universal values that inspired its creation. Our\npeoples expect the United Nations to act as an agent of\nprogress. They look to the Organization to play an\neffective and leading role in improving their economic\nand social well-being.\nKenya embraces the principles of the Charter,\nwhich serve as a basic reference point for the reform of\nthe United Nations. Those principles are the core of its\ninner strength. We believe that the principle of\ndemocracy is as central to this Organization and its\nfuture health as it is to the prosperity of our own\nnations. Kenya deeply cherishes that principle and\nseeks its generous spread around the world and in this\ninstitution.\nGlobal problems require global solutions. The\nUnited Nations is the only vehicle that can help us\nattain those solutions and give legitimacy to our\nactions. The United Nations remains indispensable in\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. It\nis pivotal to the attainment of sustainable development\nand the advancement of human rights. Let us work to\nstrengthen the United Nations to meet contemporary\nchallenges.\nImportant proposals for United Nations reform\nare already on the table. My Government embraces the\nholistic definition of collective security, which strongly\naffirms the connections between peace, development,\nhuman rights and the rule of law. Those goals cannot\nbe realized in isolation. As the Secretary-General\nobserved, \u00ecwe will not enjoy development without\nsecurity, we will not enjoy security without\ndevelopment, and we will not enjoy either without\nrespect for human rights\u00ee (A/59/2005, para. 17). I am\nsure we all acknowledge those plain truths.\n15\n\nKenya firmly believes that reform of the United\nNations is a process, not an event. In view of the\nintegrated nature of the issues, we need to adopt a\ncomprehensive policy approach to United Nations\nreforms. We must maintain a broad vision driven by\ncollective effort for the ultimate benefit of the\ninternational system.\nI am happy to note that although some of the\nproposals have been adopted, we should now move\nquickly to implement them. I refer especially to the\nproposals that do not require amendment of the\nCharter. They include the adoption of a robust counter-\nterrorism strategy, strengthening peacekeeping,\ncreating a Peacebuilding Commission and Fund and the\nreform of the human rights system.\nI am also pleased to note the consensus on the\nstrengthening of the General Assembly, the Economic\nand Social Council and a strong relationship between\nthe United Nations and regional and subregional\norganizations.\nEnvironmental protection is a threat that is a\nmajor challenge in the attainment of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals. This places the environment, more\nthan ever, at the core of sustainable development.\nInternational environmental governance is an integral\npart of realizing sustainable development. Kenya fully\nendorses the ongoing process of defining the elements\nof international environmental governance. This,\nhowever, should be done within the framework of the\nCartagena decision, which aims at strengthening the\nUnited Nations Environment Programme within its\ncurrent mandate through an enhanced financial and\nscientific base.\nWe should also recognize that no truly effective\nresponse can be made unless the international\ncommunity fully complies with its commitment to\nmake the means available as provided for in various\nmultilateral environmental agreements.\nKenya remains firmly committed to the United\nNations Programme of Action on Small Arms and\nLight Weapons and is gratified with the status of its\nimplementation, at both national and regional levels.\nDespite the progress made, small arms and other\nconventional weapons continue to end up in the hands\nof wrong non-State actors, with attendant adverse\nimplications on peace and security leading to political\ninstability in many countries. In order to curb this\ntrend, Kenya requests the Secretary-General to\nundertake a study into the possibility of a legal\ninstrument to control international transfers of\nconventional arms.\nKenya also supports proposals for the\nenhancement of peace-support operation capabilities of\nthe United Nations. Any mandate for peacekeeping\nforces should be clear and precise. Adequate resources\nmust be made available to the commanders in the field\nto enable them to execute their mandates effectively.\nIntervention in crisis situations must also be timely to\nprevent undue loss of life. Kenya welcomes vital\ncontributions to peace and security made by regional\norganizations forging predictable partnerships between\nthe United Nations and regional organizations.\nFurthermore, Kenya endorses the proposal to\nestablish a strategic military capacity to reinforce\nUnited Nations peacekeeping and the creation of a\nstandby brigade for rapid deployment of the\nOrganization\u00eds civilian police in peacekeeping\noperations.\nWe strongly support the Secretary-General\u00eds\nproposal to establish a Peacebuilding Commission and\nfund by 31 December 2005. We believe such a\npeacebuilding commission will contribute to the\nrealization of real peace in many regions. However, it\nis important that critical questions about form, function\nand decision-making authority be resolved.\nIn our own neighbourhood, the importance of\npost-conflict peacebuilding has become a bigger\npriority after the recent successes of the Sudan and\nSomalia mediation efforts, which Kenya chaired under\nthe auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority on\nDevelopment.\nKenya commends the international community\nfor the excellent response during the Oslo pledging\nconference towards reconstruction of southern Sudan.\nWe urge a similar response to support the Transitional\nFederal Government of Somalia in setting up and\nimplementing a national security, stabilization and\neconomic reconstruction strategy.\nWe also call upon the Security Council to play a\nmore positive proactive role in the search for a broad\nconsensus for peace and thus enhance the capacity of\nthe Transitional Federal Government to establish basic\ninstitutions.\nOn the reform of the Security Council, it is\nnecessary to make it far more equitable and\n16\n\nrepresentative of the United Nations global\nconstituency. The procedures and methods of work of\nthe Council should be changed to secure transparency\nand dialogue with the United Nations membership.\nFurthermore, the future composition of the\nSecurity Council should proceed on the basis of\nsovereign equality of States and equitable geographical\nrepresentation.\nKenya welcomes the proposal to develop a\nstronger relationship between the United Nations and\nregional and subregional organizations. For Africa,\nthere is abundant political will in our continent to make\nthe African Union succeed. I believe that external\nsupport, especially from the United Nations and the\ninternational community at large, would make the\nAfrican Union work better.\nThe establishment of an African Union Peace and\nSecurity Council and of the intervention force planned\nto be set up by 2009 are measures aimed at advancing\npolitical stability in Africa to underpin economic\ndevelopment. Already, the African Union has taken the\nlead in Burundi and in Darfur, in the Sudan, where\ndeployments of peacekeeping missions have preceded\ninternational action by the United Nations.\nThe recent pledges by the Group of Eight (G-8)\ncountries to double aid to Africa and grant 100-per-\ncent debt relief to 18 developing countries were\nwelcome. We hope they will honour their pledges and\ncommitments in conformity with the agreement forged\nat the 2002 Monterrey International Conference on\nFinancing for Development. Support by the G-8 will\nhelp African countries achieve the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals.\nKenya affirms the centrality of gender equality\nand recognizes the critical role that women must play\nin development. We also recognize that achievement of\nthe Millennium Development Goals depends on the\nempowerment of women. As part of our effort to fully\nattain this objective, my Government has adopted a\nnational policy on gender development. The aim is to\nintegrate women in decision-making through legal,\nregulatory and institutional reforms.\nI am convinced that, if we are to attain our\ncommon objective of revitalizing the United Nations,\nwe should embrace the vision presented by the\nSecretary-General in his package of reforms. This will\nrequire political will and leadership on our part. I\ntherefore urge Member States to seize this opportunity\nand endorse proposals on which there is broad\nconsensus. As we contemplate strengthening and\nrenewing our Organization, we should do so for\nposterity."

        "file_text": "I wish to join other\nrepresentatives in congratulating you, Sir, on your\nunanimous election as the President of the General\nAssembly at its sixtieth session. I am confident that,\nunder your able guidance, the General Assembly will\nrespond wisely and effectively to the needs and\nexpectations of the international community. I would\nlike to assure you of Cambodia's full support and\ncooperation as you carry out the duties and tasks of\nyour high office.\nWhile commending the efforts and contributions\nof Mr. Jean Ping, President of the General Assembly at\nits fifty-ninth session, I wish also to express my\nappreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his\npolitical vision and his firm commitment to the efforts\nto strengthen and revitalize the role of the United\nNations in securing international peace, strengthening\ninternational security and forging international\ncooperation.\nIn these times of uncertainties and difficulties,\nwhen the world seems to be inundated by conflicts and\ntribulations, the summit of the General Assembly and\nthe outcome document reaffirmed our commitment to\nthe principles of the Charter of the United Nations and\nprovided us with a new hope for achieving our noble\ngoals of strengthening peace and stability in the world,\na sine qua non for the development and prosperity of\nall humankind. Admittedly, the outcome document did\nnot respond to all of our concerns, but it gave us a\nframework for our future action. It is important for us\nto keep hope alive and to maintain our commitment to\nglobal peace and to taking the necessary steps to ensure\nthat that noble goal will one day be achieved.\nAs a country that has just emerged from many\nyears of war and internal conflicts, Cambodia\nunderstands the paramount importance of peace.\nCambodia is firmly convinced that more weapons will\nnot bring more security to the world. Disarmament,\nlike any other matter on our agenda today, cannot be\ndealt with in isolation. There is an urgent need for that\nmatter to be dealt with at the national, regional and\ninternational levels. We are of the view that the\npromotion of confidence-building measures is\nnecessary in that endeavour. The experiences gained by\nthe Regional Forum of the Association of South-East\nAsian Nations \u00f3 now in its eleventh year of existence\n\u00f3 have confirmed the rightness of that approach.\nThis explains the rationale behind Cambodia's\nratification of the Convention on the Prohibition of the\nDevelopment, Production, Stockpiling and Use of\nChemical Weapons and on Their Destruction on\n19 July 2005. Cambodia is a proponent of the\nreinforcement of international law, which, inter alia,\nincorporates the major instruments to curb the arms\nrace, including the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) and the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We note with dismay and\ndeep concern that the recent NPT Review Conference\nended without achieving any results, and we regret the\nfailure to reach consensus on that very crucial issue in\nthe outcome document of the High-level Plenary\nMeeting. Cambodia profoundly believes in the\nnecessity and benefit of disarmament. We believe that\npeople need food, not weapons.\nAfter 11 September 2001, security perceptions\nhave changed drastically. Nobody and no country is\nsafe from terrorism, which has caused untold suffering\nand death among innocent people and knows no\ndistinction between the rich and the poor, the powerful\nand the powerless, between a super-Power and a little\nspeck in the ocean, as we have seen in many parts of\nthe world. When death strikes, we are all the same. The\nsecurity of our people cannot be assured and ensured\nthrough weaponry and sophisticated technology alone.\nAnother threat created by the force of nature,\nHurricane Katrina, which devastated the States of\nLouisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and even Florida,\nreinforced us in that conviction. The human brain is a\ndecisive factor of and the essence behind our efforts to\ncounter security threats and threats of any other nature.\nTherefore, it is more important than ever that our\nstrategies be preventive, comprehensive, inclusive and\nglobal in nature. I would like to take this opportunity to\nexpress, on behalf of the people and the Royal\nGovernment of Cambodia, my profound condolences to\nthe families of the victims who have lost their lives, as\nwell as deepest sympathy for the survivors of that\ntragic incident.\nDuring the summit, our leaders endorsed the\nSecretary-General's identification of elements of a\ncounter-terrorism strategy. Such a strategy would\ncontribute to our concerted efforts to fight terrorism in\nall its forms and manifestations, which would be\nundertaken in full respect of human rights and\nfundamental freedom. I hope that our joint efforts will\n18\n\nlead to an agreement on the comprehensive convention\non international terrorism.\nAs part of the Government's policy of playing an\nactive role in international efforts to combat terrorism,\nin particular by fulfilling its obligations spelled out by\nthe Counter-Terrorism Committee of the United\nNations, Cambodia has implemented some necessary\nmeasures recently. Among other things, we are in the\nprocess of finalizing our national anti-terrorism law.\nAs we have learned through our experience over\nthe years, the causes of terrorism do not arise\nspontaneously. Only through continuous and consistent\nefforts to promote tolerance, social development,\neconomic growth and democracy, and to build a global\ncoalition involving all civilizations, all religions, all\ncultures and all political systems can we fight injustice,\npoverty and the other roots of those malicious and\noften lethal acts. Those long-term measures are of\nsignificance in our mission effectively to prevent acts\nof violence and extreme aggression.\nSixty years ago, the United Nations was\nestablished to spare future generations from the\nscourge of war. However, the foundation of peace lies\nin the success of our respective Governments, their\npeoples and the world community at large in forging\ntheir future and the future of their children through\nbetter health care, education and economic and\nprofessional opportunities in a safe and secure social\nenvironment that abides by the rule of law and the\nculture of merit and honesty.\nIt goes without saying that development is the\ncement for peace. Development in one part of the\nworld cannot be sustained without development\nelsewhere. Cambodia believes in national ownership in\ndevising strategies to develop itself. We also believe in\nthe crucial importance and necessity of international\npartnership. We equally believe in the importance of\ngood governance at the national, international and\ncorporate levels. How could we explain our mutual\ndependency otherwise? Transparency and mutual\naccountability are the best guarantees of a successful\npartnership.\nCambodia has expressed its full commitment to\nthe Millennium Declaration. In 2003, Cambodia\nlocalized the global Millennium Development Goals,\nwhich it calls the Cambodia Millennium Development\nGoals (CMDGs). The CMDGs, which reflect the\nrealities of Cambodia, are based on a strong national\nconsensus. Specific indicators have been adopted for\neach CMDG, including the benchmarks and the short-,\nmedium- and long-term values to be achieved by 2005,\n2010 and 2015. In all, the CMDGs cover nine areas of\nlong-term and short-term goals, 25 overall targets, and\n106 specific targets covering extreme poverty and\nhunger; universal, nine-year basic education; gender\nequality and women's empowerment; child mortality;\nmaternal health; HIV/AIDS, malaria and other\ndiseases; environmental sustainability; global\npartnership for development; and demining,\nunexploded ordinance and victim assistance.\nAt present, Cambodia is in the process of\npreparing a national strategic development plan for\n2006-2010 by combining its earlier socio-economic\ndevelopment plan and its national poverty reduction\nstrategy processes and integrating them into the\nCMDGs. The resulting CMDG-based national poverty\nreduction strategy will be rooted in the \u00ecrectangular\nstrategy\u00ee for growth, employment, equity and\nefficiency, which provides the political platform of the\nRoyal Government in the third legislature (2004-2008)\nof Cambodia's National Assembly.\nOur progress towards achieving the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals is constrained by a number of\nimpediments, including the chronic shortage of\ninvestment funds to meet our priority requirements.\nThat resource gap needs to be bridged through\nincreased flows of external finance. That is necessary\nsince the current concessions given by the international\ncommunity to least developed countries like Cambodia\nprovide only limited benefit to us and need to be\nsupplemented by increased inflows of development\nfinance. If we are to achieve the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals, greater financial inflows through\naid, reduced debt servicing and increased current\naccount inflows are critical to bridging the resource\ngaps and fostering the required growth.\nIt is in that connection that we would like to\nreiterate our call for the implementation of the Brussels\nProgramme of Action for the Least Developed\nCountries. We welcome the establishment of timetables\nby many developed countries to achieve the target of\n0.7 per cent of gross national income for official\ndevelopment assistance by no later than 2015 and to\nreach at least 0.5 per cent by 2009. We urge those\ndeveloped countries that have not yet done so to make\nconcrete efforts and invite them to establish timetables\nfor achieving the target of 0.7 per cent. We also urge\n19\n\nthose developed countries to achieve the target of 0.15\nto 0.20 per cent of gross national income for official\ndevelopment assistance to the least developed\ncountries.\nThe Royal Government of Cambodia welcomes\nthe resumption of the six-party talks on the Korean\npeninsula. Equally crucial is the continuation of the\ninter-Korean dialogue. It is our belief that open\nchannels of communication are essential in building a\nstrong foundation for attempts to pursue peace and\nstability in the Korean peninsula.\nWe also welcome the recent positive\ndevelopments in the Middle East and continue to\nencourage the implementation of the road map and the\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. After all the\nyears of war and conflict, we reiterate our call on both\nsides to continue taking steps towards peace, no matter\nhow small they might seem at the time, in order to give\nthe children of Palestine and Israel the opportunity to\nlive in harmony.\nThe dire situation in Africa deserves our outmost\nconcern and action. Too many African children and\nadults have suffered too long from too many conflicts.\nAt the end of the day, the world community, through\nthe United Nations and the Group of Eight leading\nindustrial countries should strive to make more\nefficient efforts and to take timely action to tackle the\nsevere plights of numerous innocent people in sub-\nSaharan Africa.\nIt is important for us never to lose hope, because,\nas history has shown us, hope is what carries us\nthrough difficult times and dreadful challenges.\nBecause of hope, we lend a hand to others. Because of\nhope, we let ourselves be assisted by others. Although\nwe are indeed facing an uphill battle in our attempts to\novercome the challenges of peace, security and\ndevelopment together, our noble goals to provide a\nbetter future for our children and grandchildren will be\nachieved. Let us have faith in our common house, the\nUnited Nations."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, on\nbehalf of my delegation, allow me to congratulate\nMr. Jan Eliasson on his election to preside over this\nsession of the General Assembly. I should like also to\ntake this opportunity to pay tribute to his predecessor\nfor the exemplary manner in which he guided the work\nof the fifty-ninth session of the Assembly.\nAllow me also to thank the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his inspiring report entitled \u201cIn\nlarger freedom: towards development, security and\nhuman rights for all\u201d.\nIt was 40 years ago today that the Maldives was\nadmitted to the membership of the United Nations. We\nare very proud of that milestone. We were then the\nsmallest country to have joined the United Nations, a\nfact which led to questions being asked in some\nquarters as to the viability of full membership for small\nStates and their ability to assume it. We survived the\nso-called mini-State debate, thereby reinforcing the\nconcept of the sovereign equality of all States,\nregardless of size. We also survived the cold war\nwithout losing the peace and stability that have been so\nessential to the social and economic progress of our\npeople.\nBut today we are facing a much more challenging\ntask and much more serious questions about the\neconomic viability of the country, whose economy has\nbeen devastated by the Indian Ocean tsunami.\nCompared to other affected countries, the loss of life\nand property damage in the Maldives were small in\nabsolute numbers. But in proportionate terms, we are\nthe worst-affected country.\nSome 62 per cent of the gross domestic product\nhas been destroyed. More than 7 per cent of the\npopulation is internally displaced. The social and\neconomic infrastructure was damaged or destroyed in\nover one quarter of all inhabited islands, 12 of which\nare now nothing but rubble.\nGiven the nationwide scale of destruction, timely\nassistance from the international community was\ncrucial in dealing with the emergency relief\nrequirements. We thank all nations, peoples and\norganizations for their generosity.\nI would also like to extend a special vote of\nappreciation and thanks to President Bill Clinton, the\nUnited Nations Special Envoy for Tsunami Recovery,\nfor his commitment and leadership in coordinating\ninternational efforts to assist affected countries with\nthe recovery. We are particularly grateful for his\ncontinued engagement, given that nearly nine months\nafter the tsunami, the situation in the country has not\neased.\nThere are still major funding gaps in the national\neconomic recovery programme. An economy which\nhad grown at an average of 8 per cent per annum\nduring the past two decades is now forecast to contract\nby 3 per cent. Rising oil prices, unforeseen tsunami-\nrelated expenditures and tourism revenue shortfall are\ncreating significant financial pressures requiring, for\nthe first time in our history, budget support from\ndonors.\nAs a small country, the Maldives lays great store\non assistance from the international community for its\nsurvival. We hope that our appeals for assistance will\nresult in the extension of the support that is required to\ntide us over the current blip in the economy.\nIt is ironic that just six days before the tsunami\nstruck, the Assembly had voted to begin a transition\nperiod for the Maldives for graduation from least\ndeveloped country status. While we recognize the\nachievements of our people through their diligent\nefforts and the support of the donor community, it is\nvital that trade preferences and other concessions not\nbe phased out through graduation before the country\nrecovers from the extensive destruction caused by the\ntsunami.\nThe tsunami that struck the Indian Ocean was a\ngrim reminder of the ferocity of the elements and the\nhelplessness of communities exposed to natural\ndisasters. Just as we support the establishment of a\ntsunami early warning system for the Indian Ocean,\nour thoughts are also with the millions of people in the\nUnited States, India, China, Japan and elsewhere who\nrecently have faced extreme weather events which\nbrought unprecedented death, destruction and pain. Our\nhearts go out to those in New Orleans affected by\nHurricane Katrina.\n17\n\nOne cannot overstate the importance of protecting\nthe environment and saving lives. There is no longer a\nfrontline comprising only small low-lying island\nStates. Indeed, climate change can cause destruction\nanytime and anywhere. Prevention is the only option\nwhen there is no cure. We hope that the Kyoto Protocol\nwill be implemented with full effectiveness.\nSmall States have the narrowest margins of safety\nand the least ability to mitigate or overcome\nenvironmental catastrophes. We would like to assert\nthe critical importance of the early and effective\nimplementation of the Mauritius Strategy for Small\nIsland Developing States.\nNot only is the Maldives seeking to build back\nbetter after the tsunami but we are also going through a\nhistoric transformation of the governance structures of\nthe country. The Agenda for Democracy and Reform\nbeing pursued by the Government focuses not only on\nmaking the Maldives a twenty-first century democracy,\nbut also on strengthening human rights protection.\nWith the acceleration of the Government\u2019s reform\nprogramme over the past two years, sweeping changes\nhave been brought to the political landscape of the\nMaldives. Political pluralism has been strengthened by\nintroducing, for the first time in the country\u2019s history, a\nmultiparty system. The country is also undertaking\nunprecedented legal and judicial reforms aimed at a\ncomprehensive modernization of the criminal justice\nsystem in order to bring it into compliance with\ninternational norms and standards.\nA Constitutional Assembly is in session to draw\nup a modern democratic constitution to embed liberal\ndemocracy in the country and strengthen adherence to\ninternational standards in civil liberties and the\nprotection of human rights.\nJust last week, the Maldives signed on to the\nOptional Protocol to the Convention against Torture\nand Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or\nPunishment. We are already committed to full\ntransparency and openness in safeguarding human\nrights in the Maldives. We believe that the engagement\nof the international community is one of the strongest\nsafeguards in protecting human rights. We have already\nacceded to a number of conventions on human rights\nand we are confident that the measures currently under\nway in the national reform programme will enable us\nto fully comply with and become parties to the\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights\nand the International Covenant on Economic, Social\nand Cultural Rights.\nTo recall Sir Winston Churchill, it would not be\nenough to say that we will do all that we can. Rather,\nwe would like to say that we will do all that is\nrequired, and then some, to ensure that our people live\nin larger freedom, as envisaged in the United Nations\nCharter.\nWe are mindful that under Article 2, paragraph 7,\nof the United Nations Charter Member States are not\nrequired to submit matters within their domestic\njurisdiction for settlement in United Nations forums,\nbut the Maldives believes that its aspirations to build a\nmodern and mature democracy are important enough to\nbe articulated before this Assembly. Moreover, given\nour limited resources and dearth of technical expertise,\nthe support of the international community is vital for\nthe success of the ambitious democracy project being\npursued by the Government. We are indeed encouraged\nby the initiative to establish a Democracy Fund. I\ngratefully acknowledge the support being extended to\nus by the United Nations system and our bilateral\npartners in this historic enterprise in the Maldives.\nToday, on the occasion of the fortieth anniversary\nof the admission of the Maldives to the United Nations,\nmy President wrote to the Secretary-General thanking\nhim and the United Nations membership for their\ncollaboration and support over the past four decades on\nmatters of crucial national interest to the Maldives: we\nrecall the support given by this Assembly to the\nrequirements of protection and security of small States;\nwe acknowledge the important role played by the\nUnited Nations membership in advancing efforts to\nprotect the global environment; and we are gratified by\nthe assistance that we are getting towards the\nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals\n(MDGs). Already we are on track for attaining most of\nthe MDGs.\nWe hope that the outcome document of the High-\nlevel Plenary Meeting (resolution 60/1) will expedite\nthe march of countries towards attainment of the\nMDGs and towards conquering disease, despair and\ndeprivation.\nThe July bombings in London and other incidents\nof terrorism have shocked and horrified us. We hope\nthat measures agreed upon to combat international\nterrorism, strengthen peace and international security,\npromote peacebuilding and strengthen the United\n18\n\nNations machinery on human rights protection will be\nfollowed up effectively.\nSound multilateralism is crucial to our quest for a\nbetter world in an age of globalization. It is therefore\nimportant that the effectiveness of the United Nations\nbe strengthened.\nWe welcome the proposals made by the\nSecretary-General on all aspects of United Nations\nreform. While we recognize the need for\ncomprehensive reforms, we hope that the reforms of\nthe Security Council will be completed before the\nyear\u2019s end in order to enable it to reflect more fully the\nrealities of the twenty-first century. Our support of the\nGroup of Four proposal is based on those\nconsiderations and we hope that there will be wide\nsupport for it.\nWe have consistently expressed concern about\nconflict and tension in the Middle East. We are\nencouraged by the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza\nStrip. We hope that this will be a first step in the\nmovement towards a just and lasting peace in the\nMiddle East.\nIn conclusion, allow me to reiterate the firm\ncommitment of the Maldives to the principles and\npurposes enshrined in the United Nations Charter. We\nwill work with the other members of the international\ncommunity to uphold and promote those lofty\nobjectives.\nWe seek a world, as envisioned 60 years ago in\nthe United Nations Charter, of all peoples living in\nlarger freedom, free from want, free from fear and with\nthe dignity that God almighty bestowed on all of us."

        "file_text": "Actually, we have no reason to celebrate the sixtieth\nanniversary of the United Nations. The chaotic,\nunequal and insecure world in which we are now living\nis not much of a tribute to those who gathered on\n26 June 1945 in San Francisco to found the United\nNations.\nFrom the conclusion of the Millennium Summit\nin 2000 until today, more of the world\u2019s children have\ndied of preventable diseases than all of the victims of\nthe Second World War put together.\nThe aggression against Iraq was launched, not\njust without regard to, but even counter to the opinion\nof the international community. That happened just two\nand a half years after having solemnly proclaimed at\nthe Millennium Summit that \u201cWe are determined to\nestablish a just and lasting peace all over the world in\naccordance with the purposes and principles of the\nCharter\u201d (resolution 55/2, para. 4). The General\nAssembly could not even meet to discuss it. The\nSecurity Council was ignored and then had to undergo\nthe humiliation of docilely accepting a predatory war\nthat had earlier been opposed by a majority of its\nmembers.\nThere is a clear explanation for the current state\nof affairs, which is that the order enshrined in the\nCharter pertained to a bipolar world and to a balance of\npower that no longer exists today. \u201cWe, the peoples\u201d \u2014\nas the Charter says \u2014 must bear the burden of a\nunipolar world, in which a single super-Power imposes\nits whims and selfish interests on the United Nations\nand the international community.\nTherefore, trying to get the United Nations to\nfunction in conformity with the principles and purposes\nenshrined in the Charter is make-believe. It is not\npossible. And it will not be possible as long as third\nworld countries, which make up the majority of the\nworld, fail to unite and fight together for their rights.\nWere the United States Government to comply\nwith Security Council resolution 1373 (2001), adopted\non 28 September 2001, and to the international\nconventions on terrorism, it would extradite the\nterrorist Luis Posada Carriles to Venezuela and release\nthe five young Cuban anti-terrorist fighters who have\nbeen subjected to cruel and unjust imprisonment for\nseven years.\nHad the United States Government allowed the\nUnited Nations to act in accordance with the Charter,\nthe Iraqi people would not have been invaded so that\nthey could be robbed of their petroleum, the Palestinian\n21\n\npeople would exercise sovereignty over their territory\nand Cuba would not continue to be blockaded. Nor\nwould there be billions of illiterate people or 900\nmillion starving human beings in the world.\nThat explains the failure of last week\u2019s summit,\nwhich was convened to assess compliance with the\nmodest commitments entered into to fulfil the\nMillennium Development Goals and which ended as a\npitiful imitation of what should have been a serious and\ncommitted debate concerning the grave problems\ncurrently besetting humankind. It was a complete farce.\nIt was of no interest to the powerful. Their selfish and\nhegemonic interests run counter to the aspiration for a\nmore just and better world for all.\nThe scandalous pressures and blackmail brought\nto bear on Member States, after the United States\nAmbassador brandished the stick and attempted to\nimpose 750 amendments on the outcome document,\nwill go down in history as the most eloquent evidence\nthat a new world and a new United Nations must be\nbuilt, with respect for and recognition of the right to\npeace, sovereignty and development for all, without\ngenocidal wars, blockades or injustice. The final\nnegotiations, from which most United Nations\nMembers were excluded, and the outcome document\nthat was adopted, in which issues of vital interest for\nour peoples have been omitted, is a vivid illustration of\nwhat we are talking about.\nWhile we await the day in which that new world\nand the new United Nations can become a reality, we,\nthe peoples, will continue to fight and, through our\nresistance, win once again the rights currently denied\nto us.\nThe powerful only talk about interventions and\npreventive wars, about imposing draconian conditions\nor the most efficient ways to control the United\nNations, while attempting to legitimize concepts such\nas the so-called responsibility to protect, which could\nbe used one day to justify acts of aggression against\nour countries. Let us spell this out clearly: today there\nis no right to peace for the small.\nWe as Cubans understand this very well, and we\nrely on the solidarity of peoples, on our united front\nand on our weapons, which have never been used\nexcept to defend just causes. Our brothers and sisters in\nAfrica know this well.\nWe are not pessimists; we are revolutionaries. We\ndo not surrender or conform. Today, more resolutely\nthan ever, we affirm that \u201cwe, the peoples\u201d will\novercome."

        "file_text": "I would like to congratulate you,\nMr. Eliasson, on your election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly and to assure you of my country's\nfull support during this sixtieth session of the General\nAssembly.\nReform will be a central theme at the Assembly's\nsixtieth session. Allow me to focus on four institutional\nreforms, by which Switzerland sets great store. They\nare, first of all, the creation of a Human Rights\nCouncil; secondly, reform of the Security Council;\nthirdly, the Peacebuilding Commission; and, fourthly,\ninternal management of the United Nations.\nThe creation of a Human Rights Council is\ncrucial. The Commission on Human Rights in its\npresent form suffers from various defects. We deplore\nits weak capacity to respond to grave human rights\nviolations. We also regret its overly selective character\nand the application of double standards, which\nundermine its authority.\nSwitzerland welcomes the decision made by the\nMember States at the summit to replace the\nCommission on Human Rights with a Human Rights\nCouncil. However, we regret that it has not been\npossible, even at this stage, to establish some of the\nworking methods on which there was wide agreement.\nFor Switzerland, this Human Rights Council\nshould be a principal organ of the United Nations or\nshould at least be directly subordinate to the General\nAssembly. It should convene periodically, be based in\nGeneva and should work in close cooperation with the\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights. It should be of a size that guarantees\nboth its legitimacy and the capacity to work effectively.\nFinally, to ensure real added value, it should incorporate\nthose instruments that constitute the strength of the\npresent Commission without reproducing its defects.\nThe profile and working methods of the Human\nRights Council should be established promptly. We\nhave given ourselves until the end of the sixtieth\nsession of the General Assembly to do this, but the\nideal solution would be to complete the work before\nthe next session of the Commission on Human Rights,\nwhich starts next March.\nWe now need a clearer picture of the process\nwhich the President of the General Assembly intends to\nconduct. We assure him of our strong support in this\ntask. Switzerland hopes that the future Human Rights\nCouncil can start its work soon, and it invites all States\nto strive towards this goal.\nSwitzerland has also been actively involved in the\nreform of the Security Council, an organ that embodies\nboth the strengths and the weaknesses of the United\nNations. No one can deny that the composition of the\nSecurity Council should better reflect contemporary\ngeopolitical realities. Enlargement of the Security\nCouncil will make it more representative and will\nstrengthen the authority of its decisions. However,\nenlargement of the Security Council, which has been\nthe subject of intensive debate over the past few\nmonths, is only one aspect of the reform that needs to\nbe made. It should not overshadow another\nindispensable part of the reform: the need to improve\nthe Council\u2019s working methods.\nFor most countries, opportunities to sit on the\nSecurity Council are few and limited in time. A serious\nreform of the Council's working methods would have\nan immediate and beneficial effect for all Member\nStates. New and more detailed rules should be adopted\nin a General Assembly resolution and then written into\nthe Security Council's rules of procedure.\nReform of the Security Council\u2019s working\nmethods must achieve several goals: it should increase\nthe possibilities for participation by States that are not\nmembers of the Council; it should ensure greater\naccountability of the Council to all the Member States\nof the United Nations; and, finally, it should improve\ntransparency and find new ways for the Council to hear\nother points of view.\nEfficiency is a fourth criterion that needs to be\ntaken into account. Improvements in the working methods\nof the Security Council must be geared towards\nstrengthening its capacity to efficiently exercise its\nresponsibilities for international peacekeeping and\nsecurity.\nIn May Switzerland presented a series of specific\nrecommendations that were well received by many\nMember States. I would like to focus on three specific\nproposals.\nFirst, in accordance with the principle of the\nresponsibility to protect, the right of veto must not be\n18\n\nexercised in cases of genocide, ethnic cleansing or\nother grave and large-scale violations of international\nhumanitarian law or human rights. I believe that that\nprinciple is sufficiently clear not to require further\nelaboration.\nSecondly, the Security Council should refrain, as\nfar as possible, from exercising legislative functions.\nThe task of codifying and developing international law\nshould remain the primary responsibility of the General\nAssembly, which includes all Member States. The\nCouncil is authorized by the United Nations Charter to\ntake emergency measures to maintain international\npeace and security. However, that authorization cannot\nbe interpreted as including the power to impose\nlegislative obligations, that is, obligations that are\ngeneral in scope, abstract and have no time limits.\nThirdly, on the subject of Security Council\nsanctions, the procedures for establishing and revising\nthe lists of targeted individuals and entities must be\nimproved. It is unacceptable that people who are\nsubject to sanctions that affect their basic rights are\ndenied all right of appeal. In particular, it is important\nto ensure the right to be heard, which is a fundamental\nhuman right.\nSwitzerland, together with other countries,\nintends to present a draft resolution on improving the\nworking methods of the Security Council.\nAnother important institutional reform decided at\nthe summit is the creation of a Peacebuilding\nCommission. Switzerland has contributed its ideas to\nthat project over the past few months. It welcomes the\ncreation of that body, which will address a key area of\nUnited Nations activities and fill a clear institutional\ngap.\nOnce a conflict has ended, the main players -\ninstitutions, States and civil society - must work\ntogether to rebuild the country. The principal mission\nof the Peacebuilding Commission will be to bring those\nplayers from the fields of peacekeeping, humanitarian\naid, and development together to define joint strategies\nfor future action.\nThe Commission will include representatives of\nthe Security Council and the Economic and Social\nCouncil, as well as representatives of the principal\nfinancial donors and troop contributors. Switzerland\nbelieves that the main United Nations institutions\nconcerned should also take part in the deliberations.\nFor instance, it would be useful to include the\nChairman of the United Nations Development Group,\nthe Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs\nand the High Commissioner for Human Rights. It\nwould also be useful to bring on board, as needed,\nexperts from civil society, the academic world or the\nprivate sector.\nFurthermore, in the composition of the\nCommission, we need to ensure gender parity.\nPeacekeeping, humanitarian action and\ndevelopment are parallel activities and should not be\nrigidly divided into successive phases. In drafting its\nmandate, we should ensure that the Commission has\nthe ability to advise all the institutional actors\nconcerned at any step of the peace and reconstruction\nprocess.\nWe cannot speak of improving the efficiency of\nthe Security Council without discussing the\nimprovements that have to be made in the internal\nmanagement of the United Nations. The Summit\nOutcome document sets out the most urgently needed\nmeasures. They must be implemented without delay.\nIn that context, the three following factors must\nbe taken into account: first, the political competence\nand responsibility to decide the budget belong to the\nGeneral Assembly; secondly, the Secretary-General's\nmanagement authority must be extended; and, thirdly,\nthe internal oversight bodies must be strengthened.\nThe scandals that have tarnished the image of the\nUnited Nations in recent months underscore the urgent\nneed to strengthen the means as well as the financial\nand operational independence of the Office of Internal\nOversight Services. Furthermore, given the increasing\ncomplexity of their task, we must strengthen\ncooperation between the various oversight bodies,\nwhich are spread across the United Nations system. We\ninvite the Member States to support the enlargement of\nthe mandate of the Office of Internal Oversight\nServices, so that it is able to respond to requests for\nassistance from the specialized agencies.\nEspecially close to my heart is the importance of\ncombating cases of abuse and sexual exploitation\ncommitted in the context of United Nations peace\noperations. Such abuses are a grave violation of human\nrights and of the values that the Organization espouses.\nThey damage the credibility of the Organization and\nhinder the accomplishment of its missions on the\n19\n\nground. Switzerland advocates zero tolerance on this\nquestion. We strongly support the measures that have\nrecently been taken, in particular an increase in the\nnumber of resident investigators deployed on the\nground under the authority of the Office of Internal\nOversight Services.\nLast autumn, we embarked together on a major\nundertaking: adapting the multilateral system so that it\ncan address the new problems and challenges of the\ntwenty-first century, with a strengthened and more\nefficient United Nations at its centre. All reform\nrequires a subtle mix of ambition, realism and patience.\nWe have come part of the way. The basic itinerary was\nset at the summit. We must now pursue the path of\nreform, give shape to our early decisions, and resolve\npersisting differences. That has to be one of the main\nobjectives of the sixtieth session of the General\nAssembly, which has just begun."

        "file_text": "Allow me to congratulate\nthe President on his election to preside over the\nGeneral Assembly at its sixtieth session. I wish to\nassure him and his colleagues in the Bureau of my\ndelegation\u2019s support as he guides our deliberations.\nAllow me also to thank his predecessor, Mr. Jean Ping\nof Gabon, for his effective leadership at the fifty-ninth\nsession of the Assembly.\nIn addition, let me take this opportunity to extend\nmy country\u2019s deep sympathy and condolences to all\nGovernments and peoples that have suffered tragic\nlosses of life and destruction of property as a result of\nacts of terrorism and natural and man-made disasters.\nAt this general debate, I wish to address the\nAssembly on a matter of grave and immediate\nimportance to my country that has serious\nconsequences for the supremacy of international law\nand the maintenance of regional peace and security.\nAlmost four years after the decision of the\nEritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission, the dark\nclouds of war once again hang over my country. The\nlegal provisions of the Algiers Agreement, the legal\nunderpinnings of the independent arbitration process\nand the manner in which that process was established,\nand the unequivocal decision of the Boundary\nCommission are all too well known to be repeated\nhere. But allow me to cite the cardinal elements of the\nAlgiers Agreement to refresh members\u2019 memories.\nArticle 4.15 of the Algiers Agreement explicitly\nstates,\n\u201cThe parties agree that the delimitation and\ndemarcation determinations of the Commission\nshall be final and binding. Each party shall\nrespect the border so determined, as well as the\nterritorial integrity and sovereignty of the other\nparty.\u201d\nI must stress here that violation of the Agreement\nrepresents nothing less than blatant disrespect for the\nterritorial integrity and sovereignty of a United Nations\nMember State.\nIn the sixteenth report on the work of the\nBoundary Commission of February 2005, when the\nCommission was forced to close down its field offices\nin Eritrea and Ethiopia, it warned that,\n\u201c... the line of the boundary was legally and\nfinally determined by its Delimitation Decision of\n13 April 2002. Though undemarcated, this line is\nbinding upon both Parties, subject to the minor\nqualifications expressed in the Delimitation\n23\n\nDecision, unless they agree otherwise. Conduct\ninconsistent with this boundary is unlawful.\u201d\n(S/2005/142, Annex I, para. 33)\nThe Boundary Commission\u2019s decision should not\nbe tampered with. In that regard, article 4.2 of the\nAlgiers Agreement unambiguously stipulates that,\n\u201cThe parties agree that a neutral Boundary\nCommission composed of five members shall be\nestablished with a mandate to delimit and\ndemarcate the colonial treaty border based on the\npertinent colonial treaties (1900, 1902 and 1908)\nand applicable international law. The\nCommission shall not have the power to make\ndecisions ex aequo et bono.\u201d\nThe situation with which we are now confronted\nis therefore not an intractable border dispute requiring\nthe flexibility of the parties. It is squarely a grave\nmatter of an illegal and forcible occupation of the\nsovereign territory of Eritrea, a United Nations\nMember State, in clear violation of Article 2.4 of the\nUnited Nations Charter.\nEthiopia is not only occupying the village of\nBadme and other sovereign Eritrean territory; it also\ncontinues to build illegal settlements in those areas\nwith a view to, in the words of Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan, creating facts on the ground.\nEthiopia\u2019s unrestrained assault on the rule of law\nand the sanctity of treaty agreements will have severe\nconsequences not only for the people of the two\nneighbouring countries and the Horn of Africa but,\nthrough the bad precedent it sets, also for other\ncountries and regions, as well as for the credibility and\nthe legitimacy of the United Nations. Yet Ethiopia\u2019s\nacts of occupation continue to be tolerated by the\nUnited Nations and the other guarantors of the Algiers\nAgreement.\nParagraph 14 of the Agreement on Cessation of\nHostilities (S/2000/601, annex), which is an integral\ncomponent of the Algiers Agreement, specifies that\n\u201cOAU and the United Nations commit themselves\nto guarantee the respect for this commitment of\nthe two Parties until the determination of the\ncommon border ... This guarantee shall be\ncomprised of:\n\u201c(a) Measures to be taken by the\ninternational community should one or both\nof the Parties violate this commitment,\nincluding appropriate measures to be taken\nunder Chapter VII of the United Nations\nCharter by the United Nations Security\nCouncil;\u201d.\nThe United Nations and the African Union, as\nguarantors, are parties to the treaty. They have\nobligations to ensure implementation of the Algiers\nAgreement without preconditions. In the event that\neither Eritrea or Ethiopia fails to implement the\nAgreement, the United Nations is empowered by the\nAgreement to invoke Chapter VII of the Charter with\nrespect to the reneging party.\nThe treaty agreement must be enforced and the\nnumerous international instruments must be applied in\norder to end occupation and restore legality. The\nSecurity Council is mandated to maintain peace and\nsecurity, inter alia, by eliminating all forms of\noccupation. Unfortunately, the United Nations and\nsome members of the international community have so\nfar been advancing arguments that are irrelevant to the\nissue and are in contravention of international law in\norder to decline from taking the appropriate action.\nExisting and aspirant members of the Security\nCouncil \u2014 both permanent and non-permanent \u2014 must\nfully appreciate the fact that the cardinal principle of\nthe Charter is that membership of the Security Council\nmust be considered as service to humanity and the\ncause of peace and not as a means to promote and\nprotect their own interests or the interests of their\nallies. They must uphold the sacred trust to protect the\ncredibility and viability of the United Nations.\nRespect for international agreements has been,\nand must continue to be, the foundation of the principle\nof peaceful coexistence among nations. Any\ncompromise on that principle will result in the erosion\nof trust in the international system and will severely\ndamage the functioning of the United Nations.\nEritrea and Ethiopia may soon be dragged once\nagain into a new phase of armed conflict. Yet, there is\nstill an opportunity for a peaceful resolution if the\nUnited Nations honours its treaty obligations and\naddresses the one core issue, Ethiopia\u2019s illegal\noccupation of sovereign Eritrean territory. If the United\nNations fails to reverse the occupation, it will be as\nresponsible as Ethiopia for any renewed armed conflict\nand its consequences.\n24\n\nAt this juncture, I wish to remind the Assembly\nthat the United Nations has betrayed the Eritrean\npeople twice during the past 60 years. This would be\nthe third betrayal if it does not respect its treaty and\nCharter obligations by settling this occupation through\npeaceful means.\nIn conclusion, I wish to inform the Assembly\ncategorically that Eritrea is determined, and has the\nright, to defend and preserve its territorial integrity by\nany means possible."

        "file_text": "It is my unique pleasure to\npraise His Excellency Ambassador Dan Gillerman, my\nemissary to the United Nations, who is in the Chair at\npresent, upon his election to the post of Vice-President\nat this session of the General Assembly, and to wish\nhim much success.\nThese are optimistic times in the Middle East.\nThe iron wall that has defined Israel's relations with\nmost of the Arab and Muslim world for generations, is\ncoming down. Israel's contacts with Arab and Muslim\nStates are growing at a rate never seen before.\nCountries like Pakistan and others that in the past\nrefused to acknowledge our shared humanity, today\nextend their hands in friendship and recognition.\nRelations with key Muslim States, such as Turkey, are\nflourishing, while our peaceful ties with both Egypt\nand Jordan are constantly improving.\nHere in New York this week, I have had the\nhonour of meeting with more than 10 of my colleagues\nfrom the Arab and Muslim world - a number\nunthinkable just two years ago. Those meetings have\nbeen friendly, as is only fitting for countries that are\nnot in conflict - either territorially, or economically.\nIsrael welcomes this new readiness for contact, and we\nencourage our neighbours to build on the foundations\nthat we are now laying. Contacts between Israel and its\nArab and Muslim neighbours are good for the region,\nand good for peace.\nWe all share a common interest in building a\nregion of tolerance and cooperation - a region where\nthe moderates have the initiative, not the extremists,\nwhose violence has set the agenda for so long. Indeed,\nthose who genuinely wish to help the Palestinians and\nto bring them the benefits of peace and prosperity must\nrealize that building contacts and cooperation with\nIsrael is a crucial element in that process.\nPossibilities for cooperation abound. In fields as\ndiverse as agriculture, health, the environment,\ntransportation and electricity, the potential benefits of\nMiddle East regional cooperation are immense. Such\ncooperation can bring tangible and immediate\neconomic benefits, as Israel's improving relations with\nJordan and Egypt have shown.\nUnfortunately, many of our ties with the Arab and\nMuslim world are still deep in the shadows, hidden\nfrom the public eye. Today, I call on my Arab and\nMuslim colleagues to bring our contacts out into the\nlight of day, so that our peoples may understand our\n8\n\nshared desire to work with each other to bring peace\nand prosperity to our region. I call on the leaders of the\nArab and Muslim world, to join us in speaking to our\npopulations of peace rather than conflict, of reasons to\ncooperate, rather than reasons to boycott.\nIn November of this year, I will sit alongside my\nArab and Muslim colleagues at two international\ngatherings: the World Summit on the Information\nSociety, in Tunisia; and the summit of the Euro-\nMediterranean Partnership, in Barcelona. I call upon\nthe international community and my Arab and Muslim\ncounterparts to work together with us to ensure that\nthose meetings result in concrete projects that will help\nreinforce our peace efforts on the ground.\nThis is also the time for the international\ncommunity to renew its investment in the future of the\nMiddle East by reviving the multilateral track of the\nMiddle East peace talks.\nJust one week ago, Israel completed the\nevacuation of all Israeli communities in the Gaza Strip.\nEntire families - many of whom had lived and tilled\nthose lands for three generations - were called upon\nby their Government to leave and to begin their lives\nanew. Today, there are no more Israelis in Gaza. Israeli\nmilitary rule is now over. Responsibility for the affairs\nof Gaza and its residents is now in Palestinian hands.\nIsrael's actions have opened the door to a new future,\nand we invite our neighbours to walk with us together\nthrough that door.\nWe are committed to the road map, and we wish\nto get back to its full implementation. To do that, we\nneed a partner. A partner who is committed, as we are,\nto the peaceful resolution of our differences, and to the\ndemocratic and universal principles on which peace is\nfounded.\nIsrael attaches great importance to the Palestinian\nassumption of responsibility. In it lies the key to\nprogress towards peace. The transfer of responsibility\nfor Gaza provides the Palestinian side with the chance\nto take their fate into their own hands; an opportunity\nnot just to say that they want to govern, but to show\nthat they are ready and able to do so. Gaza, we hope, will\nserve as a model for how the Palestinian Authority can\nbuild a functioning, democratic and peaceful society.\nRecognizing the significance of this moment,\nIsrael is taking great pains to ensure that Palestinian\nleader Mahmoud Abbas is given every opportunity to\nestablish his authority. We want to promote conditions\nthat will benefit ordinary Palestinians, without posing a\nsecurity threat to Israel.\nIsrael has expressed its strong support for\ninternational aid and assistance for the social and\neconomic development of Gaza, and we are committed\nto facilitating those efforts. Constructive international\nengagement is crucial to the Palestinian Authority's\nsuccess. The international community's priority now\nmust be ensuring that the Palestinian Authority and its\ninstitutions can deliver the services and outcomes their\npeople and ours expect and deserve.\nEconomic reconstruction, of course, is not\nenough. The Palestinian Authority must also deliver on\nits commitment to end the campaign of terror against\nIsrael. For Israel, security is an issue on which we will\nnever compromise. We insist on the end of terror and\nthe dismantlement of its infrastructure, for the safety of\nour citizens, and so that our peace efforts can succeed.\nTurning Gaza into a model of success requires\nthat the Palestinian Authority act to promote and\nprotect democracy from its enemies. Here, as with\nsecurity, there is no room for discounts. Simply\nholding elections is no guarantee of moderation and\nresponsible government.\nTwo days ago in Gaza, the terrorist organization\nHamas held a rally of 10,000 armed men dedicated to a\nholy war against Israel. Like Al-Qaida and the other\norganizations in the global network of terror, Hamas\nseeks to destroy everything that the international\ncommunity and the moderates in our region seek to\nbuild: tolerance, democracy and peace. Hamas is\nresponsible for the deliberate murder of hundreds of\nIsraeli civilians, amongst them scores of women and\nchildren. Israel cannot and will not grant legitimacy to\nsuch an organization. We will not cooperate with its\ndesire to participate in the forthcoming Palestinian\nelections. And we call on the international community\nto make clear its own opposition to the inclusion of\nsuch terrorists in the democratic process. If Gaza is\nindeed to be the positive model we all wish to see, then\nit is those who promote dialogue, not violence, who\nmust be empowered.\nThe central threat to global security and to\nrenewed momentum towards dialogue and peace in the\nMiddle East today is Iran and its nuclear ambitions. As\nthe speech before this Assembly by the newly elected\npresident of Iran so clearly demonstrated, Iran's fanatic\nregime remains determined to proceed with its nuclear\nweapons programme. Israel welcomes the efforts of the\ninternational community - in particular France, Britain\nand Germany, backed by the United States - to deny Iran\nthe ability to terrorize the world with nuclear weapons.\nThe Board of Governors of the International\nAtomic Energy Agency is meeting at this very moment\nin Vienna to discuss this urgent matter. I call on them\nto stop this evil regime from acquiring nuclear\nweapons. The security and stability of the entire globe\nis at stake. This is why it is essential and urgent that\nthe Security Council take action. The international\ncommunity must rally as one and use all the means at\nits disposal to stop Iran before it goes nuclear. We must\nnot allow the fate of mankind to rest in the hands of the\ntyrants of Tehran.\nIn January of this year, this Assembly convened\nin special session to commemorate the Holocaust and\npay tribute to the brave soldiers and nations who freed\nEuropean Jewry and the world from the calamity of\nthat darkest nightmare. Israel commends the\ncommunity of nations for standing up in unison on this\nanniversary in commitment to the cry \\\"never again\\\"\u009d.\nWe commend the Secretary-General's and this\nAssembly's recognition that Holocaust remembrance\nmust be a universal commitment. Ultimately, it is only\nthe determined defence of the universal values of\ntolerance and the sanctity of each human life that will\nprotect us from tyranny and extremism.\nIn this spirit, Israel calls on the General\nAssembly to adopt a resolution initiated by Israel and\nother like-minded countries commemorating the\nHolocaust and calling for global educational efforts to\nensure that its lessons are learnt. Especially today, the\nday the world's greatest Nazi-hunter, Simon\nWiesenthal, has passed away, we are reminded that the\nHolocaust is passing from human memory to history.\nAs the generation of survivors leaves us, who will tell\ntheir story, if not us?\nThe special session to commemorate the\nHolocaust is only one example, of the welcome shift in\nthe attitude of this institution towards Israel. Our recent\nelection as Vice-President of this Assembly is another.\nI wish to commend the Secretary-General for his\nunique contribution to this positive trend. Israel's\nrelations with the United Nations are better today than\nthey have ever been. Nevertheless, they are still far\nfrom what they should be.\nI call on all the States gathered here to examine\nhow they too can contribute to promoting a more\nbalanced and constructive United Nations approach to\nIsrael. The United Nations cannot be true to its own\nlofty and universal principles, if it continues to waste\nscarce resources and serve as a forum of hostility and\nprejudice against one of its own.\nThe United Nations was born of the noble vision\nto bring the ideals of peace, security and human rights\nto all peoples. Sadly, reality of the United Nations\nremains far removed from the United Nations ideal.\nMajor reform is urgent and crucial. Israel joins our\nfellow Member States and their peoples in the desire to\nsee the United Nations fulfil the vision of its founders;\nto see the United Nations serving as a force for good in\nmeeting the many challenges of our age.\nIsrael seeks to take its rightful place as a country\nwith full and equal rights in this institution. We seek to\nrealize our full potential to contribute to the global\nagenda. This is why I have decided to present for the\nfirst time Israel's candidacy for membership on the\nSecurity Council.\nIt was the wisest leader of ancient Israel, King\nSolomon, who wrote, in the book of Ecclesiastes, \\\"For\neverything there is a season: a time to weep and a time\nto laugh; ... a time to love and a time to hate; a time\nfor war and a time for peace.\\\"\u009d This is a time for peace.\nA time for the leaders of the world to work together to\nbring the blessings of opportunity, peace and prosperity\nto all humanity.\nAs the Jewish New Year dawns upon us, I extend\non behalf of the Jewish people greetings of peace and\nbrotherhood to our Muslim and Arab neighbours and to\nall nations."

        "file_text": "My\nGovernment supports the report of the Secretary-\nGeneral, which reaffirms development, peace, security\nand human rights as fundamental to the well-being of\nany modern State. The Government of Saint Kitts and\nNevis steadfastly contends that there is an inherent link\nbetween poverty reduction, the promotion of human\nrights, economic development, security and good\ngovernance.\nRegrettably, the tendency has been to separate\nthem, in favour of what some call political imperatives.\nI daresay policies do not and cannot exist in a vacuum.\nPolitics is about people, and therefore national,\nregional or even international organizational policies\nmust be about people. There is stark evidence of this.\nThe political landscape reveals clear indications\nof the interconnectedness of the phenomena of poverty\neradication, security, economic development and\ngovernance. The task of governance is becoming\nincreasingly difficult in the face of growing\nunemployment, deepening poverty, escalating energy\nprices and a mounting cost of living. As a\nconsequence, we have witnessed social dislocations\nand civil disquiet. The fruits of globalization still do\nnot grow among the world\u00eds poorest, who have become\nfurther marginalized and blame their Governments,\nwhich, despite their best efforts, are often relegated to\nthe margins of political discourse and economic\nactivities.\nSome citizens have become more vocal and more\nopen in their distrust of Government policies that fail\nto deliver the promises of democracy and\nglobalization, fail to reduce poverty and unemployment\nand fail to improve their standard of living. The\neconomic and political rift between rich and poor\nnations is steadily becoming a deeper divide as\nmistrust continues to characterize relations between the\ndeveloped and the developing countries.\nUnderstandably, small countries \u00f3 despite\nlimited and diminishing resources \u00f3 are expected to\nparticipate equally in the fight against the social\nscourges that confront us. But that dramatically\nreduces our ability to make new and necessary\ninvestments in socio-economic development. It is\nwithin that context that we urge Member nations to\nsubstantively support the Millennium Development\nGoals. We also urge them to partner with us,\nrecognizing our vulnerabilities to natural disasters and\nother external economic factors, and recognizing the\nneed for preferred and differential treatment in trade\nand access to markets in developed countries. We urge\ndeveloped countries to implement policies that do not\n2\n\nundermine our efforts or reverse the gains that we in\nsmall developing countries have made. We call for\nequity and for a willingness to live and let live.\nDespite overwhelming odds, however, the\nGovernment of Saint Kitts and Nevis stands ready to\ndo its share. At the base of our efforts and policies is\nthe fundamental importance of strengthening the rights\nof the child. We believe that promoting the rights of the\nchild goes to the heart of full and effective protection\nof human rights. We also firmly believe that by making\nsure every child in Saint Kitts and Nevis has access to\nprimary and secondary education, to potable water and\nto health care, we are creating healthier, better adjusted\nand productive adults whose rights will have been\nnourished and enshrined in the policy orientation and\ndevelopment agenda of our proud country.\nIt is generally accepted that the right to\ndevelopment is also a fundamental right that national\nGovernments have a primary responsibility to ensure.\nLong before the Millennium Development Goals were\nformally elaborated and adopted by the community of\nnations, that fundamental right was emphatically\nunderstood by the Government and the people of Saint\nKitts and Nevis. As a point of reference, in this year's\nHuman Development Report issued by the United\nNations Development Programme, Saint Kitts and\nNevis was ranked 49 out of 177 countries on the\nHuman Development Index \u00f3 the second-highest\nranking in the Caribbean region and, indeed, among the\nhighest in the Latin American and Caribbean region.\nThe report reflects the reality in Saint Kitts and Nevis,\nwhere there is an adult literacy rate of 97.8 per cent, a\nlife expectancy rate of 70 years - which needs upward\nrevision - and a combined primary, secondary and\ntertiary school enrolment ratio of 89 per cent. The\nreport underscores our commitment to gender equality,\nstarting with current parity in enrolment levels among\ngirls and boys in school at both the primary and the\nsecondary levels. The report also confirms 98 per cent\naccess to safe water and sanitation. In the field of\nhealth, it notes a 99 per cent rate of immunization of\ninfants against tuberculosis and measles in Saint Kitts\nand Nevis.\nThe Pan-Caribbean Partnership to combat\nHIV/AIDS (PANCAP), established by the Caribbean\nCommunity (CARICOM), has proved to be a useful\nand pragmatic vehicle for collective action and results.\nIn Saint Kitts and Nevis, our own fight against\nHIV/AIDS uses that particular model. PANCAP has\ndistinguished itself and has been identified as a best-\npractice model. We are therefore now pursuing policies\naimed at universal access to treatment and care and at\nending discrimination and the stigmatization of those\npersons affected by HIV/AIDS, while at the same time\ncontinuing our public education initiatives on\npreventing the spread of the virus.\nA per capita income of more than $7,000 places\nus squarely among upper-middle-income countries. We\nthank the United Nations for recognizing our efforts,\nwhich are the result of policies engineered to ensure\nthe development of the individual despite the obstacles\nthat we face as a small economy. They also reflect the\ncommitment of my Government to ensuring the\nprotection of the rights of our children and their role in\nour country\u00eds future.\nThat, however, is only one side of the coin. The\nachievements to which I referred come at an enormous\ncost - a cost that represents an enormous burden - to\nour people. The past decade has been particularly\ndifficult for Saint Kitts and Nevis. Our small island\nState continues to be especially vulnerable to natural\ndisasters, external economic fluctuations and policies\nbiased against small economies such as ours. My\ncountry has experienced back-to-back hurricanes,\nlandslides and floods, at a cost of more than half a\nbillion dollars. We have been forced to direct more and\nmore of our scarce resources towards recovery and\naway from development.\nThe experience throughout the Caribbean region\nis very similar. It was just in July this year that our\nsister CARICOM nation of Grenada again suffered\nserious devastation, caused by Hurricane Emily, on the\nback of last year's devastation brought by Hurricane\nIvan. The Maldives, another small island sister nation,\nhas made pleas for a delay in the process set in motion\nfor its graduation from the list of least developed\ncountries, owing to the tsunami. We specifically\nsupport the Maldives' request.\nIn addition to the cost of recovery, escalating\nhigh prices and the cost of food imports, Saint Kitts\nand Nevis, as an emerging tourist destination, has\nfaced the prohibitively high cost of implementing\nsupplementary security measures since 11 September\n2001. To further compound that grave situation, the\nrecent rulings of the World Trade Organization relative\nto trade preferences have dealt a most significant blow\n3\n\nto small economies in the Caribbean and therefore\nthreaten to unravel their economic base.\nIn the case of my country, after centuries of sugar\nproduction and sales to the European market - which\nhave been a cornerstone of our economic support and\nour social stability - we have been forced to close that\nindustry, which finally succumbed to continuous losses\nand escalating debts. Saint Kitts and Nevis can no\nlonger compete profitably in a world market that is\ncharacterized by engineered low prices for sugar and\nby the unfair trading practices of some countries. That\nhas severe implications in terms of unemployment,\nsocial dislocation, psychological distress and the\ndramatic loss of urgently needed foreign-exchange\nearnings.\nWe have tried to prepare for such an eventuality\nthrough a process of economic diversification, but\nsupport from the international community has not been\nforthcoming. The cost of borrowing, the removal of\ngrant financing from the menus of international\nfinancial institutions and the annual recovery costs\nfrom catastrophic hurricanes have become more and\nmore onerous. Creative legal policy initiatives,\nespecially in the international financial services sector,\nhave been challenged and undermined by some\ndeveloped countries.\nIn an attempt to fulfil the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals by 2015, my Government has also\npursued policies to stimulate and facilitate private-\nsector-led growth by investing in physical\ninfrastructure and human resource development. But\nwe need international political and economic support.\nThe Secretary-General underscored that threats to\npeace and security represent different things to\ndifferent countries. If we intend to promote collective\nsecurity, there must be an appreciation of and\nsensitivity to this diversity among countries. In the\nsame way, we are called upon to aid in the fight against\nterrorism, drug trafficking, transnational organized\ncrime and other scourges that threaten international\npeace and security in the more advanced countries. It is\nnot unreasonable, therefore, to expect reciprocity of\nsupport in fighting the almost intractable problems that\nconfront small States. To address these urgent\nchallenges, we call on the international community to\nsupport and contribute to the full, timely and effective\nimplementation of the Mauritius Strategy for further\nimplementation of the Programme of Action for the\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates, which we consider a very important mechanism\nfor achieving the Millennium Development Goals.\nMy Government was heartened by the Secretary-\nGeneral's proposal for the establishment of a Human\nRights Council. We also support effective change in the\nUnited Nations, which also means that the Security\nCouncil must evolve to reflect current world realities.\nThe United Nations must also play a more enhanced\nrole in development, and the concerns of small island\ndeveloping States must be given greater attention\nwithin this Organization. Small States can offer best-\npractice models and creative ideas from which the\ninternational debate on development, peace, security\nand human rights could benefit.\nWe encourage greater transparency in the\ndeliberations of critical organs of the Organization and\ngreater opportunities for small States to be represented\nin the decision-making processes of these organs.\nThe people of Taiwan continue to be excluded\nfrom the brotherhood of nations, which was created to\nrepresent the hopes and aspirations of all peoples. My\nGovernment reiterates its call for the people of the\nRepublic of China, Taiwan, to be consulted, effectively\nrepresented and invited to participate in the critical\ndebates on world peace, human security, development\nand human rights. I believe that we would have failed\nto promote human rights effectively if, through\npolitical exclusion, generations of people are relegated\nto the margins of such important issues and the forums\nthat facilitate their discussion.\nI remain cautiously optimistic about the future.\nOn the one hand, Governments have rededicated\nthemselves to the struggle to build a world free from\nwant and fear and with the freedom to live with\ndignity. In addition, we are poised to reform the United\nNations in the hope that it can play a more effective\nrole in this ever-changing world.\nHowever, the tenor of last week's summit\nsuggests a strong possibility that some developed\ncountries may yet renege on those commitments, which\ncould further erode developing countries' efforts to\neradicate extreme poverty, generate employment,\npromote human security and narrow the development\ngap between richer and poorer countries.\nWe still have an opportunity for an enhanced\nglobal partnership to turn commitments into action and\n4\n\nsecure a future for our children, a future that is free\nfrom want of the basic necessities, free from fear of\nviolence with guarantees of protection of the right to\nlive in dignity. Only then will we build and reinforce\nthe foundation of democracy, enhance collective\nsecurity and jumpstart a process where globalization\nbecomes a vehicle for change among all of the world's\npeoples."

        "file_text": "I bring warm greetings\nfrom the people of the Republic of Vanuatu.\nAt the outset, I wish to congratulate you, Sir, on\nyour assumption of the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its sixtieth session. I assure you of my\nGovernment\u2019s support for the work of the United\nNations under your stewardship. I take this opportunity\nalso to acknowledge, with deep admiration, the sterling\ndedication of your predecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, who\nmeticulously steered the work of the fifty-ninth session\nto its conclusion. I would like also to pay tribute to the\nSecretary-General for his active role and for his\nresilience in continuing the work of United Nations\nreform.\nWe come to the Assembly annually to reaffirm\nour faith and confidence in the purposes and principles\nof the Charter. This year is especially important, since\nleaders are meeting five years after the Millennium\nSummit to take stock of the Millennium Development\nGoals (MDGs). Although the outcome document has\nbeen adopted, we are extremely disappointed with the\nomission of numerous paragraphs. The farcical ending\nof the negotiations resulted in a dilution of the quality\nof the final document. The United Nations must, in\nfuture, avoid becoming a rubber stamp for the\npowerful.\nThe world is at a crossroads. Our meeting is\ntaking place at a critical juncture. Civil and political\nstrife, wars, poverty, diseases, famine, drought, natural\ndisasters, terrorism, minority oppression and\nenvironmental degradation are affecting the lives of\nmillions of people. The sacrilege of such human\nsuffering is unbelievable and painful to bear.\nThe United Nations must be able to do more and\nmust respond more promptly to such situations. It must\ndo so by improving its preventive-capacity\nmechanisms so as to minimize the devastating impact\non peoples\u2019 livelihood and to ease their suffering.\nWe must ask, therefore, whether we are really\ndoing enough for our peoples. Is this all about\nimpressive speeches, rhetoric and pretentious,\ngrandiose plans that detract from the real issues that\nneed addressing? My Government is disillusioned by\nthe lack of genuine goodwill and support that is being\noffered to the United Nations.\nI would like to reiterate my Government\u2019s\nmessage to the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth\nsession.\n\u201cThe Achilles heel of the current structure is the\nimbalance of power in the United Nations system.\nIt has become so chronic that it has weakened\n2\n\nthe multilateral focus, cohesiveness and\ninternationalism of the United Nations.\u201d\n(A/59/PV.14, p. 25)\nThe principles of democratization and good\ngovernance, so actively advocated and championed by\nsome Members, must be reflected in the reorganization\nand decision-making process of the United Nations\nsystem.\nIf we are to get back on track, the United Nations\nmust be rejuvenated. It must be reinvigorated so that it\ncan reassume its legitimate and central responsibility in\naddressing the causes of conflict, maintaining peace\nand security and promoting the development agenda.\nBut if it is to do that, the Organization\u2019s decision-\nmaking and other processes must be transparent and\ntruly democratized. Some of us preach strongly on\ndemocracy the world over, yet are unable to practice\nand enforce those values when it really matters. We are\nnow on the threshold of a new beginning, so let us not\nallow this new opportunity to pass.\nAt the summit, I said that tolerance and respect\nmust form the nucleus for any reform of the United\nNations. Only by enforcing those values will we come\nto realize the true meaning of justice, equality and\nhuman rights. The diversity of the developing world\npresents huge challenges for us all. However, the\nstrong nations must be able to muster the political will\nto effect changes. The big players need to transform\ntheir philosophy and their mindset, because they have\nbeen hindrances to the creation of an equitable system\nof good governance within multilateral organizations\nsuch as the United Nations.\nThe United Nations remains indispensable for\nfuture peace and prosperity. Globalization has brought\nnations together; we are interlinked and\ninterdependent, and that requires global cooperation\nand governance from all responsible Members of the\nOrganization. Understandably, there are vested\ninterests held by the powerful. That requires genuine\ncooperation and goodwill, and those interests and the\nrole of the United Nations must converge in order to\nensure compatibility with the international legal\nframework.\nMy Government fully supports efforts to reform\nthe United Nations system so as to ensure a stronger\nand more effective Organization. In this context, my\ndelegation shares the views of other delegations on the\nneed to revise the membership of the Security Council\nso as to ensure fair representation of Member States\nwithout affecting the authority of the Council. A more\nrepresentative Council will bring openness and\ntransparency, create confidence and improve\nunderstanding and cooperation. The restructuring of\nthe Security Council membership is long overdue.\nDiversity is essential in that respect.\nI agree that terrorism is one of three main\nscourges confronting humankind today \u2014 the others\nbeing poverty and disease. My Government condemns\nthose deliberate callous and inhuman acts that have\ntaken the lives of innocent people. There is no just act\nof terrorism. We agree that we must work collectively\nin eliminating that deadly menace from the face of the\nEarth. But the fight against terrorism must be balanced\nand targeted so as to ensure that resources are equitably\nchannelled into meeting the Millennium Development\nGoals.\nThe global economic situation today\ndiscriminates against many of the developing\neconomies. Unfair trading practices and the imposition\nof intrusive policies on national economies affect our\neconomies by opening them up to unfavourable\nconditions that only favour the stronger nations. Such\nnegative actions marginalize nations and peoples.\nMarginalization then breeds and incites resentment,\nfuelling the hatred that eventually creates fertile\ngrounds for extremism to grow and flourish.\nWe have agreed on the establishment of the\nPeacebuilding Commission, which will also enable\nmore work to be done to combat the spread of\nterrorism, in particular by identifying areas where\ninternational support and understanding are required.\nAlthough we are injecting many resources into curing\nthe problem, we are not really preventing it from\nemerging. The world needs a spirit of pacifism if real\npeace is to prevail. In order to achieve that, the United\nNations needs moral leadership \u2014 leadership that\nfocuses on security and dignity for the human person.\nThe post-Monterrey Conference era poses\nextreme challenges for the economic survival and\nsocio-economic stability of many of the small island\ndeveloping nations like Vanuatu. We urge our\ndevelopment partners to honour their commitments to\nreach the 0.7 per cent target for official development\nassistance (ODA). In this context we welcome the\ncommitments from the United States of America\nthrough the Millennium Challenge Account. We also\n3\n\nwelcome commitments by Qatar, the European Union\nand the People\u2019s Republic of China. Furthermore, we\nlook forward to the coming to fruition of initiatives by\nFrance and other countries.\nThe pivotal role of trade as the engine for\neconomic growth cannot be overemphasized, but, as\nmany of my colleagues from the small island States\nand the least developed countries have stated, market\naccess and special preferential treatment must be\nprovided.\nFurthermore, many of us are restricted by\ninflexible and immoral conditions that inhibit new\nfinancing and development initiatives. We continue to\ncall for trade and investment and labour export to help\nour economies to grow.\nMy Government\u2019s national development priorities\nfocus on building the productive sector. The\nGovernment\u2019s prioritized action agenda highlights the\npolicy areas that we believe to be essential in meeting\nour development objectives. It is the catalyst for\nVanuatu\u2019s medium- to long-term strategic planning,\nwhich emphasizes the need to empower our rural\npopulation through infrastructure- and capacity-\nbuilding initiatives. The development policy\nframework is consistent with achieving the MDG\ntargets, and the development strategy is being refined\nto give equal consideration to our other international\ncommitments and the Pacific Plan. We appeal to our\ndevelopment partners to assist us in the effective\nimplementation of our strategy.\nA fundamental lesson to be drawn from Vanuatu\u2019s\nreforms is that they have been forced from outside,\nwithout being adapted to our national circumstances.\nFrom Vanuatu\u2019s perspective, externally driven reforms\nmust be buttressed by an equal partnership that\nrespects local traditions and cultures and the rights of\nall citizens, without disturbing the essential uniting\nmechanisms of society that have successfully held us\ntogether. Vanuatu embraces democracy and the\nconcepts of good governance and transparency, but\nthose far-reaching principles must be tailored to\ntraditional systems without affecting their relevance\nand significance.\nWith regard to the environment, we urge our\ndevelopment partners to actively support the effective\nimplementation of the Mauritius Strategy. The\nchallenges confronting island States are ominous, and I\nrepeat the call that more recognition should be given to\naccommodate our natural characteristics and\nvulnerabilities. We also urge States that have not yet\ndone so to act responsibly by ratifying the Kyoto\nProtocol as soon as possible.\nOn the question of the shipment of radioactive\nmaterials and hazardous waste, improvements in\nsafeguards and assurances should not have to await a\ncalamity. Preventive measures must be the course of\naction to take. The risks posed by the forces of nature,\ncoupled with increased terrorist activities, are too\ngrave for enhanced safeguards to deal with. The world\nwould be better off banning such shipments rather than\nendlessly trying to perfect safeguards approaches that,\nat best, only limit such serious risks. Complacency\nwould be our greatest mistake.\nThe Charter of the United Nations espouses the\nprinciples that continue to guide the Organization\u2019s\nefforts in the process of self-determination. That right\nmust be progressively advanced. The United Nations\nmust be consistent and not lose sight of the\nfundamental right of self-determination for those who\nare working their way out of the shackles of colonial\nrule. Ruling and sovereign authorities must ensure that\nthe process remains on track.\nWhere the United Nations has failed to fully\ncomply with the appropriate legal procedures, it is only\nproper that such instances be adequately addressed to\nallow justice to prevail for the victims. Circumventing\nthe issue only exposes the dark history and raises\nserious questions about the credibility, relevance and\nintegrity of the United Nations. Only in an open and\nconsistent manner can we redress past failures and\nprovide a stronger basis for the advancement of United\nNations ideals.\nSuch contradictions simply make a mockery of\nthe fundamental principles of human rights and self-\ndetermination clearly enshrined in the Charter of the\nUnited Nations. How can we call for respect for human\nrights, yet blatantly ignore the pleas of the millions\ncalling out for justice? The United Nations cannot, and\nmust not, continue to turn a blind eye to its own past\nfailures. It is morally, politically and legally wrong to\ndo so.\nThe continuing disputes raised over the\nimplementation of United Nations resolutions are clear\n4\n\nexamples challenging the integrity and validity of the\nUnited Nations. We cannot ignore the calls of the West\nPapuans in their quest for justice. We urge the United\nNations to act responsibly in revisiting the case of West\nPapua. However, we are encouraged by the Indonesian\nGovernment\u2019s efforts to address alleged human rights\nabuses. We also welcome decisions empowering West\nPapuans to manage their own affairs in collaboration\nwith the central Government.\nThe United Nations must also explore various\navenues to end the economic embargo imposed on\nCuba. Countless resolutions have been adopted to no\neffect, and the Cuban people continue to be\nmarginalized in the multilateral trading system. This is\na critically challenging responsibility. Some may see it\nas an improbable task, but it must be addressed with\ngenuine support and goodwill on the part of the\nrelevant authorities and sovereign States.\nIn conclusion, I hope that the Creator\u2019s wisdom\nwill prevail as we continue our journey. Despite all our\ndifferences and diversities, human security for all is\nour main goal and should remain the focus of the\nUnited Nations agenda. The cardinal question is, will\nMembers allow the United Nations to undertake\nserious reforms in meeting the challenges ahead? And\nwill the Organization be capable of guaranteeing a\nfuture of peace and prosperity that is not reserved only\nfor the big players but will be enjoyed by all? Will the\nUnited Nations become a juggernaut for the stronger\nnations? A famous biblical verse reminds us about the\nfundamental wisdom of building on rock instead of\nsand. The future remains in our hands, and the\nRepublic of Vanuatu will play its part.\nMay our beloved almighty Creator bless us all."

        "file_text": "Let me begin, Sir,\nby extending my sincere congratulations to you on\nassuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its\nsixtieth session. Well aware of your experience and\ndiplomatic skills, I have every confidence that under\nyour able leadership, we will achieve great results\nduring this important session, which marks the sixtieth\nanniversary of the United Nations. I would also like to\ntake this opportunity to pay tribute to your predecessor,\nHis Excellency Mr. Jean Ping, whose tireless work\nenabled the membership to successfully prepare for the\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting held last week. My highest\ntribute also goes to the Secretary-General, His\nExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan, for his unqualified\ndedication to our world body.\nThe leaders of the world gathered here last week\nin the largest summit meeting of States in history and\ndemonstrated their collective political will to overcome\nthe challenges of the present and to build a future of\npeace and prosperity for all humankind. They\nreaffirmed their commitment to achieving the\nMillennium Development Goals. They also\nunderscored the vital role of the United Nations for our\ntime and gave guidance on steps to reform the\nOrganization. The outcome document (resolution\n60/1), adopted in the greatest spirit of cooperation and\ncompromise, may not be everything to everyone, but it\nis the guideline for action that our leaders have given\nus. The task now is to implement it.\nThe work will require determined action by all.\nSuccess will be ensured only when each and every one\nof us strives to look beyond the immediate horizon. We\nmust commit ourselves anew to realizing the ideal that\ninspired the founders of the Organization 60 years ago,\nthat of building a peaceful and prosperous world in\n13\n\nwhich all peoples live together in harmony, free from\nwant and fear.\nCertainly, with 30,000 children dying of hunger\nor preventable diseases every day, the world lies far\nfrom that ideal today. Everyone agrees that we have the\nmeans to lift the whole world out of poverty and\nunderdevelopment. We just need to effectively put\nthose means to good use. Thus, the concrete, action-\noriented recommendations adopted by our leaders on\npartnership, financing, trade, debt relief and other\naspects of development are greatly welcome. We must\nfully and speedily implement them so that, by the year\n2015, most of the world\u2019s impoverished are freed from\nhunger and poverty, the spread of HIV/AIDS is halted,\nprimary education is made universal for all children,\ngender equality takes firm root in all societies and the\nglobal partnership to achieve those and other\ndevelopment goals is in full operation.\nIn particular, we welcome the timetables many\ndeveloped countries have presented for reaching the\ntarget of 0.7 per cent of gross national income for\nofficial development assistance (ODA) by 2015. The\nRepublic of Korea is committed to doing its share.\nDespite the internal and external economic challenges\nthat my country has faced since the financial crisis of\n1997, we have continued to increase development\nassistance year after year, doubling our ODA between\n2000 and 2004. We now plan to double it again by\n2009.\nMy Government is also seeking other ways to\nbuild partnerships with developing countries. Utilizing\nour resources and expertise in information and\ncommunication technology, we are working with the\nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the\nPacific to build and host an Asia-Pacific training centre\nfor information and communication technology, with\nan initial outlay of $10 million. The centre will\ncontribute to reducing the digital divide and enabling\ndeveloping countries to make the most of information\nand communication technologies for development.\nKorea is also dedicated to good governance,\nwhich is an essential ingredient of development. Thus,\nwe are working with the Secretariat to establish a\nUnited Nations governance centre in Seoul, as a\nfollow-up to the Sixth Global Forum on Reinventing\nGovernment, which my Government hosted earlier this\nyear.\nHealth is another area that requires our collective\naction. In our globalized, connected world, infectious\ndiseases can spread with terrifying speed, with no\nregard for borders. They can become pandemics that\nthreaten the development and the security of affected\ncountries and regions. Here, too, the world must act\ntogether. For its part, my Government is contributing to\nthe Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and\nMalaria.\nWe are also vigorously supporting the activities\nof the International Vaccine Institute in Seoul, which\nstrives to develop and disseminate vaccines most\nneeded in the world\u2019s poorest regions. And we have\ntaken part in the launching of the International\nPartnership on Avian and Pandemic Influenza,\nannounced by President Bush of the United States in\nhis speech here last week (see A/60/PV.2).\nAs world leaders noted, the threats to peace and\nsecurity around the world today are increasing,\ninterconnected and global in scale. They require of us\nan urgent, collective and more determined response.\nTerrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction (WMDs) and transnational crime are grave\nthreats that can be most effectively addressed when\ncountries act in concert under the United Nations\nbanner.\nCruel and inhuman acts of terrorism targeting\ninnocent lives, as witnessed in Iraq, the United\nKingdom and elsewhere, are heinous crimes for which\nthere can be no justification. The Republic of Korea is\nalready a party to all 12 international anti-terrorism\nconventions in force. Last week, I signed for my\nGovernment the International Convention for the\nSuppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism as soon as it\nwas opened for signature. We are strongly committed\nto preventing and eradicating international terrorism in\nall its forms. We will continue to actively participate in\nthe efforts to conclude a comprehensive convention on\ninternational terrorism as soon as possible.\nThe proliferation of WMDs is another pressing\nsecurity concern. The prospect of WMDs falling into\nthe hands of terrorists is more alarming and real than\never before. The Republic of Korea is fully committed\nto the non-proliferation of WMDs. Thus, we are\ndismayed that the outcome document of the High-level\nPlenary Meeting is silent on this vital issue. We very\nmuch hope for an early opportunity to redress this\nomission. In the meantime, my Government will\n14\n\ncontinue to press for the strengthening of the nuclear\ncompliance and verification system. We call for the\nuniversal adoption of International Atomic Energy\nAssociation (IAEA) additional protocols, the\ndisarmament and non-proliferation of biological and\nchemical weapons and the full implementation of\nSecurity Council resolution 1540 (2004).\nIn facing the threats of terrorism or WMDs, or\nany traditional threats, the Security Council must be\nmade to act more quickly and efficiently to situations\nthat arise when the elements of a threat become reality.\nAt the same time, the Security Council must exercise\nwith only the utmost prudence its prerogative to\nsanction the use of force. In that regard, we should\nbuild upon the agreement reflected in the outcome\ndocument on the establishment of principles for the use\nof force. That would lead to the strengthened relevance\nand efficiency of the Security Council and of the\ncollective security system embodied in the United\nNations as a whole.\nPeacekeeping has been an important part of this\nsystem. Indeed, the success of the peacekeeping\nmissions in such places as Timor-Leste has been one of\nthe proudest achievements of the Organization in\nrecent years. However, there have been failures, as\nwell as cases of fragile peace being overtaken by the\nresumption of conflict. Shameful misconduct by some\npeacekeeping operation personnel in certain missions\nhas added to the sense of disappointment. Obviously,\nwhat is needed is a more structured and extensive\nmechanism to make the peace more durable and\nconsolidate the grounds for post-conflict\nreconstruction. In this regard, my Government\nwelcomes the decision taken at the High-level Plenary\nMeeting to establish a Peacebuilding Commission.\nWe hope to play our part, so that effective\npeacebuilding can become an important part of the role\nof the United Nations to ensure peace and security\naround the world. This is very much in line with our\npast and current participation in efforts to restore peace\nin many challenged areas of the world, including in\nIraq, where we are helping the Iraqi people to build a\ndemocratic and prosperous country.\nI would like to take this opportunity to address\nthe current situation regarding the North Korean\nnuclear issue. After a 13-month hiatus, the fourth\nround of the six-party talks commenced on 26 July,\nbroke off for a recess and resumed last week. During\nthe talks, all participants agreed on the goal and\nprinciples of the denuclearization of the Korean\npeninsula. They conducted serious, in-depth\nconsultations to make substantive progress towards\nrealizing that objective. For our part, the Republic of\nKorea has made an earnest effort to expedite the talks\nand move them towards a resolution, including through\nthe offer to supply 2 million kilowatts of electric power\nto the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea directly,\naddressing one of the most pressing problems it faces.\nAs we are gathered here, the resumed fourth\nround is under way to adopt an agreement on the\nprinciples for the resolution of the North Korean\nnuclear issue. Once adopted, the agreement will be a\ncrucial step towards the denuclearization of the Korean\npeninsula and will launch discussions on an action plan\ntowards a peaceful resolution of the North Korean\nnuclear issue.\nA strategic decision by the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea to dismantle all nuclear weapons\nand nuclear programmes would be met with economic\nand energy assistance and security assurances. North\nKorea must return to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and comply\nwith the full scope of IAEA safeguards so as to restore\nthe trust of the international community. The doors\nwould then open to its right to peaceful use of nuclear\nenergy. We urge North Korea to take this road.\nThe Republic of Korea is committed to promoting\nhuman rights as universal values that should be\nguaranteed to all. Based on our own experience of the\npast decades, we know that development and security\nare on shaky ground without full respect for the human\nrights of all. We thus welcome the reform initiatives to\nstrengthen the United Nations human rights system and\nwholly support the creation of a Human Rights\nCouncil. We would have preferred to see stronger\nlanguage and greater detail about the composition,\nmandate and functions of the Council spelled out in the\nsummit outcome document. Working closely with other\ndelegations, we hope to promptly engage in active\nconsultations so that the Council can be established\nand can start functioning as soon as possible.\nThe Republic of Korea is also committed to\ndemocracy at home and abroad. We are an active\nparticipant in the Community of Democracies and have\nsupported the International Conference of New and\nRestored Democracies. We have pledged to contribute\n15\n\nto the United Nations Democracy Fund, and we will\nremain a strong supporter of the continuing mission of\nthe United Nations to nurture and strengthen\ndemocracy and human rights around the world.\nRespect for human rights and the rule of law are\nindispensable for the preservation of peace and\ncooperation among nations. Mass killings, genocide\nand other grave infringements of human rights are\nthreats to peace and stability and must not be let pass\nwith impunity. The principle of the \u201cresponsibility to\nprotect\u201d, as discussed during the High-level Plenary\nMeeting, underscores the responsibility of the\ninternational community to lend assistance to States in\nupholding their solemn obligation to protect their\ncitizens. We support the continued deliberations by\nMember States to reach agreement on the responsibility\nto protect. This would certainly form the backbone of a\npreventive mechanism against gross violations of\nhuman rights.\nEarlier this month, Hurricane Katrina devastated\nNew Orleans and the surrounding areas in the United\nStates, causing massive casualties and tremendous pain\nand suffering for the victims and their families. On\nbehalf of the Government and people of the Republic\nof Korea, I would like to extend our deepest\nsympathies and condolences to those affected.\nComing less than a year after the massive tsunami\nthat struck many countries of South-East Asia, Katrina\nonce again mobilized the international community in\nbringing emergency relief to the victims. It also\nunderscored the urgency of establishing effective\nmechanisms to cope with natural disasters around the\nworld, including the importance of early warning\nsystems. With those lessons in mind, natural disasters\nwill be a primary issue for debate at the Asia-Pacific\nEconomic Cooperation summit meeting, which my\ncountry is hosting in Busan in November. Meanwhile,\nwe reaffirm our support for the reform of United\nNations humanitarian aid agencies to enhance their\nefficiency and effectiveness in helping countries to\nrecover from disaster and rebuild their capacities for\nsustainable development.\nWe mark the sixtieth anniversary of the United\nNations with mixed feelings. On the one hand, there is\nmuch hope. It is the hope of the entire international\ncommunity for the United Nations to prevail over the\nnew challenges of the twenty-first century and to\nassume a more central role in strengthening peace and\nsecurity, promoting prosperity and spreading\ndemocracy and human rights around the world. On the\nother hand, there is widespread disappointment. It has\nbecome painfully clear that the United Nations as it\nstands today is unfit to carry out the demands of these\ncomplex times. Between the hope and the\ndisappointment, there is much uncertainty. But of one\nthing I am certain: all of us gathered here are united in\nthe conviction that the hope must triumph over the\ndisappointment; that we must rise to the occasion and\nmake the United Nations fit for the twenty-first\ncentury.\nIndeed, our global body must be strengthened\nwith far-reaching reforms that are in step with the\ndynamic challenges of a borderless and fluid world.\nThose reforms should be comprehensive \u2014\nencompassing all the elements of the system \u2014 and\nrealized in such a way as to give all Members, large\nand small, a sense of ownership in the process and the\noutcome. Faithful to the guidance provided in the\noutcome document of the High-level Plenary Meeting,\nand in synergistic cooperation with one another, all\nstakeholders \u2014 Member States, the Secretariat, the\nfunds and programmes, specialized agencies and other\nconstituents of the United Nations system \u2014 must\nseize this opportunity for renewal and revitalization.\nIndeed, we must engage in a genuine exercise in\nmultilateralism to strengthen our global body.\nReform of the Security Council must be pursued\nto enhance its accountability, transparency and\nefficiency. My delegation believes that increasing the\nnumber of non-permanent seats on the Council, with no\naddition of permanent seats, is the best way to foster\nbroad-based consensus on this vital issue.\nThe Secretariat has long served the collective will\nand interests of the Member States of the United\nNations. The contributions of those who have served in\nthe United Nations system with dedication and\nprofessionalism should be highly praised. However, the\ncredibility and integrity of the system have been\ndamaged by recent revelations of mismanagement and\ncorruption. The maladministration of the oil-for-food\nprogramme, as Mr. Volcker stated in delivering his\nfourth report to the Security Council, should not be\nseen as a lone case but as symptomatic of deep-seated\nsystemic issues of an Organization designed for\nsimpler times. Reform, as he further stated, is urgent.\nWithout bold reforms to restore the trust and support of\nthe global community, enhance efficacy and improve\n16\n\nthe morale of staff, the system will not be able to live\nup to the growing expectations of the twenty-first\ncentury.\nUnderscoring the vital importance of this issue,\nthe High-level Plenary Meeting has fully endorsed the\nmanagement reform initiatives taken by the Secretary-\nGeneral. With the active support and encouragement of\nMember States, those initiatives should quickly bear\nfruit, providing strengthened accountability and\noversight, higher performance and ethical standards for\nstaff, and greater authority and responsibility for the\nSecretary-General as the chief administrative officer of\nthe Organization.\nThe challenges facing the United Nations today\nare daunting. Some may find them insurmountable. But\nwe are a country that was born and developed\nalongside the United Nations over the past 60 years,\nreceiving particularly active assistance from it in\nearlier decades. We have full confidence in the future\nof the Organization. Now a maturing democracy that\nupholds human rights, an emerging donor that seeks to\ndo its share in helping others, and a staunch advocate\nof peace and effective multilateralism, the Republic of\nKorea is fully committed to bringing greater vitality\nand reliability to the United Nations.\nAt the High-level Plenary the leaders of the world\ngave us guiding words for making the United Nations a\nmore effective and relevant instrument for realizing the\naspirations of the global community in the twenty-first\ncentury. We must not let those words remain just\nwords. Let us proceed with vigour and dedication to\nput them into action."

        "file_text": "A few weeks ago, a young\nMuslim lawyer in Singapore told me about a recent\nexperience he had had in an East Asian airport. Unlike\nothers holding Singaporean passports who were\nclearing immigration, he was told to stand aside. When\nhe asked the reason, the immigration officer muttered\nthat there were \\\"too many Mohamads\\\" that day.\nSmiling to himself, the Singaporean waited patiently\nand peered around, wondering how long he had to wait.\nThe officer then warned him to stand still. He suddenly\nfelt a chill along his spine.\nMuslims all over the world are being profiled by\nsecurity agencies. Since 11 September 2001, Muslims\ntravelling to Western countries have been subject to all\nmanner of interrogations and searches. Although the\nprofiling is now done more subtly now, it continues.\nAnd in East Asia, profiling is increasing.\nWhen sudden threats appear, perhaps it is natural\nto expect a certain overreaction from the affected\ncommunities. After Pearl Harbour, all Japanese people\nliving in America became suspect, including those born\nthere. Many were interned. By today's standards, that\nwas an affront. But at that time, it was widely felt to be\na necessary precaution. Shocked by that reaction,\nJapanese-American leaders set out to prove their\nAmericanness, for example by forming the Japanese-\nAmerican 100th Infantry Battalion, which fought\nheroically in the European theatre.\nThe travails of the Japanese-Americans were not\nunique. Tribalism is a basic human instinct. We may\nproclaim that all men are brothers, but we reflexively\ndistinguish degrees of closeness. Divisions of race,\nlanguage, culture and religion run deep in human\nsociety and emerge under stress. The ascendancy of the\nWest in the past few centuries created tremendous\nstress in non-Western communities, upsetting all\nrelationships and giving rise to a variety of responses,\nall of which sought to reconcile each community\u00eds\nsense of self with the needs of a Western-defined\nmodernity. In Asia, for example, the re-emergence of\nChina and India on the global stage has been a\nprolonged struggle of reconciling transformation with\ntradition.\nThat is the broader historical context against\nwhich the relationship between Muslims and non-\nMuslims in the world must be viewed today. It is a\nsubject that concerns us all deeply in the United\nNations.\nThere are two evolving developments which feed\non each other. The first is change within Islam itself;\nthe other is the relationship between Muslims and non-\nMuslims in different parts of the world. Both require\nour close attention.\nThe response of the Islamic world to the\nchallenge of modernization will affect the development\nof the entire world in this century. In some ways, it is\ncomparable to that of the Chinese response to\nmodernization, and it will probably take much longer.\nThe decline of the Ottoman Empire in the nineteenth\ncentury took place at about the same time as the\ndecline of the Qing Dynasty in China. Both collapsed\nat the beginning of the twentieth century. After many\n8\n\ntwists and turns, China has finally re-emerged onto the\nglobal stage with a bright future ahead of it.\nThere are about as many Muslims in the world as\nthere are Chinese. In contrast to China, however, the\nIslamic world is unlikely to re-coalesce in the\nforeseeable future. Once Ataturk refused the caliphate\nand with iron determination started reforming Turkish\ninstitutions on the Western model, the Islamic world\nlost its centre. From then on, different Islamic societies\nexperimented with different approaches and moved in\ndifferent directions. It has been a mixed story.\nThe different responses of Muslim societies to the\nchallenge of modernization are accompanied by a great\nideological debate among political and religious\nleaders. Good governance has become a major issue,\nwith calls for greater transparency and more\ndemocracy. In this debate, it is natural that some\ngroups should look back to a romanticized period when\nthe Islamic world was united and pristine and seek its\nre-establishment in the twenty-first century. Such were\nthe ideas of the Muslim Brotherhood, which emanated\nfrom Egypt at the beginning of the twentieth century.\nThe ideology of that movement continues to inspire\nIslamic groups in various parts of the world today. If\nonly Muslims were to abide strictly by the teachings of\nIslam, there would be no corruption, Governments\nwould be just and effective and Islamic societies would\nbecome strong again.\nIn many Islamic countries at various times, these\ngroups have been suppressed for being subversive, and\nthose who funded them were thought to have ulterior\nmotives. This struggle for the soul of Islam is an\nongoing process. However, it is not a struggle unique\nto Islam. For more than 200 years, Europe was\nbloodied by religious wars, which ended only with the\nTreaty of Westphalia in 1648, which created the system\nof modern European States. But even then, there was\nstill religious persecution, which led many Europeans\nto flee to the New World. In the twentieth century, the\nsoul of Europe was torn by communism, fascism and\nanti-Semitism. It was precisely to overcome those\ndivisions that the European Union was established by\nstages, creating the longest period of peace on that\ncontinent.\nHow Islamic society evolves in the coming\ndecades is mainly for Muslims to decide. Generally\nspeaking, non-Muslims would have no standing to\nparticipate in this debate but for two factors which\nhave become critical and which have strategic\nimportance for us all.\nThe first factor is the emergence of the ideology\nof Al-Qaida and its sister organizations, such as Al-\nJama\u00eda al-Islamiyah. This ideology is a malignant\nmutation of the ideas associated with the Muslim\nBrotherhood and other groups that argued for a return\nof Islamic society to an idealized past. It takes those\nideas to an extreme and preaches hatred against non-\nMuslims worldwide, justifying violence against\ninnocent bystanders even if they are Muslim. The\nsuicide bomber has become a potent weapon in its\narmoury. The followers of this ideology will not\nhesitate to use weapons of mass destruction if they can\nget their hands on them. We have a duty in the United\nNations to join in the global war against them.\nThe second factor necessitating the involvement\nof non-Muslims in the Islamic debate is the growing\nMuslim diaspora in many non-Islamic countries. As\nminority communities, Muslims living in countries like\nFrance and Germany, for example, have to accept\ncertain limitations in the practice of their religion. With\ngrowing religiosity in recent years, issues like the\nwearing of the headscarf have surfaced. What\nconstitutes a reasonable compromise varies from\ncountry to country. For example, Singapore allows\naspects of sharia law to apply to Muslims, including\nMuslim men being allowed four wives, although only\nunder stringent conditions. It would be hard for non-\nMuslims to accept this in Europe.\nThe fact is that while some human values are\nuniversal - and we should find more of them - many\nare not. We have to accept this diversity in the world.\nA greater tolerance of diversity in the world would\ncreate better conditions for peaceful cooperation\nbetween Muslims and non-Muslims and would\ninfluence the debate within Islam itself.\nIf non-Muslims tar all Muslims with the brush of\nterrorism and non-Muslim majority communities treat\nminority Muslim communities as problem\ncommunities, the future will be troubled for all of us.\nIn such a climate, Muslim extremists will gain\nascendancy, and the terrorists will find fertile ground\nfor recruitment everywhere.\nIt is ridiculous to argue that terrorism is inherent\nin Islam. To do so is to play into the hands of the\nterrorists. That such views are increasingly being\nexpressed in reputable journals and newspapers is\n9\n\ntroubling. Of course one could find blood-curdling\npassages in the Koran and the Hadith, but these\npassages must be read in context. We find similar\npassages too in the Old Testament. As we would not,\ntherefore, argue that terrorism is inherent in Judaism\nand Christianity, so we should not make Islam the\nproblem. That would be a big mistake. There were\nperiods in history when Islamic society was\nconsiderably more advanced than Western society.\nEqually, it would be a big mistake for Muslim\nleaders to allow Muslim extremists to make claims on\nbehalf of Muslims worldwide without contest. This\ncauses non-Muslims to suspect that Muslims are\ngenerally in sympathy with them. To be sure, there are\ngenuine grievances that have to be addressed, like\nPalestine, Chechnya and the future of Iraq, but these\nare issues that are more political than religious. The\nstrategy of the extremists is to polarize Muslims and\nnon-Muslims worldwide, thereby widening their base\nof support. Muslim leaders have to counter this\nstrategy. It is also essential for them to reach out to\nnon-Muslim audiences as well. The recent bombings in\nLondon led to a strong anti-Muslim backlash at the\ngrass roots that threatened the fabric of British society.\nThis in turn put pressure on Muslim leaders in the\nUnited Kingdom to condemn the terrorists in clear\nterms.\nIn the end, the fight against the terrorists has to\nbe won within Muslim communities themselves. It is a\nbattle for hearts and minds that requires Muslims to\nwork together with non-Muslims against a common\nenemy.\nWe have to make a concerted effort to understand\neach other better. With globalization, all societies have\nbecome multiracial and multireligious to a greater or\nlesser extent. The pluralism we hold as an ideal in the\nUnited Nations is not a choice; it is a vital necessity.\nIn 1998, at its fifty-third session, the General\nAssembly declared in resolution 53/22 that 2001 would\nbe the United Nations Year of Dialogue among\nCivilizations. In 2001, at the fifty-sixth session, the\nGeneral Assembly adopted the Global Agenda for\nDialogue among Civilizations (resolution 56/6). And\nthis year the United Nations sponsored numerous\nmeetings on interfaith dialogue. A few months ago, the\nfirst Asia-Middle East Dialogue was held in Singapore\nto promote greater understanding between two\nimportant regions of the world.\nWe need to translate our declarations of principle\ninto everyday language and into practice. Are there\nlimits to what politicians can say to win votes? Should\nreligious leaders be allowed to preach hatred, even in\nclose confines? What do we teach our children in\nschool? What does all this mean to the immigration\nofficer at the airport who does not know that\nMohammed is the most common name in the world?\nSingapore, a cosmopolitan city-State with a\nmultiracial and multireligious population, is\nparticularly vulnerable. We have experienced ugly\nracial and religious riots before and have learned that\nracial and religious harmony should never be taken for\ngranted. It has been necessary for the Government to\ninvolve itself in many aspects of ordinary life,\nincluding discouraging Christian missionaries from\ntargeting Muslims for conversion, stopping mosques\nfrom sharply turning up the volume of their\nloudspeakers when calling the faithful to prayer,\nlimiting the size of joss sticks which Buddhists and\nTaoists burn for their rituals and arresting those who\nincite racial and religious hatred. What may appear to\nbe a small thing to one community can be a serious\nprovocation to another.\nThis has become the world we live in. We cannot\nignore the diversity around us in our everyday life or\nthe tribalism which is in our nature. We will continue\nto disagree on many things such as the nature of\ndemocracy, gender relationships, the death penalty,\nstem-cell research and what we can or cannot eat. The\nmoment we dismiss those differences as unimportant,\nor lightly condemn those who disagree with us, the\ntrouble begins.\nTherefore, as we strive to achieve the Millennium\nGoals in the United Nations - and they are worthy\nGoals - a key task for us is to accept, even celebrate,\nthe differences that divide us in our daily lives. To\nparaphrase Pope John-Paul II, it is only because we are\nmany that we are one, and the United Nations\nexpresses that ideal."

        "file_text": "On behalf of my delegation, I wish to express my\nsincere congratulations on your election as President of\nthe sixtieth session of the General Assembly. May I\nwish you and the members of the Bureau full success\nand assure you of my delegation\u2019s full support and\ncooperation.\nI would like to pay tribute to your predecessor,\nMr. Jean Ping, who during his mandate substantially\ncontributed greatly to reviving discussion of United\nNations reform and activities for development and\ninternational cooperation. I would also like to\ncongratulate warmly the Secretary-General for his\ncourageous initiatives to give our Organization new\nmomentum and further the fundamental ideals and\nprinciples of the United Nations.\nMr. Hachani (Tunisia), Vice-President, took the\nChair.\nThis session is of special importance for the\nMember States and the Organization itself because it\ntakes place at a time when States are asked to speak\nabout thorough-going reforms of the Organization in\norder to permit it to deal with the triple challenge of\ndevelopment, peace and security and the promotion\nand defence of human rights. The summit just held on\nprogress in achieving the Millennium Development\nGoals (MDGs) was not as successful as we had hoped\nit would be. We can be gratified, however, that we\nwere able, despite the difficulties, to adopt a final\ndocument reaffirming the Goals and the Monterrey\nConsensus on Financing for Development, adopted in\n2002. For the first time, we were also able to condemn\nall acts of terrorism, regardless of motive, of who\ncommits them and of where they are committed. My\ndelegation hopes that we will, during this sixtieth\nsession, be able to adopt a general, comprehensive\nconvention on international terrorism and set up a\nHuman Rights Council.\nEfforts to achieve greater justice in international\neconomic relations have not been as successful as we\nhad hoped. The gap between the developed and\ndeveloping countries is widening. The economies of\nthe developing countries are deteriorating and, in some\ncases, their citizens are becoming pauperized on a\nbroad scale. The countries of the third world are being\nthwarted in their efforts to develop, labouring under the\nweight of indebtedness, the volatility in commodity\nprices, barriers to access to the markets of developed\ncountries, inadequate official development assistance\nand scarce financial resources, not to mention the\nconflicts and various pandemics afflicting our\npopulations. I would like to point out that indebtedness\nis a form of bondage and indebted economies are\neconomies that function under constraints. Finding a\ndurable, innovative and daring solution to this problem\nis one of the prerequisites for any resumption of\ngrowth, not only in heavily indebted countries, but in\nmost developing countries. This is why my delegation\nwelcomes the recent decision to cancel the debt of 18\ndeveloping countries, while we deplore, as other\ndelegations have, the limited scope of that decision. We\nwould like it to be extended to all African countries.\n5\n\nThe effective liberalization of international trade\ncan generate sufficient resources for African\neconomies and thus fund various education, health and\ninfrastructure programmes. Unfortunately, customs and\ntrade barriers that bear down on African exports, as\nwell as subsidies to agriculture in the Western\ncountries, cancel out the development efforts of the\nAfrican countries that are already labouring under the\nburden of debt. Debt alone consumes four times more\nbudget resources than those we need for education and\nhealth. That is why I would like to associate my\ncountry\u2019s voice with the call for justice and equity in\nseeking sustainable solutions to problems arising from\nthe multilateral trade system. Here, I draw particular\nattention to access for our products to developed\nmarkets and the subsidies and other forms of domestic\nsupport granted by the wealthy countries to their\nfarmers, which impair the competitiveness of our\nproducts on world markets.\nThe great challenges facing the world cannot be\nmet unless we do it in the overall context of sustained\nsolidarity. That is why C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is glad to see new\ninitiatives put forward by Member States to mobilize\nadditional funds or increase funds aimed at fostering\ndevelopment in poor countries. We congratulate the\nproponents of those initiatives. We would like, inter\nalia, to mention the allocation of special drawing rights\nand coordinated measures to encourage voluntary\nprivate contributions, the international financial facility\npresented by the British Government, which has been\nsupported by some developed countries, and a\nreduction in the price of transferring funds from\nmigrants to their countries of origin. In some States,\nthose remittances constitute 65 per cent of all\ndevelopment assistance. We would also like to mention\nthe contribution of a solidarity surcharge on air tickets\nin favour of sustained development, a proposal\npresented by Germany, Brazil, Chile and France in\nSeptember 2004 that seeks to combat hunger, poverty\nand fund sustainable development, in particular as\nregards combating HIV/AIDS and other pandemics.\nWe hope that such new sources of financing along\nwith, and as a complement to, traditional financing\nresources will effectively contribute to combating\npoverty in the world and bring us closer to attaining the\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs).\nAttaining the MDGs is a source of hope for the\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, which has for some years now been\ntrying to emerge from the socio-political crisis that has\nravaged our country. In the first national Ivorian report\non the MDGs, which was issued in 2003 based on the\ndata provided in regard to each of the eight\ndevelopment goals, it clearly appears that the Goals\nwill be difficult to achieve by 2015 if the international\ncommunity does not continue to provide financial\nsupport, including the cancelling of our considerable\nforeign debt. So, I would like to reiterate the appeal of\nthe Government of National Reconciliation to the\nUnited Nations and to development partners, both\nbilateral and multilateral, to help us more in facing the\nnew challenges of rebuilding the country, in particular,\nreintegrating internally displaced persons and\nrehabilitating our infrastructure, be they educational,\nhealth-related, cultural, or environmental.\nNo country can develop and protect its population\nfrom need, if it cannot take effective measures against\nthe diseases devastating it, such as malaria,\ntuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and other contagious diseases,\nwhich pose a serious threat to the entire world,\nparticularly the poor countries, and which represent\nobstacles to the realization of development goals. That\nis why my delegation feels that the international\ncommunity should intensify and coordinate its efforts\naimed at providing access to generic medicines for\npatients in developing countries, including\nantiretrovirals. When the time comes, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\nwill fully support the world initiative to be launched in\n2006 aimed at strengthening the health systems in\ndeveloping countries by 2010.\nAs regards human rights, my delegation is\ngratified by efforts made by the United Nations to\nbring about respect for the human person and to\ncombat impunity in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. We particularly\nappreciate the visit by the High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights last July, the visits by various\ncommissions to investigate the situation and the visits\nby Special Rapporteurs. The Government is still\nwaiting to hear the results of the latest international\ninvestigation, carried out by the United Nations from\nJuly through September 2004, covering important\nissues such as impunity, serious violations of human\nrights, international humanitarian law and mercenaries.\nTrafficking in children has become an increasing\nproblem in Africa and particularly in the countries of\nWest Africa. West African leaders are aware that only\nby fighting together against this shameful trafficking\nwill they be able to overcome it. That is why, in\naddition to the bilateral agreements already established\n6\n\nand at the initiative of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, nine West African\nStates, meeting on 27 July 2005 in Abidjan, adopted a\nmultilateral cooperation agreement to combat\ntrafficking in children in West Africa. This multilateral\nlegal instrument contains binding obligations on all the\nStates Parties and specific obligations for countries of\norigin and destination of children who are the victims\nof child trafficking.\nAs regards the resolution of conflicts on the\nAfrican continent, there has been notable progress\nthroughout the year. We are encouraged by positive\ndevelopments in Sudan, Burundi, Liberia, Sierra Leone\nand the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which\nincludes, in some cases, the satisfactory holding of\nelections. Nevertheless, despite progress in conflict\nsettlement, we must remain aware of the fact that the\nsituations, generally speaking, remain fragile. The\ninternational community must therefore act more\nresolutely to help countries in conflict tackle the\ngenuine causes of the conflict, while combating\npoverty, consolidating democratic institutions and\npromoting those countries\u2019 economic and social\ndevelopment.\nWhile we can legitimately rejoice at the\nresolution of certain conflicts, we must note that,\ndeplorably, certain situations are still far from settled.\nThis is the case in my country, which has not yet found\nthe road to peace, despite the many efforts made by the\ninternational community through various initiatives\nover the past three years, in particular the Linas-\nMarcoussis, Accra and Pretoria Agreements. The\nUnited Nations, through the Security Council, has\ninvested a great deal of energy in strengthening the\npeace and reconciliation process in my country. We\nwelcome all the measures taken thus far by the\nSecurity Council and are particularly encouraged by\nthe fact that more blue helmets have been sent and that\nMr. Antonio Monteiro has been appointed as the\nUnited Nations High Representative for the elections in\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\nI would like to avail myself of this opportunity to\nthank the international community, in particular\nPresident Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and other\nregional and subregional heads of State and\norganizations, for their readiness to help and for their\nuntiring efforts to bring about a peaceful solution to the\nIvorian crisis. As I stand here before you, the process\nis practically at a deadlock and the presidential election\nplanned for 30 October will not be held on that date.\nHolding free, fair and transparent elections within\na reasonable time frame remains the main objective to\nbe attained if we are to have sustainable peace in C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire. Nevertheless, the following priority tasks\nmust first be carried out: disarming and dismantling of\nmilitias throughout the country; the disarmament,\ndemobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants,\nfollowing an initial pre-assembly; the restoration of\nState administration throughout the national territory;\nthe identification of electors and the establishment of\nelectoral rolls \u2014 and, in that connection, the soon-to-\nbe-operational Independent Electoral Commission is a\nbright note; and the provision of funds for\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration and the\nelectoral process.\nDespite the current stagnation in the peace and\nreconciliation process, the Ivorian Government\nimplores the international community not to be\novercome by disappointment, discouragement or\nirritation. We invite it to participate more intensively\nand resolutely in finding solutions to the fundamental\nproblems of the crisis, which, alone, can guarantee the\nreturn of a lasting and stable peace in my country and\nreconcile all our sons and daughters.\nIn that regard, the Security Council must remain\nactively seized of the case of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, which\nmust be kept on its agenda. In the same connection, the\nUnited Nations should, in my delegation\u2019s opinion,\nseriously consider imposing sanctions on all persons\nwho are guilty of serious human rights violations,\ninciting hatred and violence, obstructing the peace\nprocess or violating the arms embargo throughout the\ncountry.\nThe Ivorian people need peace. We realize that\nthis is primarily the responsibility of the Ivorian people\nthemselves. Nevertheless, without the steadfast support\nof the international community, peace will be difficult\nto achieve. Therefore, I call upon our common\nOrganization to shoulder its responsibilities and\nbecome even more involved and more active in our\nnational peace and reconciliation process. That is its\nmandate and the goal of its commitment under Chapter\nVII of the Charter."

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure to address this\nforum and to share with the General Assembly my\nGovernment\u2019s views on issues of the highest relevance\nto our Organization. But first of all, let me express our\nsolidarity and heartfelt condolences in connection with\nthe loss of life and the damage caused by Hurricane\nKatrina in our host country \u2014 the United States of\nAmerica.\nI wish to congratulate Mr. Jan Eliasson of\nSweden on his election to the post of President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its sixtieth session. I am sure that\nunder his able guidance we will make substantial\nprogress in implementing the decisions adopted just a\nfew days ago by the heads of State. At the same time,\n7\n\nlet me congratulate Mr. Jean Ping of Gabon, President\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session, for a\njob well done. I would like also to commend Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan for his skilful leadership of the\nOrganization in what has turned out to be a very\ndifficult year.\nThe High-level Meeting and the outcome\ndocument reaffirmed our commitment to the core\nvalues and principles of the United Nations Charter\nand to effective multilateralism, and it identified areas\nfor future action. The summit has also provided us with\na unique opportunity to explore new ways to adapt the\nUnited Nations to new realities.\nThe Organization was created 60 years ago.\nHowever, the vision of its founders \u2014 to bring about a\nmore secure, democratic and developed world \u2014 needs\nto be pursued more vigorously today. As a wise man\nonce said, we should be both speakers of words and\ndoers of deeds. I am happy that we all agree that we\nneed a reformed, more effective and more credible\nUnited Nations.\nThe high-level segment made a fair assessment of\nthe progress achieved in the implementation of the\nMillennium Declaration and of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), as well as of the\noutcomes of the major United Nations conferences and\nsummits.\nThe assessment by the world leaders was both\nrealistic and upbeat. They boldly assessed the status of\ncurrent and longstanding problems \u2014 extreme poverty,\nhunger, disease, the HIV pandemic, child mortality,\nenvironmental degradation, lack of good governance,\ndisregard for human rights and the rule of law \u2014 and\nshowed strength and resolve in defining steps and\nactions to be taken or reinforced in order to meet our\ntargets, and they were cautiously optimistic about the\ndeadlines to be met.\nToday we live in a world in which our peoples,\nnations and Governments depend on each other. We\nmust recognize that in this interdependent and\nglobalized world, all threats are threats to us all. No\none is immune to them, nor does any single State have\na cure.\nBut how should we proceed? I believe that many\nof us share the view that, in fact, we already have a\nmultiplicity of documents and agreed positions, as well\nas many political commitments and adopted\ndeclarations. Much has been achieved by the United\nNations, and we are proud of that. My own country has\nalso benefited from United Nations efforts \u2014 the\nUnited Nations engagement in the first-ever preventive\ndeployment mission. That was a good example of the\neffectiveness of joint efforts and cooperation.\nHowever, turning to the main questions, we have\nfound that we are still lagging behind on some of the\nissues to which have so strongly committed ourselves.\nOne of the avenues for moving forward involves\nimplementation and visibility. These are not new\nwords. Many promising United Nations ideas and\nprojects have been sidelined due to inappropriate\nfollow-up and inadequate implementation measures, or\nsimply due to insufficient support and funding by the\nMember States. We should avoid such pitfalls.\nThe sooner the effects of the implementation of\nour decisions become visible, the greater international\npublic support will be, and the greater the chances of\ncreating a better world for us and for generations to\ncome. But we should not shy away from sharing that\nresponsibility with all those who can assist us, with\nthose who have the capacity to help promote and\nimplement our goals. There are many positive\nexamples in recent memory, beginning with the greater\ninvolvement of regional organizations, the civil sector,\nnon-governmental organizations, the private sector, and\nso on. Let us make greater use of them. We can only\nbenefit.\nOn this occasion, I will not dwell in detail on the\nprocesses of United Nations reform and the\nstrengthening of the Organization. President\nCrvenkovski elaborated Macedonia\u2019s position on those\nissues here last week.\nMacedonia also aligns itself with the European\nUnion statement. Nevertheless, allow me to say a few\nwords on some current United Nations reform issues of\nparticular interest to us. Macedonia supports the view\nthat human rights, the rule of law and democracy\nshould be given a prominent place in the United\nNations reform proposals. Freedom from fear could be\nsaid to sum up the whole philosophy of human rights,\nas former Secretary-General Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld put it.\nIt has long been a strong position of my country\nthat respect for those principles, coupled with\ndevelopment, is the best conflict-prevention measure\nand a vital precondition for peace and prosperity. For\nthat reason, we see great merit in establishing a\n8\n\npeacebuilding commission. I trust that a balanced\ngender representation on the commission will only lead\nto its better functioning and give added value to\npeacebuilding. Furthermore, the establishment of the\nhuman rights council must be seen as a powerful tool\nto regain the values and principles originally envisaged\nby the creation of the United Nations.\nWe are very satisfied that the concept of\n\u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d has found its well-deserved\nplace for the first time in a United Nations document\nand welcome its endorsement.\nThe democracy fund is a noble idea which\ndeserves our full creative engagement.\nTerrorism has turned into the plague of modern\ntimes. Since the last session of the General Assembly,\nmany atrocious terrorist attacks have taken place\nthroughout the world. Our firm commitment to fighting\nterrorism should engender more joint activities and\nactions. Our struggle must be based on full respect for\nhuman rights because it is human rights that terrorists\nare afraid of and seek to undermine. We need further\nconsolidation of the global anti-terrorist coalition and\nstrengthened cooperation with regional organizations.\nThe United Nations is at the core of activities in\nthe area of counter-terrorism. The Republic of\nMacedonia supports the elaboration of the United\nNations comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy, as\noutlined by the Secretary-General in Madrid. I would\nlike to appeal to the Member States to agree on the\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism.\nThis year, we took a significant step by adopting the\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of Acts\nof Nuclear Terrorism, which we signed on 16\nSeptember. The victims of recent acts of terrorism\npainfully remind us to move forward.\nFrom the very beginning, the Republic of\nMacedonia has been a part of the international anti-\nterrorist coalitions in Iraq and Afghanistan. Peace and\ndemocracy-building in those two countries remain among\nthe key challenges to the international community and to\nthe Iraqis and Afghans themselves. I would like once\nagain to reiterate our support for their efforts to rebuild\ntheir countries and to create better lives for their people.\nToday, my country, Macedonia, is a functional,\nmulti-ethnic democracy. Over the past three years, we\nhave launched and carried out a large number of reform\nprojects. Our hard work has brought us closer to the\nEuro-Atlantic structures. We have developed genuine\npartnerships with the Union and the alliance. We\nexpect the European Commission to give a positive\nevaluation of our achievements and Macedonia to be\ngranted the status of candidate at the December 2005\nsummit. I firmly believe that the time has come for our\nEuropean perspective to turn into a European reality. As\nfor the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, we expect the\ninvitation to join at the next enlargement summit.\nThe Government has recently announced its\neconomic programme, primarily aimed at increasing\neconomic growth and reducing unemployment. At the\nsame time, it has intensified the development of a\nclimate favourable to foreign investment and safe\nbusiness conduct. As a critical complement to\neconomic reforms, Macedonia is also focused on\nreform of the judiciary and the fight against organized\ncrime and corruption. We have set a goal to do better.\nThe reforms are not easy, but we are firm in our\nresolve to implement them.\nRegional cooperation has become a major\ncharacteristic of the foreign policies of all countries in\nSouth-East Europe. We have been patiently building a\nnew spirit of cooperation, while at the same time\nlearning the true meaning of developing relations based\non mutual trust and solidarity. That includes our\nbilateral relations, as well as a large number of regional\ninitiatives. Recognizing that reality and the need to\ncooperate and to build good-neighbourly relations and\nmutual confidence was not an easy undertaking, but it\nis the only way ahead. We take pride in seeing the\nregion move forward. The Republic of Macedonia will\ncontinue even more vigorously to pursue such policy.\nThere is no alternative to dialogue and all outstanding\nregional issues should be resolved in that manner.\nIn closing, I am confident that our deliberations\nwill contribute to better and faster follow-up of the\ncommitments agreed at the High-level Plenary\nMeeting. I believe that we can soon come up with\nimplementation mechanisms that will give life to what\nwas conceived by our leaders. There were many\ndebates, some of them very contradictory, showing\nhow different we are. But diversity should not prevent\nus from having a common vision and goals for a better\nfuture. That is why we are here at the United Nations."

        "file_text": "I should like first of all to\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to preside over\nthe General Assembly at this important session, at\nwhich we pledge our full cooperation. I also wish to\nthank your predecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, for having\nconducted the proceedings of the fifty-ninth session so\nefficiently and for having spearheaded the vital\nnegotiations on the outcome document adopted by the\nsummit.\nI must also express my gratitude to the\nSecretary-General for his leadership, especially his\nefforts to reform the United Nations so as to make it\nmore responsive to the dynamics and demands of the\ncurrent world.\nThe founding fathers of the United Nations\ndreamed of an organization that would be able, in the\nwords of the Charter, to promote social progress and\nbetter standards of life in larger freedom. It was in\npursuit of that dream that the General Assembly at its\nfifty-fifth session adopted the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). That was a milestone in\nthe realization of one of the purposes and principles of\nthe Charter \u2014 to achieve international cooperation in\nsolving international problems of an economic, social,\ncultural or humanitarian character, to promote and\nencourage respect for human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms for all and to be the centre for harmonizing\nthe actions of nations in attaining those common ends.\nA great deal has been done since the Millennium\nSummit in 2000, at both national and international\nlevels, to attain the objectives that we set ourselves in\nthe MDGs. Asia and Latin America have progressed\nwell, while Oceania and Africa have not been quite as\nsuccessful. On the whole, Africa\u2019s performance has\nshown mixed results. Some regions, especially in\nNorth Africa, have registered positive achievements,\nwhile others have faired negatively.\nIn a globalized world, the future and welfare of\nall are interlinked. Poverty in one part of the world\nthreatens peace and security globally. Equally, an\nepidemic in a remote village in Africa threatens the\nhealth of the prosperous individual in New York. In\nessence, we all share a common fate. The international\ncommunity has therefore a self-interested obligation to\nhelp Africa emerge from its current predicament. Let\nthe wealth of some enhance the welfare of all.\nUganda hopes that the World Summit Outcome\n(resolution 60/1) marks a real commitment to\n23\n\nimproving the welfare of the world\u2019s poor and to\nmaking the United Nations the vanguard for the\naspirations of all. We hope that it will not suffer the\nfate of the commitments that preceded it.\nPeace and security is a prerequisite for\ndevelopment. One of the reasons why Africa has failed\nto register substantial achievements with regard to the\nMDGs is lack of stability, peace and security.\nConflicts, wars and civil strife afflicting the continent\nhave acted as disincentives to development. The 1885\nBerlin Conference split Africa up, without due regard\nto the long-term interests of the African peoples. The\nGreat Lakes region found itself at the confluence of all\nthe colonial Powers. That confluence created a political\nand social situation that has, over the years, proved\ndifficult to manage. It is a complex situation, with both\npositive and negative tendencies. The cold war further\nexacerbated the situation as the East battled the West\nfor influence. Indeed, former Secretary-General Dag\nHammarskj\u00f6ld lost his life in the context of that\nexplosive political mix.\nAs Africa struggles to set its house in order,\nUganda has identified four main causes of conflict on\nthe continent which negative forces have exploited for\ntheir own ends. They include parasitic vested interests;\nsuperficiality and obscurantism in identifying and\ndealing with those parasitic interests and their effects\non a particular country or group of countries; weak and\ndisoriented local leadership; and, finally, the\npre-industrial characteristics of Africa.\nThose are the core causes of conflict, although\nthere are others. Paying clear and careful attention to\nthem could provide a vital springboard from which\nlong-term solutions could be found.\nThe conflict in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo and the Great Lakes region in general is caused\nby a combination of those factors. Those with the most\nto lose in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are\nmarginalized, while real issues of statecraft have been\npushed to the periphery. No attention is being given to\ncreating institutions and infrastructure that can sustain\nthe State.\nThe integration of armed factions into one single\nnational armed force is half-hearted. How can a State\nexist without the minimum pillars of support, such as\nan army capable of defending its territorial integrity?\nThe view that justice should precede integration\nis wrong, in our opinion. While justice is important, it\nis Uganda\u2019s belief that it should not take precedence\nover the integration of armed groups. We should\nintegrate all factions, and then seek to punish those that\nare guilty of any offences later. Uganda advocates the\nconcept of provisional immunity or immunit\u00e9\nprovisoire, as it is referred to in Burundi. On the other\nhand, equal attention needs to be given to issues of\ndevelopment, rehabilitation and the recovery of the\neconomy. A growing economy is necessary for\nsustainable peace. What we are witnessing today is a\nrush to elections and political agendas without due\nregard being given to the institutions and infrastructure\nnecessary for the long-term sustainability of peace. We\nhave travelled this road before, with disastrous\nconsequences. Let the immediate past of the continent\nbe a guiding lesson for all of us.\nThe Lusaka peace accord provided a strong\nmechanism enabling the region and the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo to play complementary roles in\nthe peace process. Unfortunately, it has been\nabandoned. The central problem of negative forces,\nwhich the agreement recognized, has been put on the\nback burner. For over five years, the United Nations\nOrganization Mission in the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo (MONUC) has made no significant effort to\nensure the demobilization and disarmament of those\ngroups, thus leaving in place the seeds of future\nconflict. We are, however, hopeful that our efforts,\nboth at the bilateral level and in the Tripartite\nCommission, which is composed of Uganda, Rwanda\nand the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with the\nparticipation of Burundi, will iron out those problems\nand allow our region to attain peace and stability.\nFor some time now, the situation in Burundi has\nbeen a real concern to the Great Lakes region and to\nthe international community at large. The destruction\nand loss of life that took place spurred the regional\nStates, together with South Africa, to undertake and\nspearhead a peace initiative. It was a long and arduous\nprocess. With the support of the United Nations and the\ninternational community, signs of success are today\nevident.\nIn the past few months, the people of Burundi\nelected their leaders in local, parliamentary and,\nfinally, presidential elections. They look to the future\nwith hope. Uganda welcomes His Excellency\nMr. Pierre Nkurunziza, the new President of Burundi,\n24\n\nand we look forward to working with him to\nconsolidate peace in the region. The international\ncommunity and the United Nations have an obligation\nto make peace sustainable. Reconstruction,\nrehabilitation and development will be necessary. We\nhope that due attention is given to institutional\ncapacity-building so that Burundi does not relapse into\nthe fratricidal anarchy that had been its bane over the\npast decade.\nAfter two decades of conflict in southern Sudan,\nthe people of the Sudan, led by the Government and\nthe Sudanese People\u2019s Liberation Movement and Army\n(SPLM/A), signed the Comprehensive Peace\nAgreement earlier this year. The guns are silent, and\nthe long-tortured people of southern Sudan are now\nenjoying some peace. It is unfortunate that the late\nJohn Garang passed away at a time when\nimplementation of the Agreement was in its early\nstages. We are confident that given the commitment of\nboth the Government of the Sudan and SPLM the\npeace agreement will hold and will be comprehensively\nimplemented. We are also confident that the Sudan is\nheaded for a peaceful future. We hope that other\nconflicts, such as that in Darfur, will be peacefully\nresolved using the Comprehensive Peace Agreement as\nan inspiration and a model.\nThe signature and implementation of the\nComprehensive Peace Agreement in the Sudan has led\nto increased optimism about peace in northern Uganda.\nThe Lord\u2019s Resistance Army (LRA), a terrorist group\nthat has long maimed, kidnapped and terrorized the\ncivilian population of northern Uganda, for a long time\nhad sanctuary in southern Sudan, from where it\nlaunched its terrorist activities. With the cooperation of\nthe Sudanese Government, including SPLA/SPLM in\nthe south, these terrorists are being flushed out from\nsouthern Sudan. Uganda\u2019s strategy of peace\nnegotiations combined with maximum military\npressure has significantly reduced the LRA\u2019s capacity\nto commit evil. However, as peace returns to the\nregion, we need international cooperation and\nassistance to supplement the Government of Uganda\u2019s\npost-conflict humanitarian, rehabilitation and\ndevelopment programme, which is already under way\nin northern Uganda.\nSomalia has been in a state of anarchy for more\nthan a decade and a half. Peace efforts by the\ninternational community and the United Nations have\nbeen anything but timid. A sense of frustration on the\npart of the United Nations has led to resignation and\ndespair, thus condemning the Somali people to a state\nof bondage and being held hostage by the warlords.\nIt is in this void that the regional States, under the\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD),\ntook on the mantle of negotiating peace and\nre-establishing order. Anarchy is contagious. We\ncannot feel safe in a situation pregnant with arms\ntrafficking, religious extremism, the dumping of\nradioactive waste and the potential for breeding\nterrorists in the region. These are realistic threats, and\nIGAD cannot ignore them. The international\ncommunity \u2014 and, most especially, the members of the\nSecurity Council \u2014 should not be deluded by\ngeographical distance. A potential threat to\ninternational peace truly exists in Somalia.\nIt is in view of these current and latent threats\nthat the members of IGAD took upon themselves to\nnegotiate with Somalia for peace. Over a period of two\nyears, we went through a very laborious and sometimes\nfrustrating negotiating process until agreement was\nreached on formation of a Government of national\nunity last year. At the end of the process, we expected\nthe Security Council to join us in the pursuit of peace.\nWe expected that all efforts would be geared towards\ncreating the necessary legal and political atmosphere to\nfacilitate the realization of peace for the long-suffering\npeople of Somalia.\nWe were, however, deeply disappointed when the\nCouncil, in its wisdom, acted otherwise, leaving the\nregion and, most important, the Somali people to their\nfate. The decision to uphold the arms embargo and to\nreject even its partial lifting denied the region a chance\nto implement the peace process to its logical end. We\nhope that it is not too late for the Council to evaluate\nand review its position.\nLet me briefly make some comments on the\nproposed reform of the United Nations. The institution\nwe have today was conceived and created 60 years ago.\nThe sense of triumphalism of the victors in the Second\nWorld War, the anguish of the vanquished and the\nassumed indifference of the colonial peoples,\nespecially in Africa, formed the background to the run-\nup to the creation of the United Nations.\nThe institution that emerged reflected those\nrealities. Nowhere within the United Nations, was this\nmore apparent than in the Security Council. The victors\nreserved for themselves the right to determine the\n25\n\ndestiny of others. This was done without due regard for\nthe interests of those that the decisions were to affect\nmost. Today, the situation has dramatically changed.\nColonial peoples have gained independence, and the\ninternational power structure has changed.\nDecisions of the Security Council need wider\nsupport diplomatically, financially and militarily in\norder to be implemented. It has, therefore, become an\nimperative to reform the Security Council and make it\nmore representative and reflective of the realities of\ntoday\u2019s world.\nIn Africa, where most Security Council mandated\noperations take place, we believe that it is time for the\ncontinent, composed of 53 States, to have a real say in\nhow those operations are formulated and implemented.\nToday, Africa is the only continent that has no\nrepresentation at the real decision-making level of the\nCouncil. It is for these reasons that we demand that the\ncontinent be given two permanent seats with veto and\ntwo additional non-permanent seats. A Council thus\ncomposed will be more democratic and credible and\nwill have its decisions more widely accepted.\nWhile the dream of the founding fathers of the\nUnited Nations was to save succeeding generations\nform the scourge of war, conflicts remain a reality in\ntoday\u2019s world. For 60 years, the United Nations has\nfailed to live up to this expectation. Uganda, therefore,\nwelcomes the establishment of the Peacebuilding\nCommission and a Peacebuilding Support Office. We\nhope that the 31 December 2005 deadline will be met\nin order to enable those vital bodies help the United\nNations effectively address conflict and make peace\nmore sustainable.\nIn the same vain, we support the establishment of\nthe Democracy Fund, which should be used to support\ncountries\u2019 home-grown institutions and not as a\nmechanism to import foreign brands of democracy.\nMy delegation is cognizant of the primary\nresponsibility of States to protect their own people. In\nthe event of failure, the international community has a\nresponsibility to protect in order to prevent genocide\nand ethnic cleansing. However, this responsibility\nshould be clearly defined and its exercise should have\nthe prior authorization of the Security Council.\nWe believe that the commitment of our leaders to\nsupport a stronger relationship between the United\nNations and regional and subregional organizations\nwill help expand the capacity of the international\ncommunity to handle the old and new challenges\nfacing the world. Indeed, regional organizations that\nhave a capacity for prevention of armed conflict or\npeacekeeping should use it to enhance the United\nNations in this field.\nThe existing Commission on Human Rights has\nbeen deficient in its performance over the years. We\nbelieve that it is time to create an independent\ninstitution with an effective and clear mandate to\nhandle human rights. The proposal to create a Human\nRights Council is timely. We hope that all the\nnecessary details will be agreed upon so that this\nCouncil can be launched.\nIn conclusion, allow me to restate Uganda\u2019s\ncommitment to the ideals and principles of the United\nNations. The Organization has served us relatively well\nover the years. It is capable of serving us even better\nand achieving the dreams and ideals emanated by the\nframers of the Charter 60 years ago. This can happen\nonly if we take the bold step of adopting the far-\nreaching, innovative reforms proposed by the\nSecretary-General and if we fully implement the\noutcome document."

        "file_text": "I would like to express\ncongratulations and support to the President of the\nGeneral Assembly for having chosen as the theme of\nour debate, \u201cFor a stronger and more effective United\nNations: follow-up to and implementation of decisions\nmade in the High-level Plenary Meeting of September\n2005\u201d.\nTen years before the target date, we are still faced\nwith doubts and questions about the actual\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals\n(MDGs), particularly in Africa. There are two\ninterconnected elements at the heart of this matter:\nStates\u2019 development policies; and the effective\nfulfilment of the commitments entered into by the\ninternational community. I have no intention of\nevaluating national policies, but it is clear that the\nachievement of the MDGs will require far-reaching\nadjustments in our national policies and increased\nefforts to reorganize and manage our budgets.\nFurthermore, the emergence of a new African\nleadership, which is bringing us together again in our\ncommitment to promoting development, democracy,\npeace and political stability, is an opportunity for the\ninternational community to provide more consistent\nsupport for the achievement of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals.\nUnfortunately, despite a great deal of discussion\nabout the MDGs, we are still falling short with regard\nto the commitments undertaken, to the clear distress of\nthe populations afflicted by pandemics such as malaria,\ntuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, which is spreading at an\nalarming rate.\nAs the head of State of Cape Verde said when\naddressing the Assembly during the High-level Plenary\nMeeting last week (see A/60/PV.5), achieving the\nMillennium Goals and building a freer world based on\nhigher levels of well-being, tolerance, peace and\nsecurity are within reach for humankind.\nIn order to achieve our goal, we need political\nwill, not just statements about political will or pious\nexpressions of hope for development. It is the\nresponsibility of the General Assembly at this session\nto ensure that the summit outcome (resolution 60/1) is\neffectively implemented. However, there can be no\ndoubt that the implementation of the outcome will be a\ntest of the policies that have been set out, as well as of\nthe negotiating skills of Member States, as we strive to\nachieve a better balance on international relations,\nfurther the democratization of international governance\nand strengthen peace and security at the regional and\nnational levels. We must redouble our efforts this year.\nIn the context of the reforms proposed by the\nSecretary-General, Cape Verde has been chosen to host\nthe joint office initiative, with the participation of\nUnited Nations programmes and agencies in the field.\nMay I once again reiterate my Government\u2019s support\nfor this initiative, while at the same time emphasizing\nthe absolute need for there to be adequate preparation\nfor this experiment, as well as internal adjustments\nconsistent with the option of joint representation. We\nare convinced that the joint office initiative will make\nit possible to concentrate resources more effectively on\npriority challenges and the substantive aspects of\ndevelopment.\nOn 5 July 2005, the Republic of Cape Verde\ncelebrated the thirtieth anniversary of its independence;\nthese 30 years have been marked by considerable\nsacrifice and effort in a country without natural\nresources. Throughout this period, fortunately, all the\n27\n\ndevelopment indicators have shown upward movement.\nUnder a resolution adopted by the General Assembly in\nDecember 2004, Cape Verde has made sufficient\nprogress to be no longer included in the list of least\ndeveloped countries. This \u201cgraduation\u201d is an explicit\nrecognition of the work done by the people of Cape\nVerde; and, undoubtedly, it is also the result of the\ninternational aid provided by various partners.\nTherefore, I should like to take this opportunity to\nexpress to all of Cape Verde\u2019s development partners,\nboth present and absent in this Hall, our profound\ngratitude for the solidarity thus extended to us.\nAt the risk of repeating myself, I should like to\nrecall the following points. The \u201cgraduation\u201d of Cape\nVerde is a result of the fact that the country satisfied\ntwo of the three established criteria. I am referring to\nthe per capita income per inhabitant and the human\ndevelopment index. The failure to identify the third\ncriterion, that of economic vulnerability, which is by\nfar the most important one, illustrates the kind of\nfragile situations that can be experienced by a small\nisland country that is permanently afflicted by drought\nand external shocks, of which the increase in oil prices\nis a very illustrative example.\nFor success to be meaningful over the medium\nand long term, \u201cgraduation\u201d should be accompanied by\nthe appropriate measures needed to ensure continuity\nof the development process. It is of fundamental\nimportance to define the goals, their duration and the\npractical modalities for this transition, and it should be\ndone as quickly as possible. What has been achieved\nby Cape Verde, thanks to the judicious management of\nforeign aid, cannot obscure major structural\nvulnerabilities. Parenthetically, I would like to reiterate\nonce again an appeal to the international community to\ngive particular attention to the specific problems of\ndevelopment in small island States.\nWe are convinced that, when Cape Verde leaves\nthe group of least developed countries in January 2008,\nwe will have agreed upon a common frame of\nreference, together with our development partners, one\nthat is based on General Assembly resolution 59/209\nand is in step with the spirit of smooth transition,\nwhere emphasis will be placed on questions of trade,\nfinancing for development, including modalities and\nmore effective and innovative instruments that fit the\nneeds for accelerated economic growth of a\n\u201cgraduated\u201d but vulnerable country.\nWe continue to be convinced that the\ndevelopment target we share with our partners must not\nlead to our being penalized for good governance and a\npositive development dynamic. For our part, we will\ncontinue to rely on the solidarity of our partners,\nincluding the United Nations.\nRegarding financing for development and the\nurgent need to adjust the practices and instruments of\naid to the requirements of achieving the MDGs, I\nshould like to comment on the decision taken by the\nGroup of 8 to eliminate external debt. The Government\nof Cape Verde is delighted at the Gleneagles decision\nto forgive the external debt of 18 countries, mostly\nAfrican ones. This is a shot of oxygen for the\ndevelopment process of the recipient countries.\nThat having been said, however, the Government\nof Cape Verde believes that we will need to analyse the\nproblem further in order to ensure that solutions are\nintegrated effectively into the international agenda. On\nthe one hand, the situation of poor countries, which are\ndeeply indebted, requires an increase in solidarity. On\nthe other hand, we also believe that some gesture\nshould be made towards the medium-income countries,\nparticularly those that are bereft of natural resources\nand only slightly indebted and who, at the same time,\nhonour their debt servicing in a structural framework\nthat is marked by budgetary constraints. Otherwise, the\nmessage underlying the decision to pardon the debt\nwill be extremely ambiguous and could lend itself to\nvarious interpretations.\nI would like to end with what one normally starts\nwith, and that is by congratulating the President on his\nelection to lead the sixtieth session of the General\nAssembly. My congratulations are equally extended to\nSweden, his country, which has always given\ninvaluable assistance promoting the self-determination\nof peoples, world peace and development. I would also\nlike to express my gratitude to his predecessor,\nMinister of State Jean Ping, for the competent and wise\ndischarge of his functions during a period of intense\nand difficult negotiations.\nMay I finally address our gratitude,\nencouragement and confidence to the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan. His vision of the future of\nthe world and of the United Nations deserves to be\nsupported by us all, so that our Organization, which\nbelongs to all of us, can respond to the growing and\ncomplex challenges of the current world."

        "file_text": "At\nthis session we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the\nestablishment of the United Nations. We also begin,\nactively and seriously, our effort to revitalize this\nstrong Organization, which humankind decided to\nestablish after it experienced two devastating wars\nduring the first half of the twentieth century. There is\nno doubt that this session has been convened at a time\nwhen international relations are undergoing major\nchanges and when hope is being tempered by threats\n7\n\nand challenges to the stability of the international\ncommunity and the peace and security of all our\npeoples.\nRecent international developments have proved\nthe increasing need to strengthen the capabilities of the\nmultilateral framework in addressing problems facing\nour nations and peoples and in achieving the required\nbalance on four issues that we consider to be at the\ncore of our contemporary interests: development,\ninternational peace and security, human rights and the\ninstitutional reform of the Organization.\nAddressing the issue of development at the\ninternational level requires strong political will to\nimplement the commitments we have undertaken,\nwhich we reaffirmed together in the outcome document\nof the High-level Plenary Meeting (resolution 60/1),\nprimarily the implementation of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals adopted at the Millennium\nSummit, the revitalization of the international\npartnership for development and the mobilization of\nthe financial resources it requires, and the fulfilment of\nthe commitment made by many developed countries to\nreach the target of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) in official development assistance by\n2015. I would like to take this opportunity to express\nEgypt\u2019s appreciation to the countries that have\nreaffirmed their commitment to fulfil their obligations\nin that regard.\nIn attaining our common goals, it is therefore\nimperative to use the consensus we reached at the\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting as a platform to build\ngreater consensus towards achieving the development\npriorities of developing countries, especially during the\nupcoming Ministerial Conference of the World Trade\nOrganization, to be held in Hong Kong, and at other\ninternational forums dealing with issues of importance\nto the developing world, especially those of trade, debt\nrelief, investment and industrial modernization, as well\nas other issues that can bring about the justice and\nopenness required in our international trading system\nand provide developing countries with the\nopportunities they need to raise the living standards of\ntheir peoples.\nIn fulfilling our long-standing commitments to\nachieve sustained economic growth and sustainable\ndevelopment in Africa, Egypt wishes to call upon our\npartners in developed countries to play a leading role\nin support of the implementation of the New\nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD). That\nAfrican-owned initiative constitutes an ambitious\npartnership for sustainable development that can\nensure Africa\u2019s integration into the world economy,\nlead to the achievement of good national and\ninternational governance and promote the contribution\nof civil society and the private sector in the\nachievement of our development goals.\nAlong with achieving economic security for all, it\nis essential that we strive to achieve international peace\nand security by practically and realistically addressing\nthe challenges and threats facing the international\ncommunity. Since terrorism is the most dangerous\nmenace of our times, Egypt actively contributed to\nreaching consensus on the Summit Outcome\ndocument\u2019s condemnation of terrorism in all its forms\nand manifestations, as it constitutes one of the most\nserious threats to international peace and security.\nContrary to what some might have imagined, the\nrecent terrorist attacks that have struck many\ncountries \u2014 including Egypt \u2014 have now made it\nclear that terrorism is a danger that does not distinguish\namong peoples, cultures or religions; rather it is a non-\ndiscriminating threat to human civilization. Those\nattacks have also reminded us that counter-terrorism\nefforts should not be limited to enhancing measures to\ncombat terrorism or to finding ways to improve their\nimplementation. Rather, they should include effectively\naddressing the underlying causes of the phenomenon.\nAccordingly, Egypt has put forth an initiative to\nconvene a high-level meeting of the General Assembly\nto draft and adopt a comprehensive plan of action that\nincludes the necessary legal and practical measures to\ndeal effectively with terrorism \u2014 without affecting the\nability of peoples under occupation to gain their\nindependence in accordance with established\ninternational law and norms \u2014 until it is completely\neradicated.\nIn conformity with that position, Egypt pledges to\nexert extensive efforts with a view to concluding a\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism.\nSuch a convention, along with the 12 existing\ninternational counter-terrorism conventions, to which\nthe International Convention for the Suppression of\nActs of Nuclear Terrorism was added this year, could\nconstitute the most comprehensive legal framework\npossible to tackle this phenomenon.\n8\n\nThe issues of disarmament and the\nnon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction relate\nto another major threat requiring concerted\ninternational action in the near future, specially as the\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting could not reach agreement\non how to address those issues in a manner consistent\nwith their crucial importance and urgency to the safety\nand security of the human race. Our common\nendeavour should be based on restoring the balance\nbetween nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation and\nthe peaceful uses of nuclear energy: the three pillars of\nprogress in achieving our common objectives. The\npoint of departure for our undertaking can only be the\nconsensus reached at the 1995 Review Conference of\nthe Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons (NPT), which constitutes an integral\npart of the package that made possible the indefinite\nextension of the NPT, along with the resolution on the\nMiddle East adopted at that Conference. Concerted\ninternational efforts, in particular by nuclear-weapon\nStates, to achieve the universality of the NPT are\nessential; otherwise, we risk having the Treaty lose its\ncredibility and relevance.\nTo that end, we require strong political will to\nrelaunch the United Nations disarmament machinery,\nreinforce the mutual and balanced implementation of\ncommitments and obligations set forth in existing\ntreaties, achieve the universality of those treaties prior\nto making any attempts to impose further obligations\non States parties and fully respect the commitments\nentered into under those instruments. We also need\ndetermination to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone\nin the Middle East, in order to support efforts to reach\na just and comprehensive peace in the region.\nThe establishment of the Human Rights Council\nmust prove to be a landmark in the promotion of, and\nrespect for, principles and freedoms. Its mandate,\ncomposition and methods of work must be formulated\nin a democratic manner and be based on the principle\nof equitable geographic distribution while also taking\ninto consideration each region\u2019s specific cultural and\ncivilizational characteristics. The Human Rights\nCouncil must also assist and encourage countries to\nimprove human rights and respect for the rule of law\non their territories. To that end, we must strengthen the\nhuman rights machinery and the rule of law in a\nmanner that will enable us to redress existing\nshortcomings \u2014 in particular, politicization, selectivity\nand double standards \u2014 and as to promote coexistence\nand dialogue among civilizations in contrast to the\ndivision and differences that characterize our current\nhandling of these issues. In that connection, I agree\nwith the previous speaker, the Minister for Foreign\nAffairs of Australia.\nThe Egyptian National Council on Human Rights\nhas been established in order to promote that effort. It\nenjoys the institutional independence it needs to carry\nout its tasks with due impartiality and objectivity. It\nalso has the capacity to promote respect for human\nrights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to\nparticipate in the formulation, prioritization and\nimplementation of national policies.\nWe must also launch a coordinated multilateral\neffort to promote human rights and to address rights\nviolations by enhancing the capacity of States to\nprotect their populations against genocide, ethnic\ncleansing, war crimes and crimes against humanity.\nHere, we must not capitalize on exceptional situations\nas a pretext to interfere in the internal affairs of States.\nIn accordance with the Charter of the United Nations\nand the relevant provisions of international law, we\nmust draw a line between the inability of a State to\nprotect its population against such crimes and its\nunwillingness to do so.\nOur common efforts to ensure larger freedom for\nour peoples are closely linked to our resolve and ability\nto settle current political issues, most notably in our\nregion, the Palestinian question. While we welcome the\nIsraeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and a few\nsettlements in the northern part of the West Bank, we\nalso call upon the Israeli Government to continue\nwithdrawing its troops from all Palestinian territories\nand to implement all of its commitments in that\nrespect, in accordance with the road map, which should\nlead us to our common goal: the establishment of an\nindependent Palestinian State coexisting with Israel in\nmutual peace and security. However, until we reach\nthat goal, Israel must cease settlement activities in the\nWest Bank, stop building its separation wall, improve\nthe humanitarian situation of the Palestinians in the\noccupied territories and launch final-status negotiations\ntowards a comprehensive settlement. Israel must also\nwithdraw from the remaining Arab territories in Syria\nand Lebanon occupied in 1967.\nFurthermore, we cannot address respect for\nhuman rights unless we address the human rights\nsituation in Iraq, particularly every Iraqi citizen\u2019s right\n9\n\nto life. In that context, and despite the establishment of\nthe Interim Government and the drafting of a new\nconstitution, national reconciliation among the entire\nbrotherly Iraqi people is still needed. We urgently need\nan increased understanding that violence and the\nkilling of innocent people will not lead to the desired\nsecurity and stability for Iraq.\nEgypt will continue its support for the important\nsteps taken by the Sudan towards peace and stability, in\nthe context of maintaining that country\u2019s sovereignty\nand territorial integrity. Egypt will continue to support\nthe implementation of the Nairobi Comprehensive\nPeace Agreement on southern Sudan and the Cairo\nagreement complementing it. We will also participate\nactively in peace negotiations on Darfur under the\nauspices of the African Union and continue Egypt\u2019s\nsupport by contributing troops to the United Nations\nMission in the Sudan, as well as observers to the\nAfrican Union Mission in Darfur.\nIt is in that context that Egypt continues to place\nthe security and stability of Africa at the centre of its\nregional and international policies. Egypt will therefore\ncontinue to increase its efforts to resolve contemporary\nAfrican political problems. It has contributed, and will\ncontinue to contribute, to all peacekeeping operations\nin Africa, as well as to support all of Africa\u2019s ongoing\nefforts to implement an integrated approach to\ndevelopment that covers all political, economic and\nsocial dimensions. Egypt\u2019s commitment to Africa is\nbased on an unwavering conviction of our common\ndestiny and on the need for continued cooperation.\nHere, the African Union has a central role to play; it\nmust have the full support of the United Nations.\nBecause of the particular importance that Africa\nattaches to the link between security and development\nin addressing situations in countries emerging from\nconflict, Egypt has supported the establishment of the\nproposed Peacebuilding Commission. However, the\nactivities of the Commission must reflect a balance\namong the various mandates of the principal organs of\nthe United Nations and the various steps taken in\ntackling each issue. We also call for a leading in the\nwork of the Commission role for both the General\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council, along\nwith the Security Council. The Commission must\nbecome neither a body to impose trusteeship on States\nnor an instrument to bypass the will and the national\npriorities of States. The Peacebuilding Commission\nmust always remain an effective advisory body\nfocusing on mobilizing assistance to post-conflict\ncountries on its agenda, in order to enable them to\nattain their national aspirations to sustainable peace\nand stability.\nThe United Nations will not be able to carry out\nall those increasing and challenging tasks unless we\nembark upon effective institutional reform that takes\ninto consideration the balance between the\nOrganization\u2019s principal organs, that ensures the\nimplementation of the Organization\u2019s tasks and that\nenhances the credibility of the United Nations and\neliminates the causes of the criticism it has been\nfacing.\nThere is no doubt that among the most important\npillars of institutional reform is the revitalization of the\nGeneral Assembly and the strengthening of its role as\nthe chief deliberative, policymaking, implementing and\nmonitoring body of the United Nations. The Assembly\nshould cooperate with the Secretary-General within a\ntransparent framework and should provide him with the\nauthority he needs to carry out his tasks effectively\nwhile ensuring that he remains committed to the tasks\nmandated by the principal organs of the Organization.\nWe look forward to the proposals that the\nSecretary-General is expected to present, including\nthose on improving auditing and oversight, which\nshould duly take into account the intergovernmental\nnature of the existing budgetary and management\ncommittees. We also look forward to undertaking,\nthrough the General Assembly and other relevant\nbodies, a one-time review of mandates older than five\nyears, while emphasizing the need to avoid a mere\nregulatory approach to that issue and the imperative of\ntaking its political implications into consideration. We\nmust never neglect the international political balance,\nor affect ongoing efforts to resolve contemporary\nproblems.\nIn that context, the reform and expansion of the\nSecurity Council is becoming increasingly important,\nparticularly in the light of the Council\u2019s role in the\nmaintenance of international peace and security. That\nreform must ensure that the Security Council is more\nrepresentative of the general membership of the\nOrganization and more transparent in addressing the\nissues on its agenda. In that regard, I wish to stress the\ncommitment of Egypt to the African Common Position\non this issue, as set out in the Ezulwini consensus and\nthe Sirte declaration, which aims at fulfilling the\n10\n\nlegitimate aspirations of our continent for permanent\nand balanced representation in an expanded Security\nCouncil and at remedying the existing imbalance in the\nrepresentation of Africa in particular and of developing\ncountries in general.\nThe outcome document that we adopted at the\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting marking the sixtieth\nanniversary of the United Nations (resolution 60/1) is\nsolid proof of the vitality of the Organization and of a\ngenuine desire that its essential role continue. We look\nforward to working together to move ahead and to\nimprove the capacity of the United Nations to fulfil our\ncommon objectives on the basis of firm political will to\nimplement the commitments agreed upon in that\ndocument. We must expand the agreement\u2019s scope to\nencompass all aspects of international action. That is\nthe only path available to us in order to attain our\npeoples\u2019 aspirations to peace, security and stability."

        "file_text": "Sixty years ago,\nPrime Minister Peter Fraser of New Zealand told\nrepresentatives to the San Francisco Conference that its\nsole aim should be\n\u201cthe setting up of a world organization that will\nreally work, and that will be the background for\nan orderly progress towards security, prosperity\nand happiness for all the people of all nations\u201d.\nThe new organization would only work, he said, if its\nmembers were determined to stand by their\ncommitments and principles.\nToday the essential concept of the United Nations\nremains robust. We can be justly proud of its\nachievements in many areas including humanitarian\nassistance, development and peacekeeping. But we\nhave collectively underperformed in others, sometimes\nwith tragic results.\nOur task this sixtieth anniversary is twofold: first,\nto recommit ourselves as Member States to the\nenduring vision and values of the Charter and,\n19\n\nsecondly, to retool the United Nations machinery to\nmeet the challenges of the twenty-first century.\nThe Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1) provides\nthe blueprint for the way forward. New Zealand would\nhave liked more progress in a number of areas, such as\nmore detailed agreement on the establishment of the\nHuman Rights Council and more authority to the\nSecretary-General to manage resources in return for\ngreater accountability. We deeply regret the failure to\nendorse further disarmament and non-proliferation\nmeasures.\nBut we are encouraged by the many significant\nadvances, including recognition of the need for more\nand better aid, establishment of the Peacebuilding\nCommission, a doubling of resources for the Office of\nthe Commissioner for Human Rights and the\nrecognition of our shared \u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d.\nWe have as our theme for the General Assembly\nimplementation of our summit undertakings. We share\naccountability for getting the job done. I shall confine\nmy comments here to the results of the summit.\nNew Zealand is pleased with the Summit\nOutcome as it relates to development. It represents a\nshared commitment by all Member States to the\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) and\nrecognizes the important partnership between\ndeveloped and developing countries in the effective use\nof aid.\nThis year New Zealand has increased its\ndevelopment assistance by 23 per cent. Our official\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) programme has a focus\non poverty elimination, with a core, but not exclusive,\nfocus on the Pacific. We strive to address aid\neffectiveness, the particular problems faced by small\nisland developing States, HIV/AIDS, the empowerment\nof women, sexual and reproductive health and rights,\neducation for all, sustainable development and trade\naccess.\nOn trade, we look forward to an ambitious\noutcome across all aspects of the Doha Development\nAgenda, including in agriculture, improved market\naccess, the elimination of export subsidies and\nsubstantial reductions in trade distorting domestic\nsupport. Improving the coherence of trade policies and\ndevelopment initiatives remains a critical element in\nachieving the MDGs.\nNew Zealand welcomes the decision to establish\na Peacebuilding Commission to help break the cycle of\nconflict by better coordinating long-term international\nrecovery efforts and ensuring sustained political\nattention to those who need it. We must now move\nswiftly to get the Commission up and running by\nDecember this year. We look to the General Assembly\nPresident to take a lead in holding consultations to\nachieve this. The core elements of the framework have\nalready been discussed at length and in detail. With\ngood will and determination, we can surely arrive at\nagreement within the next few weeks on a package.\nThis should ensure balanced membership and flexible\nreporting arrangements. We would caution against\nraising the bar for assistance too high, and we hope\nthat all States in need of help will be able to approach\nthe Commission.\nOur leaders have spoken with one voice and\nunequivocally to condemn all forms of terrorism. We\nmust build on this and honour our undertaking to\nconclude negotiations on the comprehensive\nconvention on international terrorism at this session.\nNew Zealand will continue to work closely with our\nfriends in the Pacific region to improve our collective\nabilities to identify, prevent or respond to terrorist\nthreats. Consolidating reporting requirements created\nby Security Council resolutions would, we believe, be\none step towards enhancing the counter-terrorism\nprogramme of the United Nations. We think it very\nimportant that Member States should now support the\nSecretary-General\u2019s counter-terrorism strategy.\nOne of the most far-reaching achievements of the\nsummit, as many countries have acknowledged, is our\ncollective acceptance that there is a responsibility to\nprotect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic\ncleansing and crimes against humanity. We must now\nall be prepared to assist the United Nations in\nestablishing the early warning capability referred to in\nour outcome document. It is vital that, when the need\narises, we give effect to our resolve and follow the\nprinciples we have agreed upon.\nIn this context, New Zealand wishes to reaffirm\nits commitment to ending impunity for those\nresponsible for the most serious crimes of concern to\nthe international community. Adoption of the Rome\nStatute of the International Criminal Court was an\nhistoric moment for the United Nations and one that\ndemonstrated the breadth and depth of political will to\nend impunity and to secure the rule of law.\n20\n\nThe absence of any reference to a commitment to\nend impunity or of any acknowledgement of the\nInternational Criminal Court\u2019s central contribution to\nthis goal is one of several telling silences in our\nsummit outcome.\nWe are particularly pleased that leaders have\nrecognized the need to conclude, during this session,\nnegotiations on the draft protocol to the Convention on\nthe Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel.\nThis will be a major priority for New Zealand. We call\non all Member States to contribute constructively to\nthis process, so that we can reach agreement on a\nprotocol and demonstrate our full support for the work\nof United Nations personnel in the field.\nNew Zealand welcomes the emphasis on human\nrights in the outcome document. That the budget of the\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights is\nto be doubled and her Office strengthened is an\noverdue recognition of the gap between expectations of\ndelivery and resourcing.\nWhile progress has been made through the\nsummit decision to establish a Human Rights Council,\nwe regret that the opportunity was lost to reach\nagreement on details of the Council\u2019s mandate and\noperation, despite the support of a great majority of\nMembers for such a package. A small minority cannot\nbe allowed to veto the establishment of the Council.\nOver the next weeks we must redouble our efforts\nto translate that broad support into specifics on what\nthe Council will look like and on its mandate. We shall\nlook to the President to set a work programme that will\naim for agreement on the details.\nOur second human rights priority for the sixtieth\nsession is to see negotiations completed on the draft\nconvention on the rights of persons with disabilities.\nThe constructive and collegial spirit of delegations in\nthe Ad Hoc Committee on the rights of persons with\ndisabilities has been extraordinary. New Zealand is\nconfident that it will be possible to conclude the\nnegotiations in 2006 if the Ad Hoc Committee is\nenabled to meet for three weeks next January.\nOur ability to strengthen the United Nations\nacross the board in development, security and human\nrights will be enhanced by implementing summit\nundertakings on Secretariat and management reform.\nWe need particularly to improve the managerial\neffectiveness and accountability of the Secretary-\nGeneral. He should be given, as he has requested, the\ntools that he needs to manage the Secretariat.\nWe strongly support the review of all budgetary\nand human resource rules and regulations and the\nreview of mandates. We support also the increased\nfocus on ensuring ethical conduct on the part of all\nUnited Nations personnel. We believe a system-wide\ncode of ethics and an independent ethics office would\nfacilitate that. New Zealand also welcomes the\ncommitment to strengthening the United Nations\nOffice of Internal Oversight Services.\nThe outcome document calls for early reform of\nthe Security Council, and the General Assembly is to\nreview progress on this issue by the end of the year.\nNew Zealand continues to believe that the Security\nCouncil needs to be more effective and more\nrepresentative for the twenty-first century, although we\nhave no illusions about the difficulties of reaching\nagreement on this.\nWe should in the meantime renew our efforts to\nimprove the working methods of the Security Council.\nFor those many Member States who rarely, if ever,\noccupy a non-permanent seat on the Council, there\nshould be other ways to participate in Council\ndecisions and contribute to discussions.\nWe, as Member States, have shown in finalizing\nthe summit outcome a mixture of courage and\ncreativity on the one hand and of stubbornness and\nhesitation on the other. The implementation period\nahead gives us a second chance to make good on those\nmoments when we allowed agreements to slip through\nour fingers. We put our trust in our President to set up\nthe structures for ongoing work and to be the catalyst\nto motivate and energize us.\nIn closing, I would like to acknowledge the much\nvalued contribution that former President Ping made\nover the last year, and we thank him."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, first of all, I\nwould like to congratulate you on your election as\nPresident of this session of the General Assembly and\nto thank your predecessor, Mr. Ping, for all his efforts\nduring his tenure. I would like also to thank the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for all his\nendeavours in seeking the preservation of this great\ninstitution\u2019s integrity as well as world peace.\nThis year\u2019s session of the General Assembly\ncomes days after a landmark meeting of world leaders\nat which they adopted a blueprint that aims to increase\nthe efficiency of the United Nations in the prosecution\nof human rights abuses and in the preservation of\nworld peace and security. Moreover, that instrument\ncalls on all to move forward with a much-needed,\ncomprehensive programme of reforms at the United\nNations, including in the Security Council.\nThis clearly demonstrates our faith in the primacy\nof the role of the United Nations in the preservation of\nworld peace, as the embodiment of our collective\ndesire and will, and as the legitimate body for crisis\nresolution within the framework of every individual\nState\u2019s sovereignty.\nTruly, the only way out of this dangerous impasse\nis a return to a multipolar world order, based on the\nrule of international law and justice and on respect for\nevery nation\u2019s sovereignty. Moreover, such a wise\napproach should be complemented by serious and\nconcerted efforts to fight poverty and oppression and,\nconsequently, the root causes of terror.\nThe core values of a democratic and just world\nare best served by enhancing the capabilities of the\nUnited Nations and its instruments, and by reinforcing\nin-house democratic values. This institution should\nremain the primary defender of such human values as\nfreedom, justice and peace.\nThe advances in telecommunications and\ninformation technologies, signature traits of\nglobalization, have led to a withering of geographical\nboundaries, along with a strengthening of multinational\ncorporations, and hence the need for a new approach to\ntackling our world\u2019s problems in international\nrelations. The \u201ccrumbs\u201d from the rich nations have\nbecome insufficient to satisfy the needs of a third\nworld seeking to extract itself from backwardness and\nto eradicate poverty and disease. Those ailments have\nspread beyond the boundaries of the great development\ndivide and serve as a stern wake-up call and a ticking\nbomb for us all to heed.\nThat is why it is imperative to call for a serious\nand urgent dialogue between North and South, for\nrapid and eased transfer of technological advances and\ncapital, and for bolstering the development of those\nnations that seek modernity. Moreover, it is crucial to\nencourage interaction and cooperation between\ndeveloping States through such forums as the summit\nthat was held in Brasilia last May, where Arab nations\nmet the nations of South America. Lebanon looks\nforward to the follow-up meetings of the Brasilia\nsummit, considering the importance of cooperation\nbetween those two important geographic blocs.\nAt this juncture, it is logical to ask whether\nextremism, terrorism and wanton violence against\ninnocent civilians are the by-products of the\nenvironment of seclusion and deprivation. In view of\nthe rapid spread of terrorism, we feel that the approach\nto countering the plague of terrorism remains\nsuperficial and unable to tackle the root causes of the\nplague.\nHaving suffered the awful consequences of that\nplague, Lebanon was always a bellwether in\ncondemning all terrorist acts around the world. That is\nbecause few nations have so endured and continue to\nendure the consequences of that evil. That is why we\nknow that an effective anti-terror campaign requires an\nenvironment of constructive cooperation worldwide,\nremote from politically motivated campaigns of\nvilification, and as a platform for a clear definition of\n7\n\nterrorism, remote from the wilful or unintended\nconflation of the inalienable right of people to fight\noccupation and acts of wanton terror.\nTherefore, and in order to conclusively win the\nwar on terror, the security approach should be\ncomplemented by mid- and long-term approaches\naimed at resolving political crises in order to deprive\nthe terrorists of all legitimacy. That is why tackling the\nproblems of oppression and occupation, along with\nbolstering development, education and the attainment\nof a better life, will surely lead to shrinking the human\npool that feeds extremism.\nFor decades now, the Middle East has witnessed\nconflicts and unresolved disputes and, as a\nconsequence, has been subject to the festering wounds\nof terrorism. Needless to say, the core of the problem\nremains the fact that Arab lands are still under\noccupation in spite of the many resolutions of\ninternational legitimacy, many adopted in this very\nedifice, calling for an end to occupation.\nThe immediate implementation of those\nresolutions, as well as General Assembly resolution\n194 (III) \u2014 which affirms the right of return of the\nPalestinian refugees to their lands confiscated by Israel\nand bars the resettlement of the uprooted Palestinians\nin their host countries \u2014 remains the only way to\ndefuse and to dry up the wells of extremism. That will\npave the way to a comprehensive, just and peaceful\nsettlement in our region, as foreseen in the 1991\nMadrid peace summit and the implementation of the\nland-for-peace principle.\nThose principles of peace were confirmed as a\nstrategic choice by all Arab leaders during the Beirut\nArab summit of 2002. Sadly, the initiative has yet to be\nseized upon to resolve regional conflicts and to achieve\na final and peaceful settlement in the Middle East.\nAwaiting the historic resolution of the conflict,\nLebanon commends the United Nations Relief and\nWorks Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East\nfor all that it does, and calls upon the international\ncommunity to bolster its capabilities in order to\nalleviate the hardships of the Palestinian refugees in\ntheir places of \u201ctemporary\u201d residence.\nThe daily Israeli violations of Lebanon\u2019s\nterritorial integrity and aggressions against the people\nof South Lebanon have made that important part of my\ncountry yet another point of tension in the Middle East.\nIsrael\u2019s violation of the Blue Line and its continuing\noccupation of parts of my country, along with the\nimprisonment of scores of our citizens without any\nrecourse to due process, are in clear violation of\ninternational law, to say nothing of the lethal hardships\nfaced by our citizens in the freed areas of South\nLebanon due to the thousands of land mines planted by\nIsrael during its two-decade occupation of South\nLebanon.\nMy country continues to adhere to a\ncomprehensive and just peace settlement, to the\nprinciple of non-aggression, and to respect for human\nrights, and yearns for the implementation of all\ninternational resolutions towards those ends. In the\nmeantime, we cannot but value the role played by the\nUnited Nations in South Lebanon through the United\nNations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) \u2014 a role\nthat has been extended to and benefited Lebanon for\nalmost three decades. Our clinging to the UNIFIL\npresence emanates from our commitment to peace and\nsecurity, pending a final resolution of the conflicts in\nthe region.\nHere, I would like to avail myself of the\nopportunity to salute the UNIFIL forces active in South\nLebanon, to thank them for their sacrifices, and to bow\nin memory of the fallen peacekeepers.\nLebanon has long endured Israel\u2019s wars and\noccupation, despite a Security Council resolution\ncalling for the immediate cessation of the occupation.\nAlas, Israel ignored that resolution for over two\ndecades. That gave birth to a staunchly national\nmovement of resistance and defence of Lebanon\u2019s\nterritorial integrity, as guaranteed by the Charter of the\nUnited Nations under the right to fight occupation.\nDespite the persistence of all the aforementioned\nconditions of occupation, violations and aggressions,\nand due to Lebanon\u2019s adherence to all resolutions of\ninternational legitimacy \u2014 an adherence based on a\nclear understanding of the world community\u2019s\ndemands \u2014 the Government of Lebanon launched an\ninternal dialogue between all Lebanese groups in order\nto maintain our unity, security and stability, and to\nreinforce our internal and international positions. We\nlook forward to maintaining that rapport with the world\ncommunity in order to achieve those noble goals.\nSince the historic reconciliation at Taef, Lebanon\nhas enjoyed over a decade of stability and tranquillity,\nquickly recapturing its regional pre-eminence and its\n8\n\npioneering role as a land of religious tolerance \u2014 an\nexample to follow in the dialogue of civilizations.\nMoreover, Lebanon has enjoyed an unprecedented\nlevel of economic revitalization and has been able to\nforge iron-clad unity in its armed forces and civil\ninstitutions.\nHowever, Lebanon has recently gone through\nsome horrific and fateful events, one of which \u2014 the\nassassination of Prime Minister Rafik Hariri \u2014\nconstitutes the hardest blow in its modern history. That\nassassination caused great grief for our nation, and the\nrepercussions were felt throughout the world. We look\nforward to the timely and prompt disclosure of the\nInternational Inquiry Commission\u2019s results of the\ninvestigation into that heinous act, and we thank the\nSecurity Council for consenting to Lebanon\u2019s request\nto appoint such a Commission.\nMoreover, Lebanon appreciates the great efforts\nundertaken by the Inquiry Commission in its search for\nthe truth, and will afford the Commission all the\nsupport that it needs in order for us to prosecute the\nculprits to the full extent of the law. That underlines\nthe commitment of Lebanon and of the world\ncommunity in the fight against terrorism.\nDespite the abominable assassination of Prime\nMinister Rafik Hariri and the ensuing national malaise,\nwe were able to conduct exemplary parliamentary\nelections, which have been heralded by most observers\nas yet another landmark in the democratic history of\nLebanon.\nUnited Nations and international monitoring\nofficials testified that those elections were held in\naccordance with the highest standards. Consequently, a\nGovernment of national unity has been formed, which\nhas taken upon itself the task of immediately tackling\nLebanon\u2019s internal and external affairs, within the\nframework of a serious dialogue aimed at achieving a\nnational consensus and the preservation of what we all\ndesire, namely, Lebanon\u2019s stability and national unity.\nThe new Lebanese Government is determined to\nundertake a comprehensive plan of reform that will\nencompass all political, administrative and economic\naspects, and as a first step it has established a much-\nneeded consultative national body to formulate a new\nelectoral law that will live up to the recommendations\nof the European Union\u2019s delegated commission.\nMoreover, the Lebanese Government looks\nforward to the valuable support of the United Nations,\nand conveys the gratitude of the people of Lebanon.\nFinally, we commend the precise follow-up provided\nby the World Bank and the International Monetary\nFund for the rebuilding of a solid national economy.\nFrom this rostrum, we set forth Lebanon\u2019s\nstruggle for freedom, justice and the rule of law. It has\nbeen Lebanon\u2019s fate to walk this path in a region of\nfestering, decades-long conflicts and disputes. As such,\nit has ended up paying an exorbitant price in wars,\noccupations and assassinations. But Lebanon has been\nrelentless in its devotion to what is good and right, and\nhas always been able to defeat the forces of sedition\nand destruction.\nToday, we owe our moment of triumph to our\nperseverance and to the international community\u2019s\ncommitment to Lebanon. We ask that you take our\nhand, once again, as we cross the threshold from fear\nand war to hope and peace."

        "file_text": "At the\noutset, I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your\nelection to the important post of President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its sixtieth anniversary session\nand to wish you every success in your responsible and\ndifficult task. May I also extend our thanks to your\npredecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, for his successful\npresidency of the previous session of the Assembly.\nThe summit that ended yesterday demonstrated\nthat the United Nations remains the universal\nOrganization capable of making an important\ncontribution to strengthening international peace and\nsecurity, achieving sustainable development and\nfinding adequate answers to new global challenges and\nthreats. In that regard, I hope that this sixtieth\nanniversary session of the General Assembly will\nbecome a major event in and give people some hope\nfor the future.\nThe rapid changes in today\u2019s world have not\nbypassed Kyrgyzstan. Our people, not indifferent to its\nown destiny and future, in March of this year chose its\nown path to development, progress and creativity.\nAnother page has been turned in Kyrgyzstan\u2019s modern\nhistory. We enter the twenty-first century full of\nresolve to achieve our deepest aspirations and hopes\nfor peace, prosperity, progress and freedom. We are\nconfident that that the goals reflected in the\nMillennium Declaration will be achieved in the Kyrgyz\nRepublic as elsewhere.\nIf it is to preserve the respect and to justify the\nhopes of peoples, the United Nations must not lag\nbehind the swift and ever accelerating changes taking\nplace in the world today. It must not only adapt to\ncurrent realities, but also create more effective\nmachinery for addressing new challenges and risks.\nKyrgyzstan is convinced that United Nations\nreform should fully reflect the will, fundamental rights\nand interests of all States Members and peoples.\nIn recent years, the Security Council has been\nrepeatedly criticized for its failures in the maintenance\nof international peace and security. It is therefore\nextremely important that the Security Council find the\nmost effective way to meet its basic responsibility for\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\nKyrgyzstan has consistently advocated expansion of\nthe membership of the Security Council and reform of\nits working methods in order to make it more\nrepresentative, democratic and, above all, more\neffective. We believe that the reform of the Security\nCouncil should be based on the principles of\nuniversality, efficiency and broad geographic\nrepresentation. The Council\u2019s decisions must be as\ntimely as possible and their implementation\ncorrespondingly expeditious and effective.\nThe Kyrgyz Republic shares the position that\nUnited Nations reform will be successful only if\nSecurity Council reform is followed by reform of the\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social\nCouncil. We support efforts to enhance the activities of\nthe General Assembly and to strengthen the\ncoordinating functions of the Economic and Social\nCouncil. Effective coordination among the three\nprincipal organs is extremely important in addressing\nthe complex problems facing the world today.\nWe all realize how great and complex are the\nchallenges facing the United Nations in the\nmaintenance of peace and security. Kyrgyzstan intends\nto make its contribution to those tasks. For the first\ntime, it has offered its own candidature for non-\npermanent membership of the Security Council for the\nterm 2012-2013. We understand the great responsibility\nthat membership of that crucial organ of the United\nNations entails. I would venture to assure the\n19\n\nAssembly that Kyrgyzstan will make every effort to\nincrease its cooperation with Member States in all\nregions and to become a reliable partner in resolving\nglobal political issues.\nToday, the United Nations and its agencies are\nmore engaged with issues of development than with\nthose of security. While many United Nations agencies\ndeal every day with the problems of development,\nthere is only one permanent organ that deals with\nsecurity issues. In our opinion, given globalization and\nthe interrelationship of all issues relating to man-made\nand natural disasters, along with international terrorism\nand extremism, the United Nations capacity to\nmaintain global security must be considerably\nstrengthened. We believe that development\nprogrammes should be endowed with preventive\npowers to ensure security and safety.\nThe history of international relations in the\nsecond half of the last century shows that it is virtually\nimpossible to preserve international peace and security\nwhen certain basic conditions of life remain unmet.\nPoverty and deprivation lead to tension, which in turns\nleads to breaches of international peace and security. It\nis no accident that it is precisely the poorest regions of\nthe world that suffer the most serious regional\nconflicts. If it is to achieve its security and\ndevelopment targets, the international community must\nadopt a more balanced policy.\nThe world community must work actively to\novercome disparities and inequalities between the\ncountries of the North and the South. We feel that the\nUnited Nations needs to establish interactive\nmachinery to resolve the issues that cause the poorest\ncountries to opt out of the process of global\ndevelopment and decision-making. The countries of the\nSouth should become full partners in decisions\ninvolving global problems.\nKyrgyzstan remains committed to the Monterey\nConsensus, whereby the developed countries will\nincrease their development assistance and poor\ncountries will adapt themselves to using that assistance\nmore effectively. At various high-level forums, we\nhave come to understood the concepts of sustainable\neconomic development and sustainable human\ndevelopment. We fully support those concepts, with\nsubstantive provisions reflected in our national strategy\nand programmes.\nFurthermore, the successful implementation of\nthe national development programmes of many\ncountries is directly linked to regional and international\ncooperation. It is at the juncture where all of those\ninterests meet that the United Nations and its agencies\nmust further enhance their role and coordinate their\nefforts.\nWe support the proposal for national development\nstrategies to be adopted by 2006 and implemented by\n2015 as indicators for the implementation of the\ndevelopment goals set out in the Millennium\nDeclaration. In our opinion, the United Nations should\nmobilize new resources, strengthen coordination and\nincrease its contribution to the resolution of\ndevelopment issues.\nDonor countries must now move from paying lip-\nservice to their obligations to concrete action. In that\nregard, the Kyrgyz Republic welcomes the decision of\nthe European Union to allocate 0.7 per cent of its gross\nnational income to official development assistance by\n2009. Kyrgyzstan also advocates the identification of\nan acceptable level of indebtedness and the adoption of\nurgent and commensurate measures to ease the debt\nburden of developing countries.\nKyrgyzstan is a landlocked, mountainous country.\nMountain States are characterized by remoteness,\ndifficult accessibility, the scarcity of information, harsh\ngeo-climatic conditions, and high costs of living. While\nreceiving financial aid from the developed countries,\nKyrgyzstan itself is a donor of environmental services\nwhose value increases yearly. So, for example, the\nKyrgyz Republic is one of the principal repositories of\nglaciers and suppliers of fresh water in the region.\nMoreover, in the context of the International\nConvention on Biological Diversity, Kyrgyzstan also\noperates a network of biosphere areas and releases\nmuch less greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than\nmost other countries of the world, thus contributing to\nthe preservation of the planet\u2019s ozone layer.\nAt the same time, unfortunately, in our territory,\nour many stockpiles of radioactive waste are an\ninheritance from the military-industrial complex of the\nformer Soviet period. Their maintenance and the\nprevention of further potential ecological accidents for\nthe entire Central-Asian region are an excessive burden\nfor Kyrgyzstan. We believe that the international\ncommunity, with a coordinating role for the United\nNations, should more actively involve itself in those\n20\n\nareas of environmental risk and provide more financial\nand technical assistance to avert global and regional\necological disasters.\nWe also believe that the United Nations should be\nmore active in assisting poor and developing countries\nregarding sustainable development by creating\nmachinery to shift the burden of external debt to\nsustainable development. A significant amount of our\nincome goes to servicing our debt, hindering the socio-\neconomic development of mountainous areas.\nIn addition to disaster preparedness and\nmitigation, Kyrgyzstan supports initiatives on the\ncreation of a worldwide early warning system for\nnatural disasters. As a mountain country, Kyrgyzstan\nregularly faces serious and frequent natural disasters,\nsuch as earthquakes, landslides, avalanches, and the\nflooding of cities and settlements. In our harsh\nexperience, the consequences of such natural disasters\ndivert huge sums from economic and social\ndevelopment and highlight the importance of\nstrengthening ecological security. As a first step,\nKyrgyzstan offers the use of its territory as a pilot area\nfor the prevention and mitigation of such natural\ndisasters.\nI would also like to express our support for the\nestablishment of a committee of regional organizations\nunder United Nations auspices. Such a committee\nwould enable the exploitation of untapped potential of\nthe regional and subregional organizations in the\nprevention and settlement of conflicts and other\nimportant regional problems. Regional structures with\nsuch potential that are now operating effectively should\nplay a mutually complementary role in facing new\nthreats and challenges. Kyrgyzstan supports the\nparticipation in the work of the committee of such\norganizations as the Shanghai Cooperation\nOrganization, the Collective Security Treaty\nOrganization, the Euro-Asian Economic Union and the\nCentral Asian Cooperation Organization.\nWe also support measures to enhance the\neffectiveness of peacekeeping operations and welcome\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s proposal on United Nations\nstandby forces of peacekeepers and civilian police.\nThe Kyrgyz Republic is the only country in\nCentral Asia that participates in United Nations\npeacekeeping operations. We have sent military\nobservers and staff officers to the United Nations\nmissions in Liberia, Burundi, Sierra Leone, Serbia and\nMontenegro, and the Sudan. We are proud of our\ncontribution and are resolved to continue supporting\nthat noble endeavour.\nKyrgyzstan actively supports the efforts of the\ninternational community to restore and strengthen\npeace in Afghanistan and has opened its territory to the\nforces of the counter-terrorism coalition and the\nCollective Security Treaty Organization to provide\nregional security measures.\nWe remain committed to the establishment of a\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia. The text of\nthe agreement on such a zone has been agreed by five\ncountries of our region and we are pleased that the\nKyrgyz Republic is to be the depositary of the treaty.\nWe feel that this is evidence of the great respect and\ntrust in which our Republic is held with regard to the\ninitiative to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone. I am\nfirmly convinced that the establishment of such a zone\nin our region will strengthen global security and\nregional stability. We hope to obtain the corresponding\nsupport of the world community.\nIn conclusion, I would like to note that the world\ncommunity is going through a difficult phase in the\nestablishment of a new system of international\nrelations. Clearly, it will be a long, drawn-out process.\nThe States Members of the United Nations should\naffirm their readiness to find practical solutions to the\nmost essential problems of our time: combating\npoverty, famine and disease and to work for sustainable\ndevelopment. This session of the General Assembly\nwill be remembered as the session of reforms."

        "file_text": "The delegation of\nthe Republic of Sierra Leone wishes to express its\nprofound appreciation for the significant contribution\nof the President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\nninth session to the work of the Assembly and to\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the\nleadership of this body at its sixtieth session. You and\nyour predecessor will always have a special place in\nthe history of the United Nations as Presidents of the\nGeneral Assembly at the height of the Organization\u2019s\nreform process.\nThe United Nations was founded on the principle\nof multilateral cooperation for the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. For 60 years, it has\nbeen the focus of its Members \u2014 rich and poor, big\nand small \u2014 for carrying out that critical\nresponsibility. Today, for many of its Members, the\nOrganization is the great hope, not only for the\nachievement of peace and security, but also for the\nattainment of every objective of human aspiration,\nparticularly development, human rights, freedom and\ndemocracy.\nThe United Nations was designed to serve the\nworld of the aftermath of the Second World War \u2014 a\nworld different in many ways from today\u2019s world. That\nis why my delegation has welcomed with total\ncommitment reforms in the United Nations system to\nreflect the realities of today\u2019s world, and we will\ncontinue to participate fully in the reform process.\nWe welcome the outcome document (resolution\n60/1) of last week\u2019s summit and applaud the\nnegotiations that led to its adoption by consensus. The\nsuccess of those negotiations indicate that, in spite of\nour differences and individual sovereign interests,\nMember States recognize that we have more things in\ncommon than things that divide us and that, for a better\nworld, common interests must enjoy precedence over\nindividual interests.\nThe rhetoric that has accompanied the outcome\ndocument has been impressive and reassuring,\nespecially for developing countries and countries in\nconflict or emerging from conflict. If those soothing\nstatements are matched by action, this year\u2019s United\nNations summit and General Assembly session will\nhave a landmark effect on the Organization and on the\nworld. We are optimistic that it will.\nThis is the last Assembly session before the\ncompletion of the withdrawal of the United Nations\nMission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) at the end of\nDecember. UNAMSIL has achieved successes that are\nunique in the history of United Nations peacekeeping\nefforts. Sierra Leoneans will forever remember the\npositive difference that the Mission made in their\n2\n\ncountry\u2019s crisis and in their lives. For that, we can\nnever sufficiently thank the United Nations and the\nentire international community for coming to our\nrescue and for standing by us when we could not stand\nalone. In particular, we are profoundly grateful to\ncountries that contributed troops to UNAMSIL and\ncountries that financially supported the Mission.\nWith a tremendous feeling of relief, we welcome\nthe proposal to constitute an integrated United Nations\noffice to succeed UNAMSIL, with the objective of\nsupporting Sierra Leone in continuing to address\ncritical areas of concern, including the causes of the\nconflict, consolidating the peace, human rights,\ndevelopment, legal, judicial and governance reforms,\nthe rule of law and security. That measure has allayed\nthe fears of Sierra Leoneans that UNAMSIL\u2019s\ndeparture would create a security vacuum and would\nmark the end of programmes associated with the\nMission. We eagerly look forward to yet another\nsuccess in the United Nations peacekeeping experiment\nin Sierra Leone.\nToday, the Organization is preparing to transform\nits peacekeeping functions in Sierra Leone to meet\nsome of the post-conflict needs of the country. That is\na landmark decision that could serve as a model for\neffective coordination of strategies and programmes\namong the United Nations, its agencies and\nprogrammes, and organizations and development\npartners in countries emerging from conflict.\nWe note with interest that the architecture and\nplans for the operation of the new integrated office\nwere based on close and extensive cooperation among\nrelevant parties of the United Nations Secretariat and\nvarious United Nations agencies and organizations that\nconstituted the country team. Sierra Leone hopes that\nthat process of consultation and cooperation will\ncontinue. We urge the United Nations Mission to work\nclosely with existing national institutions and with\nother initiatives that we have set up over the past five\nyears to tackle post-conflict problems. We have no\ndoubt that the new office will provide a \u201cguinea pig\u201d\nfor the work of the proposed United Nations\nPeacebuilding Commission, to which we will spare no\neffort to lend support.\nAs members are aware, it is not enough to\nestablish these short-term yet essential post-conflict\nbridges; what we desperately need is the mobilization\nof resources, including those required for capacity-\nbuilding for sustainable economic and social\ndevelopment. The objective is not merely to ensure that\nSierra Leone and other countries emerging from\nconflict do not slide back into conflict; rather, the\nultimate objective must be to ensure that Sierra\nLeoneans do not remain in abject poverty.\nThe creation of the Peacebuilding Commission\nwill be in consonance with the views expressed by my\ncountry\u2019s President five years ago when, from this\nrostrum at the Millennium Summit, he spoke about the\nimperative of adaptation by the United Nations. He\npleaded with the Organization to continue to adapt and\nequip itself to deal with the perennial problems and\nnew manifestations of human insecurity and\nunderdevelopment. He also spoke about some of the\nways in which Sierra Leone had tested the capacity of\nthe United Nations to adapt itself to respond to local\nand global challenges.\nThe three main elements \u2014 development, peace\nand security and human rights \u2014 highlighted in the\nSecretary-General\u2019s report entitled \u201cIn larger freedom\u201d\n(A/59/2005) and in the outcome document (resolution\n60/1) of last week\u2019s High-level Plenary Meeting are all\ninterrelated. However, as the document states,\ndevelopment is a central goal by itself. That is why no\none should be surprised at the importance that Sierra\nLeone \u2014 a poor country emerging from a devastating\nconflict \u2014 attaches to the development cluster of the\noutcome document, including the section on ways in\nwhich to meet the special needs of Africa.\nThe people of Sierra Leone continue to attach\nimportance to the Millennium Development Goals\n(MDGs) and to the commitments our heads of State or\nGovernment made in the Assembly five years ago. The\nprincipal purpose of the just-concluded High-level\nPlenary Meeting was to renew our determination to\nfulfil those commitments.\nThe General Assembly would be interested to\nknow that the food security objective of ensuring by\nthe year 2007 that no Sierra Leonean goes to bed\nhungry is consistent with, and directly linked to, the\nMDGs; so are the objectives embodied in our Poverty\nReduction Strategy Paper. We are determined to\ncontinue to work with our development partners to\nachieve those objectives.\nFor the overwhelming majority of us, \u201cfreedom\nfrom want\u201d means the collective national and\ninternational responsibility to eradicate extreme\n3\n\npoverty, the collective responsibility to ensure that\npeople in all regions of the world enjoy, first and\nforemost, their human right to food, basic health care,\neducation, clean water and other amenities that sustain\nlife. As we see it, \u201cfreedom from fear\u201d means the\ncollective responsibility of all States to remove and\neliminate threats to the safety and security of people\neverywhere, such as the illicit traffic and use of small\narms and the accumulation of nuclear and other\nweapons of mass destruction. \u201cFreedom from want\u201d\nand \u201cfreedom from fear\u201d also imply the responsibility\nto accept without reservation the relationship between\ndisarmament and development.\nFurthermore, \u201cfreedom to live in dignity\u201d implies\nthe collective responsibility of all States to ensure that\ntheir peoples are treated with dignity. This includes the\nprotection of all the economic, social, cultural, political\nand civil rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration\nof Human Rights. In our view, that responsibility\nimplies cooperation and assistance where necessary to\nenhance the capacity for prevention and protection. In\nthis connection, Sierra Leone is grateful for the\nassistance it continues to receive from the United\nNations in the field of human rights.\nSierra Leone has continued to make giant strides\nin all areas of human endeavour since the end of armed\nconflict in 2002. Since then, presidential,\nparliamentary and local elections \u2014 the latter ushering\nin a revival of local government that had been dormant\nfor nearly 30 years \u2014 have been held in conformity\nwith democratic principles and practice. We are now\npreparing for the 2007 presidential and parliamentary\nelections to consolidate further our gains in the\ndemocratic process.\nSierra Leone believes that children are the best\ninvestment to ensure a bright future for our country.\nConsequently, we hold the view that development and\nrespect for human rights start with them and that the\nMillennium Development Goals are a critical tool for\nachieving those goals. That is why we have increased\nthe space devoted to education, as indicated by\nenrolment figures that have jumped from 659,503 in\nthe 2001-2002 academic year to 1,158,399 in 2003-\n2004 \u2014 this in a country whose total population is\n5 million.\nWe believe that the sound administration of\njustice, in particular strict adherence to the rule of law\nand human rights, is indispensable to attaining durable\npeace and political stability. Accordingly, the\nGovernment has re-established civil authority\nthroughout Sierra Leone through the reopening and\nstrengthening of judicial and law enforcement\ninstitutions, and we are in the process of establishing a\nnational human rights commission.\nTwo transitional institutions, the Truth and\nReconciliation Commission, which has just published\nits report, and the Special Court, have contributed\nimmensely to the peace process. It is the Government\u2019s\nintention to implement the Commission\u2019s\nrecommendations, to which we attach great importance\nas a crucial instrument of durable peace.\nLet me take this opportunity to appeal to the\nUnited Nations, the international community and our\nfriends to support the Special Court to enable it to\naccomplish its mandate.\nThere is no doubt that the United Nations and the\ninternational community have made important strides\nin addressing impunity. However, it is our belief that\nthe international community should do more than\nsupport the international tribunals, truth and\nreconciliation commissions and other mechanisms of a\ntransitional justice system. It is our fervent hope that\nthe process of peace and reconciliation in Sierra Leone\nwill not end with the report of the Truth and\nReconciliation Commission or the end of the work of\nthe Special Court. Reconciliation would be incomplete\nwithout addressing the special needs of the victims of\nthe heinous crimes that were perpetrated on civilians\nduring the armed conflict.\nI solemnly appeal to the international community\nto assist us in supporting victims of war crimes and\ncrimes against humanity. Within its limited resources,\nthe Government has made every effort to address the\nspecial needs of the victims of the heinous crimes\ncommitted during the 11-year rebel armed conflict. But\nwe need international support for these victims\nthrough, for instance, the Special Fund for War Victims\nenvisaged under the 1999 Lom\u00e9 Peace Agreement and\nthe National Commission for War-Affected Children.\nThis address would be incomplete without\nreference to the security situation in the West African\nsubregion. While Sierra Leone is enjoying relative\npeace and stability and the capacity of its security\nforces continues to be enhanced by the International\nMilitary Advisory and Training Team, there is still an\nair of uncertainty in the neighbourhood and the\n4\n\nsubregion. Because of the porosity of the borders and\nthe historically fluid nature of the conflict in the\nsubregion, we will feel safe and secure only in a\nconflict-free region.\nIn the light of this, I would like to appeal to the\nUnited Nations, the international community and our\nfriends to continue to support measures to resolve the\nconflicts that have plagued the subregion for so long\nand diverted scarce resources and energy from\ndevelopment. But let me remind members about the\nimperative of recognizing the fact that the achievement\nof lasting peace requires wholesome measure for the\nentire subregion. In particular, we recommend a\nsubregional approach by the United Nations, the\nAfrican Union, the European Union, the Economic\nCommunity of West African States and other interested\nparties to post-conflict activities, including\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration,\nsecurity-sector reform and post-conflict peacebuilding.\nFinally, at the time of the debate of the sixtieth\nsession of the General Assembly, we should be\nreminded that the United Nations is and should remain\nat the centre of efforts to harmonize activities to attain\nits common objectives. This Organization belongs to us\nall and operates in the larger interest of all its\nmembers. Let this sixtieth anniversary be a time for\nrecommitment to the principles and purposes of the\nCharter, a time for renewed determination to build on\nthe successes of this great Organization."

        "file_text": "At the\noutset, allow me, on behalf of the people and\nGovernment of Togo and on my own behalf, to extend\nour warmest congratulations to you, Sir, on your\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at\nits sixtieth session. I also assure you of the support and\ncooperation of the Togolese delegation, confident as I\nam that your experience and outstanding qualities will\nprove to be a major asset in ensuring that our work at\nthis session will be commensurate with the great stakes\nand global challenges that we must meet together.\nI also convey to your predecessor, Mr. Jean Ping,\nour deep appreciation for the immense work he\nundertook with marvellous enthusiasm throughout his\nmandate. With commitment and insight, the qualities of\na seasoned diplomat in service to his country, Gabon,\nand to Africa, he effectively guided the work of the\npreceding session, including the debates held in recent\ndays on the Millennium Development Goals.\nI also take this opportunity to pay vibrant tribute\nto the Secretary-General, our brother Kofi Annan,\nwhose commitment to the United Nations and to the\ngreat causes and noble ideals it embodies has allowed\nus to register critical progress in improving the quality\nand effectiveness of the United Nations operations. I\npledge him my country's full support in the ongoing\nmission we have entrusted to him, which he has carried\nout with competence, serenity, resolve and humanism.\nThe United Nations is now at a crossroads. The\nchallenges that continue to face the world - in\nparticular the ongoing conflicts that are ravaging many\ncountries and regions around the world; the pandemics,\nfloods and natural disasters; the terrible dangers that\nthreaten the environment and the ecosystem; famine in\nvarious places, particularly in Africa, caused by\ndrought and climate change; and the growing gulf\nbetween the wealthy countries and those afflicted by\nunderdevelopment - require greater solidarity, the\nurgent reform of our Organization, and the adaptation\nof its bodies and operations to the new international\ncontext.\nMy country, Togo, will therefore firmly support\nthe United Nations reform process, as outlined in the\nreport of the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges\nand Change, entitled \\\"A more secure world: our shared\nresponsibility\\\" (A/59/565). Indeed, we absolutely must\nreaffirm certain fundamental principles and ideals that\nguided the founding fathers of the United Nations. We\nmust devise strategies and working methods that are\nbolder and better adapted to the scope and seriousness\nof problems that cannot be effectively resolved except\nin the framework of this Organization, a symbol of\nsolidarity and brotherhood among States and peoples.\nWe need to pursue and step up our fight against\npoverty and hunger, the lack of education, gender\ninequality, child mortality, disease, environmental\ndegradation, and devastating and lethal conflicts.\nI take this opportunity, on behalf of the\nGovernment and people of Togo, to convey our deep\ngratitude and thanks to the community of States\nrepresented here for its many expressions of support\nand sympathy for our country after the unexpected\n29\n\ndemise of President Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyadema and in the\ncontext of Togo's difficulties in the wake of his death.\nVery fortunately, Togo has emerged from that\nperiod of unrest and instability. Calm and serenity now\nreign and promise a new era of hope for our country. In\nfact, in spite of the tension and violence that marked\nthe electoral process, Togo has continued since then to\nmake tangible progress in peacefully reorganizing its\nsocial and political life. The representatives of all\npolitical persuasions and civil society have together\nestablished a Government of national unity. Moreover,\nin accordance with our desire for openness and\ndialogue, we have launched consultations with the\nTogolese political class and civil society in order to\nreach a broad consensus and mobilization in managing\nthe process of national reconciliation and in efforts to\nensure the return and reintegration of refugees. The\nconsultations also mark the onset of a political\ndialogue that will allow us, through joint effort, to\nagree on electoral reform, the reorganization of\nregulatory bodies and institutions, and the stages and\nschedule of legislative elections.\nSafeguarding human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms, enshrining the values and practices of\ndemocracy, and strengthening the rule of law and good\ngovernance are at the heart of the 22 commitments that\nmy country approved on 14 April 2004 with the\nEuropean Union. They are also at the very core of our\naction and of the demands and expectations of my\nfellow citizens. Immediately following the\nestablishment of the Government, we therefore adopted\nbold measures and initiatives in various sectors.\nA special independent national commission of\ninquiry was created to investigate the violence and\nvandalism committed during the electoral process.\nSimilarly, Togolese authorities at all levels have fully\ncooperated with the United Nations fact-find mission\nmandated to look into the violence and allegations of\nhuman rights violations committed between 5 February\nand 5 May 2005. The mission's conclusions and\nrecommendations, which I believe will be useful and\npromising, will be considered in a spirit of open-\nmindedness and with a view to correcting potential\nareas of weakness so that we may never again\nexperience acts of violence in future elections in Togo.\nIn an effort to restore calm and reduce tension, all\npersons detained for their suspected involvement and\nresponsibility in acts of violence, atrocities, pillaging\nof property and ransacking of buildings during the\nelections have been released. Also, with a view to\nstrengthening citizens' confidence in the Republic's\ninstitutions, we have just launched a wide-ranging\nprogramme to reform the justice system.\nToday, we reaffirm that democracy spurs the\nharmonious and sustainable socio-economic\ndevelopment of Togo. In that respect, effectiveness and\ntransparency in the management of the affairs of the\ncapital and respect for human rights are important\nresponsibilities of the Government of Togo.\nHowever, it is clear that the young democracy of\nTogo needs the international community's support in\norder to help democracy to take firm root and to\nstrengthen peace and stability in West Africa. I take\nthis opportunity to express once again the gratitude of\nthe people of Togo to the African Union and the\nEconomic Community of West African States for their\nassistance to Togo during such a crucial period.\nBuilding a State where the rule of law prevails is\na long-term effort; it is achieved gradually and requires\nconsolidation at each step. That is true for all great\ndemocracies. I therefore call on all our development\npartners to support Togo in its steadfast and\nirreversible march towards a democratic, law-based\nState in which all Togolese can fully exercise their\nfundamental rights and can act, think and create in\ncomplete freedom.\nIn conclusion, I would like to underline once\nagain the merits of international solidarity, in particular\nbetween the prosperous countries and the developing\ncountries. In fact, we live in an increasingly\ninterdependent world that faces multiple threats and\nchallenges. Those threats spare no State, large or small,\nand make it imperative that we take coordinated and\nunited action, in particular in those situations that\njeopardize international peace and security.\nAfrica, in particular, remains a zone of conflicts\nand instability, and this exacerbates the feelings of\nhelplessness and distress among our peoples. We\nwelcome the engagement and the support of the\ninternational community, in particular in Cote d'Ivoire,\nthe Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes region.\nWe welcome encouraging signs in the peace\nprocess in Burundi. However, we call on the United\nNations and the international community to remain\nvigilant and active in helping the brotherly people of\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, whose country\n30\n\nis moving towards stability and the completion of its\nelectoral process.\nCote d'Ivoire must quickly return to the path of\npeace and harmony in order to pursue a leading role in\nthe efforts for political and economic integration in\nWest Africa.\nBut we believe that it would be wise to take\ntimely action to address the causes of those conflicts,\nrather than intervene at a later date to deal with the\noften devastating consequences. We should therefore\nreflect together on how to address the root causes of\nthose situations.\nThat leads me to make two suggestions for the\nAssembly to ponder.\nFirst, regarding institutions, Africa must put in\nplace democratic institutions of a new kind, founded on\nthe value of dialogue and the ongoing search for\ncompromise and consensus, closer to our tradition of\ndiscussion than to the imposition of the majority\ndecision.\nSecond, we need to strengthen the management\ncapabilities of States whose administration is still weak\nin order to improve the quality and the effectiveness of\nthe public and administrative services, thus putting the\nState at the service of its citizens.\nI hope that our Organization will strengthen its\naction to make national administrations more effective\nand more accessible for citizens. By doing so, the\nUnited Nations would further realize its vocation as an\nirreplaceable forum for dialogue and solidarity in the\nservice of humanity, the well-being of peoples and the\nmaintenance of international peace and security."

        "file_text": "I wish first of all to\ncongratulate Mr. Jan Eliasson on his election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixtieth\nsession. We are convinced that, given his extensive\nexperience in international relations, this session will\nhave a fruitful outcome. My delegation pledges its\nsupport and full cooperation in his endeavours for the\nsuccess of this historic session. I should like also to\nconvey to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, deep\nappreciation for his efforts in promoting the noble\nideals and causes of our Organization.\nThe strength of our Organization lies in its\nuniversality and legitimacy, anchored in the Charter of\nthe United Nations and in the fundamental principles\nof international law. Among these cardinal principles\nare respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and\n8\n\nequality of States, non-interference in their internal\naffairs and the non-use or threat of use of force.\nInternational issues today are of such a scale and\ncomplexity that they can be resolved only through\nmultilateralism and by collective action founded on the\nvalues of solidarity and universality, as embodied in\nthe United Nations. Only by working together can we\nhope to discharge our responsibilities. We must at the\nsame time ensure the Organization\u2019s credibility by\nadapting it to the global realities of the twenty-first\ncentury.\nThe High-level Plenary Meeting provided a\nuseful impetus towards meeting the goals and\nchallenges of the twenty-first century. The outcome\ndocument of the 2005 world summit included measures\nto strengthen the United Nations. My delegation wishes\nto underscore the need to preserve and promote the\ncentrality of the General Assembly as the highest\ndeliberative and decision-making organ of the United\nNations. Myanmar also agrees that the Security\nCouncil should be reformed to reflect world realities so\nas to be more effective. Since the Council has primary\nresponsibility for world peace and security, the process\nof its expansion should be managed with the utmost\nseriousness. Any decision in that respect should be\narrived on the basis of the broadest possible agreement\nof the membership.\nIn the context of the reform process, we must\navoid the introduction of new concepts that have no\nbasis either in the Charter or in international law.\nAcceptance of such concepts would go against the\nprinciples of sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-\ninterference, which form the very basis of the system\nof international relations.\nI am happy to see that the outcome document\ncontains elements that we hold dear. The document\nunderscores in particular the obligation of all Member\nStates to refrain from the threat or use of force in any\nmanner inconsistent with the Charter of the United\nNations. Charter provisions provide the necessary\nprinciples for the use of force as a last resort. We have\nalways strongly held the view that Article 51 of the\nCharter, which deals with the right of individual or\ncollective self-defence, should not be rewritten or\nreinterpreted.\nWe believe, however, that there some areas\nremain that should be further revisited in order to\naddress our concerns.\nRegarding the establishment of the Peacebuilding\nCommission as an intergovernmental advisory body,\nwe feel strongly that there must be adequate\nrepresentation by developing countries in the\nOrganizational Committee. Developing countries have\na strong case, since they are major contributors of\nmilitary personnel and civilian police to United\nNations missions.\nIn strengthening human rights mechanisms, we\nmust address the root causes of problems, namely, the\nuse of selectivity, double standards and politicization.\nIt must be borne in mind that the Charter places human\nrights in the context of international cooperation.\nDuring this session, we will be considering the\nmandate, modalities, function, size, composition,\nmembership, working methods and procedures of the\nenvisaged Human Rights Council. Given the\nimportance that we all place on human rights,\ndeveloping countries must play an active role in the\nnegotiation process. We would like to see the initiation\nof open, transparent and inclusive negotiations at an\nearly date.\nThe threats we face today do not respect national\nboundaries; they are interconnected and complex.\nTerrorism, illicit drug trafficking, transnational\norganized crime, weapons of mass destruction, poverty\nand hunger, and the alarming spread of highly\ninfectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis\nand malaria are some of the threats we can ignore only\nat our peril. Efforts and strategies to tackle\ntransnational issues need to be coordinated at all levels\nand carried out with the necessary respect for the\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of States.\nMy country is a State party to the United Nations\nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime and\nits supplementary Protocols to Prevent, Suppress and\nPunish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and\nChildren, and against the Smuggling of Migrants by\nLand, Sea and Air. It has enacted legislation to control\nmoney laundering and to render mutual legal assistance\nto combat transnational crime. It is a State party to\nalmost all of the United Nations conventions on\nterrorism. It has also actively participated in regional\nand international efforts against international crime.\nMyanmar is against all forms and manifestations\nof terrorism. Myanmar is of the view that terrorism\nshould be combated in accordance with international\nlaw and obligations. The issue should not be used as a\n9\n\npretext for intervention in the internal affairs of other\nStates.\nSixty years after the Second World War, the\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction,\nparticularly of nuclear weapons, remains a formidable\nchallenge. Nuclear proliferation is on the increase, and\nthere is also considerable concern that non-State actors\ncould gain access to such materials and technologies.\nAll States must take action in a multilateral framework\nto make substantive progress towards disarmament,\nincluding nuclear disarmament, and nuclear-weapon\nStates should reaffirm their commitment to negative\nsecurity assurances vis-\u00e0-vis non-nuclear States. The\noutcome document, however, failed to address the\nimportant issue of disarmament and non-proliferation.\nThis is an issue of great importance, and we should\nmake every effort to ensure that this vital issue is not\nsidelined in international forums.\nAt the twentieth special session of the General\nAssembly, on narcotic drugs, it was emphasized that no\nsingle State can combat the scourge of narcotic drugs\non its own. In my country, the problem of narcotic\ndrugs is a bitter colonial legacy. We have therefore\nmade the elimination of narcotic drugs a national\nresponsibility and have formulated strategies and\ntactics to end the problem of opium poppy cultivation\nthrough a 15-year comprehensive plan and the\nsupplementary New Destiny Project. These efforts\nhave resulted in a drastic reduction in opium poppy\nproduction. As a result, the United Nations Office on\nDrugs and Crime (UNODC) reported a 73 per cent\ndecline between 1996 and 2004. Myanmar\u2019s efforts to\neradicate poppy cultivation, opium and heroin\nproduction and drug trafficking and abuse complement\nthe objectives set forth by the United Nations.\nMyanmar is also taking urgent measures with its\nneighbouring countries to exercise control over\nillegally trafficked precursor chemicals used in the\nproduction of synthetic drugs. We have developed\nbilateral, trilateral and multilateral cooperation in the\nsubregional, regional and international contexts.\nWorld leaders pledged in the Millennium\nDeclaration that the world of 2015 would be better than\nthe one in which we live today. They made a solemn\ncommitment to implement the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). To achieve the MDGs,\nboth the developed and the developing countries must\nact in a cooperative manner. The developed countries,\nin particular, must fulfil their commitments and meet\nthe internationally agreed official development\nassistance target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national\nproduct. Debt relief must also be provided to\ndeveloping countries, including grant-based financing\nand 100 per cent debt cancellation.\nIn Myanmar, we are making satisfactory progress\ntowards reaching the Millennium Development Goals\nby 2015. In our drive to eradicate poverty we have\nachieved significant results through the designation of\n24 special development zones in the states and\ndivisions of the country, in order to achieve equitable\nand balanced development throughout the country.\nMyanmar is endeavouring to achieve development\nmainly relying on its own resources without assistance,\nparticularly from international financial institutions.\nWith external financial assistance, however, our\ndevelopment efforts can be accelerated.\nMyanmar is a multi-ethnic nation comprising\nover 100 races. Immediately after independence, the\ncountry had to face the scourge of insurgency. This has\nposed a serious impediment to our national\ndevelopment endeavours. Based on the bitter lessons of\nthe past, we have today embarked on a programme to\nmake law, order and national stability prevail. As we\nare able to build peace and stability, we have been able\nto focus our attention on economic development,\ngiving priority to human resource development. While\nendeavouring to achieve comprehensive development\nof the country, we are at the same time implementing a\nseven-step political programme for a smooth transition\nto a democratic State.\nIn this regard, understanding and support from\nthe international community would enable us to\nachieve our cherished goal more expeditiously.\nUnwarranted pressures will, however, delay our\nprogress. We, for our part, are resolute in our\ndetermination to achieve our goal of establishing a\nmodern democratic State.\nMyanmar is poised on the threshold of a new era.\nWe are at a point when all our attention must be\ndevoted to crossing the threshold and entering a new\nera."

        "file_text": "It is my firm opinion that\nwe achieved important results at our summit. We\ncreated a peacebuilding commission and agreed to\nestablish a human rights council. We have good\nlanguage on development, including unanimous\nagreement on the Millennium Development Goals, and\nwe agreed on the responsibility to protect. We made\nprogress towards consensus on the fight against\nterrorism and agreed on some essential management\nand reform issues.\nSome have expressed disappointment about the\nresults of the summit and, indeed, not all of our\nambitions were achieved. Does that imply that it is\nwrong to be ambitious? Of course not. In a world\nsociety of 191 Member States, we must accept that the\nend result of negotiations will always reflect a\ncompromise between different ambitions, and that we\nhave to be tolerant of each other\u2019s diverse views and\ninterests.\nAs regards my own country\u2019s expectations, it is a\nmatter of concern that we did not agree on any\nmeasures to counter the proliferation of weapons of\nmass destruction \u2014 one of the greatest threats to\nhumankind. We had also hoped for more specific\nagreement on the modalities for the human rights\ncouncil and would have preferred clear parameters for\nthe use of force, as well as solid language on the\nInternational Criminal Court. And the Netherlands\nwould have liked to give the Secretary-General more\nscope to carry out his management responsibilities.\nBut all in all, we have made clear progress. So let\nus now agree to remain ambitious, to move forward\nwith implementing the programme we have agreed, and\nto allow the United Nations to deliver on our promises.\nI look forward to the outline of work the President of\nthis Assembly has announced, and I fully support the\naccountability pact with which the Secretary-General\nhas challenged us.\nWe have also achieved something else, something\nless apparent but equally important. We have\nreaffirmed our political and moral support for a\nfundamental underlying principle, namely, that we\nneed to build bridges through dialogue and cooperation\nand that we have to promote respect and tolerance. And\nwe all share the conviction that, in promoting respect\nand tolerance across the globe, the United Nations has\na central role to play.\nAccording to a well-known saying, there is only\none thing we cannot tolerate, and that is intolerance.\nIndeed, the struggle to protect tolerance from\nintolerance is one of the great challenges of our time.\nIt is in the interest of all States to take up the\nfight against radical ideologies that turn people into\nterrorists. Terrorism, as we all know, is a cross-border\nthreat. People of all persuasions and beliefs are its\ninnocent victims. And so we must respond collectively,\nboth to terrorism and to the radical ideologies that feed\nand breed it. Rwanda and the wars in the former\nYugoslavia are sharp reminders of how the political use\nof intolerant and racist rhetoric can even lead to\ngenocide or ethnic cleansing.\nStill, I do not believe there is or will be a clash of\ncivilizations. But there is a clash between the tolerant\nand the intolerant within and across our societies,\nwithin and across our civilizations.\nThat is why it is now so important to take on the\nradical ideologies that foster violent extremism.\nSecurity Council resolution 1624 (2005), calling on all\nStates to prohibit, by law, incitement to commit a\nterrorist act or acts, sends an important message to the\nhate-mongers.\nTo fight an effective battle against violent\nextremism and terrorism, we must strike a careful\nbalance between judicial and police measures, on the\none hand, and meaningful dialogue on the other. Let us\nlearn from each other in that respect. I believe that peer\nreview in the human rights council could, in future,\nhelp us all to maintain that careful balance.\nLet us invest in a global culture of tolerance and\nmutual respect. We must not look at cultural, religious\nand ideological differences as unbridgeable divides\nseparating adversaries. Instead, we should join forces\nfor a global society in which the quest for greater unity\ngoes hand in hand with respect for diversity.\n22\n\nThe best way for societies to protect tolerance is\nfor them to treasure their identity and, at the same\ntime, dare to reassess the validity of their prevailing\nnorms and standards. Recent events in the Netherlands,\nfor example, have confronted our society with the\nquestion of how to protect our centuries-old tradition\nof tolerance from those who would abuse it to sow\nhatred and division. That process of reflection is an\nongoing one, but part of the answer is to constantly\nremind ourselves that it is wrong to hold an entire\ncommunity accountable for the deeds of individuals.\nLet us all vow to protect tolerance from\nintolerance. Let us invest in mutual respect and try to\nchange the mindset of those who propagate intolerance\nand violent extremism. That will require permanent\ndialogue, with a central role for the United Nations, the\nonly truly global platform we possess.\nSerious dialogue can also help to clear up\nmisunderstandings. One of the most striking\nmisunderstandings concerns the nature of secularism,\nby which I mean the separation of State and religious\ninstitutions. That separation protects the freedom of all\ncitizens of all religious backgrounds, as well as of\npeople who do not practice any religion. In the\nNetherlands, as elsewhere, politicians and political\nparties may be inspired by religion, as long as the\ninstitutions remain separate.\nThat is precisely why, in my country and across\nthe European continent, there is a place for Islam, just\nas there is a place for other religions. There is a place\nfor any form of Islam that allows believers to be both\nMuslims and citizens of a democratic society.\nCitizenship means more than just holding a\npassport. True citizenship calls for an active\ncontribution to the society of which one is a part. It\nalso calls for a society that is open to the many and\nvaried contributions of all its citizens. Radical\nideologies that push people to isolate themselves from\nthe rest of society and to reject or even attack the spirit\nof democracy will run up against our determined\nrefusal to give even one inch, in my country and, I\nhope, everywhere. For intolerance is a global, cross-\nborder phenomenon, which is why we so urgently need\nthe United Nations at our side.\nUnited Nations reform will mean making good on\nour promises. It will require determined\nimplementation of the plans and proposals we have\nagreed on. If we are serious about our effort to build a\nmore humane, dignified and just world, United Nations\nreform must also strengthen the protection of tolerance\nfrom intolerance.\nIn our fast-changing world, people long for safety\nand certainty, and that is understandable. But leaders\nall over the world have a duty to explain that narrow\nworldviews, with no place for differences, can offer no\ngenuine protection. Without respect for diversity, there\ncan be no unity.\nIf we want to protect tolerance from intolerance,\nwe should look critically at what we teach our children.\nHow can we expect them to become tolerant adults if\nthey learn in school to despise people of other faiths\nand ethnicities? It is not enough for Governments to do\npolite business with other Governments; they should,\nat the same time, not allow hotbeds of intolerance to\nexist in their societies.\nThere is an old saying that we reap what we sow.\nIf we wish to reap a harvest of tolerance and mutual\nrespect, and foster a sense of common purpose, then\nwe must set to work now. Let us begin sowing the\nseeds of tolerance and mutual respect here at the\nUnited Nations, the world\u2019s main crossroads of\ncivilizations."

        "file_text": "Australia is a founding\nMember of the United Nations, and we have long\nsupported this Organization\u2019s important role in world\naffairs. The United Nations has many achievements to\ncelebrate in its sixtieth year. Equally, the sixtieth\nanniversary places the shortcomings and indeed the\nfailings of the United Nations under a microscope for\nall to see.\nIn approaching this occasion, the United Nations\nand its Members have been presented with a challenge:\nto find practical and workable ways to bring greater\nsecurity and prosperity to the people of the world\nthrough a reformed United Nations system. This has\nnot been easy. The reform agenda is simultaneously\nvast and urgent, with agreement on approaches\ndifficult \u2014 at times impossible \u2014 to achieve, as the\nrecent summit process made clear.\nAustralia welcomes the summit\u2019s progress in\nsome important areas, particularly the agreement to\nestablish a Peacebuilding Commission to assist fragile\nStates, a field of endeavour where Australia has long\nbeen active in its own region, as I have outlined in\nprevious addresses to the General Assembly. We also\nwelcome the fact that States have agreed for the first\ntime that the international community, through the\nUnited Nations, has the responsibility to act to protect\npopulations from gross and systematic violations of\nhuman rights.\nWe also welcome the call for early conclusion of\na comprehensive terrorism convention and early entry\ninto force of the International Convention for the\nSuppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.\nWe are pleased that, on development, the Summit\nOutcome (resolution 60/1) recognizes what already\nunderpins Australia\u2019s approach to development\nassistance: that good governance, sound economic\npolicies, anti-corruption measures and trade\nliberalization are critical elements in fighting poverty\nand promoting economies and stable communities.\nAustralia has a proud record of assistance in these\nareas, further underscored by our announcement last\nweek of an increase in Australia\u2019s overseas aid\nallocation to about 4 billion Australian dollars by\n2010 \u2014 a doubling of aid from 2004 levels \u2014 as well\nas generous contributions of 10 million Australian\ndollars to the Democracy Fund and 3 million to the\nPeacebuilding Fund over three years.\nAs a nation that strongly supports an ambitious\noutcome of the Doha round of multilateral trade\nnegotiations and recognizes the crucial importance of\nthis to developing countries, Australia also welcomes\nthe pledge and challenge put forward by President\nBush a week ago (see A/60/PV.2): that the United\nStates is ready to eliminate all tariffs, subsidies and\nother barriers if other nations do the same.\nBut alongside these welcome outcomes, many\nquestions and, in some cases, vast disappointments\nremain. On arms control and non-proliferation, we\nhave absolutely nothing to show \u2014 an extraordinarily\npoor outcome given a contemporary global security\nenvironment in which proliferation threats are so\nclearly evident.\nThe outdated ideology that too many delegations\nbrought to negotiations was a damningly deep\nreflection on the intergovernmental process at the\nUnited Nations. We did not grasp the opportunity\nprovided by the largest-ever gathering of world leaders\nto produce a political declaration defining acts of\nterrorism.\nHow can some nations continue to assert that the\ndeliberate maiming and targeting of civilians is\nsometimes justified?\nHow is it \u2014 after atrocities in Sharm el-Sheikh,\nIstanbul, Jakarta, Riyadh and on a daily basis in Iraq \u2014\nthat some continue to employ double standards,\ndeceiving themselves into believing that such terrorists\ncould ever be considered to be \u201cfreedom fighters\u201d?\nThis is not an argument about the merits of a\nparticular cause. It is about the moral imperative to\noutlaw behaviour that offends civilization.\nWe were disappointed that the summit missed the\nopportunity to make progress on Security Council\nreform to ensure that the Council\u2019s membership and\n5\n\nfunctioning match the priorities and the realities of this\ncentury.\nWhile the summit resolved to create a Human\nRights Council, the outcome document is\ndisappointingly short on detail. A new Human Rights\nCouncil must overcome the credibility deficit that\nplagues current human rights machinery and that sees\nsome of the most egregious human rights abusers\nelevated to positions of leadership.\nAustralia will participate constructively in\nnegotiations on the shape of this new Council. We will\nalso more than double \u2014 to $650,000 \u2014 our\ncontribution to the Office of the High Commissioner\nfor Human Rights.\nFinally, the management reforms agreed at the\nsummit are a step in the right direction, but they are\njust that \u2014 one step.\nThe Secretary-General needs more authority and\nflexibility to manage the United Nations. And \u2014 as\nrecent inquiries have highlighted in sobering detail \u2014\nthe United Nations accountability, audit and oversight\nsystems must be massively strengthened. It will not be\neasy, but we must address anew our failures.\nThe summit heralded an historic shift in our\nthinking on humanitarian intervention, showing a\nwillingness to embrace a new mindset, one which\naddresses our responsibility to watch out for each other\nin times of need \u2014 our collective \u201cresponsibility to\nprotect\u201d. Too often the world has stood by watching\nhumanitarian disasters unfold before international\nmachinery has creaked into action.\nIn Somalia, Bosnia, Rwanda and Kosovo, action\ntaken was too little, too late. Today, the situation in\nDarfur epitomizes those shortcomings.\nAs the Summit Outcome makes clear, all States\nhave a responsibility to protect their own population\nfrom egregious crimes such as genocide and crimes\nagainst humanity. Where a population is suffering\nserious harm, and the relevant State is unwilling or\nunable to stop this, the principle of non-intervention\nshould yield to the collective responsibility to protect.\nThe Security Council must now rely on this new\nconsensus to respond more effectively to humanitarian\ncrises.\nWe have a responsibility to react faster to\nsituations of compelling human need, and we must do\nmore to help countries rebuild, recover and reconcile\nafter conflicts or disasters.\nIn the last year we have seen the people of\nAfghanistan and Iraq exercise restored democratic\nrights. The international community must continue\nsupport for their transformations, help them to leave\nbehind the experience of brutal dictators and narrow\nregimes, and ensure that progress and democracy take\nroot.\nCeding any ground in Iraq or Afghanistan to the\ntyranny of terrorism and the violent suffering it brings\nwould be a backward step in our global campaign, a\ncampaign we continue to fight but have not yet won, as\nthe July terrorist attacks in London and the ongoing\nterrorist menace in South-East Asia and elsewhere\nmake clear. There remains an urgent need for nations to\ncome together to confront terrorists in the battle of\nideas, contest extremist ideologies, and build greater\nand more productive dialogue between faiths and\ncivilizations.\nAustralia is doing its utmost in our region to\ntackle terrorism and the ideology that feeds it. United\nNations machinery must also play a part. Many\nMember States still need assistance to implement\nUnited Nations counter-terrorism standards and build\ntheir counter-terrorism capabilities \u2014 the kind of\noutcomes Australia is already pursuing in cooperation\nwith its regional partners. Leaders made some progress\nin this direction last week but did not adopt the\nSecretary-General\u2019s counter-terrorism strategy.\nAustralia welcomed the General Assembly\u2019s\nadoption of the International Convention for the\nSuppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism in April this\nyear. Our Prime Minister, John Howard, signed that\nConvention for Australia at the summit. It is now\nimperative that we redouble our efforts to conclude a\ncomprehensive convention against terrorism during\nthis session of the General Assembly. Closing the gaps\nin the counter-terrorism legal framework is an essential\ncomplement to our concerted efforts to prevent future\nattacks and to prosecute those who commit terrorist\nacts. Effective international efforts to criminalize such\nacts are a vital step forward.\nThe world today is confronted by a menace not\nenvisaged at the time the Geneva Conventions were\ndrafted \u2014 terrorist organizations and their foot\nsoldiers, like those captured in Afghanistan, who bear\narms on a battlefield but pay no heed to the laws of\n6\n\nwar, fight for no regular army, wear no uniform and\nbear no recognizable insignia. Just as international law\nevolved to deal with a scourge of another age \u2014\npiracy \u2014 so today a comprehensive convention against\nterrorism is needed to help deal with these perpetrators\nof terrorist acts.\nThe summit was a lost opportunity on\ndisarmament and non-proliferation. Multilateral non-\nproliferation regimes are being tested now by a small\nminority of Governments that flout the norms and\nstandards observed by the rest of the international\ncommunity and which in doing so imperil the security\nof us all.\nA dangerous new dimension to this global\nchallenge is the known ambition of terrorists to acquire\nweapons of mass destruction. It is therefore imperative\nthat we take practical action against proliferation as it\noccurs, through innovative measures such as the\nProliferation Security Initiative that complement and\nreinforce multilateral regimes.\nEarlier this year I saw firsthand the Review\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons be thwarted by\na few countries determined to prevent consensus.\nAustralia \u2014 together with the overwhelming\nmajority of States \u2014 remains unwavering in its support\nfor the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and we will continue\nto take a leading role in universalizing the Additional\nProtocol on strengthening nuclear safeguards, making\nit a precondition for the supply of uranium to non-\nnuclear-weapon States.\nIt is not acceptable, in the current global climate,\nthat we have not started negotiations on a fissile\nmaterial cut-off treaty, a treaty which would reduce the\nrisk of leakage of fissile material to proliferators or\nterrorists and would buttress nuclear disarmament\ngains made to date.\nI am pleased to be chairing the Comprehensive\nTest-Ban Treaty Article XIV Conference this\nafternoon, looking for ways to accelerate that Treaty\u2019s\nentry into force.\nA firmer and more active Security Council role\non the issue of weapons of mass destruction is also\nsorely needed.\nAustralia is a committed and long-term supporter\nof the United Nations and of the vital role that it can\nplay in promoting international peace and security. We\nhave a proud record of contributing to United Nations\nactivities, funding and debates, extending back to its\nformation in 1945.\nBut we are not an uncritical supporter. The need\nto reform the United Nations has been a consistent\ntheme since I first addressed the General Assembly at\nits fifty-first session in 1996. Such a need is all the\nmore compelling today.\nThe reality is that there continue to be States\nfailing or in precipitous decline for no reasons other\nthan poor leadership and poor governance \u2014 with\ndisastrous results for human lives. What does it say\nwhen the international community proves to be\nunwilling to act when misrule has caused life\nexpectancy to plunge in what was one of Africa\u2019s most\npromising countries \u2014 from around 63 years in the\nearly 1990s, to just under 34 years in 2004? Would\ntoday\u2019s United Nations be able to prevent another\nRwanda?\nWe and the publics of the world expect much of\nthe United Nations, and rightly so. The stakes are too\nhigh in this complex and challenging security\nenvironment to accept anything less. We all have a part\nto play. There was some welcome progress at the\nsummit; but where we have fallen short we must\nacknowledge it and be ambitious in pursuing more\nmeaningful reform. Large challenges loom before us.\nWe should approach them with a degree of realism.\nAustralia does not believe that the United Nations is\nthe answer to all the problems of the world. But the\nOrganization does have a role to play. When we call on\nthe United Nations, it must be able to fulfil that role\neffectively and expeditiously. The publics of the world\nexpect nothing less."

        "file_text": "My delegation associates\nitself with the compliments extended to you, Sir, on\nyour election to the presidency of this session and to\nyour predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping of\nGabon.\nThe United Nations was born 60 years ago when\nthe brutality of war impressed itself on all as far\n12\n\nbeyond human comprehension and tolerance. The\nOrganization became a source of hope, founded as it\nwas on the inalienable, interlinked and mutually\ninterdependent pillars of development, human rights\nand security.\nMember States of this Organization have\nincreasingly yearned for its reform in order to make it\nmore democratic and responsive to the needs of all\nnations, rich and poor, big and small, strong and weak.\nWe should recall that the last reform of the United\nNations was in 1963, a good four decades ago. Against\nthis background, my delegation pays tribute to the\nSecretary-General for his report entitled \u201cIn larger\nfreedom: towards development, security and human\nrights for all\u201d (A/59/2005). That report formed the\nbasis for discussions by Member States as they\nprepared for the five-year review of the Millennium\nDeclaration and for this sixtieth session of the General\nAssembly. It raises critical issues regarding the reform\nof this world body to enable it to meet the challenges\nand threats of the twenty-first century \u2014 a daunting\ntask indeed.\nHowever, we have noted with regret that some\nMember States have relegated to the back burner\ncritical issues of development, giving priority instead\nto security issues, particularly the reform of the\nSecurity Council. As a result of this trend, we foresee\nan emerging, untenable and, indeed, unwarranted\nsituation with the potential to divide regions and/or\ncontinents and to adversely affect cordial relations\nbetween States.\nIn order to move in unison, the international\ncommunity should strive to advance the global\ndevelopment, human rights and security agendas\nsimultaneously. All agree that the HIV and AIDS\npandemic has emerged as a major threat to\ndevelopment, reversing, as it does, all the gains that\nhave been made so far. We all also agree that the\nravages of extreme poverty continue to haunt us.\nNeedless to say, extreme poverty constitutes a violation\nof human dignity. Armed conflicts also hamper\ndevelopment. Africa presents a classical example of\nhow those menaces compromise not only peace and\nsecurity, but also development, thus militating against\nrespect for human rights.\nIndeed, it is no coincidence that development has\nbeen one of the key objectives of most, if not all, major\nUnited Nations conferences and summits in the\neconomic, social and related fields. Hence, my\ndelegation welcomes the efforts of those donor\ncountries that have achieved the 0.7 per cent target of\ngross national income as official development\nassistance (ODA), with 0.2 per cent of gross national\nincome for the least developed countries. We also\nwelcome initiatives by some countries to set up\ntimetables for fulfilling their ODA targets. However,\nwe reiterate our appeal that developed countries abide\nby their commitments to help developing countries in\nall the relevant areas. They have to accelerate and\nincrease the flows of ODA and foreign direct\ninvestment. They also have to adopt appropriate\nmeasures to fully integrate small and vulnerable\neconomies into the multilateral trading system, cancel\ndebt, transfer technology, render financial and\ntechnical assistance and provide capacity-building\nprogrammes for developing countries.\nOn this auspicious occasion, my delegation\nexpresses sincere appreciation for all initiatives\nrecently taken to address the needs of developing\ncountries, especially the debt cancellation extended by\nthe G-8 countries to highly indebted poor countries.\nHowever, we appeal for debt cancellation for all least\ndeveloped countries in order to enable them to redirect\ntheir meagre resources to national development\nprogrammes. It is an irrefutable fact that a substantial\npercentage of the national budgets of least developed\ncountries that do not fall within the Heavily Indebted\nPoor Countries Debt (HIPC) Initiative category is\nconsumed by servicing their debts.\nLesotho supports the launching of a series of\n\u201cquick wins\u201d, as recommended by the Secretary-\nGeneral in his report, as this would go a long way\ntowards broadening commitment to the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and promoting economic\ngrowth in many developing countries. In our view, the\ncriteria for the selection of countries for the\nimplementation of the \u201cquick wins\u201d should be fair and\ntransparent.\nTerrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction to non-State actors, the existence of nuclear\nweapons, and armed conflict top the list of global\nsecurity issues. There is, therefore, an urgent need to\nconclude a comprehensive convention on terrorism.\nMy delegation hopes that the General Assembly will\nsoon initiate negotiations on an international\ninstrument to prevent the proliferation of weapons of\nmass destruction to non-State actors. We regret the fact\n13\n\nthat the 2005 Review Conference of the Parties to the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n(NPT) was not able to reach consensus. However, we\nwish to emphasize the need for all States parties to\nadhere to the three pillars of the Treaty \u2014 namely,\ndisarmament, non-proliferation and peaceful uses of\nnuclear energy. We also wish to encourage the nuclear-\nweapon States that have not yet ratified or acceded to\nthe NPT and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty to become parties to those important treaties.\nThe notorious use of small arms and light\nweapons in armed conflicts is well documented.\nLesotho therefore regrets the inability on the part of the\nOpen-ended Working Group on small arms to adopt a\nlegally binding document. We also attach great\nimportance to the issue of prevention of internal armed\nconflicts by the international community. While we\nsupport the moral obligation behind the proposed new\nconcept of the \u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d, we suggest\nthat the issue should be subjected to further\nconsideration by Member States, guided by the\nfundamental principles enshrined in the United Nations\nCharter. Needless to say, the sanctity of Article 51 of\nthe Charter should be preserved.\nThe Kingdom of Lesotho considers it the\nresponsibility of the international community, with the\nUnited Nations playing the central role, to put in place\neffective measures aimed at preventing genocide,\nethnic cleansing and the atrocities perpetrated on\nwomen and children caught up in armed conflict.\nConsequently, my delegation considers the enhanced\nrole of the major organs of the United Nations,\nparticularly the General Assembly, to be of paramount\nimportance. One of the major constraints of the United\nNations is that it lacks a mechanism designed to avoid\nState collapse and the slide into war, or to assist\ncountries in their transition from war to peace. It is\nwithin this context that Lesotho supports the proposed\nestablishment of a Peacebuilding Commission.\nIn the area of human rights, we support the\nelevation of the Commission on Human Rights to a\nHuman Rights Council, a body that would be apolitical\nand insist on the protection both of civil and political\nrights and of economic, social and cultural rights. For\nmy delegation, the flaws of the Commission lay mostly\nin its focus and not necessarily in its size.\nIt is in this twenty-first century that peace,\nsecurity, the right to self-determination, respect for all\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms must be\nguaranteed as the norm rather than the exception.\nHence, our call for the right to self-determination of\nthe Palestinian people and complete withdrawal from\ntheir occupied territories, the independence of the\nSaharawi people, the lifting of the unilateral economic\nembargo against the people of Cuba and the end to\narmed conflicts, particularly in Africa. These matters\nmust be addressed and resolved urgently,\ncomprehensively and honestly, without fear or favour,\nand without malice to anybody."

        "file_text": "We congratulate the\nPresident of the General Assembly on the assumption\nof his office. His extensive experience in multilateral\naffairs will undoubtedly be an invaluable asset in our\nwork.\nThe 2005 world summit has clearly demonstrated\nthat, in five years, we have not given poverty\neradication the highest priority on our international\nagenda.\nIt is clear that in too many countries the\nMillennium Development Goals will not be realized; in\nsome, the situation is worse than five years ago. How\nthen do we assure the marginalized people of our world\nthat we are serious about achieving the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals by the year 2015? The only way is\nby showing that there is the global political will to use\nthe outcome document as a platform for action.\nIn his report \u201cIn larger freedom\u201d, Kofi Annan\nstressed that the priority objectives of the United\nNations over the coming years should be to secure for\npeople \u201cfreedom from want\u201d and \u201cfreedom from fear\u201d.\nWhat is often not recognized is that a person who is not\nfree from want can only live in fear.\nThe greatest evil \u2014 the most effective and\nconsuming terrorism of our age \u2014 is the terrorism of\nabject poverty. It is a poverty in which millions of\npeople live in terror because they know that sooner, not\n10\n\nlater, they might die from hunger or from preventable\ndiseases.\nEvery day in our region of Central America and\nthe Caribbean, our people face threats to their human\nsecurity: from AIDS, drug trafficking, trafficking in\nhuman persons, crushing poverty and growing\ninequality.\nA new security approach is therefore required to\ncontain these threats. We must promote the\nhumanization of security rather than embark on efforts\nto militarize globalization. We must focus on stopping\nthe deaths that occur every day, most often from\npreventable causes. Global security cannot be built on\na minefield of poverty and disease.\nPrioritizing human security does not mean\nneglecting national sovereignty or State security. As\npart of our national security strategy, we remain\ncommitted to fostering a culture of peace and the\npeaceful resolution of conflicts.\nIn the Middle East, we are encouraged by the\nIsraeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. We join others\nin calling upon the Government of Israel to continue\nthe withdrawal from all Palestinian territories. We look\nforward to the implementation of its commitments in\naccordance with the road map that will lead to the\nrealization of two independent States, Palestine and\nIsrael, coexisting side by side in peace and security.\nThe 23 million people on Taiwan also deserve to\nlive in peace and security. We therefore continue to\nurge the United Nations to take up the plea of Taiwan\nto participate in this world body. Taiwan has earned its\nplace among the community of nations.\nBelize continues to be plagued by an\nanachronistic claim to its territory from our neighbour\nGuatemala. But, encouragingly, earlier this month\nBelize and Guatemala signed a new agreement under\nthe auspices of the Organization of American States.\nUnder that agreement, if we are unable to resolve the\ndispute through negotiations, the Secretary-General of\nthe Organization of American States can then\nrecommend that we submit our differences to an\ninternational juridical body. We therefore hope that we\ncan ensure the early and final resolution of this dispute,\nso that we can cooperate more effectively to combat\nour common problems of poverty and underdevelopment.\nWe all recognize that there can be no security\nwithout development. The world summit outcome\ndocument maintains the vision of development\nelaborated in the Millennium Declaration, the\nMonterrey Consensus, the Johannesburg Plan of\nImplementation and other outcomes, including the\nMauritius Strategy.\nIf we are to make measurable progress in\ndevelopment, we must urgently implement the global\npartnership for development. That global partnership\ninvolves returning development issues to the forefront\nof trade negotiations. Without a deeper commitment\nfrom developed countries to trade regimes that are\nmore just, the future of the sugar and banana industries\nin countries such as Belize hangs in the balance. We\nmust therefore spare no effort to ensure that the latest\nDoha development round concludes on terms\nfavourable to developing countries like Belize.\nAs a coastal nation with a significant population\nin low-lying areas, my country emphasizes the need for\nnew action to ensure environmental sustainability,\nparticularly as it relates to climate change. We agree\nwith the Secretary-General that:\n\u201cOne of the greatest environmental and\ndevelopment challenges in the twenty-first\ncentury will be that of controlling and coping\nwith climate change.\u201d (A/59/2005, para. 60)\nThe increased temperatures occasioned by\nclimate change are likely to lead to greater frequency\nof life-threatening weather systems. The most\nvulnerable to these changes will be small island\ndeveloping States and coastal nations like Belize. It is\ntherefore incumbent upon the international community\nto improve the framework for action to cope with\nclimate change. The eleventh session of the Conference\nof the Parties to the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change is an opportunity to\nforge wider and more inclusive cooperation to address\nthat grave danger.\nSo much of what we hope to achieve depends on\na United Nations that is effective and credible. Some\nrecent reports point to systemic problems throughout\nthe United Nations Organization. These, in our view,\nprovide evidence of an Organization that is flawed \u2014\nnot one that is irrelevant. Belize therefore continues to\nview the United Nations as an indispensable\nOrganization. It is the only global Organization that\nhas the capacity to meaningfully foster peace, security\nand sustainable development for the peoples of our\nworld.\n11\n\nBut the United Nations must reinvent itself to\nmeet the needs of today\u2019s geopolitics and unique global\nchallenges. The General Assembly and the Economic\nand Social Council must be revitalized and\nstrengthened. Similarly, the Security Council must be\nreformed to make it more accountable, inclusive and\nrepresentative of the current membership of the United\nNations.\nThe establishment of the Peacebuilding\nCommission and of the Human Rights Council are\nimportant, but we must define ways in which these\nbodies can reinforce the work of the other principal\norgans of the United Nations.\nIn the five years that have elapsed since the year\n2000, our collective lack of political will has resulted\nin the loss of millions of children, women and men to\nhunger, disease, HIV/AIDS and other preventable\ncauses. But we can halt and reverse that trend. We must\ngive a reformed United Nations, as the ultimate\nexpression of multilateralism, the means to carry out\nits mandate, as set out in Article I of the Charter: \u201cTo\nachieve international cooperation in solving international\nproblems of an economic, social, cultural or\nhumanitarian character\u201d.\nOur world is besieged by such problems. We can\ncarry out this mandate by implementing all the\ncommitments we have made since the year 2000, or we\ncan ignore them and condemn many millions more to\nlive in misery or die in pain. The choice is ours."

        "file_text": "Please accept my\ncongratulations, Sir, on your election to the presidency,\nand my assurances that Kiribati will support you during\nyour term of office. I would also like to take this\nopportunity to thank the outgoing President, Mr. Jean\nPing, for his able and effective leadership during the\nfifty-ninth session.\nDuring last week's High-level Plenary Meeting,\nwe discussed, among other issues, the future of this\nOrganization and what we expect from it. We heard about\nthe achievements made by our Organization over the past\n60 years. We express our gratitude to all nations for the\ncooperation and support that led to those achievements.\nI would like to congratulate the Secretary-General as\nwell as his staff, for his leadership of our Organization\nat these difficult and trying times.\nWe also heard about the shortcomings of our\nOrganization. While we recognize and fully endorse\nthe need for reform in the Organization, we are\nconcerned that many of the shortcomings in terms of\nthe promotion of sustainable development in Member\nnations, in particular in the small island developing\nStates, are the result of our inability to deliver on\ncommitments made in the past.\nIndividual Member nations have the prime\nresponsibility for achieving sustainable development\nwithin their borders, but with globalization and the\nincreasing interdependency of our world, individual\nnations cannot achieve sustainable development acting\nalone. To attain sustainable development in small\nisland developing States, the need for external\ncooperation and support is understandably more\npronounced.\nHaving taken stock of progress over the past 60\nyears, the challenge now is to consider measures by\nwhich we can collectively and through the United\nNations address the needs and concerns highlighted\nduring the High-level Plenary Meeting. Of particular\nconcern are the special needs of the least developed\ncountries and small island developing States.\nWhile Kiribati may be categorized as a least\ndeveloped country and a small island developing State,\nthe people of Kiribati have a genuine desire to develop\nthemselves and at the same time to develop their\ncountry. As their elected representatives, we have a\nclear mandate and duty to make our best efforts to meet\ntheir development aspirations.\n2\n\nPopulation issues are a major challenge in our\ndevelopment efforts. Concerted efforts to promote\neffective family planning have been given greater\nfocus in our national development strategies. The\ngrowing number of unemployed youth brings with it\nnew social issues. We are committed to directing the\nenergy of our youth to productive and worthwhile\npursuits. Employment opportunities abroad for both\nmen and women, such as the arrangements in place\nwith foreign shipping companies, fishing companies\nand cruise operators, will be expanded and new\nopportunities explored. The New Zealand Government's\nPacific Access Category scheme is a very welcome\nmodel that merits closer scrutiny by other countries.\nThe spiralling cost of fuel is an issue of grave\nconcern to us. The impact of rising fuel costs has been\nhardest on the least developed countries, which are also\nthe least able to afford it. Therefore, the need to\naccelerate the development of alternative sources of\nenergy, including clean and renewable energy, is now\ngreater than it ever was.\nWe firmly believe that our fishery resources can\nprovide us with the basis for achieving a sustainable\nfuture, but in order to be able to do so, we shall need\nthe assistance of our development partners in providing\nthe necessary incentives through the provision of credit\nschemes to those investors who are able and willing to\ndevelop onshore facilities within resource-owning\ncountries.\nBut before we can achieve that, and if we are to\nachieve our Millennium Development Goals, we shall\ncontinue to be reliant on the official development\nassistance target of 0.7 per cent of gross national\nincome being met.\nEnvironmental issues and, in particular, climate\nchange and sea-level rise are security issues for\ncountries comprising low-lying coral atolls, such as\nKiribati. A global and concerted effort, including\nstronger political commitment, is required to achieve\nthe objectives of the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change.\nWe are appreciative of the support we have\nreceived and continue to receive in developing\nadaptation measures to climate change and sea-level\nrise. We nevertheless acknowledge the need now to\nseriously consider the option of having to relocate our\npeoples when necessary \u2014 an option that can be\nmeaningfully addressed only within this forum.\nKiribati fully endorses the need for\ncomprehensive reform in the United Nations. The\nenvironment in which the Organization now operates is\nso very different from that of 1945. Reform must take\nplace to ensure that the Organization continues to be a\nrelevant institution for its Member countries.\nTerrorism threatens all. Kiribati condemns\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations and we\nsupport the global fight against terrorism. We have\nnoted with increasing alarm the globalization of terror.\nWe cannot afford to be complacent about terrorism and\nwill contribute, within our resource constraints, to the\nwar against terror. We seek support from those able and\nwilling in the implementation and enforcement of\ncounter-terrorism legislation we have passed in\ncompliance with our obligations as a member of the\nglobal community.\nKiribati has contributed to the Regional\nAssistance Mission to the Solomon Islands. We will\ncontinue to contribute to that regional effort as long as\nthere is need. Kiribati is also interested in contributing\ncivilian police to peacekeeping missions of the United\nNations.\nKiribati supports an expansion of the permanent\nand non-permanent membership of the Security Council.\nIn our view, those countries, such as Japan, that are\nsignificant contributors to United Nations programmes\npromoting peace, security and development merit a\npermanent seat on the Security Council.\nAs we consider reform of the United Nations and\nas we celebrate 60 years of the United Nations, we\nbelieve that now is also the time to consider the issue\nof Taiwan and its 23 million people. Taiwan is a\ncountry where democracy thrives, where the rule of\nlaw prevails and where human rights are respected.\nTaiwan has also remained able and willing to make\nsignificant contributions to the collaborative efforts to\nsecure global peace, security and prosperity.\nWe also believe that, whatever the views are on\nthe question of whether Taiwan is a domestic issue or\nnot, there can be no justification for supporting\nthreatening initiatives, such as the so called anti-\nsecession law, which could have such far-reaching\neffects on regional and global stability.\nI am confident that, under your leadership, Sir,\nwe will work with unity of purpose and perhaps with\nless posturing to address the challenges before us."

        "file_text": "Allow me at\nthe outset to express my heartfelt congratulations to\nyou, Sir, on your election as President of the General\nAssembly at its sixtieth session. Your vast experience\nin the international arena is the best guarantee of\nsuccess for your mandate. My sincere thanks go also to\nyour predecessor, Jean Ping, who presided over the\nfifty-ninth session with particular effectiveness and\nskill.\nThe deliberations of the High-level Plenary\nMeeting represent an important and significant step in\nthe process of adapting the United Nations to the\nglobal challenges that it must address. The results\nachieved in the process of reforming the United\nNations, its basic principles and its bodies reflect the\nbroadest consensus that could be mustered within the\ninternational community. Any attempt to reach for\nmore would in all probability have meant jeopardizing\nits unity, which is an absolute and essential value. We\nshould therefore rate those results highly and consider\nthem to be a call to action.\nIndeed, the heads of State or Government have\nshown us the path to follow. It is now up to the General\nAssembly and the Secretariat to set about\nimplementing the initiatives agreed upon in the\noutcome document, improving and developing them\nwhere necessary.\nRecent events remind us, sometimes tragically, of\nthe need for a multilateral system that has a solid\nstructure and can respond swiftly and effectively to the\nmany challenges that individual members of the\ninternational community would never be able to\naddress by themselves. Italy is convinced of this, and\ncommitment to multilateralism is a basic characteristic\nof our foreign policy.\nOf course, Italian support for the action of\ninternational organizations is not based solely on\nabstract ideals. We support the principle, and especially\nthe practice, of multilateralism because we are\nconvinced that common principles and, above all,\ncommon interests justify the sharing of resources,\ntools, responsibilities and benefits. Joint action is\ninconceivable without a shared perception of interests,\nobjectives and their priorities.\nAmong the positive results of the High-level\nPlenary Meeting is that it encouraged consensus on an\ninnovative and comprehensive vision of collective\nsecurity and highlighted the main phenomena\nthreatening that security. Terrorism, underdevelopment\nand fundamentalism are the primary threats, and our\nresponse must be equal to the challenge; it can come\nonly from a strong and credible multilateral system.\nIn the light of the emergence of fundamentalist\nterrorism, the use of force by itself, although\nsometimes inevitable, is not enough. It is not through\nweapons, but through political means, that we can\ncreate the conditions for a fruitful dialogue among\ncultures, civilizations and religions and thereby\ndevelop the social and international solidarity that can\nprevent terrorism from continuing its criminal\nproselytizing.\n9\n\nGlobal solidarity is also the most appropriate\nresponse to the scandal of global poverty, which results\nfrom the persistence of profound inequities in the\ndistribution of wealth \u2014 inequities that violate not\nonly every standard of fairness, but also the most\nfundamental criteria of logic and effectiveness. To\neradicate underdevelopment, we must promote a\ntangible solidarity that provides real and lasting\nbenefits by combining political and economic action on\nthe part of donor countries with the heightened sense of\nresponsibility and autonomy that is developing in\nemerging countries as they yearn to shake off the\nculture of dependency.\nUnderdevelopment and terrorism often find\nunifying elements \u2014 which increases the potential for\ninstability \u2014 in fundamentalism and ideological\nfanaticism, sworn enemies of universal values such as\nfreedom, peace and equality: values seen as a grave\nthreat by those who seek to control and delegitimize\nour social systems.\nWe firmly believe that the international\ncommunity must unite in the fight against terrorism,\nunderdevelopment and fundamentalism. This session\nof the General Assembly will have the task of\nidentifying concrete initiatives and actions to that end.\nItaly\u2019s steadfast commitment \u2014 even at the cost\nof significant sacrifices \u2014 to promoting peace in key\nareas of crisis such as the Middle East, the Balkans and\nDarfur; our assistance to countries, such as\nAfghanistan and Iraq, that are seeking to recover after\ndecades of obscurantist oppression; our commitment to\nspreading a culture of freedom and dialogue among\ncultures; and our front-line commitment to fighting the\nscourge of underdevelopment, including through\ninnovative methods such as debt cancellation and\nparticipation in the Global Fund against the major\nepidemics, are eloquent and material testimony to the\nseriousness of our intentions. In that regard, I wish to\nmention in particular our activities to promote the\ndevelopment of the African continent \u2014 activities\ncarried out not only by way of anti-poverty initiatives,\nbut also by strengthening African capacities in the\nareas of conflict prevention, management and\nsettlement.\nWe are prepared to meet the challenges before us,\nwhich will entail the significant contribution of\nmaterial and human resources that Italy is providing\nfor the functioning of the United Nations. It would not\nbe consistent with Italy\u2019s attachment to multilateralism\nif I did not add that our efforts would be bound to fail\nif they were carried out individually and not within a\nmultilateral framework \u2014 hence our resolve to\nstrengthen multilateralism.\nThe reform proposals introduced over the past\nyear and submitted for the consideration of heads of\nState or Government provide us with new and\npotentially valuable tools that we must put to good use.\nI am thinking, for example, of the possibility of\nsignificantly developing the international community\u2019s\ncapacity to prevent crisis situations, manage conflicts\nand modernize the modalities and contents of\ntraditional development assistance programmes in\norder to promote lasting stability.\nThat is why Italy cannot but favour the prospect\nof developing or inventing tools for communal action\nin those areas by creating new bodies such as the\nPeacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights\nCouncil. Their creation will make it possible to\noperationalize the desired integrated approach to crisis\nmanagement and management of peacekeeping\noperations \u2014 an approach that promises to reduce the\nrecurrence of conflicts, consolidate peace processes in\ncrisis regions and promote the restoration of rule-of-\nlaw infrastructures.\nThe reform process under way can and must\ninvest in United Nations institutions in their entirety,\nwith regard to both their composition and working\nmethods, in order to strengthen effectiveness, while at\nthe same time ensuring the coherence and balance of\nthe Organization\u2019s general framework. Italy is fully\naware and convinced of this. We are also convinced of\nthe need \u2014 especially in this area \u2014 to proceed with\ndue attention to individual sensitivities, within the\nframework of a process that ensures transparency and\ninclusiveness.\nAt the summit, it was not possible to reach an\nagreement on the rather controversial subject of\nSecurity Council reform, whose various aspects,\nalready widely debated in the preparatory phase, are\nwell known. Also well known is the position of Italy\nand of countries that, like us, belong to the \u201cUniting\nfor consensus\u201d group. We presented a proposal aimed\nat greater inclusion, greater effectiveness and increased\ndemocratic participation, having broad geographic and\nregional representation and elaborated in a constructive\nand flexible spirit.\n10\n\nWe are well aware that the priorities of other\ncountries are different, and we obviously respect their\npositions, although we do not share them. It is our\nfervent hope that everyone will be convinced that\nSecurity Council reform cannot be the result of shows\nof force, unacceptable conditions or artificial\naccelerations aimed at creating new positions of\nprivilege. Awareness of the need to reform the Council\nis the common heritage of all Members. Such reform\ncertainly cannot be considered the exclusive\nprerogative of those who advocate one reform option\nas opposed to another. Recent events have\ndemonstrated that none of the proposals currently on\nthe table has the votes needed for adoption.\nUndoubtedly, none of them enjoys the broad consensus\nessential to ensure that the future shape of the Security\nCouncil will help unite, and not divide, the\ninternational community. This is why we firmly believe\nthat it is necessary to turn the page in order to unite\nefforts to seek new consensus formulas, both in terms\nof substance and in terms of method.\nIt is clear that this quest cannot go on forever.\nTravelling this road together with trust and\nperseverance is the only way to ensure effective and\nlasting outcomes. Italy is prepared to consider, in a\nconstructive spirit, any potential solution that will\ngarner the broadest consensus possible, but will\ncontinue to oppose \u2014 in accordance with the principles\nshared by a growing number of Member States \u2014 any\nformulas that could create new divisions and\nmarginalization. Given the challenges it must face, the\ninternational community needs to be united in its\nintentions.\nI know quite well that in these statements, the\nadjective \u201chistoric\u201d is used so often that it loses much\nof its meaning. Nevertheless, when we think about the\ntimetables and the risks or opportunities that are\nemerging, describing the moment of this General\nAssembly as historic does not seem an exaggeration. A\nwell-known aphorism reminds us that those who do not\nremember history are condemned to repeat it. History\nteaches us that a united international community based\non the recognition of shared principles and basic\ninterests is the necessary condition for ensuring peace,\ndevelopment and progress for our peoples."

        "file_text": "It is with great\nhonour that I take this floor before this Assembly. At\nthe outset, I should like to congratulate the President,\non behalf of the Government of the Republic of\nAngola, for his election to the presidency of the\nsixtieth session of the General Assembly of our\nOrganization.\nI also wish to express my appreciation to his\npredecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, for his commitment and for\nthe transparent and efficient manner in which he\npresided over the fifty-ninth session of General\nAssembly.\nToday, 60 years after the foundation of the United\nNations, humanity continues to face new and complex\nchallenges. The continuation of armed conflicts,\nhunger, poverty, massive human rights violations, the\nspread of HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, the scar\nof terrorism and the risk that non-State actors can\nacquire, develop and use weapons of mass destruction\nindeed constitute a threat to international peace and\nsecurity. Therefore, the international community has\nevery reason to act collectively to reform and\nstrengthen the United Nations in order to render it\nbetter prepared to address the many and complex\nchallenges we are facing.\nThe Republic of Angola follows with great\nconcern the developments in several areas of the world,\nparticularly on the African continent. In spite of a\nrelatively positive tendency characterized by a\ndecrease in areas of tension in the world today, it is\nnecessary to continue to pay special attention to the\npeace processes in various parts of the world,\nparticularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Sudan and Guinea-Bissau, to mention\nonly a few.\nRegarding Guinea-Bissau, my delegation is\nsatisfied with the results achieved, and we commend\nthe political maturity shown by the people of Guinea-\nBissau during the transition period, particularly the\ncivic responsibility demonstrated during the period of\npresidential elections.\nIn this context, we believe that respect for the\nconstitutionally established institutions of sovereignty\nis an indispensable condition for political stability.\nOnly this will create a propitious environment for the\naccomplishment of tasks that guarantee the\nmaintenance of peace and economic reconstruction.\nSuch is the expectation of the Guinean people, who\nwent to voting stations in such significant numbers.\nThat is a vote for democracy.\nIn that connection, we welcome the round table\non Guinea-Bissau, scheduled for the month of\nNovember, and we urge donors to respond positively\nsince the international community\u2019s assistance remains\na fundamental condition for the process under way.\nRegarding the process of consolidation of peace\ncurrently in progress in the Great Lakes region,\nAngola, in its capacity as a core country, is pleased\nwith what has been achieved so far. We thank the\nGroup of Friends, and particularly the Government of\n35\n\nCanada, for the support they have been providing, and\nespecially for the second Great Lakes Conference, due\nto be held next November in Nairobi.\nAlthough we understand that the primary\nresponsibility to prevent and resolve conflicts in Africa\nfalls upon African States themselves, we share the\nnotion that the international community should, in\npartnership with regional and subregional\norganizations, play a more significant role in the\nprevention and resolution of conflicts on the continent.\nBased on our own experience, we believe that in\norder for strategies for the prevention and resolution of\nconflicts to be successful, they should be based on an\napproach that is as inclusive as possible. In this\nconnection, the cooperation of the key organs of the\nUnited Nations \u2014 the General Assembly, the Security\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council \u2014 is\nabsolutely essential. The pertinent involvement of the\ninternational financial institutions, as well as the\nprivate and business sectors, has proven to be equally\nfundamental.\nFor this reason, we support and welcome the\ndecision of the High-level Meeting to create the\nPeacebuilding Commission. We are ready to work with\npartners towards rendering this organ operational as\nsoon as possible.\nAngola supports the creation of the permanent\nfund for the consolidation of peace. We are also of the\nview that activities related to disarmament,\ndemobilization and reintegration should be financed\nfrom the regular budget and attributed to peacekeeping\noperations.\nWhile the illicit exploitation of natural resources\nwas not mentioned in the outcome document of the\nsummit, we hope that during the current session of the\nGeneral Assembly this issue will be given due\nconsideration since it constitutes a fundamental\nelement for the strategy of prevention and resolution of\nconflicts.\nTerrorism undoubtedly constitutes a permanent\nthreat to the world that no country can face alone.\nTherefore, it calls for cooperation among all countries,\nwith the United Nations playing the central role in the\nfight against it. In this connection, we join the\nSecretary-General\u2019s plea for the conclusion, as urgently\nas possible, of the comprehensive convention against\ninternational terrorism, which would contain a\nuniversally accepted definition of the concept of\nterrorism.\nFive years since the adoption of the Millennium\nDeclaration, the social and economic situation in\nseveral parts of the globe continues to be characterized\nby extreme poverty.\nAs well-articulated mentioned by the Secretary-\nGeneral in his report, \u201cIn larger freedom\u201d (A/59/2005),\npoverty is not only about development; it is also a\nmatter of security and respect for human rights, which\nare fundamental to the Millennium Development\nGoals. For this reason, I agree with several previous\nspeakers that this issue in the outcome document ought\nto be dealt with in greater detail. Thus, we look\nforward to continuing our work in the relevant forums,\nin particular in a strengthened Economic and Social\nCouncil.\nThe fight against HIV/AIDS, malaria,\ntuberculosis and other illnesses constitutes an\nindispensable condition for peace, stability and\ninternational collective security. For this reason, we\nurge the international community to redouble its efforts\nin mobilizing the required resources for the prevention\nand treatment of these illnesses.\nLet me take this opportunity to express my\nGovernment\u2019s appreciation to the United States for\nfunding and initiating a programme to fight malaria in\nAngola, as well as in Tanzania and Uganda.\nIn my delegation\u2019s opinion, in order to meet the\nchallenges facing the world, it is imperative that we\nproceed to the reform of the main organs of the United\nNations, with a view to adapting them to the current\nreality. We will remain active in the process of reform\nof the United Nations, including the Security Council\nand the other primary bodies of our Organization.\nWe share the opinion that the composition of the\nSecurity Council should properly reflect the present\nday political reality. Enlarging the Security Council\nwould render it more transparent and more\nrepresentative, with greater credibility and, in\nparticular, greater authority in its decisions.\nNevertheless, we would like to underline that the\nenlargement of the Council is just one aspect of the\nreform that needs to be completed. We should not\nunderestimate other elements of Council reform that\nwe consider no less important, such as the need to\n36\n\nimprove and render more transparent its working\nmethods.\nI am convinced that the results reached at the\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting during this session of the\nGeneral Assembly will stimulate the continuation of\nthe debate on the process of the reform itself. This will\ncreate a platform that will reinforce the Organization\u2019s\ncommon vision and objectives: strengthening\ncooperation and providing greater assurances that\ninternational peace and stability can only be found in a\nreinforced multilateralism."

        "file_text": "It is my pleasure to take this opportunity to\ncongratulate you on your election to the Presidency of\nthis session, which coincides with the sixtieth\nanniversary of the United Nations. We hope that this\nimportant session will provide a historic opportunity to\nreview and evaluate the achievements of this\nOrganization and to formulate a political and\ndevelopment vision on strengthening our common\naction and our ability to maintain international peace\nand security and achieve sustainable development.\nThe United Arab Emirates welcomes the\nOutcome Document of the High-level Plenary Meeting\nand considers it a positive step towards achieving the\nMDGs, especially those related to the four main fields,\nnamely development, peace and collective security,\nhuman rights, rule of law and the strengthening of the\nUnited Nations. At the same time, we hope that our\nconsultations on other unsolved issues will continue in\norder to reach an international consensus.\nIn that context, we wish to reaffirm our position\ncalling for the reform of the United Nations, including\nthe increase of permanent and non-permanent\nmembership of the Security Council, based on a system\nof equitable geographical distribution that ensures the\ntransparency of the Council\u2019s working methods.\nWe emphasize the importance of reinforcing\ninternational commitment to the principles of\ninternational and humanitarian law and respect for the\nsovereignty of States, including their cultural and\nreligious diversity and traditions. We also underline the\nneed to respect the resolutions and recommendations of\ninternational legitimacy issued by world summits,\nincluding the Millennium Declaration.\nWe affirm that the challenges of the twenty-first\ncentury, including poverty, illiteracy, epidemics,\nenvironmental degradation, global terrorism, organized\ncrime and the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction, are by nature transnational and pose grave\nthreats to all humanity. Therefore, while we supported\nthe establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission,\nwhich will assist countries recovering from civil and\nregional wars, we call for the utilization of our human\ncultures and beliefs in joint efforts to address such\nchallenges, including the holding of an international\nconference on combating terrorism and its causes. Such\na conference must provide a clear definition of\nterrorism, based on the principles of the United Nations\nCharter and international law and norms, and must\ndistinguish between terrorism and the legitimate\n25\n\nstruggle of peoples against foreign occupation. At the\nsame time, we reaffirm our support for the proposal of\nthe brotherly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to establish an\ninternational centre to combat terrorism.\nFirmly convinced of the importance of adopting\npeaceful solutions in resolving disputes and issues of\nforeign occupation, particularly in the Middle East and\nthe Arab Gulf region, the United Arab Emirates calls\nupon the Islamic Republic of Iran to respond to its\npeaceful initiatives aimed at resolving the issue of\nIran\u2019s occupation of the three islands of the United\nArab Emirates \u2014 Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu\nMusa \u2014 through bilateral negotiations or by referral to\nthe International Court of Justice.\nIn that context, we reaffirm that all actions taken\nby Iran since its illegal occupation of the three islands\nin 1971 are null and void, because they contradict the\nUnited Nations Charter, international law, the\nprinciples of good neighbourliness and the peaceful\ncoexistence of nations and confidence-building\nmeasures. In the light of the impact of that important\nand delicate issue on the security and the stability of\nthe Arab Gulf region and on the entire world, the\nUnited Arab Emirates, along with other countries of\nthe Gulf Cooperation Council, looks forward to the\nIranian Government\u2019s review of its policy in that\nregard. We also hope that Iran will take a transparent\nand objective approach in its response to the repeated\npeaceful initiatives of the countries of the region,\nwhich call for the end of Iran\u2019s occupation of the three\nislands belonging to the United Arab Emirates and the\ncreation of a positive regional environment conducive\nto the strengthening of cooperation, good\nneighbourliness and mutual advantage among the\nregion\u2019s countries and to prosperity and stability for its\npeoples.\nWe are hopeful that the political transition\nprocess in Iraq will be completed and, in that respect,\nwe renew our support for all efforts made by the Iraqi\nGovernment to strengthen political dialogue among the\nvarious Iraqi factions, achieve national reconciliation\nand rebuild its national institutions so that Iraq can\nmaintain its unity, territorial sovereignty, independence\nand stability, and can play its natural role in the region\nand the world.\nThe United Arab Emirates welcomes Israel\u2019s\nwithdrawal from the Gaza Strip and parts of the\nnorthern West Bank and hopes that the international\ncommunity will urge Israel to complete its withdrawal\nfrom the Arab and Palestinian territories occupied\nsince 1967, including the Syrian Golan and the\nLebanese Shaba\u2019a farms, dismantle the separation wall\nand discontinue its settlement plans and activities, in\naccordance with the resolutions of international\nlegitimacy, the Arab peace initiative based on the land-\nfor-peace principle, and the Quartet\u2019s road map.\nFurthermore, the international community must\nstrengthen its support of the Palestinian Authority and\nhelp it rebuild its national institutions and exploit its\nnatural and economic resources.\nWe also demand that Israel accede to the Treaty\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and\nsubmit its nuclear facilities to the supervision of the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, in accordance\nwith the relevant United Nations resolutions calling for\nthe establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass\ndestruction, including nuclear weapons, in the Middle\nEast and the Arab Gulf region.\nIn spite of the progress made in science and\ninformation technology, the international community\ncontinues to face a growing economic gap between the\nNorth and the South. Therefore, we call for further\ninternational efforts to address that imbalance,\nincluding the greater participation of developing\ncountries in decision-making in economic and trade\nmatters, and for the commitment of industrialized\nStates to continue their support for development\nprogrammes in the developing countries in order to\ncreate a fair and just international economic\nenvironment in which all peoples enjoy the benefits of\nprosperity, well-being and development.\nThe United Arab Emirates has developed\nhumanitarian and financial assistance programmes to\nassist developing countries and countries affected by\nconflicts, civil and regional wars and natural disasters.\nThat assistance exceeds the percentage recommended\nby international conferences on development and the\nMillennium Development Goals. In that context, the\nUnited Arab Emirates has adopted multifaceted\ndevelopment policies and plans to keep pace with\ninternational economic and development changes.\nThose policies include human resources development,\nthe opening of the country\u2019s markets to foreign trade\nand the enhancement of the private sector\u2019s role in\nnational development.\n26\n\nIn conclusion, we hope that our deliberations at\nthis session will result in a positive outcome that\nstrengthens our joint efforts to realize our peoples\u2019\nhope and ambition to live in a world in which security,\nstability, peace, freedom and justice prevail."

        "file_text": "Today, I would like to\nbegin by congratulating the founding nations and all\nthose present here today as we celebrate the sixtieth\nanniversary of the United Nations, which can be proud\nof so many great accomplishments.\nSince its foundation in 1945, the United Nations\nhas helped to negotiate an end to over 170 regional\nconflicts and has deployed more than 35 peacekeeping\nmissions. It is leading international efforts to clear land\nmines from former zones of warfare. It has provided\naid to tens of millions of refugees fleeing war, famine\nand persecution. It has focused the world\u2019s attention on\nissues of human rights. It provides annual\ndisbursements that amount to $10 billion per year for\nvarious development programmes. It has made safe\ndrinking water available to 1.3 billion people during\nthe last decade. It has helped to eradicate smallpox\nfrom the globe, with polio set to follow soon. It has\nhelped to reduce world child mortality rates by half\nsince 1960. It has improved education in the\ndeveloping countries, where 60 per cent of adults can\nnow read and write. It provides over 2 million tons of\nfood to victims of emergencies every year. About 30\nmillion people in 36 different countries benefited from\nsuch assistance in 2004 alone. And it has hosted a\nvariety of significant events, such as the Rio\nConference on Environment and Development, which\nresulted in important treaties on biodiversity and\nclimate change.\nThe vast majority of the United Nations\nemployees over the years have been guided by a\nprofound sense of duty. I would like to single out those\nresponsible and dedicated workers who provide\nhumanitarian assistance in the poorest regions of the\nglobe, in zones of conflict, and in places that have been\naffected by natural disasters. We should pay tribute to\nall those who have lost their lives in the service of\nhumanity, like the lamented Sergio Vieiro de Mello,\n36\n\nwho was killed while leading the United Nations work\nin Iraq.\nThe world needs the United Nations. It needs the\nUnited Nations today as much as it did 60 years ago.\nWe need a United Nations that is more and more\nefficient in dealing with global challenges and able to\nact efficiently to prevent such horrors as the genocide\nin Rwanda, the ethnic cleansing in the Balkans, and the\nongoing human tragedy in the Darfur region of the\nSudan. While such values and principles as national\nsovereignty, non-intervention and self-determination\nlie at the very core of relations between the United\nNations Member States, we also have to recognize our\ncollective responsibility to protect innocent civilians\nfrom wide-scale abuse and suffering. It is our duty to\narrive at a common understanding of that responsibility\nto protect so that the international community can act\nefficiently to avert future mass killings and crimes\nagainst humanity. I encourage those United Nations\nMember States that have not yet done so to ratify the\nRome Statute of the International Criminal Court and\nto support the Court\u2019s endeavours to bring war\ncriminals to justice.\nWhen the United Nations was created, my\ncountry, Latvia, was an occupied country and had no\nsay in the rules that govern the Organization. It was\ntherefore a particular honour that the President of\nLatvia was chosen as a Special Envoy of the Secretary-\nGeneral for promoting reforms within the United\nNations during the past six months. I am delighted that,\nin some aspects, we have succeeded in reaching a\nbroad consensus, as for instance on the necessity of\ncreating a peacebuilding commission. However, we\nstill do not have a common understanding regarding\nmany other reforms that need to be carried out. It is our\nshared responsibility to arrive at such an understanding\nsoon.\nAs we work to strengthen the United Nations, we\nshould ensure better cooperation and practices and\navoid duplication of effort. Latvia strongly supports the\ndecision to establish a Human Rights Council, which\nrecognizes human rights as a priority on the United\nNations agenda. I therefore encourage delegations to\nwork with vigour to ensure the smooth transformation\nof the Human Rights Commission into a council and to\nset the highest standards for its future members. A vital\nrole in the realization of those standards will be played\nby the High Commissioner for Human Rights. I wish to\nconfirm Latvia\u2019s support for the Commissioner and her\nOffice, and welcome the decision to allocate a larger\nshare of the United Nations regular budget to that\nimportant aspect of its work.\nMy country fully supports the management\nreforms of the United Nations administration that have\nbeen put forth by the Secretary-General. The reforms\nwould afford the Secretary-General greater authority\nwithin certain fields of the United Nations activities, as\nwell as greater responsibilities. The reforms would also\ncontribute to the transparency and professionalism of\nthe Secretariat, which has been justly criticized for\nserious deficiencies in its work. I am pleased that the\nUnited Nations leadership is willing to propose viable\nchanges for improving the operations of the\nSecretariat. It is now up to the Member States to arrive\nat a consensus upon those proposed measures.\nLatvia has consistently endorsed reform of the\nSecurity Council in order to render it more effective\nand representative. We believe that the Security\nCouncil should be enlarged to incorporate new\npermanent seats without veto rights. We also believe\nthat the permanent members of the Security Council\nshould refrain from using the veto in cases of genocide,\nwar crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against\nhumanity. That promises to be one of the most difficult\nissues to resolve, but we should nevertheless not\nabandon our efforts to reach a feasible accord by the\nend of this year.\nThe Secretary-General has highlighted the\nlinkage between security and development. The\ncommitments he outlines are designed to advance the\nrealization of the Millennium Development Goals,\nwhich, if achieved by 2015, would mark a genuine turn\nof the tide in our common struggle against poverty and\ndisease. The comprehensive package agreed at the G-8\nGleneagles summit in July is an important milestone in\nhelping Africa to eradicate extreme poverty, combat\nAIDS and malaria, and ensure that every child receives\na primary education. We must now make sure that what\nwas agreed at Gleneagles, including a doubling of aid\nby 2010 and the writing off of billions of dollars in\ndebt, will be delivered.\nI would also like to highlight the necessity of\nachieving gender equality, which includes universal\naccess to reproductive health information and services\nby 2015. That was the central goal of the agreements\nthat were reached at the International Conference on\nPopulation and Development in Cairo in 1994. Our\n37\n\ncountries must strengthen girls\u2019 access to both primary\nand secondary education so that they become less\nsubject to early forced marriages and economic\nexploitation. Girls must be made safe from genital\nmutilation. Girls and women must be guaranteed\nsexual and reproductive rights and protection against\nHIV/AIDS and other diseases. There is no excuse for\nhalf a million women dying each year of pregnancy-\nrelated causes that are entirely preventable.\nThe need for continued development concerns\nalmost all regions in the world, including Eastern\nEurope, which has experienced momentous changes\nsince the fall of the iron curtain in the late 1980s and\nearly 1990s. Thirteen years ago, the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) established an\noffice in Latvia to facilitate the country\u2019s development\nand improve people\u2019s lives. Its mandate in Latvia will\nconclude at the end of this year, and I take this\nopportunity to express Latvia\u2019s gratitude for the\ninvaluable assistance that UNDP has provided to my\ncountry over these 13 years.\nToday, Latvia, as a full State member of the\nEuropean Union, has become a net contributor of aid\nfor achieving the Millennium Development Goals. We\nknow that, without the promotion of good governance\nat all levels, sound macroeconomic policies and a\nconcerted fight against corruption, the Goals will not\nbe reached. Latvia stands ready to share its experience\nof transition to democratic rule and a free market\neconomy, as it has done and will continue to do with\ncountries in transition in Eastern Europe and the\nCaucasus. We welcome the initiative of establishing a\ndemocracy fund to assist all committed countries in\ntheir efforts to consolidate democratic political\nsystems.\nRecognizing the opportunities that derive from\nthe use of modern technologies in the field of\ninformation and communications, Latvia has been\nactively involved in the preparations for the World\nSummit on the Information Society, which will be held\nin Tunis this November. We hope that the Summit will\nprovide unprecedented opportunities for strengthening\ncooperation among Governments, civil society and the\nprivate sector in promoting the use of information and\ncommunication technologies and generating knowledge\nsocieties.\nA major step forward is our unequivocal\ncondemnation of terrorism in all its forms and\nmanifestations. My own country, Latvia, regained its\nfreedom through peaceful and non-violent means. We\ntriumphed due to our firm belief in historical justice,\nalong with a great deal of persistence, patience and\nhope.\nLatvia welcomes the Secretary-General\u2019s counter-\nterrorism strategy. We need to arrive at a\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism,\nwhich would provide a legal framework for\ninternational cooperation in combating that modern-\nday scourge of humanity. The war against terrorism\nwill be won only if it is fought while respecting basic\nhuman rights and remembering humanistic ethics.\nI express my profound disappointment that we\ncould not achieve any consensus on disarmament and\nthe non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\nProgress in that area is more urgently needed than ever.\nI therefore encourage every United Nations Member\nState to act responsibly and in good faith in the pursuit\nof those goals.\nSince the previous session of the General\nAssembly a year ago, the world has experienced\nnatural disasters of an unprecedented scale of\ndestruction. We have just had Hurricane Katrina, and\nare still getting over the terrible tsunami last year in\nSouth-East Asia. The hard lessons of those crises must\nbe learned in order to prepare for future emergencies.\nWhile there is nothing we can do to prevent\nearthquakes and tsunamis, scientists have warned us\nfor years that our continued dependence on and\nincreasing consumption of fossil fuels is generating\ngreenhouse gas emissions that are causing disruptive\nclimate changes. Unless we diversify our sources of\nenergy, we can expect to see more devastating\nhurricanes and floods in some parts of the world, along\nwith drought and desertification in others.\nThe challenges that our nations face are\nformidable, and we will be able to overcome them only\nby working together. As we prepare to implement the\ndecisions we have made at this gathering, I wish us all\nthe foresight and the courage to uphold the higher\ninterest of the common good over narrow, short-term,\nlocal concerns. The future of our peoples depends on\nus."

        "file_text": "On behalf\nof my delegation and on my own behalf I would like to\nextend our warm congratulations to President Eliasson\non his election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its sixtieth session and to ensure him of\nour cooperation in carrying out his noble mission. I\nwould also like to congratulate his predecessor, His\nExcellency Mr. Jean Ping, who guided our work with\ntact, skill and competence throughout his term, in spite\nof the delicate and complex issues that were on the\nagenda during the fifty-ninth session.\nIt is clear that the results that we have reached in\nrecent years, both in terms of peacekeeping and in our\napproach to development issues, have been made\npossible by the commendable commitment and\ndevotion of each and every Member, at all levels of\nengagement and responsibility. I would specifically\nlike to underscore the valuable contribution of\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, to whom I pay a well\ndeserved tribute.\nIn his report, entitled \u201cIn larger freedom: towards\ndevelopment, security and human rights for all\u201d\n(A/59/2005), our Secretary-General submitted specific\nproposals that we rightfully believe are appropriate\nsolutions to our shared concerns. Effective\nimplementation of those measures will enhance the\neffectiveness and credibility of the United Nations and\nwill help us to meet the myriad challenges facing\ntoday\u2019s world.\nA few days ago the heads of State and\nGovernment reviewed the international situation from\nthe standpoint of the Millennium Declaration adopted\nin 2000 and the implementation of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals. The conclusions clearly indicate\nthe magnitude of the task that still remains to be\naccomplished, despite the efforts made by Member\nStates and their national constituents. Those\nconclusions, which corroborate the analysis of the\nSecretary-General, tell us that times have changed and\nthat the world \u2014 while it still bears scars from the\npast \u2014 has already entered into the future. Today, we\nare seeing the unparalleled impoverishment of many\ncountries and peoples, as well as the emergence of new\nabhorrent phenomena, such as terrorism and\ntransboundary crime, not to mention the pandemic of\nHIV/AIDS and the resurgence of other communicable\ndiseases. Given those formidable developments, it is\nabsolutely necessary to build a new international\nsociety that is more caring, more just and better\nmanaged, with the United Nations at its centre.\nFor its part, the Government of Chad, since the\nestablishment of democracy in 1990, has planned and\nimplemented a vast programme of institutional\ntransformation that promotes social and economic\ndevelopment, peace and security, both domestic and\nexternal. Moreover, we held a constitutional\nreferendum in June to amend a number of\nprovisions \u2014 a clear demonstration of our concern to\nadapt our institutions to present-day demands, as well\nas an opportunity for our people to renew their\nconfidence in those institutions.\nWhile our country has achieved sufficient\nstability within, that is not true of our borders. We are\nsuffering from the impacts of an insecurity that is\nprevalent among our neighbours, particularly in the\nCentral African Republic and the Sudan, with which\nChad shares very long borders. Therefore, prompted by\nour border security concerns, we have undertaken\nmediation initiatives to reconcile the belligerents. For\nthose reasons, the Government of Chad took the\ninitiative to bring together the parties to the conflict in\nDarfur, at Ab\u00e9ch\u00e9, Chad, in September 2003, to make\nthem listen to reason. Since then, the Government has\nworked continually and actively towards helping to\nreach a negotiated solution to that conflict, with\nsupport from the African Union and representatives of\nthe international community. Moreover, in spite of his\nheavy schedule, President Idriss Deby has become\npersonally involved in trying to bring about a pacific\nsettlement to that fratricidal conflict.\nChad\u2019s mediation led to the conclusion of the\nN\u2019Djamena and the Abuja agreements in Nigeria,\nwhere talks are still under way to find a comprehensive\npolitical agreement and to put an end once and for all\nto the crisis that has gone on for far too long. Chad will\ncontinue to act as a mediator so that one day the\nwestern region of the Sudan can at long last regain its\ncalm and stability.\nWe deplore the violations of the ceasefire that are\ncurrently taking place in Darfur and hope that they will\ncease. We must welcome the formation of the new\nGovernment of the Sudan and we are hoping that that\nwill be an opportunity for an acceleration of the peace\nprocess of Abuja.\nIn Chad, we are duty-bound to work with our\nbrothers in the Sudan, with whom we have historical\n8\n\nand geographic ties. But we should not lose sight of the\nimpacts and consequences of the conflict, which have\ntaken a heavy toll, in particular on the border\npopulations. For instance, Chad took a fully sovereign\ndecision to welcome more than 200,000 Sudanese\nrefugees and is providing many forms of support to\nother humanitarian institutions that are operating in the\naffected zone. Indeed, the disruption of trade, the\ndeterioration of major roads by humanitarian convoys\nand all the other costs eat up our meagre resources and\nare the most common source of political unrest among\nour own people, who feel that they have been\nabandoned. Given the scarcity of our resources and the\nimmense needs of refugees and populations in refugee\nareas, the Government of Chad is counting on\nsubstantial assistance from the international\ncommunity.\nThe positive developments in the situation in the\nCentral African Republic are facilitating the restoration\nof constitutional order in that brotherly country.\nHowever, the incidence of crime spilling across that\ncountry\u2019s common borders with Chad and Cameroon is\nincreasing. That phenomenon has caused a new flow of\nCentral African refugees into Chad and they live in\nvery difficult conditions. We call upon the international\ncommunity to devote greater attention to their plight.\nWe welcome the initiative taken in that regard by\nthe United Nations Peacebuilding Support Office in the\nCentral African Republic, which brought together\nrepresentatives of Cameroon, Chad and the Central\nAfrican Republic at Yaound\u00e9 on 26 and 27 August to\nconsider the phenomenon of insecurity on their\ncommon borders and to find solutions to it.\nOf course, the insecurity on our borders should\nnot cause us to lose sight of other crises in Africa and\nthroughout the world. In Africa, we welcome the\ndevelopments in Guinea-Bissau, Burundi and Liberia,\nto mention only those brotherly countries.\nUndoubtedly, the issue of their reconstruction will have\nan important place on the agendas of those countries,\nof the African Union and of the rest of the world.\nOn the other hand, the situation in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\ncontinues to concern us. President Mbeki\u2019s mediation\nhas not been able to lead \u2014 as had been hoped \u2014 to\nthe immediate holding of presidential elections. We\nurge our Ivorian brethren to engage in dialogue.\nIn the Middle East, the persistence of the Israeli-\nArab conflict continues to poison relations in the\nsubregion, even while the withdrawal from the Gaza\nStrip is a tangible element in recent developments. We\nare convinced that it is only through dialogue that a\njust and lasting solution to that conflict can be found.\nWith regard to the disagreement between the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and Taiwan, we appreciate\nTaiwan\u2019s tireless efforts to reach a peaceful solution.\nThe international community must encourage the two\nparties to accept each other. The readmission of Taiwan\ninto the United Nations, which we believe to be a\nlegitimate demand of that country, would be the point\nof departure for such acceptance.\nThe interdependence of the concepts of\ndevelopment, peace and security is the basis of our\ncountry\u2019s support for the Millennium Development\nGoals (MDGs). The Millennium Declaration was\nundoubtedly a strong signal from the partnership of\nrich and poor countries in favour of a fairer, more\nbalanced and more united world. In itself, it is a great\nendeavour that could lead to the consolidation of\nglobal efforts.\nMy country has set for itself the same objectives\nin its development strategies, plans and programmes as\nare found in the Millennium Declaration, particularly\nour national poverty reduction strategy and our\nnational strategy for good governance. Undoubtedly,\nfor most of our countries, achieving the MDGs is not\nvery likely, particularly in the areas of promoting peace\nand security, good governance and economic and social\nreforms.\nThere is in Chad, however, a consensus regarding\nthe need for sustained progress on those issues and in\nother areas related to social, economic and political\nlife. The Government of Chad is, therefore, focusing in\nparticular on activities relating to the protection of\nchildren, the promotion of maternal health, the\neducation of girls and the social and professional\nintegration of underprivileged groups, particularly\nwomen, the elderly and the disabled. In that\nconnection, there is no doubt that the partnership\nbetween civil society and the private sector is being\nstrongly encouraged.\nI am not unaware that many delegations may\nwonder about the current situation with regard to\nsocio-economic development in Chad following the\nexploitation of oil there. The fact that Chad joined the\nsmall circle of oil exporting countries two years ago,\nalthough it caused some euphoria in my country, has\n9\n\nnot attracted the expected financial resources.\nUnfortunately, Chad, under the agreements linking it to\nthe oil consortium, benefits from only a small\nproportion of the revenues resulting from its oil. We\ncontinue to need the cooperation and assistance of\nfriendly countries to supplement our resources, which\nstill fall short of our needs. Such cooperation is\nessential if we are to carry out our development and\nanti-poverty programmes.\nAs members are aware, my country\u2019s\ndevelopment depends partly on the cotton crop, which\nunfortunately is in a state of crisis that is becoming\nendemic. That crop, which provides a living for much\nof Chad\u2019s population, is dangerously threatened by the\nprotectionist practices of developed countries. In fact,\nour cotton producers are victims of the subsidy policies\nof countries that are supposed to comply with the rules\nof international trade. Measures must be taken to limit\nthe effects of the market economy, which is\nincreasingly restricting our weak economies. We\nbelieve that well-regulated economic trade would\nensure sustainable development for the least advanced\ncountries and would help to build confidence among\nStates.\nWe are uncertain of reaching a political solution\nto the cotton problem, despite the hopes placed in\ncontinued multilateral trade negotiations within the\nframework of the Doha Round. It is no longer certain\nthat developed countries will agree to abandon their\nsubsidy practices and implement radical changes in the\ncurrent system to meet the expectations of African\ncotton growers. That would leave no choice but to\nresort to political and legal action under the provisions\nof the statutes and rules of the World Trade\nOrganization with a view to regulating the cotton\nmarket through measures to compensate the losses\nsuffered by our producers.\nMost Member States had hoped that this sixtieth\nsession of the General Assembly would finally achieve\nthe democratization of the United Nations. That does\nnot yet seem to be the case. But we must not lose\nmomentum, and we must continue to work to ensure\nthat that objective is attained in the near future. The\nrevitalization of the General Assembly and of the\nEconomic and Social Council and the transformation of\nthe Commission on Human Rights into an important\nUnited Nations body, as suggested by the Secretary-\nGeneral, would enable the Organization to be more\neffective. In such a restructuring, which remains\nrelevant, the issue of Security Council expansion is of\ninterest to Member States, particularly those of\nAfrica \u2014 and quite rightly, because we know that since\nthe creation of the United Nations in 1945, no African\nState has had a seat on the Council as a permanent\nmember with the right of the veto. That injustice\nseriously mars the credibility of the United Nations,\nand it is time to rectify it.\nOur position regarding a new configuration for\nthe Security Council remains that which has been\nreaffirmed many times by the African Union. It reflects\nour firm will to participate in the efforts of the\ninternational community under United Nations\nauspices aimed at ensuring the maintenance of peace\nand security, which are guarantees for sustainable\neconomic and social development."

        "file_text": "I\nbring greetings and congratulations to the President of\nthe General Assembly from the Government and the\npeople of Papua New Guinea on the occasion of the\nsixtieth anniversary of the United Nations. I pledge my\ndelegation\u2019s support in the discharge of his noble\nresponsibilities. I would like to commend again His\nExcellency Mr. Jean Ping, Foreign Minister of Gabon,\nfor his stewardship of the work of the fifty-ninth\nsession of the General Assembly. I also pay tribute to\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and his staff\nfor their continued efforts in servicing the needs of\nMember States.\nAt the outset, I would like to convey the heartfelt\nsympathy and condolences of the people of Papua New\nGuinea to the Government of the United States of\nAmerica and its people with respect to the loss of lives\nand the destruction of property in the Gulf states. We\nwish them well for a speedy recovery and in their\nreconstruction efforts.\nThe United Nations has come a long way since its\ninception in 1945. The focus on international peace and\nsecurity remains relevant, although since then it has\ntaken on new and different dimensions, including the\nevil of global terrorism.\nThe process of reform of the United Nations,\nparticularly the General Assembly, the Security\nCouncil and the Secretariat must be reflective of the\nchanging landscape of today\u2019s international realities.\nThe membership of the Security Council, both\npermanent and non-permanent, must be expanded to\ninclude equitable representation from developing\ncountries. Work on the reform agenda, as set out in the\noutcome document (resolution 60/1) of the High-level\nPlenary Meeting, must commence without any further\ndelay. We strongly support the early resolution of all\nthe outstanding issues, including those related to\nhuman rights and to disarmament.\nConvening the recently concluded summit\nenabled us to see how much progress we have made in\nthe implementation of the Millennium Development\nGoals (MDGs) in our respective countries. Despite the\nGovernment\u2019s efforts to achieve the MDGs, Papua\nNew Guinea\u2019s scorecard indicates that much more\nneeds to be done. We recognize that combating\npoverty, HIV/AIDS, child and maternal mortality and\nunemployment and promoting universal primary\neducation and gender equality are major challenges for\nPapua New Guinea.\nImportant legislative, policy and administrative\ninstruments are now being put in place. The\nMillennium Development Goals and targets have been\nincorporated into our medium-term development\nstrategy, which ties the MDGs to our development\nprogrammes through the national budgetary process. I\nam happy to report that in July of this year the Papua\nNew Guinea National Parliament endorsed a\ncomprehensive national MDG report, compiled with\nthe kind assistance of the United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP). This now paves the way for\nconcrete efforts at all levels of Government and by all\nrelevant stakeholders to implement its\nrecommendations.\nWe are extremely concerned about the spread of\nHIV/AIDS in our country. Papua New Guinea has the\nhighest incidence of reported cases in the Pacific\nregion. Important national legislation and policies have\nbeen put in place to address all aspects of that scourge.\nThese include placing the National AIDS Council\ndirectly under the auspices of the Prime Minister\u2019s\ndepartment. Papua New Guinea therefore fully\nsupports the efforts of the United Nations and the\ninternational community to address that scourge. We\nsupport in particular the leadership of the Secretary-\nGeneral in mobilizing international resources for the\nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria\nand to combat other diseases.\nOur development partners, including Australia,\nNew Zealand, UNDP, the Joint United Nations\nProgramme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and other United\nNations agencies, continue to support Papua New\nGuinea\u2019s efforts to address this critical issue. While we\nappreciate such valuable assistance, it must be\ncoordinated effectively within the medium-term\ndevelopment strategy policy framework if it is to have\nmaximum impact.\n30\n\nInternational finance, especially foreign direct\ninvestment and overseas development assistance, are\nvital instruments that can help developing countries\nsuch as mine to achieve the MDGs and other\ninternational commitments and obligations. Our\nGovernment is therefore committed to attracting\nforeign direct investment to assist us with development\nefforts in our country. At the same time, overseas\ndevelopment assistance must be used effectively, as\nmeasured against achievement of the national\ndevelopment goals and priorities set out in the\nmedium-term development strategy.\nWhile Papua New Guinea has a good debt-\nservicing record, debt repayments still place\nconsiderable strain on our ability to provide much-\nneeded services to our people. They affect the\ncountry\u2019s ability to implement the MDGs, the outcome\nof the World Summit on Social Development and other\nimportant development commitments.\nPapua New Guinea commends the European\nUnion\u2019s assistance to help highly indebted poor\ncountries (HIPC) with their debt servicing difficulties.\nConsideration, however, must also be given to other\nnon-HIPC countries, such as mine, so that they can\nbenefit from such goodwill and assistance. In this\ncontext, we support the proposal by President\nMacapagal-Arroyo of the Philippines to extend debt\nservicing assistance to highly indebted non-HIPC\ndeveloping countries, including Papua New Guinea,\nunder a debt-for-equity swap arrangement.\nTrade is the engine of economic growth and\ndevelopment. It is a critical prerequisite for sustained\nefforts to achieve socio-economic development,\nincluding the MDGs. Papua New Guinea was\nheartened to hear some leaders of major developed and\ndeveloping countries at the summit indicating firm\ncommitments to address the current distortions on\ninternational trade regarding the elimination of\nagricultural subsidies and other trade barriers. That is a\npositive signal of a move towards the creation of an\nopen, equitable and rule-based international trading\nsystem.\nThe ongoing Doha round of negotiations, as well\nas the economic partnership agreement negotiations\nbetween the European Union and the African,\nCaribbean and Pacific countries must place greater\nemphasis on development. The particular development\nneeds of small island developing States \u2014 the result of\ntheir physical and structural disadvantages \u2014 must\nalso be given priority in the negotiating process.\nAs a young democracy, Papua New Guinea is\ncommitted to fighting corruption and upholding the\nprinciples of good governance and the rule of law.\nCorruption, in particular, is the main impediment to\nprogress and development in developing countries such\nas Papua New Guinea. The victims of corruption are\nthe poor, who are deprived of basic goods and services.\nThat is a great challenge for us, and we are determined\nto combat it. Taking a step forward, Papua New Guinea\nhas ratified the United Nations Convention Against\nCorruption. Other policies and administrative and\nlegislative measures have been put in place, along with\nexisting constitutional provisions on the leadership\ncode governing the conduct of leaders.\nThe illicit trade in small arms and light weapons\nis a also a major threat to the peace and security of our\ncountry. Small arms and light weapons almost\ndestroyed our country. The Bougainville crisis was\nfuelled by large quantities of small arms and light\nweapons. Papua New Guinea will seek the cooperation\nand support of neighbouring countries to put an end to\nthe traffic in small arms and light weapons to the\nregion. We therefore support the ongoing work at the\nUnited Nations to address that critical issue.\nThe resolution of the Bougainville crisis was a\nsuccess story for the United Nations in the history of\npeacekeeping efforts throughout the world. We thank\nthe United Nations \u2014 especially the Security Council\nand the Secretary-General \u2014 and our friends in the\nPacific region, including Australia, New Zealand, Fiji,\nSolomon Islands, Vanuatu and Tonga, for assisting us\nin concluding the peace process. Peace and normalcy\nare now being consolidated, with the election of the\nfirst Autonomous Government by the people of\nBougainville. They must be strengthened through\nsocial and economic development throughout the\nisland. Basic goods and services are being restored and\nthe infrastructure redeveloped on the island, but we\nwill require the continued support of the international\ncommunity in those efforts. We also look forward to\nthe assistance of the proposed Peacebuilding\nCommission in such endeavours.\nPapua New Guinea, like many other small island\ndeveloping States, suffers from natural disasters, such\nas volcanic eruptions, floods, cyclones, landslides,\ndroughts and even tsunamis. The ongoing and never-\n31\n\nending cycle of natural disasters continues to pose\ngreat difficulties for Papua New Guinea\u2019s achievement\nof social and economic progress, including its\nachievement of the MDGs and other development\nobjectives. Papua New Guinea therefore supports the\nestablishment of early warning systems for all natural\ndisasters and hazards.\nPapua New Guinea\u2019s coexistence with the\nenvironment was enshrined in the preamble of our\nnational Constitution at the time of the country\u2019s\nindependence in 1975. That constitutional imperative\nguided our commitment to implement the sustainable\ndevelopment goals and objectives resulting from the\nRio Earth Summit, including the World Summit on\nSocial Development outcome, the Barbados\nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development\nof Small Island Developing States and, more recently,\nthe Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation\nof the Barbados Programme of Action.\nThose multilateral commitments are vital if we\nare to ensure the proper management of our country\u2019s\nrich natural resources and address critical issues, such\nas poverty eradication, climate change, sea-level rise\nand natural-disaster management.\nLegal and policy frameworks have been put in\nplace to enable us to pursue development in a\nsustainable manner. Our Government is committed to\nundertaking economic development activities, such as\nmining, forestry and agriculture, in a sustainable\nmanner.\nWe call upon the United Nations and the\ninternational community to recognize the weakest,\nsmallest and most vulnerable peoples of the small\nisland developing States. The recently adopted\nMauritius Strategy identifies certain commitments that\nmust be fulfilled if we are to address the sustainable\ndevelopment and other development aspirations of\nsmall island developing States. The international\ncommunity must, including at this General Assembly\nsession, translate those commitments into action,\nthrough projects relating to water, sanitation and\nrenewable energy and by addressing training and\ncapacity-development needs. In this regard, we support\nthe call for the mobilization of financial resources on a\nmore predictable basis so as to implement the strategy\nas articulated in the summit outcome document.\nAs a Member of the United Nations, we\nemphasize that all nations have a critical responsibility\nto address climate change, including sea-level rise. If\nwe are to achieve lasting climatic stability, we must\nhave a global commitment to the objectives of the\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange. The relationship between environmental\nsustainability and poverty is becoming increasingly\nclear. Papua New Guinea is therefore of the view that,\nwhen addressing tropical forestry, the world must\nbetter align market incentives with sustainable\noutcomes.\nIn the forested rural areas of my country, the only\nreal options for economic growth often require the\ndestruction of natural forests \u2014 either when clearing\nfor agricultural commodities such as coffee, or through\nthe sale of hardwood timber. Furthermore, the\nInternational Panel on Climate Change found that,\nduring the 1990s, an estimated 20 to 25 per cent of\nannual global carbon emissions were generated through\nland-use change, primarily from the degradation of\nforest resources. That is the second largest source of\nglobal carbon emissions \u2014 second only to the\ncombustion of fossil fuels. That has to change if we are\nto take responsibility to help with issues related to\nclimate change.\nPapua New Guinea is part of a new Coalition for\nRainforest Nations, including Costa Rica and other\ncountries, and is requesting a global discussion on\naccess for ecosystem services to the global carbon\nmarkets as a means to alleviate this problem. Simply\nput, the present incentives offered by international\nmarkets for agriculture, forestry and emissions\nreductions lead directly to deforestation, environmental\ndegradation and further poverty. We invite more like-\nminded nations to join our efforts to create new\nmarkets and to reform outmoded market and regulatory\nmechanisms. That is necessary if we are to contribute\nmore effectively to environmental sustainability,\neconomic development, climate stability and poverty\nreduction.\nOceans and fisheries issues are critical to Papua\nNew Guinea and to other Pacific island countries.\nOceans and fisheries sustain the livelihood and well-\nbeing of our people and contribute significantly to our\nsmall economies. Sustainable development is a priority\nfor Pacific island countries, including Papua New\nGuinea. We are concerned about the ongoing illegal\nfishing activities in the region. We require the support\nand assistance of development partners with technical\ncapacities to strengthen our surveillance capabilities\n32\n\nand with regulatory regimes to address these issues of\nvital importance.\nPapua New Guinea fully supports the entry into\nforce of the Western and Central Pacific Tuna\nConvention. Papua New Guinea welcomes any\nassistance that United Nations agencies \u2014 including\nthe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United\nNations \u2014 and other bilateral and multilateral partners\ncan provide to permit effective functioning of the\nConvention secretariat.\nThe security of Pacific island countries depends\non the collective security efforts of the region and of\nthe wider Asia-Pacific region. Our regional security\ncooperation is attested to in the successful mission\ncarried out by the Regional Assistance Mission to the\nSolomon Islands, organized under the aegis of the\nPacific Islands Forum.\nPapua New Guinea condemns international\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Our\nsupport in the fight against this evil is unwavering and\nresolute. We have ratified most of the counter-terrorism\ntreaties, pursuant to Security Council resolution 1373\n(2001). However, our efforts are being hampered by\ntechnical and resource constraints; hence the need for\nthe support and assistance of the international\ncommunity to ensure effective implementation of those\ncommitments.\nOver the years, Papua New Guinea has called for\nbold decisions and leadership on the part of both Israel\nand Palestine to exercise restraint and resolve their\ndisputes through peaceful means. We commend Prime\nMinister Sharon and President Abbas for their bold and\nstrong leadership towards the resolution of this long-\nstanding issue.\nWe fully support the positive efforts being carried\nout in Iraq and Afghanistan as democracy and the rule\nof law take root. These will be enhanced through\neconomic and social development as well as through\nvital infrastructure development. Those efforts,\nhowever, must be supported by the international\ncommunity.\nWe are halfway through the Second International\nDecade for the Eradication of Colonialism. Progress\nmust be made to ensure that all the remaining 16\nnon-self-governing territories, including New\nCaledonia, exercise their inalienable right to self-\ndetermination by 2010. We are following the positive\ndevelopments taking place in Tokelau, where the\nGovernment of New Zealand is helping the people to\nfreely exercise their right to self-determination.\nSouth-South cooperation among developing\ncountries is critical. It paves the way for enhanced\ntrade relations and cooperation in areas related to the\ntransfer of technology and know-how to address issues\naffecting those countries, including the fight against\nHIV/AIDS and the eradication of poverty. Papua New\nGuinea welcomes the establishment of the South Fund\nfor Development and Humanitarian Assistance and the\nGovernment of Qatar\u2019s initial pledge to contribute $20\nmillion to the Fund. We commend the pledges by India\nand China to contribute $2 million each to the Fund. It\nis a significant step forward for developing countries to\nassist needy Members, including small island countries\nwith vulnerable economies. We call upon the\ndeveloped countries to recognize this valuable effort\nand to provide support to the Fund.\nPapua New Guinea will assume the chairmanship\nof the Pacific Islands Forum commencing in October.\nAs Chair, Papua New Guinea will provide leadership in\nour collective efforts to address critical issues facing\nmember countries, including the adoption of the\nPacific Plan, which is built upon four main pillars,\nnamely regional security, economic growth, sustainable\ndevelopment and good governance in the region. It\nmust become a vehicle for translating the Mauritius\nStrategy and the outcomes of the World Summit on\nSustainable Development and the High-level Plenary\nMeeting into action on the ground in our respective\nmember countries. We therefore welcome the support\nof our development partners in the implementation of\nthe Plan after its adoption at the upcoming Forum\nmeeting to be held at Port Moresby, Papua New\nGuinea, in October this year."

        "file_text": "The struggle for democracy being waged by\nNicaragua has transcended our borders, arousing\nfeelings of solidarity and support in different parts of\nthe world. The Nicaraguan people raised their voice\nand they were heard by Central America. From there,\nwith the added strength of the seven fraternal countries\nthat joined it, that voice resounded throughout the\nAndean Community, Mexico, the United States of\nAmerica, Canada, the Rio Group, the Organization of\nAmerican States (OAS), the European Union and\nJapan, to mention only the most recent cases. Indeed,\nthe echo of that voice has reverberated at the United\nNations in various reports and resolutions.\nFrom this rostrum in the General Assembly Hall,\nI would like to convey to Member States the deep\ngratitude of the Nicaraguan people for the solidarity\nthey have shown to us.\nWe come to the sixtieth session of the General\nAssembly at a turning point for our future, for we are\nin the throes of a struggle for democracy, a struggle to\nkeep us from returning to our dark days and make them\na thing of the past. Like the peoples of other United\nNations Members who have fought for their freedom,\nthousands of Nicaraguans have died for it, victims of a\nperverse pendulum that swung from authoritarianism to\ntotalitarianism. The lessons learned in those years left\nus a legacy that acknowledges the supreme value of\nfreedom, democracy and, above all, peace.\nOver the past four years, we have been striving\nfor national revitalization and institutional overhaul\nbased on transparency, freedom, the rule of law, social\nequality and individual initiative.\nTo carry out that Herculean task, we needed to\novercome the errors of the past. That is why, with\nsupport from the rest of our continent, we have\nengaged in a frontal attack on corruption and impunity.\nWe have also attempted to restore independence and\nintegrity to our institutions, held hostage by private and\npartisan interests. Those efforts include the legal\n34\n\nsphere, where the absolute impartiality and objectivity\nof judges and magistrates, as well as an inclusive\nelectoral system capable of ensuring respect for a\npopular vote cast in freedom, are imperative. It also\nrequires that institutions act in the service of the higher\ninterests of the nation and do not become weapons in\npolitical vendettas, used in campaigns to intimidate\npublic officials in the executive branch.\nThe forces conniving to oppose democracy\nresponded by escalating the breakdown in the\nconstitutional order and the legitimate exercise of\npower. They then attempted to upset the balance of\npower, an essential principal of representative\ndemocracy in the inter-American system. The\nopposition attempted to execute a new type of coup\nd\u2019\u00e9tat, corrupting State institutions by using them as\ninstruments of political coercion. Instead of accepting\nthe separation of powers, they appropriated the\ndistribution of power, attempting to modify the powers\nof the President retroactively without consulting the\nNicaraguan people. Only the Nicaraguan people can\nconfer national sovereignty and presidential power, as\nthey did at the polls in November 2001.\nIn the light of those threats to democracy, we\nhave harnessed all our available resources under\nnational legislation and international law. The Central\nAmerican Court of Justice, the judicial arm of the\nCentral American Integration System and rooted in\ndemocratic values, handed down a far-reaching\ndecision on 29 March 2005 recognizing the separation\nof powers as a democratic principle. Under the Inter-\nAmerican Democratic Charter, we also turned to the\nOrganization of American States, which affirmed that\nthe disturbing turn of events in Nicaragua was\ncompromising the balance of power and the\nGovernment\u2019s legitimate exercise of power.\nTo overcome that situation, President Enrique\nBola\u00f1os has expressed his continuing willingness to\nlaunch a broad national dialogue with all sectors. This\ndoes not mean, however \u2014 as the forces attempting to\ndestroy our institutions have claimed \u2014 a dialogue\naimed at surrendering democracy. Nor should it be a\ndialogue in which a gun is held to the President\u2019s head\nto force him to make concessions that would lead to a\nnew type of dictatorship in Nicaragua \u2014 one never\nbefore seen in the history of Latin America \u2014 one that\nwould bring back the trials and tribulations of earlier\nyears and put an end to freedom and dash the\ndemocratic hopes of the Nicaraguan people and all\nnations. On the contrary, as the Organization of\nAmerican States itself has said in its resolutions, it is a\ndialogue aimed at seeking democratic solutions, free\nfrom pressure, threats and coercion, and aimed at the\ncessation of any actions that could exacerbate the crisis\nand prevent the restoration of the balance of power.\nWe deplore the murder of journalists in any part\nof the world. In particular, we are concerned by the\nmurders of three Nicaraguan journalists that took place\nover the past three years. We are concerned not only\nbecause the criminals cut short precious human lives,\nbut also because the murders came at the height of the\nelectoral campaign and constituted an attempt to\nterrorize our journalists and suppress freedom of\nexpression in our young democracy. By attacking\nfreedom of expression, they are harming the\ndemocratic processes. Those forces are well aware that\nfreedom of expression is the voice of democracy.\nFreedom of expression protects all the other\nfundamental rights; without it, freedom loses its\nsustenance and democracy is orphaned.\nWe will continue doing our utmost to punish the\nguilty and break up all networks of terror and\nintimidation.\nWe are aware of the importance of the upcoming\nelectoral processes for democracy in Nicaragua. Under\nthe present circumstances, we must guarantee the\nNicaraguan people that every vote will be duly\nregistered, counted and respected, and that their sacred\nright to elect their authorities in conditions of absolute\nfreedom will not be violated. As a result, we have\nasked the Secretary-General for technical assistance\nfrom the United Nations specialized agencies to help\nus hold elections and strengthen our democracy,\ncomplementing the work being carried out by the\nOrganization of American States with assistance of the\nEuropean Union.\nDespite the energy, resources and efforts diverted\nfrom development in order to preserve democracy,\nNicaragua has made major strides towards fulfilling the\nMillennium Development Goals. Destabilizing actions\nhave not stopped the Nicaraguan people from\nbeginning to enjoy the first fruits of the war against\ncorruption and to benefit from an honest and\ntransparent civil service that has succeeded in\nattracting foreign investment and winning the\nconfidence of the international community.\n35\n\nThe latest gauge of President Bola\u00f1os\u2019s success\nin enabling more and more Nicaraguans to lead a\ndecent life can be found in the Human Development\nReport 2005, which states that we have progressed\nfrom the 118th to the 112th position. The best medium-\nterm strategy for sustainable poverty reduction is to\ngain access to new markets and make international\ntrade the driving force of growth, combining economic\ngrowth with social development in order to develop our\nhuman capital.\nThe Government of Nicaragua is promoting\nratification of the Central American Free Trade\nAgreement between Central America, the Dominican\nRepublic and the United States of America, which\nseeks to strengthen our economy, integrate us into the\nworld and raise our population\u2019s standard of living,\nparticularly that of the poorest sectors.\nWe welcomed with hope the words of President\nBush in his statement to this Assembly:\n\u201cA successful Doha Round will reduce and\neliminate tariffs and other barriers on farm and\nindustrial goods. It will end unfair agricultural\nsubsidies ... Under Doha, every nation will gain \u2014\nand the developing world stands to gain the\nmost.\u201d (A/60/PV.2, p. 8)\nMay that be the case.\nI am pleased to announce that in accordance with\nthe request made by the heads of State and Government\nof the Central American Integration System to\nPresident Vicente Fox of Mexico on 12 September, we\nare today sending his Government the information that\nwill make it possible to explore innovative finance\nmechanisms to help our countries deal with the crisis\ncaused by the international price of oil.\nPoverty is a multi-dimensional phenomenon\nassociated with economic and structural problems. The\nreduction of unemployment and social inequality and\nthe expansion of social investment are determining\nfactors for human development: in other words,\nsustainable economic growth within a democratic\nframework based on social and gender equality.\nThe Government of Nicaragua is carrying out\nsocial programmes to protect the rights and satisfy the\nbasic needs of the most vulnerable sectors of\nNicaraguan society \u2014 women, children, young people,\nthe elderly and persons with disabilities. This\nprotection extends to Nicaraguans abroad.\nWe reaffirm our priority commitment to\npromoting respect for the dignity of all our migrants,\nwho, with their work and their efforts, contribute to\nsocio-economic development, that of their host country\nand that of their home country.\nA duty of justice and solidarity moves Nicaragua\nto raise its voice in support of the just and legitimate\naspiration of the Republic of China on Taiwan to\nbecome a member of the universal forum of the United\nNations. The more than 20 million nationals of that\ncountry deserve to be regarded as an integral part of\nthe peoples of the United Nations.\nNicaragua is grateful to the Central American\nIntegration System for endorsing our candidacy for a\nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council for the\n2006-2007 term, reflecting the right of countries with\nsmall economies to be represented on an equal footing.\nAt a time of reform of the Organization, Nicaragua is\nalso grateful for the significant support it has received\nthus far and affirms its resolve to continue seeking the\nsupport of all Member States.\nWe hope to be elected and to share our experience\nin areas such as peacekeeping and peacebuilding and to\nsupport the just aspiration of developing countries to\nparticipate fully in decisions concerning security, with\nall the responsibility, benefits and consequences that\nthat implies."

        "file_text": "At the outset, allow me to\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixtieth\nsession. I am confident that your experience in\nmultilateral diplomacy, coupled with a positive\napproach, will serve as a guarantee of success for the\noutcome of your decisions. Ahead of us lie demanding\ntasks related to the implementation of the reform\ndecisions that have been adopted. I wish to assure that\nyou can fully rely on Slovakia's support in that regard.\nI wish also to convey our solidarity to the United\nStates citizens devastated by Hurricane Katrina, who\nare struggling to recover from the trauma of losing\ntheir loved ones and their homes. On behalf of the\npeople and the Government of Slovakia, I extend\nheartfelt sympathy to the families of the victims who\nperished in that natural disaster.\nWe are gathered here in this forum because the\nchallenges faced by humankind in the area of global\ndevelopment, security and protection of human rights\nbring us together in our search for common solutions\nthat call for clear political decisions. There is a general\nunderstanding that the United Nations, in its current\nshape and form, is not up to the challenges that lie\nahead of it in the twenty-first century. Accordingly, we\nmust follow through with the necessary changes so that\nthis Organization may continue to fulfil its role\nefficiently while keeping abreast of the growing needs\nand expectations of the international community.\nThe Secretary-General has submitted his plan,\nwhich contains a package of bold reform steps laying\ndown ways for the international community to deal\nwith current issues and upgrade the United Nations\nsystem. Since the very day on which it was published,\nSlovakia has believed that his plan provides an\nexcellent basis for our deliberations. We endorse the\npremise that progress in tackling the most important\nglobal problems can only be achieved if the issues of\ndevelopment, security and human rights are addressed\njointly. In particular, we welcome the fact that human\nrights are accorded the same priority as development\nand security, and we appreciate the relevant proposals\nto strengthen the international system for the protection\nof human rights.\nThe reform of the United Nations is not a matter\nto be dealt with by the Organization alone, as\nresponsibility for reaching concrete consensus on key\nissues lies primarily in the hands of the Governments\nof Member States. Reaching agreement that\naccommodates the interests of the entire world is no\neasy task. This year\u00eds summit and its outcome\ndocument have forced us to look in the mirror. They\nhave shown us the amount of vision, wisdom and\ncourage that we were able and willing to bring to this\ntask, with a view to fundamentally reforming the\nsystem of multilateral cooperation in the interest of\nglobal development. The image we saw reflected in the\nmirror was not to everyone\u00eds liking, but that is the\nnature of multilateral diplomacy. It is the result of\ncompromise, the art of the possible, which is both its\nstrong and its weak point. In that connection, I prefer\ntaking a forward-looking approach with regard to the\noutcome document, which contains messages and ideas\nthat deserve our support in the General Assembly. Let\nus try to go ahead with its implementation as best we\ncan.\n22\n\nDespite the considerable progress achieved -\nprimarily in the fight against poverty and famine in\nAsia - all reports draw attention to  the extremely\nalarming and unacceptable downturn in several parts of\nAfrica. Slovakia came to the summit with the\nunderstanding that our first priority was to make\nprogress in achieving the Millennium Development\nGoals (MDGs). In my view, the outcome document\nprovides a solid basis for our future work in that\nregard.\nSlovakia has not been inactive in that respect.\nThe amount of public funds appropriated for foreign\naid has quadrupled since the year 2000, which speaks\nfor itself. In addition, having joined the European\nUnion in May 2004, Slovakia also joined the common\nEuropean development aid system. As a new member\nof the Union, Slovakia pledged to do its utmost to\nincrease its official development assistance to 0.17 per\ncent of gross domestic product by 2010, and to 0.33\nper cent by 2015.\nSlovakia is directly funding and implementing\nmore than 70 projects in the poor countries of Europe,\nAsia and Africa. That gives us the opportunity to\ndirectly pass on to developing countries the unique\nknowledge that we acquired during our own country\u00eds\ntransition.\nIn addition to favouring an increase in aid,\nSlovakia also supports further reform of trade relations\nas well as debt relief for poor countries. I wish to\nhighlight the serious debt relief measures that Slovakia\ntook earlier this year, forgiving several hundred million\ndollars in debt owed by heavily indebted poor\ncountries.\nSlovakia welcomes efforts aimed at liberalizing\ntrade as a means to promote economic growth and\ndevelopment. We therefore join the call for an\nexpeditious completion of the World Trade\nOrganization\u00eds Doha round of negotiations.\nAt this point, I must mention that one of the most\nserious global threats is the escalation of terrorism. It is\ncommendable that the outcome document clearly\ndenounces this new plague of our time, which\nendangers the population of rich and poor countries\nalike. Slovakia has clearly opposed all forms of\nviolence and expressions of blind fanaticism and\nhatred. During the summit, in order to demonstrate\nSlovakia\u00eds position, I personally signed the\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of Acts\nof Nuclear Terrorism, which is the latest in a series of\nanti-terrorist international treaty instruments. Slovakia\nis also a signatory to all 12 United Nations anti-\nterrorism conventions. Slovakia strongly supports the\ncomprehensive strategy to fight terrorism presented by\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan at the Madrid\nConference in March 2005.\nI must say that Slovakia had expected that the\nsummit would have formulated a clear definition of\nterrorism, which is an important prerequisite for the\nadoption of a comprehensive anti-terrorism convention.\nWhile we did not achieve that, it is nevertheless\nimperative that we redouble our efforts to draft such a\nconvention in order that it can still be adopted during\nthis sixtieth session. The outcome document will serve\nas a good starting point for that effort.\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\ncontinues to represent the most serious threat to global\nsecurity. It is therefore regrettable that the outcome\ndocument leaves us with more questions than answers.\nAs a member of the Board of Governors of the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Slovakia\nrecognizes the right to the peaceful use of nuclear\nenergy without the possibility of misusing that\ntechnology to produce nuclear arms. We therefore\nbelieve that in order to prevent the proliferation of\nnuclear weapons it is crucial to strengthen the\nsupervisory competencies of the IAEA and to control\nmore effectively the stages in the nuclear fuel cycle\nthat involve uranium enrichment and plutonium\nprocessing. However, such restrictions must take\naccount of the right of countries that fully satisfy their\ntreaty obligations to obtain energy from nuclear power.\nSlovakia supported the proposal to set up a\nHuman Rights Council as a permanent principal body\nof the United Nations. The Human Rights Council\nshould follow up on all the positive and constructive\nfeatures of the existing Human Rights Commission.\nMembers of the Human Rights Council should be\nelected by a two-thirds majority of the General\nAssembly. The Slovak Republic is in favour of the\nCouncil being composed of a small number of\nmembers in order to give it the necessary flexibility in\nresponding to emerging problems. Slovakia supported\nthe proposal to elect members of the Council on a\nregional basis, and from countries that demonstrably\nmeet their commitments concerning the protection of\nhuman rights. Slovakia also encourages closer\n23\n\ninteractions between the Office of the High\nCommissioner for Human Rights, the Human Rights\nCouncil and the Security Council. In that context, we\nwelcome the proposal in the summit\u00eds outcome\ndocument to strengthen the Office of the High\nCommissioner for Human Rights.\nWe were also pleased to note that, for the first\ntime, the outcome document contains a broader\ndefinition of the principle of the responsibility to\nprotect. Slovakia looks forward to further work in that\nregard. We believe that after Cambodia, Rwanda, the\nSudan and Srebrenica, we are slowly entering a stage\nwhere we take on more direct responsibility for dealing\nwith situations where genocide and war crimes are\ncommitted. The principle of sovereignty means that\nresponsibility for people lies with each sovereign\ncountry and its Government. However, if a particular\nGovernment fails to live up to that responsibility, the\ninternational community has the obligation to take all\nnecessary steps and use all available and necessary\nmeans to prevent a major humanitarian disaster.\nSlovakia was very much in favour of the proposal\nto set up a Peacebuilding Commission. Experience\nshows us that we must not rush to leave a country that\nhas just seen the end of a conflict and simply turn our\nbacks on the whole situation. Our recent history has\nprovided us several bad examples in that regard. We\nmust strengthen our efforts with a view to setting up an\neffective Peacebuilding Commission in the shortest\namount of time possible. The outcome document sets\nout clear parameters and a timeframe for its\nestablishment.\nI mentioned at the outset that it is essential to\nrealign the United Nations with the reality of our\nmodern era. In that regard, it is essential to further\nrevitalize the General Assembly. We must also reform\nthe Economic and Social Council so as to make it\ncapable of effectively implementing the development\nagenda of the United Nations.\nWith respect to reorganizing the Secretariat, we\nare in favour of increasing the flexibility, and\nstrengthening the authority of, the Secretary-General in\nhis managerial functions as the head of the\nOrganization, in order to enable him to keep abreast of\nthe current needs of the United Nations. He must be\ngiven the necessary resources to perform his role. At\nthe same time, it will be necessary to strengthen the\nindependence and powers of internal supervisory\nbodies in order to ensure more transparency and\naccountability inside the Organization. Of course, all\nthe reforms will require appropriate funding in order\nnot to dissipate the efforts that were necessary to reach\nconsensus.\nAmong the reforms that have enjoyed Slovakia's\nlong-standing support is the reform of the Security\nCouncil. This is an issue on which, despite ongoing\nefforts, we were unable to reach a balanced agreement.\nWe need a more democratic and more representative\nSecurity Council that better reflects today\u00eds new\ngeopolitical situation. The Security Council should be\nenlarged in both categories of membership by adding\ncountries that play an important role in the global arena\nand in the United Nations framework. It is vital that an\nenlarged Council retain its effectiveness with regard to\ndecision-making.\nWe intend to actively support the transition\nprocess in Iraq with a view to creating a secure, stable,\nunited, prosperous and democratic country, in\naccordance with Security Council resolutions. As we\ndeclared at the International Conference on Iraq, held\non 22 June 2005 in Brussels, Slovakia has decided to\nforgive $1.13 billion of Iraq's debt as a tangible\ncontribution to that end. We are confident that the Iraqi\npeople will use the October referendum to show their\nsupport for the new Constitution, and that democratic\nparliamentary elections will follow.\nStabilizing the western Balkans remains a priority\non my country\u00eds foreign policy agenda. Slovakia has\nthus far supported the engagement of the United\nNations in the region by participating in peacekeeping\nand stabilization missions in the Balkans. In our\nopinion, the pivotal issue with regard to the\nstabilization of the Western Balkans is the future status\nof Kosovo, which remains a potential element of\ninstability in the region. We denounce all acts of\nviolence and intolerance inside the province. We\nbelieve that the majority of Kosovars aspire to peace,\ndemocracy and development. In particular, we\nappreciate the activities of the Special Envoy of the\nSecretary-General, Kai Eide.\nSlovakia has been approved as the candidate of\nthe Group of Eastern European States for a non-\npermanent seat in the Security Council in the elections\nto be held at this session of the General Assembly.\nSlovakia has never been a member of the Security\nCouncil, although it has taken an active part in United\n24\n\nNations peacekeeping efforts through its participation\nin operations in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle\nEast.\nIf elected to membership in that important body,\nthe Slovak Republic will enter the Security Council at\na dynamic moment characterized by a changing global\nenvironment and by the search for a new security\nconsensus. New threats to security represent growing\nchallenges to the ability of the international system to\nmaintain international peace and security. That\ndevelopment will therefore also be a challenge for our\ncountry in its capacity as a member of the Security\nCouncil, in particular because it will test our readiness\nto shoulder greater commitment and responsibility for\nstability and security around the world. I want to assure\nthe Assembly that Slovakia is ready to take on this\nimportant assignment with honour and responsibility."

        "file_text": "Fiji extends its warm\ncongratulations to the Organization on the sixtieth\nanniversary of its existence, and to the President, on\nhis assumption of the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its sixtieth session. We wish to express\nour confidence in his ability to guide our work during\n2005 and 2006.\nWe also extend our appreciation to his\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping of the\nGabonese Republic, for his outstanding guidance of the\ndifficult business of the fifty-ninth session. We also\nwould like to place on record our appreciation to the\nSecretary-General for his tireless efforts and active role\nin bringing about an outcome document that should\nbecome the centrepiece that guides our efforts in the\nmany months to come.\nLast week the leaders of our States or\nGovernments adopted a resolution on the outcome of\ntheir deliberations. The outcome document (resolution\n60/1), as anticipated, did not meet the expectations of\neveryone; rather, it contained those key elements\nessential to addressing the three pillar issues of\nsecurity, human rights and development.\nWhat is required of us now is the commitment to\nsupport the implementation plan that will be drawn up\nto convert to action what have up to now been merely\nhopes and aspirations. We must also undertake to\nensure that the assistance so rendered trickles right\ndown to the poor, the hungry, the needy and the\nhopeless \u2014 those that require it the most. Far too often\ndonations, funds and other forms of assistance are\nmired in the bureaucratic process and reduced by\ncertain percentages, which are then passed off as\nso-called administrative charges.\nFiji fully endorses the outcome document, and we\nare committed to implement those provisions that we\nas a developing nation are required to pursue for\nourselves. The formulation and implementation of the\nFiji national sustainable development strategy,\noutlining the visions of our leaders and targeting the\naspirations and objectives of the summit outcome and\nthe Millennium Development Goals, is paramount. We\nare in the process of reforming our public and financial\nsector and introducing limited changes in the private\nsector. Infrastructure development and improvement\nare a priority in light of our occupational health and\nsafety standards. Marine legislation and regulations are\nbeing reviewed to ensure the safety at sea of both\n30\n\npassengers and vessels alike, as well as the protection\nof our maritime resources such as our continental shelf.\nThe principle of restorative justice in pursuit of\nreconciliation, tolerance and unity is being widely\ndiscussed through a democratic process of\nconsultations among the public before it is introduced\nin Parliament.\nConcerning the reform of the United Nations\nSecretariat, Fiji subscribes to the thinking that the\nSecretary-General should be empowered to enact the\nchanges he believes best suit the Organization. We\nmust all help to create a United Nations Organization\nthat is more efficient and accountable. Accountability\ncan be achieved by the establishment of the much\ndiscussed Oversight Committee, the modalities and\nworking methodology of which have to include clear\nand transparent terms of reference and a well-balanced\nregional representation.\nThe United Nations must function always with\nintegrity and urgent concern for the needs of Member\nStates. Above all we must help the United Nations to\nconcentrate, as never before, on reducing the shameful\ngap between developed and developing countries.\nThere should be no pause in United Nations\nendeavours to establish and maintain international\npeace, security and stability. The Secretary-General\nand his staff are to be commended for seeking peace\nagreements or in trying to prevent disputes from\nviolently escalating. Peacekeepers from many troop-\ncontributing countries deployed to conflict zones are\nworking not only to provide security but also to\ndisarm, demobilize and reintegrate former fighters, to\npermit the safe and sustainable return of refugees and\nto strengthen human rights and the rule of law.\nWe commend the work of the Special\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for Iraq and\nthe United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq\n(UNAMI) in trying to promote an inclusive,\nparticipatory and transparent political transition\nprocess in the country. Fiji is privileged to have our\ntroops serving in UNAMI to help in the process.\nFiji reaffirms its commitment to the United\nNations. As always, we are for peace and this is the\nreason we have sent many of our soldiers and police\nofficers to serve with United Nations peacekeeping and\npeacebuilding forces. Many of our servicemen have\nlost their lives, but we have accepted this ultimate\nsacrifice as our contribution to the unceasing global\neffort for finding peace and security.\nFurther, while fully appreciating the principle of\nthe standby force, we are at the same time concerned\nby the fact that those nations who are unable to\nproperly equip their forces are mainly from developing\ncountries and will therefore be marginalized should no\narrangement be made to assist them in this area. If such\nassistance is not forthcoming, then peacekeeping will\nbe confined to only a select few countries, mainly\ndeveloped nations.\nFiji acclaims the proposal for a Peacebuilding\nCommission. We will gladly share with the\nCommission our own experiences in reconstructing our\ncountry following the civil unrest that almost tore the\nnation apart in 2000. We ask reconsideration regarding\nthe makeup of the Peacebuilding Commission, for\nwhile some of us have served in that sphere longer than\nothers, the size of certain countries\u2019 contribution gives\nthem an advantage under the current modalities.\nWe support the United Nations and other major\ngroups\u2019 initiatives at establishing partnerships with\nregional groups. The South Pacific region has\nconstantly come together to address common problems\nthat may beset its members. The Regional\nAssistance Mission to the Solomon Islands is a\npeacekeeping/peacebuilding mission that was mounted\nby the region. We would urge the United Nations to\nkindly assist in the humanitarian effort to bring this\nregional initiative on an even keel.\nFiji is supportive of an enlarged Security Council\nmembership that reflects current geopolitical realities.\nWe maintain our support for the inclusion of India and\nJapan as permanent members under revised\narrangements.\nWe look forward to the moment when peace\nfinally reigns in the Middle East, and we commend all\nthose countries that are helping with that global cause.\nFor our Pacific Ocean region, we would like to see the\nKorean people find just peace and lasting harmony. On\nthe future of Taiwan, it is Fiji\u2019s fervent hope that a\nresolution through dialogue, conducted in the true\nspirit of reconciliation and understanding and devoid of\nviolence, can be found \u2014 one that is agreeable to all\nparties and that can last for years to come.\nThis age of globalization is marked by the\nadoption of universal principles governing such\n31\n\nmatters as democracy, human rights, trade and\ndevelopment. Fiji accepts those precepts; there is no\nquestion about that. But we also say that countries like\nours, undergoing profound transition, should not be\nheld to unrealistic standards. We need time to evolve,\nto adapt and to adhere. Members should not judge us\nby what might be appropriate to their standards, but\nmeasure us by the progress we are making towards the\nuniversal ideals and the level of our commitment to\nchange.\nFiji respects the principle of equality of human\nrights. We endorse the proposal for a Human Rights\nCouncil, directly accountable to the General Assembly,\nas an improvement upon the present arrangements.\nHowever, in order for the Council to be effective, its\nmembers have to be as widely representative as\npossible and should not be subjected to special\nreporting requirements.\nFor Fiji, it is vitally important, as a factor for\nlong-term stability, that the special interests of the\nindigenous people, including their right to ownership\nof their natural resources, is protected, and that a\nbalance between the rights of individuals and\ncommunities is maintained. This has particular\nrelevance for a multicultural society such as ours. In\nthis regard, we strongly endorse the intention to bring\nto the General Assembly as soon as possible for\nadoption a final draft Declaration on the Rights of\nIndigenous Peoples.\nTo fund the Millennium Development Goals\ndeveloping countries ought to have access to markets\nand a fair return on their exports. This fact is important\nfor Fiji and other small vulnerable States; our very\neconomic survival is dependent upon it. Unrealistic\nand inequitable world trade policies simply make it\nmuch harder for our countries to eliminate poverty.\nFiji commends those developed States that are\nprepared to assist developing nations in cushioning the\nimpact of World Trade Organization compliance. We\npay particular tribute to the European Union for its\nwillingness to assist and call on our European Union\npartners to provide adequate long-term support as it\nbegins to reduce preferential processes for African,\nCaribbean and Pacific sugar.\nWe also would like to express appreciation to our\nclose neighbours Australia and New Zealand and our\nfriends in Asia for their support in helping us get better\naccess to their markets and assistance in other\nimportant areas of development.\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic is a global concern as it\nimpacts on our ability to achieve the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals. A cooperative effort by everyone\nremains the only way to control and eradicate the\nscourge. Action that integrates prevention, treatment\nand the medical and social vulnerability of infected\npersons should be our guiding principles.\nAt the same time we should not minimize the\nseriousness of the ravages produced of other infectious\ndiseases such as malaria and tuberculosis. Effort\nshould also be directed at other scourges, such as\nextreme poverty and the plight of the disabled.\nWe can no longer ignore the plight of women and\nchildren who through the years have been subjected to\nsexual exploitation and abuse. Last week, Fiji\u2019s Prime\nMinister, Laisenia Qarase, signed the two Optional\nProtocols of the Convention on the Rights of the Child;\nthe first on the involvement of children in armed\nconflict and the second on the sale of children, child\nprostitution and child pornography. In addition Fiji\nstrongly believes that the time is right for stronger\naction to be taken to address the issue of young women\nwho are denied the right to sexual and reproductive\nhealth.\nWe welcome the decision to hold a 2006 General\nAssembly High-level Dialogue on International\nMigration and Development. The amount of\nremittances from migrant workers has become a rich\nsource of funds and has raised the standards of living\nof families, contributed substantially to the national\neconomy and provided much needed employment to\nthe job market. Fiji hopes that the High-level Dialogue\nwill be the catalyst to enable countries to work in\npartnership and agree to a better understanding to\nimprove the conditions of migrant workers.\nTerrorism is a blight on all our horizons. It\nrespects no borders, and it is neither an acceptable nor\nan effective way to advance any cause. Insularity is no\nlonger a cushion to protect islands which believe\nthemselves to be further away from the mainstream of\ninternational activities. In trying to fulfil the terms and\nconditionalities established by the various terrorism\nconventions, more money that can hardly be spared has\nto be found to fulfil those obligations. In doing so,\nefforts to achieve Millennium Development Goals are\nstymied and in some instances halted.\n32\n\nIn this regard, a global effort to combat terrorism\nhas to be instituted to include training, funding,\ntransparency in the exchange of information and\nintelligence, and a pledge to assist when needed.\nFiji will always be in support of all efforts to\nreform the United Nations and its initiatives in the\nfields of security, human rights and development. Our\nefforts will be modest but commensurate with our\nabilities."

        "file_text": "On\nbehalf of the United Republic of Tanzania, I\ncongratulate the President on his election as President\nof the General Assembly at its sixtieth session. I wish\nhim every success. I would also like to extend my\ndelegation\u2019s gratitude to his predecessor, Mr. Jean\nPing, for presiding over the Assembly\u2019s fifty-ninth\nsession, which, among other accomplishments,\nsuccessfully negotiated the outcome document of the\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting.\nAt the outset, I should like to commend\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan for his outstanding and\ntenacious leadership of the United Nations through one\nof the most trying interludes in the Organization\u2019s\nhistory. That period has probably been the most\ncreative and visionary in the Secretary-General\u2019s\ncareer, as he inspired the Organization and its\nmembership to embark upon ambitious and much-\nneeded reforms to make the Organization relevant and\nequal to the threats and challenges of a globalizing\nworld in the twenty-first century.\nThe summit that has just ended set the tone,\nagenda and direction for where the United Nations\nshould go 60 years after its inception at San Francisco\nin 1945. The pace of reform will be determined by the\ncollective political dedication of us, the Members of\nthe Organization. The process of United Nations\nreform has brought us together and reaffirmed the\nsovereign equality of nations and demonstrated the\nindispensability of collective action and the demands\nof shared responsibility and obligations in international\naffairs. Although what we have agreed upon falls short\nof what we set out to accomplish, we have to put\ndetails into what we need to implement with the same\nspirit of collective dedication and a sense of common\npurpose. We should not allow political expediency and\nposturing to rob us of our declared objectives.\nThe glaring indignities of poverty, hunger,\nilliteracy and preventable disease amidst the glamour\nand opulence of prosperity in some quarters of the\nworld should be relegated to the dustbin of history.\nThat is achievable if we implement the commitments\nthat we resolved to undertake at the summit that has\njust ended. At Monterrey we agreed on a framework\nfor partnership. For some members of the G-8,\nGleneagles transformed a 30-year-old pledge to devote\n0.7 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) to\nofficial development assistance into a timetable; for\nothers, it resulted in predictable increases. Debt\n37\n\nsustainability has finally given way to debt\ncancellation for some countries, including my own, the\nUnited Republic of Tanzania. That is a tremendous\nrelief and will make a significant quantitative and\nqualitative difference to our development programmes\nand priorities.\nTrade and investment have also received\nacceptance as being central to growth and\ndevelopment. The Doha trade and development round\nof negotiations, to take place in Hong Kong later this\nyear, should be completed with agreements on pending\nissues such as subsidies.\nThe political capital generated at the summit\nshould bring about a convergence of resources from\nour development partners and the economic, political,\nfiscal and institutional reforms already under way in\nAfrica, and result in predictable and implementable\ndevelopment programmes. The issue of absorptive\ncapacity should not arise when there is coherence and\ncoordination among our partners within a collaborative\nframework at country level to mainstream assistance\ninto national development strategies and priorities.\nThe United Republic of Tanzania has already\ncomplied with the critical element of paragraph 22 (a)\nof the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1),\nwhich calls upon developing countries to adopt and\nimplement comprehensive national strategies to\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDG).\nWe are ahead in achieving the goal regarding universal\nprimary education, namely, nine years before the 2015\ndeadline. We are on-course in achieving the goals\nregarding access to safe drinking water, reducing child\nmortality and promoting gender equality in political\nparticipation and decision-making structures. With\nsteady assistance and our macroeconomic and political\nstability, we should get closer to achieving most of the\nGoals by 2015.\nIn sub-Saharan Africa individual countries are\naccelerating reforms and improving the climate for\ninvestment. Frontloading aid flows and innovative new\nsources of finance to bridge the financial gap in\nachieving the MDGs should be scaled up, as should\naid-in-trade to overcome supply side constraints.\nSubsidies and market-access issues should also be\naddressed simultaneously in the international\ndevelopment agenda. The outcome of the Helsinki\nprocess, with its wealth of ideas, adds tremendous\nvalue both to the reform process launched last week\nand to the overall international development agenda. It\naddresses political deficits and requirements to bring\nabout purposeful development and democratic changes\nin this era of globalization.\nThe relationship between development and\nsecurity at the national and international levels has\nclearly emerged during the debate and negotiations on\nthe 2005 World Summit Outcome, on which I do not\nneed to dwell here. The arms race in conventional and\nnuclear weapons can only bring the world to\napocalyptic brinkmanship \u2014 by design or by accident.\nThe agonizing endeavour to mobilize development\nefforts to achieve the MDGs stands in stark contrast to\nthe irony of spending trillions of dollars on armaments\nof total and mass destruction. It is therefore most\ndisconcerting that the summit was unable to come up\nwith an agreement on disarmament and non-\nproliferation. We should not give up on the subject of\ndisarmament and non-proliferation. Let us therefore\nmake another effort to resume negotiations on those\nissues.\nWe in Tanzania and in our region are also\nparticularly keen to see a global convention concluded\nsoon to regulate the marking and tracing of all small\narms and light weapons and on the illicit brokering of\narms which fuel violent conflicts and instability in our\nregions in Africa.\nCollective security cannot be enhanced without\nreform of the Security Council. The reform of the\nSecurity Council too has been deferred, but the issue of\nthe Council\u2019s expansion and the reform of its working\nmethods should remain on the agenda. Negotiations on\nthe issue should resume soon. The United Republic of\nTanzania supports the Ezulwini consensus on the\nreform of the Security Council, bearing in mind that\nonly Africa has yet to have either a permanent seat or a\nveto in the Council. Our interlocutors should recognize\nthat imbalance in our negotiations and should try to\naccommodate Africa\u2019s demands to make the Security\nCouncil more, not less, representative and more, not\nless, legitimate.\nThe condemnation of terrorism in all its forms\nand manifestations brings us closer to an agreed\ndefinition, which would be helpful in galvanizing our\nundivided efforts to combat terrorism. The lack of an\nagreed definition, however, should not delay an\nagreement on a comprehensive anti-terrorism\nconvention in the course of this session of the General\n38\n\nAssembly. As a victim of terrorism in recent years, the\nUnited Republic of Tanzania has a compelling reason\nto support a global anti-terrorist strategy.\nRespect for the human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms of all people is entrenched in the purposes\nand principles of the Charter of the United Nations and\nbuttressed by the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights. For nearly 60 years, the institutional expression\nand status of human rights in the United Nations has\nbeen evolving, and it still is. We support the\nestablishment of the Human Rights Council to the\nextent that it will elevate the centrality of human\nrights, enhance the moral authority and integrity of the\nUnited Nations, and overcome the shortcomings of the\ncurrent Commission on Human Rights. The new\nCouncil should embody the principles and practices of\npeer review in its working methods to avoid double\nstandards in accountability and compliance, which\nhave plagued the Human Rights Commission.\nThe new concept of the \u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d\nmerits our support, after the recent international\nfailures to protect people in Rwanda and Bosnia. The\nresponsibility to protect should be a collective\nundertaking by States to protect populations from\ngenocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.\nHowever, we will need to establish benchmarks and\nsafeguards to guarantee against unilateral and\npolitically motivated interventions, such as those\nexperienced in the past with what were conceived and\npresented as humanitarian intervention.\nThe African continent is the main scene of both\nlooming and several ongoing natural and human-made\ndisasters. Some are forgotten and protracted, while\nothers gain initial media attention but receive delayed,\nand often inadequate, responses. We support the\nrecommendations in the outcome document for new\nstandby arrangements and funding for emergencies in\nAfrica.\nThere is an international regime in place to\nprovide protection and assistance to refugees fleeing\nfor their lives from persecution, violence and gross\nviolations of human rights. The United Republic of\nTanzania has received and protected such victims since\nwe became independent, in 1961. Currently, Tanzania\nis still hosting over half a million refugees. We are\ngratified and encouraged by the commitment in the\noutcome document to safeguard the institution of\nasylum and by its reaffirmation of the principle of\nsolidarity and burden-sharing in assisting refugee\npopulations and their host communities. We equally\nhope that the recognition of the Guiding Principles on\nInternal Displacement will provide more effective\nprotection for internally displaced persons by relevant\nand appropriate authorities.\nThe outcome document has duly recognized the\ntragedy of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, the malaria and\nthe tuberculosis that have hit Africa so hard. That\nglobal awareness should be matched by adequate\nfunding to save current and succeeding generations\nfrom the ravages of those diseases.\nTanzania would like to thank President Olusegun\nObasanjo of Nigeria for the statement he made, in his\ncapacity as Chairman of the African Union, on the\nsituation relating to conflicts, peace and security in\nAfrica. We are grateful to him, to other African\nleaders and to the Chairman of the African Union\nCommission \u2014 His Excellency President Alpha\nKonare \u2014 as well as to all our friends outside Africa,\nfor their dedicated efforts to prevent and resolve\nconflicts in Africa.\nLast week, the Security Council adopted its\nresolution 1625 (2005), on strengthening the\neffectiveness of the Council\u2019s role in conflict\nprevention, particularly in Africa. Among other things,\nthe resolution stresses the importance of averting\nconflicts to make possible peaceful development,\nsecurity and stability in Africa. The resolution also\ncalls for the strengthening of cooperation and\ncommunication between the United Nations and\nregional organizations such as the African Union in\nmediation efforts and peacekeeping.\nThe bulk of United Nations peacekeeping\noperations are in Africa, following peace agreements\nthat are at various stages of implementation. Despite\nserious numerical, logistical, financial and sometimes\nimage constraints, multidimensional peacekeeping\noperations are making positive contributions to\nrestoring peace in Africa in collaboration with the\nAfrican Union and other friends of Africa. Political and\noperational partnerships between the United Nations\nand the African Union need to be strengthened and\ninstitutionalized.\nWe welcome the implementation of the\nComprehensive Peace Agreement in the Sudan in\npartnership with the United Nations. We encourage\nprogress in the current peace negotiations on Darfur.\n39\n\nThe institutional and operational requirement to\nbridge the transitional gap from peacekeeping to\ndevelopment, in the form of a Peacebuilding\nCommission, is one of the main decisions to have been\ntaken in the current reform of the United Nations.\nAfrica needs the Commission. It should become\noperational as soon as possible. The peaceful outcomes\nin Burundi and Somalia \u2014 and, soon, in Sierra Leone\nand Liberia \u2014 require a peacebuilding mechanism\nduring the transition from peacekeeping to\nreconstruction and development. The peace processes\nin both Burundi and Somalia have had tortuous paths,\nbut those countries finally have peace agreements and\ntransitional Governments in place. The Peacebuilding\nCommission should focus priority attention on both\nBurundi and Somalia. The second summit on the Great\nLakes region, to be held later this year in Nairobi, will\npave the way for a peace and security pact and for\npeacebuilding initiatives in the region.\nThe only remaining case of self-determination in\nAfrica is Western Sahara. We appeal for maximum\ncooperation by the parties concerned and for\nunrelenting support for the issue from the international\ncommunity through the Baker plan. It is in the interest\nof all of us here to reach a peaceful solution to that\nproblem.\nI cannot conclude my statement without\naddressing the situation in the Middle East, and in\nparticular the question of Palestine, which remains of\ngreat concern to my Government. There have been\npath-breaking developments in the Israeli-Palestinian\nconflict to revive the road map and invigorate the\ninitiatives of the Quartet. The new leadership of\nMr. Mahmoud Abbas at the Palestinian Authority, the\nwithdrawal of Israel from the Gaza Strip and the\ncoming elections in the occupied territories are\ninjecting new dynamism and a positive direction into\nthe peace process. But we must accept the reality that\nthe people of Palestine have equal rights, not only to\nlive in peace and security in full human dignity but\nalso to establish their own independent State,\ncoexisting side by side with the State of Israel. We\nshould therefore do all we can to help secure the just\nand lasting peace that is the right of the Palestinian,\nIsraeli and Arab peoples.\nFinally, I want to reiterate our deepest sympathies\nand condolences to the victims, the Government and\nthe people of the United States of America in the wake\nof the death and destruction wreaked by Hurricane\nKatrina."
